      <li>Very cool &amp; great price.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>The razor cuts nicely.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s handy.</li>
      <li>It takes a lot of getting used to, but once you figure out how much pressure is required and what the best angle is for you, this hair-cutting tool is unmatched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
      <li>This razor comb is really nice</li>
      <li>I ordered this comb as I am trying to learn to cut and style my own hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a wonderful texturizing comb that&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and the price was good.</li>
      <li>so I bought this product to use until I find someone... very easy to use</li>
      <li>and wow it works great!!!!</li>
      <li>Turned out amazing :)  </li>
      <li>sooo easy!</li>
      <li>This is SO EASY to use!</li>
      <li>If you make the angle more ( like 90 degrees) and apply a lot of pressure you will CHOP the hair.</li>
      <li>I wish the razor installation instructions had been more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is okay, but I would rather use the Tinkle Hair Cutter.  </li>
      <li>The comb itself is OK</li>
      <li>It works better than this one.  </li>
      <li>So cheap too!</li>
      <li>But, despite that I&#x27;ve gone through a couple - you will never get a better home cut than with this and a couple of mirrors, a lot of patience, and a vision.</li>
      <li>more words required for this review?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe to use with no fear of taking gouges out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>hope this helps :)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my groomed look now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With that said, I can say that I think this product would work better with hair that is thinner and finer.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>This is much better than others i have tried.</li>
      <li>I hope this helps :)  </li>
      <li>Very Useful!</li>
      <li>The comb itself is pretty good, however, the blade won&#x27;t stay in at all.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to use and its safe.</li>
      <li>Works great, especially for just trimming and giving a nice shaggy cut.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get to the barbershop easily.  </li>
      <li>It opens too easy and the blade will fall out.</li>
      <li>easy to use even for beginners so you can&#x27;t chop the hair.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something easy</li>
      <li>Easy to change blade if needed.</li>
      <li>It arrived also arrived very quickly and was a  Prime purchase.</li>
      <li>my own hair, I had to section it off and do the bottom layer first.</li>
      <li>After cleaning it up, I might even be able to use it on my own hair to trim and shape in between professional cuts.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t make any huge mistakes, but it&#x27;s because I prepared myself thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t make any huge mistakes, but it&#x27;s because I prepared myself thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>FANTASTIC product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the other razor also, but it too wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
      <li>A good product, for a small amount of money, that will keep you looking good.</li>
      <li>Once you are familiar with how it is used, give it a shot.</li>
      <li>Really worth the money!</li>
      <li>If you are going to use this make sure to try and test an area first, the amount of pressure and angle at which you put the blade against your hair to cut can effect the look of the cut.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I had heard originally about razor combs on a YouTube tutorial for how to do \\&quot;emo/scene\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this comb like three times and it had never disappointed me.</li>
      <li>Well Mr. Great Haircut moved to a much,much more expensive salon, good for him.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and I have thick hair--it made quick work of it!</li>
      <li>I needed something to \\&quot;Clean Up\\&quot; my neck line between haircuts.</li>
      <li>The product works well but will fill up with hair unless you clean it (wipe it) each time you&#x27;ve run it through the hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good condition, and cuts very well.</li>
      <li>I love this item I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
      <li>is too much and this is so cheap and easy</li>
      <li>the proper techniques for the tool, you can begin trying more elaborate or intricate styles.</li>
      <li>after you understand the proper techniques for the tool, you can begin trying more elaborate or intricate styles.</li>
      <li>very first thing I did while I was waiting for this tool to arrive was watch</li>
      <li>The manufacturer of the comb installation of new razors should have been more detailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works best for long layers, wispy ends, and/or short hair.</li>
      <li>This comb was easy to use and fits in nicely with my other tools.</li>
      <li>I game someone a haircut with this comb and it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used it to cut my own hair several times now.</li>
      <li>it is well worth the money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The blade felt off several times. I don&#x27;t think I want to use it again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this razor is amazing! i adore my haircut &amp; my friends haircuts! sooo easy! perfect for shaping and thinning. i LOVE this! i&#x27;ll never pay for another haircut again.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews about this product so I decided to buy it. Its great for thinning my hair. The only downside is that I have be careful when combing my hair so i dont accidentally cut some peices off. But otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something easy this is hard to cut your hair.. You kinda have to shove it.. I&#x27;m glad I got the other razor also, but it too wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I use this to cut my bangs.... No complaints with the blade  and they even give you extra blade for next use.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this products just pulls hair and  barely cuts it. Poor quality blades and design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased a number of grooming products to use on my Newfoundland who has A LOT of fur of various lengths and strengths, in a wide variety of bodily areas. This razor-comb is very effective for trimming some of the fur around his ears, feet, elbows and tail. I use it in conjunction with other grooming tools, each with specific purposes for location and type of fur. This comb was easy to use and fits in nicely with my other tools. After cleaning it up, I might even be able to use it on my own hair to trim and shape in between professional cuts.</li>
    <li> I love it... Very Useful! no need to go to salon to pay $30 for a simple trim...&lt;br /&gt;This its beyond what i expected..&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cut my little sister&#x27;s bangs and it works well it looked so natural.&lt;br /&gt;Also works for guys like me(korean hairstyle)&lt;br /&gt;Saves a lot of money.. dont hesitate to buy</li>
    <li> brush my dogs and wow it works great!!!! I love that it comes with extra razors it is well worth the money</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I have thick hair--it made quick work of it! Don&#x27;t be too aggressive with your combing or you&#x27;ll take a lot of hair off!</li>
    <li> Love how it comes with extra blades. pretty sharp. i havent mastered it all the way since it&#x27;s my first razor comb</li>
    <li> I have thick slightly wavy hair that grows very quickly. It can get really bulky over time. For the past 3 years I&#x27;ve only trusted one stylist to take care of my hair, after seeing so many others butcher it. I noticed that every time he cut my hair, he did layers and always cut it with a razor. Well Mr. Great Haircut moved to a much,much more expensive salon, good for him. Bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to tighten the belt (I&#x27;m a college student...extra money goes to beauty things like hair cuts or food...I&#x27;ll take the food), I decided to try this product out.&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I did while I was waiting for this tool to arrive was watch AT LEAST 5 different &#x27;how-to&#x27; videos for &#x27;razor combs&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Then, once the razor comb arrived, I practiced on an old wig that had a long straight hairstyle (similar to my own hair). Take your time getting to know the right amount of pressure and the right angle you want for the amount of hair you want to remove. If you make the angle more ( like 90 degrees) and apply a lot of pressure you will CHOP the hair. If you do a lesser angle (10 degrees) and use very little pressure, you will have a very light (barely any) thinning. The trick is to apply the right angle and the right pressure while dragging down the hair, just like you&#x27;re combing it.  This is NOT the right tool for chopping hair, although you certainly could use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;You also need to keep in mind that where you start the comb on your hair will remove hair below it. This is why you NEVER start the comb by your roots, you will get bald spots!!! If you&#x27;re doing layers, your shortest layer should be where you start the comb (this may vary depending on the style you are trying).&lt;br /&gt;For my own hair, I had to section it off and do the bottom layer first. I accidentally made a few spots shorter than the top layer (mostly not noticable due to the over thickness of my hair) and I definitely think that I should have added at least one more layer (I only did two).&lt;br /&gt;Now after you understand the proper techniques for the tool, you can begin trying more elaborate or intricate styles. Stick to the basics in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad always had this one joke:&lt;br /&gt;Q: What&#x27;s the difference between a good hair cut and a bad haircut?&lt;br /&gt;A: Two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t worry if you mess up. I didn&#x27;t make any huge mistakes, but it&#x27;s because I prepared myself thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps :)&lt;br /&gt;XO&lt;br /&gt;Sstand the proper techniques for the tool, you can begin trying more elaborate or intricate styles. Stick to the basics in the beginning.  My dad always had this one joke:  Q: What&#x27;s the difference between a good hair cut and a bad haircut?  A: Two weeks.  So don&#x27;t worry if you mess up.

    <li> I bought this after I skrewed up my hair with scissors when I was trying to do a ton of layers. It&#x27;s a little hard to adjust to if your useto scissors, but once your use to it it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. If you just don&#x27;t trust professionals to do it (I don&#x27;t) and want a lot of layers. This product is for you. I&#x27;m scene by the way, if your looking for that type of hair style.     &#x3D;3 Good Luck</li>
    <li> The Diamond Edge 2 Way Razor Comb is a very good tool. I have thick hair and it grows fast. It gives me an extra 2 weeks for me to get to the hairdressers. It is easy to use and the price was good. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this awhile back and I&#x27;ve used it to cut my own hair several times now. Works great, especially for just trimming and giving a nice shaggy cut. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried cutting my hair with scissors many times. I tend to prefer a pixie cut with a little wispy edge to it. Every time I try it myself with scissor it fails and I end up getting it fixed professionally (which is okay because I always figure if I was going to have to get it cut professionally why not try it myself and potentially save the money). I will NEVER have to pay for a professional cut again. This is SO EASY to use! I cut the back of my hair using a handheld mirror and a wall mounted mirror and it was even across the back. It works GREAT! You can use the blade for more than one cutting if you take it out and clean it. The comb came with 5 replacement blades (in addition to the one already in it). My only recommendation is to look on youtube for some how-to videos on using razor combs before just going at your hair with it. It works best for long layers, wispy ends, and/or short hair. Also if it&#x27;s your first time using a razor comb, take your time. FANTASTIC product.</li>
    <li> In the past I have used similar items and they have always done what I want. This one is superb.</li>
    <li> I got tired of spending $250 at my stylist every few months, so I purchased this comb and decided to start maintaining my own hair in a layered look. It takes a lot of getting used to, but once you figure out how much pressure is required and what the best angle is for you, this hair-cutting tool is unmatched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up video tutorials to watch a professional, or at least a guru, use a razor comb to cut their own hair. I can explain all I want, but nothing beats watching someone use the comb. Once you are familiar with how it is used, give it a shot. Work slowly, in front of a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are up for a bit of experimentation and would like professional-looking hairstyles from home, buy this comb! Just don&#x27;t expect to know how to use it right away. If you are getting by with scissors and are perfectly happy with them, just stick with what works for you.</li>
    <li> perfect for touching up high spots, general thinning and stays sharp a long time. This is much better than others i have tried. use it like you comb your hair and eliminate the barber shop visits.</li>
    <li> It has been a little difficult for me to learn to use this, but because I am house bound, I really needed a way to cut my bangs,  Getting better at it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this comb as I am trying to learn to cut and style my own hair. The comb itself is pretty good, however, the blade won&#x27;t stay in at all.  I tried to use it and the blade just cane out of the casing. It seems simple enough to get in and seems to snap shut, but it won&#x27;t stay.I have emailed the company requesting a new comb, but have not heard from them as of yet..</li>
    <li> Very cool &amp; great price. I got it to spruce up my doo as well as my toddler son&#x27;s who will not sit for a barber at all. This way I can set him on the couch, put on cartoons and cut his hair...no probs!</li>
    <li> This is as described-I just am not very good with it but I will use it to keep a short haircut trimmed between appointments for a hair cut.</li>
    <li> The girl who cuts my hair said she will get lots of use from this item.</li>
    <li> uhm...AMAZING! You do not have to be a pro to use this and cut your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it today and cut my hair straight away and I love me hair now!!! Took off some length off my hair and gave myself some style! The razor cuts nicely. I don&#x27;t like the comb part on the other half but it&#x27;s handy. I use a more small flexible fine toothed comb instead. The package also encloses a small box with 5 stainless steel replacement blades. I can&#x27;t compare this comb to other razor combs, but I like it!! So cheap too! Will be buying this again, going to a salon to get hair trimmed is too much and this is so cheap and easy and (the comb comes with a blade already in place ready to use) the 5 extra blades will probably last a while before needing to buy more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alsoo, I agree with the helpful comment about needing to educate yourself before you try cutting. it isn&#x27;t difficult, but you can pick up some good tips by watching youtubers and google some tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the person who rated this product very low, probly tried cutting their hair bone try. dampen your hair a bit with a water spray bottle before cutting, it&#x27;ll turn out to be a much smoother rzor cut and you should never have to \\&quot;shove\\&quot; the razor on your hair</li>
    <li> Works great,but NOTE: put a small piece of duct tape or something on the razor hinge cover.It opens too easy and the blade will fall out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and two other similar trimmers. I kept this one and it works great in thinning out my unruly hair. It comes with its own little case, combs and extra blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I generally hate going to the stylist and paying for a hair cut that usually disappointed me. This razor comb is really nice and I have used it several times when my hair was in the process of growing out, but also in need of a little shaping. It obviously is only as good as the person using it, so you should definitely watch some videos, but it works. I use it often just as a regular comb without any issues of accidental hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this comb like three times and it had never disappointed me. Its easy to use and its safe. I would recommend buy it.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations.  It thins the hair just a little with just a comb thru the hair. It is easy to be careful while you are combing.</li>
    <li> Does as description states.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good condition, and cuts very well. The blade is abit heavy (I never had one before so it may not be) so find a good techinque</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I could reduce my trips to the barber shop, this razor comb is for professionals only or just not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove some knots from my cat&#x27;s fur (part Siberian).&lt;br /&gt;it worked OK for few knots but blade dulled fairly fast it kept pulling his fur instead of cutting and he got pissed. Now I have a claw mark and the cat still has plenty of knots and he runs when he sees me with the comb.</li>
    <li> I game someone a haircut with this comb and it worked wonderfully. It brings extra razors which is cool too.</li>
    <li> Split ends. . Split ends... split ends...&lt;br /&gt;13 more words required for this review? I have nothing else to add. I guess the replacement razors they send are a good quantity, if you want to continue splitting your ends.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make my hair look more choppy. Turned out amazing :)  Only problem is that the combing part isn&#x27;t great (bent out of line after a few days) so depend on another comb for combing.</li>
    <li> this comb works perfectly and the way that it was meant to -on wet hair and angled flat against the hair. It arrived also arrived very quickly and was a  Prime purchase. Thanks for a wonderful texturizing comb that&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
    <li> they work , you just have to try it and  practice to get it right, but on the whole they&#x27;re not bad for a quick touch up.  another good buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like this item.  Gives a variable razor cut.  Easy to change blade if needed.</li>
    <li> The package had been opened when I received it and the box of replacement blades was missing.  The comb itself is OK but the main reason I bought this one was the replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my mother for mothers day. Shes a stylist and she absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> great comb to get the mats out of my dog&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> My hair grows really fast and I am really picky about what people do to my hair at hair salons. I have bangs and like lots of short, choppy layers, and not everyone does them the way that I want them. Also, with my hair growing so quickly, I hate having to spend so much money to get my hair cut. So I thought, \\&quot;Why not do it myself?\\&quot; I needed a razor comb to achieve the look I wanted and this one worked perfectly! It&#x27;s a great price, great quality, and very easy to use. (: I recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> This is awesome and it came razor with five more razors it is so great! I love this item I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Excuse my title pun up there. Anyway, I had heard originally about razor combs on a YouTube tutorial for how to do \\&quot;emo/scene\\&quot; hair. I&#x27;m not \\&quot;emo\\&quot; or \\&quot;scene\\&quot; but I adore some of the hairstyles that come from those sub-cultures. I was a bit skeptical of the product, firstly because I had never cut my own hair before (successfully) and secondly because I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t understand how to use it. I got the product and it works perfectly, just as I had hoped it would! It is really simple to use, too! One of the best investments I have made. It even comes with a little box of replacement razors, but I haven&#x27;t had to replace mine yet and I bought this product at the first of 2012. Really worth the money!</li>
    <li> Havw not found a good barber in my area so I bought this product to use until I find someone... very easy to use and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the Seki hair razor and the &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; hair razor.  I cut my hair last night for the first time since receiving these items and found that on my course, thick hair, the other two products worked better than did this product.  With that said, I can say that I think this product would work better with hair that is thinner and finer.  It&#x27;s not a bad product - - just not so much for my hair.</li>
    <li> works well....good price</li>
    <li> The product works well but will fill up with hair unless you clean it (wipe it) each time you&#x27;ve run it through the hair. I suggest either a container of water and a towel or just a towel - either works. The product is great.</li>
    <li> This does what the description says it will, and it&#x27;s cost-effective. Seller is efficient as well. Hopefully I don&#x27;t botch up my hair! If I do, it&#x27;s my own fault, don&#x27;t worry!</li>
    <li> On my fine thin hair it seems to be fine, but on my daughters thick hair it seems to damage it! So we don&#x27;t use it very often. If you are going to use this make sure to try and test an area first, the amount of pressure and angle at which you put the blade against your hair to cut can effect the look of the cut. Also take care in using the comb side or take out the blade from the other end when not using to cut, otherwise you will have a cut you didn&#x27;t intend!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly :) it&#x27;s just what I needed! it makes your hair thinner and allows you to do feathery layers I love ittt :D</li>
    <li> this is very useful for trimming long hair, and the hair parter on the end really helped to separate hair. overall, a very useful tool for any girl that does not want to spend money at a hair salon!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product.  doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t drop this thing, it will bust. But, despite that I&#x27;ve gone through a couple - you will never get a better home cut than with this and a couple of mirrors, a lot of patience, and a vision.</li>
    <li> If you want to lengthen your time, in between haircuts and still look groomed, this comb is your answer.  It&#x27;s safe to use with no fear of taking gouges out of your hair.  A good product, for a small amount of money, that will keep you looking good.</li>
    <li> Be careful if you don&#x27;t have hair cutting talent. My client took off her bangs...very sharp</li>
    <li> It had been several months since I had had a haircut.  I was looking really shaggy and I couldn&#x27;t get to the barbershop easily.  I had seen a razor trim comb not too long ago.  I got to thinking about giving myself a haircut and decided to give this comb a try.  I got it and just combed through my hair and the razor/comb feathered the hair as I combed.  It took about 20 minutes to get my hair cut finished the first time.  Now I just do trims as my hair grows back.  I have a even haircut all around.  I am pleased with my groomed look now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb comes with 5 additional razor blades to replace when a blade becomes dull.  Instructions on replacing a new blade is very limited and sketchy.  I have not figured how to turn the blade over or replace a blade without breaking the razor compartment on the comb trim side.  The purchase cost was quite reasonable so I will not return to seller.  I wish the razor installation instructions had been more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This limited information is not the fault of the seller.  The manufacturer of the comb installation of new razors should have been more detailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally figure out how to turn over the blade or correctly insert a fresh blade I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, comes with an extra razor, my self-done hair cuts look fantastic. Only complaint is that I can&#x27;t quite get the razor back in the right spot after taking it out to clean out the hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to close well anymore--it occasionally falls apart (opens up and the razor falls out) while I&#x27;m trying to trim up my hair, which could end up being disastrous...maybe a little cheaply made, if you&#x27;re really serious about cutting your hair and want a good razor comb that will last a while, maybe look for a highly quality, better made, more expensive one? Just a thought, but this is good for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well for cutting hair, I used it on my own to texturize. My only complaint is that sometimes it hurts when I try to texture with it because it pulls.</li>
    <li> easy to use even for beginners so you can&#x27;t chop the hair.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but I would rather use the Tinkle Hair Cutter.  It works better than this one.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NJE39M Diamond Edge 2 Way Razor Comb]]This product works very well and the blades are sharp. It&#x27;s good for trimming down the hair without changing it&#x27;s shape. Discover just what angle you need to use when combing and it will bring your hair down to the length you decide is right for you. It&#x27;s good for guys and gals. With some other hair cutting tools, it&#x27;s a good add on to have.</li>
    <li> I needed something to \\&quot;Clean Up\\&quot; my neck line between haircuts. This device does just that. Just like using a comb, a few strokes, and the hair is gone. included Reverseible blade, and extras included, make this a very thrifty purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that i use at least daily and i would definitely purchase it again and give as a gift</li>
    <li> These sort of razor combs have been around for a long time. Most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried essentially do what they claim. The difference is the blade and how long it lasts. This works well with wet hair and a soft touch.</li>
