### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>TO hold it for greatest effectiveness, I have to do so mid-handle</li>
      <li>Very happy with the solution to the problem, and must commend the dedication and support of Mony Design.</li>
      <li>The feel, control &amp; comfort of this brush is very good.  </li>
      <li>Great idea</li>
      <li>and I just LOVE IT!!  </li>
      <li>The slip resistant rubber part on the handle is also very nice.</li>
      <li>a bit longer handle would be very nice.</li>
      <li>What a nice surprise!</li>
      <li>The bristles take a bit to get used to, but they do a good job.  </li>
      <li>so I immediately searched in good ole amazon for something that could help.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t get a good grip on it.</li>
      <li>My elderly mother was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Perfect shape and very soft.</li>
      <li>Design is a fine company, and it exemplifies what is good in an online retailer.</li>
      <li>I wanted a soft bristle bath brush and this one is perfect!</li>
      <li>Ideal for reaching the back and giving it a good scrub.</li>
      <li>They encourage feedback, which helps in making their products even better.</li>
      <li>I thought that there was nothing more to be done, but a couple of days ago I received a package from Mony.</li>
      <li>---the articulating part could be more sturdy.</li>
      <li>A good brush overall and the option to change brushes is very nice.</li>
      <li>So far, so good on this brush!</li>
      <li>so this is a pretty good option.</li>
      <li>the brush has good reach, is a medium scrub (not baby gentle but not skin removing pumice either) and does what its supposed too.&lt;br /&gt;i would like slighly longer bristles though and</li>
      <li>I look forward to the shower now to get my Lu La brush working, It is easy to handle and grips well in the shower, and I also take it with me to the Y because it is easy to carry and stow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A huge bonus...</li>
      <li>Needed something to reach my feet since I have back issues and this worked great.  </li>
      <li>The brush part pops out-NOT worth it!</li>
      <li>If you want something gentle on your skin this would be more for you.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a good alternative to get my back</li>
      <li>The nylon bristles are soft, which is great for people that have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good construction but bristles on both heads are really not that fantastic.</li>
      <li>When I bought it, I thought the replaceable brush head would allow me to exchange, if I wanted to,  the all nylon bristle head that came with the handle for one with more massage action that seemed to be available also.</li>
      <li>I am always weary when I shop outside of amazon prime, but must admit that some of the retailers that are part of the amazon world, are nothing short of very good to do business with.</li>
      <li>We think it may be just our own personal preference</li>
      <li>This Lu La Bath Brush Lite - W/Replaceable Nylon Brush Head and Sip Resistant.... is a handy tool for someone with limited mobility.</li>
      <li>Probably it could have been better with a slightly larger reach, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Mony</li>
      <li>My back has never felt better.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for something more like a scrub brush for your back this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>Not very expensive, useful for a stressful situation (was told that liquid soaps turned into lather and then put in the brush generates plenty of foam to do a thorough job every time.</li>
      <li>The brush is a quality item and appears sturdy, durable, and even attractive, but I like more stiffness in a back brush to give a little massage action.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>A member in our tribe had troubles reaching his left foot in the shower, some kind of muscle pain, tendon problem, who really knows for did not seek medical counseling.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and mine has not broken yet.  </li>
      <li>WOW!!!  </li>
      <li>Not being able to properly soap the left foot became an aggravation</li>
      <li>My one complaint though is that when used, the brush makes a significant amount of noise as it appears to not be securely attached to the handle.</li>
      <li>We were hoping for it to be a little bit more scratchy.  </li>
      <li>and it worked, allowing a person with limited reach to soap and clean the feet area.</li>
      <li>And a money saver for when I need to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slip resistant grip?</li>
      <li>I was surprised and very  appreciative to the fact that they wanted to know what was wrong with the product and they replaced it with an upgraded version.  </li>
      <li>I love how this lathers up when you put a small dab of shower gel on it.  </li>
      <li>There are rubber massagers built into the brush and while I do not really wanted that its not bad.</li>
      <li>I just find the handle too long for me to use comfortably (maybe because I&#x27;m short?).</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly and was what I expected.</li>
      <li>Also, the brush head is too soft.</li>
      <li>Lu La bath brush has nylon bristles, but they&#x27;re really soft and won&#x27;t scratch your body.</li>
      <li>On a positive note the all plastic construction doesn&#x27;t get gross the way wooden ones do.</li>
      <li>This new brush is a definite 5-star rating.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I like the brush and recommend it to anyone who likes a soft back brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only annoyance is a slight \\&quot;clicking\\&quot; sound the head makes when you scrub due to the \\&quot;latch\\&quot; holding it in place.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get much easier when you need a little bit of help.</li>

    <li> I bought this and it reaches places I had a hard time reaching without it. I have no complaints about it yet.</li>
    <li> Great idea---the articulating part could be more sturdy.</li>
    <li> This Lu La Bath Brush Lite - W/Replaceable Nylon Brush Head and Sip Resistant.... is a handy tool for someone with limited mobility. A member in our tribe had troubles reaching his left foot in the shower, some kind of muscle pain, tendon problem, who really knows for did not seek medical counseling. Not being able to properly soap the left foot became an aggravation so I immediately searched in good ole amazon for something that could help. Found several products, this one among them, which I opted for in the end based on the reviews for this item. Upon arriving it was use almost immediately and it worked, allowing a person with limited reach to soap and clean the feet area. Probably it could have been better with a slightly larger reach, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Mony Design is a fine company, and it exemplifies what is good in an online retailer. They stand by their product, no questions asked, and their attitude is not defensive, but one of concern for their customers. I am always weary when I shop outside of amazon prime, but must admit that some of the retailers that are part of the amazon world, are nothing short of very good to do business with. Not very expensive, useful for a stressful situation (was told that liquid soaps turned into lather and then put in the brush generates plenty of foam to do a thorough job every time. Very happy with the solution to the problem, and must commend the dedication and support of Mony Design. Product 4 - 4.5 Stars, Mony USA 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> The last two back brushes I&#x27;ve owned have been wooden ones with non-nylon bristles. Unfortunately, the wood on one cracked. And the bristles on the second became matted down for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lu La bath brush has nylon bristles, but they&#x27;re really soft and won&#x27;t scratch your body. Period. Anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head? Replaceable. A huge bonus... And a money saver for when I need to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slip resistant grip? Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only annoyance is a slight \\&quot;clicking\\&quot; sound the head makes when you scrub due to the \\&quot;latch\\&quot; holding it in place. Honestly, not even something worth complaining about. (But I know the not-totally-silent-back-brush will irritate some users.)</li>
    <li> A good brush overall and the option to change brushes is very nice. My one complaint though is that when used, the brush makes a significant amount of noise as it appears to not be securely attached to the handle.</li>
    <li> This bath brush is long enough for my mother to use with ease.  The brush is very firm feeling and gets the job done.  Shipping was fast.  The replacement brush works well with this also.</li>
    <li> The brush is a quality item and appears sturdy, durable, and even attractive, but I like more stiffness in a back brush to give a little massage action. When I bought it, I thought the replaceable brush head would allow me to exchange, if I wanted to,  the all nylon bristle head that came with the handle for one with more massage action that seemed to be available also. But now the replacement massage head seems to be unavailable. I would buy it if I could find it. Otherwise, I like the brush and recommend it to anyone who likes a soft back brush.</li>
    <li> The feel, control &amp; comfort of this brush is very good.  The bristles take a bit to get used to, but they do a good job.  With only the use of one hand, this truly helps with showering.</li>
    <li> Perfect shape and very soft. Ideal for reaching the back and giving it a good scrub. My elderly mother was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush because it is very difficult to wash you back unless you have very long arms. It should be at least 6 inches longer to do the job.</li>
    <li> For my dad, and he likes it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a soft bristle bath brush and this one is perfect!</li>
    <li> the brush has good reach, is a medium scrub (not baby gentle but not skin removing pumice either) and does what its supposed too.&lt;br /&gt;i would like slighly longer bristles though and a bit longer handle would be very nice.</li>
    <li> My back has never felt better. I look forward to the shower now to get my Lu La brush working, It is easy to handle and grips well in the shower, and I also take it with me to the Y because it is easy to carry and stow.&lt;br /&gt;My itchy back is history with th Lu La</li>
    <li> Needed something to reach my feet since I have back issues and this worked great.  Put some liquid soap on the brush and it washed off the dry skin.  When finished, I rinsed it off and hung it over the tub faucet.  Can&#x27;t get much easier when you need a little bit of help.</li>
    <li> This back brush will leave you wondering why you havent found this years earlier.  I love how this lathers up when you put a small dab of shower gel on it.  There are rubber massagers built into the brush and while I do not really wanted that its not bad. They are sturdy and mine has not broken yet.  I bought two spares since for some reason I go through these often.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Would Buy Again. Delivered quickly and was what I expected. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this, I thought that it was going to be just what I needed, but instead I was disappointed with the brush. The interchangeable head moved while using, I was afraid the the head was going to fall out. Because of that, I notified the company of the problem and expressed my disappointment in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to let everyone know, that after recently writing my review of this product, the company contacted me.  I was surprised and very  appreciative to the fact that they wanted to know what was wrong with the product and they replaced it with an upgraded version.  I did not expect this to happen since they originally informed me that some brushes do have a slight movement with use, but if I was not happy they would offer to send me a brush that had the head glued in place. I explained to them that I have a skin condition and that I needed a brush with interchangeable heads so that I could also apply lotion to my back when needed.  I thanked the company for their explanation for the movement and I informed them that since there seems to be a slight movement of the brush head, and that others stated the same thing,  that I would just deal with it.  I thought that there was nothing more to be done, but a couple of days ago I received a package from Mony. A upgraded version of the brush arrived. WOW!!!  What a nice surprise! Thank you Mony for listening and though you did not have to, you replaced my brush and I just LOVE IT!!  This new brush is a definite 5-star rating. The interchangeable brush head has no movement at all.  The nylon bristles are soft, which is great for people that have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the upgraded brush, I would definitely recommend this product and if you have a problem, questions or concerns, I guarantee you that Mony will respond promptly to you. They encourage feedback, which helps in making their products even better.</li>
    <li> The brush part pops out-NOT worth it!</li>
    <li> Use this daily.  Was looking for a good alternative to get my back so this is a pretty good option.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not a bath brush person, but issues with decreased mobility motivated me to get this and give it a try. I just find the handle too long for me to use comfortably (maybe because I&#x27;m short?). TO hold it for greatest effectiveness, I have to do so mid-handle which then makes it slippery in my soapy hands and I can&#x27;t get a good grip on it. Also, the brush head is too soft. But a friend likes it, so I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> We purchased this based on other reviews. Good construction but bristles on both heads are really not that fantastic. We think it may be just our own personal preference but if you are looking for something more like a scrub brush for your back this may not be for you. If you want something gentle on your skin this would be more for you. We were hoping for it to be a little bit more scratchy.  On a positive note the all plastic construction doesn&#x27;t get gross the way wooden ones do.</li>
    <li> finally a back brush that works , reaches , holds up , replaceable brush that lasts , and comes out the washer looking the same .</li>
    <li> So far, so good on this brush! It&#x27;s held up well, the bristles are still bristling and not falling out, breaking off or matting down (yes, we have had bath brushes where the bristles fall out). The slip resistant rubber part on the handle is also very nice. I purchased this one because the head is replaceable so we&#x27;ll see how that works when the time comes!</li>
