      <li>It covers really well</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really break me out, covers pores, blemishes, and evens out skin tone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest, it&#x27;s still way too pale for full-face use.</li>
      <li>i live in hot and humid weather so any type of stickiness is to be avoided.</li>
      <li>I paid about 5 more dollars compared to other listings.</li>

      <li>It covers blemishes, small zits, and stays very comfortably on my face.</li>
      <li>It is just a little too light for me, so after I put it on I let it set for 5 minutes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is full coverage and pretty thick. I really like it and the color is light enough for my pale skin. If you like a more sheer BB cream then I wou recommend this. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 25 year old niece for Christmas at her request. She used it before. She said she loves it. She has perfect pale white skin.</li>
    <li> This BB cream has very good coverage and a nice finish that isn&#x27;t too shiny. It doesn&#x27;t clump up or settle into pores/creases on my face the way some other makeups do, and it gives me an overall poreless, dewy look.  However, it is a very pale shade. Perfect for me, but maybe not everyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used  ,I just wish it came in differant shades. It is just a little too light for me, so after I put it on I let it set for 5 minutes. Then I use some physicians formula matchmaker light bronzer over it</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It covers my rosacea well. It blends smoothly and doesn&#x27;t sink into large pores or lines. I recommended this product to my sister who has red cheeks too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried five different Dr. Jart BB creams. This one is by far the best. The color looks very natural, coverage is superb.</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations/BB creams I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very fair skin (MAC - NC10, Bobby Brown - Alabaster, Laura Mercier - Soft Ivory). The shade of this cream is a bit gray-ish, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad or weird when applied in moderation. The cream is somewhat thick and can feel pretty heavy and oily when used with moisturizer, but works well alone and stays on longer when applied on primer (mine is Smashbox Blemish control). Covers blemishes and post acne scars really well. Makes skin look smooth and healthy. Provides good sun protection. I used it on the beach (reapplied a few times after swimming as it washes off easily) and got burnt everywhere except for my face :D  Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in skin condition, but it didn&#x27;t make it worse for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a bb cream that works so well as ones from dr jart. It covers blemishes, small zits, and stays very comfortably on my face. No irritation or heavy feeling! The black label is also infamous but this silver label works better on my skin tone:)&lt;br /&gt;The product came in at a normal shipping rate--took 7days--in a very good condition. I ordered from this seller because they said they give out samples to be honest:p I was little disappointed that only two little sample tubes came even tho I paid about 5 more dollars compared to other listings. HOWEVER, the product was doubtlessly a fresh, new item that wasnt old and definAtely had not been used before. Having the experience of getting used, opened, and expired( or closed to being expired) cosmetics from various sellers on amazon this made the money worthwhile. The product was freshly made this year and the box had a sticker approving the legitimacy of the item right on the opening of the box. :):)</li>
    <li> I loved this and I&#x27;ll order more when it finish.</li>
    <li> i decided to buy this when my Dr Jart Black Label Detox was running out to try it. it is definitely thicker than black label and has a somewhat paler hue. it works for me because i have very light skin. i did find it a little bit sticky when applied on top of my moisturizer so I had to knock it down one star. it wasn&#x27;t as bad when i applied it on it&#x27;s own but my skin tends to flake when i don&#x27;t use moisturizer under make up. it felt a bit more mask-like compared to Black Label (which feels like i don&#x27;t have make up on) but still not as heavy as other foundations i have tried. not a bad product if you&#x27;re pale and want slightly fuller coverage than some other BB creams provide. i think i will stick to Black Label Detox only because it&#x27;s got a thinner, smoother (non-sticky) texture. i live in hot and humid weather so any type of stickiness is to be avoided. i bet this would work better for the winter/cooler climates.</li>
    <li> I really like this by cream. It has pretty good coverage and seems to make my skin look a little brighter.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my skin. The most important trick is not using too much - that is why some other reviewers thought this product is too thick. It&#x27;s much easier to apply this using fingers instead of brush.</li>
    <li> The product took about 6 days in total to be processed, shipped, and arrived. When it came in the pacakage was in very good condition and there was an authentic sticker on the Dr. Jart package. The only disappointing part was it said that free samples would be given out along with the purchase of this item; however, I DID NOT receive any samples, which to me is disappointing. TO THE SELLER: If you aren&#x27;t going to give out any free samples, DON&#x27;T say that your are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product works well on my skin. Didn&#x27;t really break me out, covers pores, blemishes, and evens out skin tone. However, the color of this product is a bit light on me. I recommend this product to someone with really light skin, otherwise, it would make you look like a ghost. Another thing is this product can be a bit hard to blend at first, so I recommend \\&quot;patting\\&quot; motion or using a sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of Dr. Jart&#x27;s BB&#x27;s and this is the lightest with an &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; grey tinge that Asian BB&#x27;s tend to have. If you&#x27;re not fair-skinned, this is NOT the BB for you. It&#x27;s very full coverage, so it works best as an undereye concealer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, it&#x27;s still way too pale for full-face use. I just use it under the eye area. The &amp;#34;grey&amp;#34; tinge acts to negate any sallowness, plus creates the perfect &amp;#34;triangle of light&amp;#34; in concealing dark circles, or highlighting &amp;agrave; la Kim K. It&#x27;s also a hydrating formula similar to Premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a BB formula similar to this but in warmer/deeper tones for the US market, PTR&#x27;s are a good alternative ([[ASIN:B00CJTV8M4 Peter Thomas Roth CC Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Complexion Corrector, Light/Medium, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]], as they are also made in Korea but there are more shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, in order of lightness, the Dr. Jart BB&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Rejuvenating/Regenerating -- Whitest/Greyest/Palest&lt;br /&gt;-Premium- Slightly less &amp;#34;grey&amp;#34; than above&lt;br /&gt;-Black Label Detox/Doctor&#x27;s 7-Free - light, but less pale than Premium&lt;br /&gt;-V7 and Water Fuse -sheerer and least pale, but still light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Rejuvenating as a dark circle corrector, while using [[ASIN:B009138YW8 Dr. Jart Doctor&#x27;s Seven Free Beauty Balm SPF 20/PA++]] for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> Nothing but this tones down the redness in my face.  I can put it directly on blemishes without causing any inflammation or flare-up.  It has been an important part of my business wardrobe.  Make sure you wait for it to totally dry if you apply makeup over it. I have dry, inflamed, ultra sensitive skin and this works great.</li>
    <li> The best BB cream for whitening your face, cover blemish too, After use a thin layer on my face , I apply mineral powder, my face look very natural.</li>
    <li> I actually bought myself this after using a sample of my moms she got as a present. The pigmentation and coverage is really good as it covers my blemishes and it also hydrates my skin without leaving it oily. I use this from morning like 8am instead of foundation on my off days (from makeup) and it stays on throughout the day whole day. All I do it blot oilblotter mid-day around like 2pm and its still going strong. Maybe powder a little around 6 and its still pretty much there.</li>
