      <li>Great condition and a natural look.</li>
      <li>It fits great, looks just as it is pictured, and many people thought it was my actual hair!</li>
      <li>so it worked fine.</li>
      <li>really cheap  cant be styled</li>
      <li>Hair was not as full as the picture represented.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t style to look better no hard I tried</li>
      <li>after I brushed it out a little it was perfect, Its more platinum blonde then</li>
      <li>Not like picture, more yellow.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>and it was much more yellow.</li>
      <li>The quality seemed OK, it might have worked for a different outfit, but not for me!</li>
      <li>it arrived in perfcet condition, was soft , natural and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It stays in place very well and isn&#x27;t too itchy.</li>
      <li>The curls were much tighter than the picture</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for a Cosplay and it was better than I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a decent quality</li>
      <li>More of a low quality Halloween wig than regular use or cosplay.</li>
      <li>i used it in my golden greek goddess halloween make up tutorial</li>
      <li>The wig I recieved is more of a strawberry blonde not light golden blonde in the picture.</li>
      <li>I ended up not having to wear a cap as my hair color isn&#x27;t too dark and the wig has full coverage.</li>
      <li>It was suuuuper super curly, it looked a little cartoonish, I didn&#x27;t even up wearing it.</li>

    <li> I bought this for a cinderella costume and the wig is not the color pictured. The wig I recieved is more of a strawberry blonde not light golden blonde in the picture.
