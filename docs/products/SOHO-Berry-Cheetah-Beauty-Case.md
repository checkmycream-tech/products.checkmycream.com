<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was a surprise gift for our daughter-in-law who has talent for using makeup.  She is enjoying this lovely case and uses it every day!  This is a great gift idea!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, and was curious to see how much they paid for it and I was appalled to see the price. It&#x27;s made of very cheap material, the black molding on the inside isn&#x27;t glued to the wood very well, a few stitches are loose. Just not a very well built item.</li>
    <li> So cute- Perfect size</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter and she really loves it, just wish it had a mirror attached to the case....</li>

    <li> Not roomy enough for cosmetics. Pretty design. Returning.</li>
    <li> My niece loves it! It doesn&#x27;t look super cheap which is a surprise! Not for pro use though as it is only medium sized. Only good for organizing teens make ups and accessories.</li>
    <li> The shipment was very quick and the product looks even more beautiful when you have it in your hands.</li>
    <li> I am SOOOOOOOO in love with this!!! It has alot of room and space to put things. I have one for all of my makeup. I am going to purchase one in the future for my hair stuff and other personal care items! I would recommend this to anyone i know! The lock is a nice addition, too! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My mom got this for me, and it works great. Great for your everyday things, or just random beauty products. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Really love my new case however the pictures made me believe it was bigger than it really was. I wanted to for my hair cutting items and it just wasn&#x27;t big enough. But, it worked great for all my makeup items.</li>
    <li> very beautiful bought for my 14yr sister for her beday filled it with make up and she loved it .</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!!</li>
    <li> Loved it perfect for storage. Love the color and compartments would defiantly recommend this product to anyone else thanks guys</li>
    <li> Its kind of cheap but its so cute I got over it lol. Just dont be rough with it and you should be ok.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s super cute and very sturdy and just perfect for travel.  Carrys all the makeup I need for a long vacation without being super bulky</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star at all!! When it arrived it was filthy and ready rusted! It doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture listed above! The only thing decent was my refund!</li>
    <li> Great product! My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my niece that is into make-up and she loved it, It was very pretty.</li>
    <li> The print is the min reason why i&#x27;m going to keep it. This is for my person use rather than my clients, because I have way more things/makeup for my clients than myself. It&#x27;s pretty spacious, but it&#x27;s not big, if you have a few of each, then this will work for you.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this case, but I didn&#x27;t want to put a lot of money into a makeup case.  Upon arrival, I found it to be sturdier than ones I&#x27;ve seen at Target.  The lock on it is really easy to break if you try to, so for travelling(airport), it&#x27;s not going to do you a lot of good.  As far as size, it&#x27;ll do, but probably isn&#x27;t big enough for ALL of my makeup.</li>
    <li> The product is nice, but it would have been great if it was the dimensions stated in the ad. The dimensions in the ad are 12.2 x 6.5 x 8.2 inches, but the item is 11.2 x 6.5 x 8.5 inches.  It is 1 inches shorter than advertised.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this as would I. good quality, made a  great gift . fab colour and great size... buy</li>
    <li> SMALLER THAN i THOUGHT BUT LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I love my makeup box the colors are amazing. I love the print! I love print,but if you have a lot of makeup you might want to get a bigger box.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon and ship it to Nigeria. Very nice beautiful case and color</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger than it looks.</li>
    <li> Great just what I wanted a good size and very prompt delivery. Fits all my daughter&#x27;s dance makeup and hair stuff easily and is a great pattern</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the quality of the case.  It was made very cheaply. Doesn&#x27;t appear it will last long considering a makeup case needs to be open and closed more than a regular case.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this particular case and had to order it from USA, I love the case, the colours are so vibrant and it was delivered a heck of a lot quicker than I expected it to.  The company are on the ball with processing their orders, I would certainly buy from them again.  I wish it came in different sizes, I would buy a set!!!  With matching luggage!</li>
    <li> Very nice quick delivery</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to keep my nail art items in, but as my collection keeps growing, I will be storing my makeup in the case. I will say that I was able to fit all my polishes in the bottom main compartment and the mini shelves with accessories, and the handle has not broken or seemed to loosen. Very sturdy and super cute!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this for my granddaughter who is just 8yrs old. She already collected beauty stuff quite a bit. The beauty case is nice and sturdy and it is her favorite color. This case will last for a long time. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for our niece. Shipped really quick, and is great quality. We are excited for her to open it on Christmas.</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter for christmas and she absolutely loves it!  she is a makeup and nail color junkie and it holds everything.  the perfect size, not too large or too small.</li>
    <li> My sister loved it! Im so glad I got her this becuase she can now put her expensive make up in a case that describes her personality to a T! thank you!</li>
    <li> This box is nicely sized and the colors are bright, however the quality is less than I had expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than expected but can take a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this case. It can fit so much make up in 3 different compartments. I love the colors and it is easy to use and you can take it with you anywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional but small and not that durable.  I bought a larger metal one 5 yrs ago that worked great.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my 13 year old twins &amp; they both love them! They&#x27;re not huge but for a small makeup collection, its perfect</li>
    <li> Shipping fast. However, the product may look okay, but the case is very weak. Not recommend for this one. My look for other worth the price.</li>
    <li> I want to return them. please send me a return lable. The look bigger then they are, very small not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as big as it is. I love it!</li>
    <li> the wife loves it, now she can fit all her makeup in one case without them being all spread out.</li>
    <li> Way too small! It barely fits any of my day to day makeup.. Would be perfect for a small child or young teen..</li>
    <li> I love this case it may not fit all my make up but it fitted everything i need on a daily basis its cute and well built , overall i thing i might buy another soon.</li>
    <li> I wish I got another color but I just love this box! All makeup is organized now, and fits in that box!</li>
    <li> Great size for the price, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much in terms of durability considering the price, but it&#x27;s actually quite durable.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I put 4 stars is because the lock is iffy and kind of cheap, and the trays are a bit wobbly.</li>
    <li> This case is great if youarent a heavy make up user. It feels as though its made from heavy card board material and can if dropped dent or tear. The slots that rise when open are nice but after three weeks it gets stuck when its time to fold down. I like the look and it holds most of my makeup well organized even though its not that big. If you are looking for a quick to do box tgis is it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this make up case it&#x27;s durable and fits all my needs I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very convenient, durable and cute.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as the picture shown, but I thought it would have been more sturdy, the two layer shelves are Shakey and wobbly. Other than that its pretty looking and it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my 5 year old daughter who stores all her &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;jewelry&amp;#34; in it and uses it every day</li>
    <li> Very cool print really brite. Its not as big as I thought but it will serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for a young teenager.. Sturdy and well made</li>
    <li> I got it because of the print. It has a lock &amp; keys which is cool, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup being messed with lol. The size is medium, fits a good amound of items.</li>
    <li> Perfect for small storage use.</li>
    <li> I wanted a make-up case that I could lock to keep my girls out of it. This case is perfect. It&#x27;s not too big but it&#x27;s not small either. They have tried to get into the case and can not. My make-up is safe from their little hands. (Ages 2, 4, &amp; 6)</li>
    <li> Not too big, Not too small, perfect for home use and storage. Sturdy and brightly coloured!&lt;br /&gt;great for stowing jewellery instead</li>
