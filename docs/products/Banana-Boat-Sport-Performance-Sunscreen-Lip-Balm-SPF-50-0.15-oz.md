      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a flavor, per se, maybe the faintest hint of coconut but nothing that you would obviously taste like the Bonne Bell LipSmackers, which are highly flavored.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Only gave it 4 stars as it was not chosen as a highly rated item by EWG.  </li>
      <li>This is the second tube I&#x27;ve bought because it&#x27;s high SPF but doesn&#x27;t taste like it.  </li>
      <li>Apparently something in this lip balm broke me out in blisters.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Found this orginially at REI.  It&#x27;s excellent:  good taste and easy to apply.  Only gave it 4 stars as it was not chosen as a highly rated item by EWG.  But I&#x27;m not sure if they reviewed this or not; though they had reviewed other Banana Boat products.</li>
    <li> This is the second tube I&#x27;ve bought because it&#x27;s high SPF but doesn&#x27;t taste like it.  Most balms I&#x27;ve tried with sunscreen taste too bad for me to leave on my lips.  I use the Banana Boat everyday and all day.</li>
    <li> As a prime member and at  $5.74 for 0.15 ozs this was a total ripoff. I ordered 2 for a total of $ 11.44. Did not come in the package as illustrated. My fault I did not examine the specifics of product. I will send it back.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen/chap stick , it works better than most I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad .I will be ordering more soon !</li>
    <li> This is a great running chap stick. Especially for those long runs that could be sunny and windy. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims, for a great price. The balm is not a &#x27;dry&#x27; balm like original chapstick, it&#x27;s a little more moist and feels good on your lips. It doesn&#x27;t have a flavor, per se, maybe the faintest hint of coconut but nothing that you would obviously taste like the Bonne Bell LipSmackers, which are highly flavored.&lt;br /&gt;The balm lasted through my entire afternoon of yard work in the sun, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, was easy to use, and didn&#x27;t even melt in my pocket in 90+ degree F temps. Suitable for men or women, as it has no color. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> like it, this item is light and it really protects, it has a slight sweet taste but we don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
    <li> I did not want to give this product even 1 star but i couldn&#x27;t post this without giving at laeast one star. I purchased this product last week. I was planning a trip to Florida, and applied it to my lips two days before leaving for my trip to condition my lips for the sun. I wasn&#x27;t in the sun as we were in a rainy period in PA.  I broke out with 3 blisters on my bottom lip. Apparently something in this lip balm broke me out in blisters. I will never purchase this product again. Worst product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out as white as some of the reviews I read. It&#x27;s like chap stick or carmex. It works really well, and my lips are not getting sun burned like they use to. Good investment.</li>
    <li> I am a skin cancer patient and i can&#x27;t be in sunlight at all without getting burns.  this is the clear lip balm i can use on my lips and nose to prevent serious sun burns as a result of the side effects of the cancer chemo i am taking.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Item arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Not too slippery and it really does protect from the sun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to protect my lips when I swim. They peel and chap more when using this than without.</li>
    <li> Used this for 4 months now and have not gotten burned lips even once.</li>
    <li> great lip balm - wore fishing for 5 days on the ocean in the hot sun. Lips stayed moist and not burned</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has sunscreen in it. It works just like any other lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love this lip Balm not only its high spf50 its very moisturizing on my lips too. I bought 4 for my husband and my daughter and some back up I can keep in my purse. It doesn&#x27;t have the sun screen taste or smell (no smell at all) and the price is awesome. I was in search for an spf lip balm and I&#x27;m so glad I found these. I apply these before my lipstick or lip gloss. I will be buying more of these to stock up.</li>
    <li> Good product but sorta heavy on. Took long time to get here. Next time I would buy in store.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the SPF, does have a taste to it (I try not to let my tongue on my lips, but it happens).  I usually wear this under my Neutrogena Moisture Shine Lip protector as added SPF and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I especially like this stuff as it has NO SCENT! Also has hardly a taste either. It has Aloe and Vitamin E for lips. It has kept my lips from being sunburned many times over. I just keep a light layer on my lips when I am outside, all summer long.</li>
    <li> If you want name brand lip balm with spf 50, then this is a good buy at $5, which is what I bought it for. Name brand lip balm, with something special, is like 3-7 dollars anyway. This one is simple, and tastes fine. Don&#x27;t go for the ones that taste good, they are filled with sugar and calories and junk and you&#x27;re no longer buying lip balm. Just buy this one, it&#x27;s cheap and SPF 50.</li>
