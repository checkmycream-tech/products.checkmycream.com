<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simple to use, and possibly re-use. No tan lines, and easy to see through them when looking at your phone, the bed time, etc.</li>
    <li> These are much cheaper than buying at the tanning salon. Easy to apply and disposable. Even thou I have the plastic eye shields these are nice to carry in a purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying .50 cents each time I tan.  These were perfect and my gym allowed me to use them, no problem.</li>
    <li> I love tanning bed but hate to use the tanning glasses (they always leave tanning lines). That&#x27;s why these are to perfect. They just stick right around the eye so you don&#x27;t have to worry about tan lines on your nose or the side of your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once. They were pretty easy to put on and stayed on the entire time, sweating and all. I liked that you can see out of them without hurting your eyes. The goggles are uncomfortable and difficult to see out of.</li>
    <li> The seller was amazing it came VERY fast in the mail! I love the product it works wonderfully it is easy to use and does not leave tan lines!! I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> For the first time ever I started using a tanning bed this winter. The place where I go does supply goggles but to me they cover too much of your eyes and I didn&#x27;t want that raccoon look. So I did some online surfing and heard about Wink-Ease, a small, disposable eye cover. Before I found Nova Companies I was almost going to buy a 30 piece starter pack somewhere else. The price was $14 ( I had no idea really of what they would cost) with a $9.00 shipping fee. The shipping seemed way out of line so I called the company who verified that $9.00 was the correct shipping charge. I thought this was so far out of line that I did some more internet checking. That&#x27;s when I found the exact same product from Nova Companies. But instead of charging $14 for the starter pack they only charged $6.00. And instead of a $9.00 shipping fee they charged $1.22. So what I almost paid $23 for I ended up paying $7.22 for! An amazing difference. So I definitely recommend this company</li>
    <li> Although it was a good price for these I did not like them at all.  I ordered the 30 pack and I only used 2 pairs and hated them.  They would not stay stuck on in the corners of my eyes.  I could see light coming through.  I will stick with the old fashioned tanning goggles.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye protection. First used at my tanning salon. I bought these when my salon stopped giving them out. Easy to use and nice to be able to have a fresh pair every time.</li>
    <li> Love them! My current tanning place didn&#x27;t offer them for purchase and I&#x27;m not crazy about the string and nosepiece on the goggles. These are just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Good product but just be it said prime didn&#x27;t mean a thing it arrived over a week late!</li>
    <li> The only product of it&#x27;s kind---no lines across nose or across side of face, these disposable work for me.  I bought the 30 pack because I was buying them one at a time at the tanning place</li>
    <li> Eye ware works just great.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a few months now and I really like them.  They are easy to put on and take off. The stickiness does not irritate your skin.  Handy little product.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!! They prevent tan lines from standard goggles, they&#x27;re easy to use and disposable! They block the UV but still allow you to actually see thru them. Perfect for anyone that wants that awesome tan!</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to use and they stay on. You can even see through them!</li>
    <li> I wear these in the stand up bed to avoid lines from my other goggles with the straps. Sticks the whole time</li>
    <li> These are awkward and uncomfortable. They don&#x27;t stick very well either.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal and great product!!!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the tanning spa.&lt;br /&gt;Fit wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This was a great find. Much cheaper than buying them at the tanning salon and no white strap marks on your face!</li>
    <li> Love &#x27;em....no tan lines from the strings on the goggles.  They even stay on in the stand up bed.</li>
    <li> I really like these for stand-up tanning.  Ordered 30-pack so I could try them out and will order more before I run out.  Can be used several times with a little care.  I cut a piece of wax paper to fit ziplock snack bag and place them with sticky side on the wax paper.</li>
    <li> I have been using wink-ease for years.  They are much more convenient than goggles because it allows me to flip over in a tanning bed.  They go together with ease without tearing and stick to the eye well.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. Not sure if I received an old batch or what, but after use, the sticky glue was off the wink-ease and on my eyes and they ripped in half when removing from strip. I ordered 30 prs, and of the 10 prs I&#x27;ve used-all have done the same thing. I have used wink-ease before and never had any trouble with them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great! I just wish Amazon sold the wink ease with lash room as I do tend to tan with mascara on!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for people who want to tan and not have the raccoon eyes. My eyelashes were crushed against them but that&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
    <li> I really like these.  They allow you to see thru them while in use and fit perfectly over the eyes. They do what I purchased them for.  They stay put till you take them off.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> They work for their purpose which is to block the UV light from tanning beds. However, the glue becomes stuck to my eyes so when I take them off after tanning, the glue stays on my eyes and I have to pick/peel it off my eyelids! It&#x27;s irritating, and pulling on the delicate skin of your eye is never a good idea!</li>
    <li> You only have 1 set of eyes so take care of them. I have the goggles but I like the wink-ease hands down.</li>
    <li> I love these little things. No weird tan lines and so easy to use and a lot cleaner. Showed up early. Great Service. Will definitely will be getting more.</li>
    <li> Yes I tan, and they charge $.50 for each set of these in the salon. The price was great so I grabbed them.</li>
    <li> These wink-ease do the trick, and at a good price. The reason they get a 4 out of 5 rating is that the adhesive stays on your eyelids and has to be picked off..</li>
    <li> I was using goggles and searching for something that didn&#x27;t leave raccoon eyes or lines for the strap. They work great! For me, they stay in place and come off easy.</li>
    <li> Wink-Ease are the best way to protect your eyes.  Way better than the goggles.  I will always use Wink-Ease</li>
    <li> Arrived as-pictured and work just as perfectly as when I purchase them at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> work for what they are for. my tanning bed requires us to use some kind of eye protection. better than the goggles that leave tan lines. can see through these just fine if necessary. and blocks the rays</li>
    <li> great for standup beds</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. If you buy them at the tanning salon, they are usually $0.50 for one pair. I always buy them online instead in bulk. You don&#x27;t have any lines over the bridge of your nose and they are disposable. I keep some in my car in case I forget them when I head out to tan.</li>
    <li> I use to tan at Fusion and I would just spend 50 cents for this each time, but my gym does not have them. I love these! These are perfect for stand up beds. And a really great price!</li>
    <li> love them  perfect for what I needed  they fit the eye so well and no lines  love them  I will definitely buy them again  thank you so much</li>
    <li> They work very well but they sometimes fall off your eyes while you are wearing them. Also when you take them off the glue sticks to your eye lids and it is hard to remove from your skin.</li>
    <li> These work great at tanning salons.  I hated using the goggles that can leave lines on your face.  These work well.</li>
    <li> This product got to my address very promptly and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product! Wink ease cover my eyes 100% from UV rays and they&#x27;re cheap to buy! Definitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with these!! I have been looking for some type of eyewear for stand up beds that doesn&#x27;t have a piece covering my nose for quite some time. Easy assembly, no strings, and they stick right to you. I was shocked when I put them on, you can see much more clearly compared to normal goggles.</li>
    <li> These are OK but nothing great.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get used to these.  I prefer to use eyewear that is solid and does not require any origami skills.  :)</li>
    <li> This product is simply wonderful! I love how it sticks in place, has great visibility and protects my vision without the use of heavy/bulky goggles that left me with a funny tan line on my nose. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have used these for year and years. When I managed a tanning salon we sold out of these like crazy. You use these for every tan....throw them away after. The nice thing is you can see right through them but they still protect you from the bad rays. PLUS no raccoon eyes or weird lines from eye band straps.</li>
    <li> This is a neat idea. I can even reuse several times. Great product!  I like the fact that I can also see through them.</li>
    <li> These are great for anyone who wants to make sure to protect their eyes while tanning but doesn&#x27;t want the weird lines you can get from goggles. I was introduced to these years ago at a tanning salon but the one I go to now doesn&#x27;t carry them so I was glad to find them on here. They can be tricky to figure out at first, but they are really the best. You can move around in the bed and they don&#x27;t fall off and you don&#x27;t have to readjust like you might with goggles. No weird tan lines with them either. They can tug a bit when you are taking them off, you just have to be careful to be gentle with that skin around the eyes. They do need to be that sticky though to stay on. Great invention!</li>
    <li> I use these in a stand up tanning bed. They work great if you put them on right! They are easy to tear, so be careful. No raccoon eyes for me. They fit in your wallet so you don&#x27;t forget them at home!! I will continue buying these.</li>
    <li> good product does what it is supposed to do in almost any condition, and lessens any risk of contamination if only used once.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the Wink-Ease. After use each time I would try to take them off my eyes and the sticky stuff would remain on my eyelid. Plus, when I carefully, and I stress carefully, take them off the paper to use them, many of them would rip. I did not have luck with them but maybe others will.  They are just not for me.  :(</li>
    <li> These work great for the tanning booth.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t complain about this product, use the eyewear once and dispose when done.  They stay on your eyes much better than normal tanning eyewear</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected and in excellent condition. Great product, I use them in the stand up tanning booth. Easy to use, stays in place and removes easily w/ no residue.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are amazing and much better than any other tanning goggles I&#x27;ve ever tried. They don&#x27;t leave those awful tan lines!</li>
    <li> You get a good amount for the price you&lt;br /&gt;Pay and they work great!</li>
    <li> These particular winks are designed with a slightly different adhesive flap. When bending the winks into shape, I found it difficult to completely close the flap without a tiny hole forming in the middle. I never experienced this problem with earlier winks. Nevertheless, for a month&#x27;s worth of eye pieces, I found this starter kit to be a good bargain.</li>
    <li> I have lost that raccoon eyes look since using these and will order again.  Very easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> Good price and these little things are pefect for standing tanning bed!</li>
    <li> For my home tanning unit, Love my winkies, Thank You !</li>
    <li> Easier to pack around then the eye goggles, and stay on.</li>
    <li> Just what you expect, but at a bargain and less expensive than the salon.</li>
