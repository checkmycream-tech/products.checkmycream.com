      <li>sporty citrus is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Great subtle mini sprays, perfect for your purse!</li>
      <li>GREAT WAY TO SAMPLE NEW PERFUME LINES.</li>
      <li>If I were you, I&#x27;d head to your nearest MACY&#x27;s, and see if they&#x27;ll let you sample the three fragrances for FREE and then buy the one you like the most.</li>
      <li>They all smell beautiful and last all day.  </li>
      <li>I thought the fragrances were fine.  </li>
      <li>I love it and it arrived quicker than expected and it is great in helping me decide in which fragrance to choose from.  </li>
      <li>This was a great way not only to try it out for the 1st time but also try 2 bonus scents.   </li>
      <li>Stuff that I could get it for free ...</li>
      <li>It was great to receive the 3 different fragrances in sample size for testing.</li>
      <li>I would purchase any one of these in a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>Too sweet.  </li>
      <li>I really fell in love with the Jasmine perfume.</li>
      <li>The good part is that I got a few more samples.</li>
      <li>Jasmine is sweet, the citrus is refreshing and lovely, and the Amber is deeper and more complex.</li>
      <li>I like either a fresh or citric scent.  </li>
      <li>but I did find one I really liked and ended up purchasing the big bottle of that..</li>
      <li>I really liked the sexy amber but didn&#x27;t care much for the other 2.</li>
      <li>They were a lot small than I thought they would be but smelled great</li>
      <li>Smells great but to small.</li>
      <li>I just needed the sample size to be sure of which to buy in a bigger size.</li>
      <li>Ships fast!</li>
      <li>These bottles are really small but they smell really good</li>
      <li>THanks</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending them so promptly.</li>
      <li>I really just wanted one of the vials of perfume.</li>
      <li>cute little sample bottles.</li>
      <li>I wish they were larger, but mission accomplished large bottle of jasmine purchased without regret!</li>
      <li>I was hoping that at least one would be nice.  </li>
      <li>Before you buy you should be aware this is not meant to be sold, its a tiny sample you should ask your department store for one.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re slightly bigger than the size of a large bobby pin.</li>
      <li>This product is just little sample sprays you get for free at any retail store that sells this perfume.</li>
      <li>The perfume was fabulous as expected, thank you for the extra vial.  </li>
      <li>Sure, the bigger bottles are much more expensive, but you get a bigger bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, my search for a good perfume continues.</li>
      <li>One little spray will last all day, and anymore is too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was disappointed that the sizes were not bigger for the price I paid.  Probably only got two uses per bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent combination, smells really good. I will stick with these fragrance for a while.</li>
    <li> great buy quick shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest here. The fragrances are LOVELY. They all smell beautiful and last all day.  I spritzed myself twice and headed out for the day and received nothing but compliments on how great I smelled. BUT, these &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; are NOT worth 30 bucks. They&#x27;re tiny. Real tiny. They&#x27;re slightly bigger than the size of a large bobby pin. So please keep that in mind when deciding to shelve out thirty something bucks. If I were you, I&#x27;d head to your nearest MACY&#x27;s, and see if they&#x27;ll let you sample the three fragrances for FREE and then buy the one you like the most. Sure, the bigger bottles are much more expensive, but you get a bigger bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to decide which one I want!</li>
    <li> It was great to receive the 3 different fragrances in sample size for testing. Love the spray tops.</li>

    <li> GREAT WAY TO SAMPLE NEW PERFUME LINES.</li>
    <li> All three fragrances are beautiful... sporty citrus is my favorite.  This set is a perfect way to test out each scent before committing!</li>
    <li> I love it and it arrived quicker than expected and it is great in helping me decide in which fragrance to choose from.  I love the glam jasmine, it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I really just wanted one of the vials of perfume. Sexy Amber. This was a great way not only to try it out for the 1st time but also try 2 bonus scents.   REMEMBER:  A little puff goes a long way. It should be worn in a subtle way. Sexy Amber fits the Bill.  Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Perfect to test which scent you like before making that big purchase!  Ships fast!</li>
    <li> Smells great but to small.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a little bigger and who pays for samples.  So disappointed in this purchase of perfume samples.</li>
    <li> These bottles are really small but they smell really good so I will be buying the larger sizes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like any of the scents.  Too sweet.  I like either a fresh or citric scent.  I was hoping that at least one would be nice.  To no avail.  Unfortunately, my search for a good perfume continues.</li>
    <li> Samples smell wonderful, however they were much smaller than I imagined. Not worth 20+ bucks.</li>
    <li> The bottles were really, really tiny. I felt for the price I paid it was a bit of a rip off.. but I did find one I really liked and ended up purchasing the big bottle of that..</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I was a little disappointed in the amount vs the price but other than that everything was ok. I appreciate the extra sample you put in. THanks</li>
    <li> I thought the fragrances were fine.  It was good to be able to sample before a full purchase. Not great enough to tempt me away from the niche perfume market.</li>
    <li> I really liked the sexy amber but didn&#x27;t care much for the other 2. Also the viva la juicy was an awesome surprise and is now my favorite. Thanks for sending them so promptly.</li>
    <li> I feel so blessed to have received this as a gift with purchase. Before you buy you should be aware this is not meant to be sold, its a tiny sample you should ask your department store for one. I saw another listing for .24 oz samples for I think $39? That&#x27;s probable the legitimate \\&quot;for sale\\&quot; sample (just guessing) However Each scent is so wonderful and different. Jasmine is sweet, the citrus is refreshing and lovely, and the Amber is deeper and more complex. I would purchase any one of these in a full size bottle. One little spray will last all day, and anymore is too much. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great subtle mini sprays, perfect for your purse!</li>
    <li> It was way too smaller for the price. Stuff that I could get it for free ...</li>
    <li> They were a lot small than I thought they would be but smelled great</li>
    <li> I thought that they were a bit bigger. It was totally not worth the money. The good part is that I got a few more samples.</li>
    <li> These are trial sizes, smaller than I anticipated.  However overall received product in timely manner with no problems.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. Returned item.</li>
    <li> one of the samples was broken when I received it, and they are very small</li>
    <li> cute little sample bottles. I used them up in 3 weeks. I really fell in love with the Jasmine perfume. Happy that I was able to sample them for $20. Now I will be happy with my purchase of $80 bottle</li>
    <li> This product is just little sample sprays you get for free at any retail store that sells this perfume. Not worth the 25$ i paid.</li>
