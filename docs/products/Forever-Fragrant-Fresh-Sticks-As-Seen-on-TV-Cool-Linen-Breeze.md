### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THE ITEM IS VERY GOOD</li>
      <li>this was great in getting rid of our pet odors.</li>
      <li>looks  great</li>
      <li>It has worked great for about a year.</li>
      <li>Great  smell  </li>
      <li>Ordering more!!</li>
      <li>it is amazing!</li>
      <li>I plan to get these again if a good deal comes up.</li>
      <li>I question if the sticks did any good OR</li>
      <li>It does not give a strong scent, which works great for me.  </li>
      <li>I took one stick out and put it in my car and my car still smells amazing every time I get in it.</li>
      <li>AND MY BROTHER LIKED THEM</li>
      <li>SO I BOUGHT HIM HIS OWN.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one set of sticks for nearly 2 months in a confined space (walk-in closet) with excellent coverage.</li>
      <li>I notice their scent, but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
      <li>ON TOP OF THEM.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
      <li>but would I buy more?</li>
      <li>great.they have my whole house smelling so good.</li>
      <li>I first got it at Fry&#x27;s, and came to love it!  </li>
      <li>but I  also no longer smell the strong sulfur odor associated with our water.  </li>
      <li>at first Thrilled.</li>
      <li>While I did enjoy the aroma they gave off, I believe it was a bit too strong.</li>
      <li>It says in the product description that it is a LIGHT scent, which is how it should be.</li>
      <li>THEM IN OUR BATHROOM CAN&#x27;T EAVEN SMELL THEM UNLESS YOUR RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THEM UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for a small room like a bathroom</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice the linen scent at all unless I&#x27;m fairly close to where I keep them, but the room smells cleaner and odors are barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>another great product love these little sticks</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, they do work better than I expected.</li>
      <li>As with all air fresheners, they are great at first; but lose their potency a short while after.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product but is quite strong in smaller areas (like bathrooms).  </li>
      <li>the scent is fresh and clean but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This product made my whole house smell like linen for about two weeks but did nothing to neutralize strong odors.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t feel they were worth it...</li>
      <li>I had to hold them right up under my nose to smell them at all when I opened the package</li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>If I put my nose right at the stick</li>
      <li>It has really kept the odors down great where nothing else could.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I hoped it would  do.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty to look at though</li>
      <li>Pretty and really adds freshness to the room without using a power outlet.</li>
      <li>They have a delicate scent that is pleasant and clean-smelling.</li>
      <li>Nice scent very very very light add an oil scent that is the same scent fills the room and scent long lasting</li>
      <li>I actually do not like an obvious scent in the room, but do like to eliminate odors, which this product does amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>THEY REALLY DO KEEP THEIR SMELL.  </li>
      <li>It absorbes odors really well--I knew it from my experience putting it in the Kitchen.  </li>
      <li>but really?  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH</li>
      <li>SO MUCH NEATER THAN LIQUID REED DIFFUSERS</li>
      <li>Since I started using this product, it neutralized the air in my kitchen really well.  </li>
      <li>And Absolutely my apartment no longer smells like a locker room.  </li>
      <li>anyone who would pay over  15.00 has too much money on their hands.</li>
      <li>Plus, their odor is not off-putting as are many other room &#x27;fresheners.&#x27;</li>
      <li>in all, the fragrance sticks were okay while they lasted, but I would recommend to stick to other brands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>barely any scent and can&#x27;t smell them at all unless my nose is right on them.</li>
      <li>fragrant is weak transaction was good</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a powerful air-freshener or something that puts out a constant perfumey fragrance like a plug-in, but they do seem to help reduce odors to some extent.</li>
      <li>Now I decide to get a few more.  </li>
      <li>From the first day I put them out you can BARELY smell them from 1 foot away.</li>
      <li>I would likely buy more of these if I got a good price, for small rooms, bathrooms, a room where pets stay or a few in the kitchen.</li>
      <li>only works for short time looks pretty but not as effective on odors as I expected from ads</li>
      <li>These are indeed subtle - you DO have to stick your nose in them to smell them, and I LOVE that!</li>
      <li>I love it but wish it lasted longer in &amp;#34;heavy odor&amp;#34; rooms of larger sizes (like a bedroom with limited windows).</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and subtle (but nice), especially after the first few days, but I have noticed they do neutralize odors.</li>
      <li>the fact that I switched to the new &amp;#34;clump and seal&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I live in an RV where the septic or something else is always stinky.</li>
      <li>At the rate I was using up cheap car and home air fresheners before, I would have spent probably $50 or more in the last year and a half.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work miracles by any means, but I do notice a positive difference in the room I currently keep them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>so far these are</li>
      <li>(new product same old hype)  </li>
      <li>It only has a scent if you nearly stick it in your nose.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think most people would want a heavy scent to fill up their house year round.</li>
      <li>They definitely work most efficiently (if smelling the product is important to you) in a confined, smaller space--however, even in a small bedroom space, I not only can smell the scent sticks, but I noticeably do NOT smell the stale air odor that I bought them for.</li>
      <li>No, not really a difference, we also have 2 dogs, they are small, clean dogs, we have carpet.</li>

<li> No, not really a difference, we also have 2 dogs, they are small, clean dogs, we have carpet.</li>
<li> I like , but I wish the sticks were a little more scented when you want to divide them to put a few in other rooms.</li>
<li> My cooking usually leaves a strong smell that would stay for a few hours.  </li>
<li> The package reads &amp;#34;up to 2 years&amp;#34;, but they only lasted about a week and a half before the smell was completely unnoticeable.</li>
<li> Did not last long.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t looked at ingredients for any long term hazards.</li>
<li> Bought these to be used in my bathroom and other open spaces in my home.</li>
<li> Then, I decided to buy a multi-pack on Amazon for several other areas in my home.</li>
<li> it is not overpowering - just subtle but really works.</li>
<li> They are far too strong, annoyingly cloying, or aggravate my migraines.  </li>
<li> I put them in a smallish room that has a somewhat musty smell from old carpeting and these sticks have helped reduce the odor by at least 75%.</li>
<li> Scent lasted only a few days.  </li>
<li> HE WAS TICKLED PINK.  </li>
<li> in reality  for this product to remotely work you might need to buy 5 of them for one room to smell the scent pass 10 min..</li>
<li> and I guess that&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
<li> gave it an extra star because I&#x27;m not sure, don&#x27;t want to mislead.</li>
<li> After about a month, you would have to be extremely close up to the sticks to get any whiff of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Holy cow.  </li>
<li> this product is definitely subtle - but works..we had an old stench we couldn&#x27;t get rid of but after a few days it was gone.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> I hate most of the room deodorizers I have tried.</li>
<li> I have had mine for about a year and a half.</li>
<li> A lot of people on here are complaining that after a few days, they can&#x27;t smell them unless they hold them close to their nose.</li>
<li> Waste of $</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>

    <li> another great product love these little sticks</li>
    <li> Great  smell  looks  great</li>
    <li> As with all air fresheners, they are great at first; but lose their potency a short while after.  These are the same and I guess that&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> this product is definitely subtle - but works..we had an old stench we couldn&#x27;t get rid of but after a few days it was gone.  if you want an overpowering scent, this product is not that.</li>
    <li> gave it an extra star because I&#x27;m not sure, don&#x27;t want to mislead. I think it was alittle over priced, but seems somewhat to work. If I put my nose right at the stick I sorta can smell them, otherwise I probably wouldn&#x27;t know they were there. Haven&#x27;t looked at ingredients for any long term hazards.</li>
    <li> THE ITEM IS VERY GOOD AS STATED IN ADVERTIZEMENT&lt;br /&gt;USED  ALL OVER THE HOUSE EXPECIALLY IN THE KITCHEN AND BATH</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product but is quite strong in smaller areas (like bathrooms).  I love it but wish it lasted longer in &amp;#34;heavy odor&amp;#34; rooms of larger sizes (like a bedroom with limited windows).</li>
    <li> Holy cow.  I purchased these for my classroom (30 foot by 30 foot with 15 foot ceilings).  The scent was over-powering!  My students claimed it smelled like &amp;#34;Old Lady.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up throwing away the container and all but six sticks which were spread evenly thoughout my room.  Those six sticks stopped smelling within a week.</li>
    <li> From the first day I put them out you can BARELY smell them from 1 foot away. I put 2 in a small bathroom and they do nothing, you can not smell the fragrance at all. I tried them for several months. They do not remove odors or freshen anything! Total junk!</li>
    <li> at first Thrilled. but really?  TWO years?? I think NOT. anyone who would pay over  15.00 has too much money on their hands. I do have 2 cats, but  I question if the sticks did any good OR the fact that I switched to the new &amp;#34;clump and seal&amp;#34; litter did it. So, maybe my review is pointless. however I did purchase another one from a store and place it in our house. No, not really a difference, we also have 2 dogs, they are small, clean dogs, we have carpet. the house still smells, the same. after 3 months, you can pick up a stick and not even smell it. however, in fairness, the reviews did say the smell of the sticks would dissipate or you would get used to it, so i&#x27;ll give you that. but would I buy more? no.</li>
    <li> THE ONLY WAY YOU SMELL THEM IS IF YOU STICK YOUR NOSE RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM.&lt;br /&gt;PUT THEM IN OUR BATHROOM CAN&#x27;T EAVEN SMELL THEM UNLESS YOUR RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THEM UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one set of sticks for nearly 2 months in a confined space (walk-in closet) with excellent coverage. Then, I decided to buy a multi-pack on Amazon for several other areas in my home. They definitely work most efficiently (if smelling the product is important to you) in a confined, smaller space--however, even in a small bedroom space, I not only can smell the scent sticks, but I noticeably do NOT smell the stale air odor that I bought them for. Plus, their odor is not off-putting as are many other room &#x27;fresheners.&#x27; They have a delicate scent that is pleasant and clean-smelling. Of course, they are advertised to last for up to 2 years...but, even if they had to be replaced annually or semi-annually, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> so far these are great.they have my whole house smelling so good. hope that they last 2 years like they say</li>
    <li> PLEASE do not order these sticks!  I had to hold them right up under my nose to smell them at all when I opened the package but I placed them on my kitchen counter anyway.  After just ONE week,  I couldn&#x27;t even smell them when I held them in front of my nose.  TWO of my friends had the same experience.  The claim that these darn things would last for two years is completely false!!!!!</li>
    <li> HA!!  day 2  and the scent is gone  not alone 2 years.  why do teleband co. promote products  that dont work on tv.  in reality  for this product to remotely work you might need to buy 5 of them for one room to smell the scent pass 10 min..</li>
    <li> Sticks In A Glass&lt;br /&gt;I saw this ad on tv and though if would solve my odor problem....(new product same old hype)  no good SORRY  do  you have sticks in a glass to match my décor at least I know  I am getting Sticks in a glass ......... Harold Williams</li>
    <li> this was great in getting rid of our pet odors. it is not overpowering - just subtle but really works. it helps if you keep flipping the sticks</li>
    <li> Months later still going.</li>
    <li> These are for eliminating odors, not for giving you something to sniff. If you want to sniff something, stick some scented markers up your nose. A lot of people on here are complaining that after a few days, they can&#x27;t smell them unless they hold them close to their nose. That is going to happen with anything scented because your brain/nose becomes accustomed to a scent from smelling it all day and then you don&#x27;t notice it anymore. It says in the product description that it is a LIGHT scent, which is how it should be. I don&#x27;t think most people would want a heavy scent to fill up their house year round. I have had mine for about a year and a half. I live in an RV where the septic or something else is always stinky. It has worked great for about a year. It has really kept the odors down great where nothing else could. I put them next to a fan so that might have made them wear out earlier. I took one stick out and put it in my car and my car still smells amazing every time I get in it. At the rate I was using up cheap car and home air fresheners before, I would have spent probably $50 or more in the last year and a half.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel they were worth it...barely any scent and can&#x27;t smell them at all unless my nose is right on them. Waste of $</li>
    <li> Nice scent very very very light add an oil scent that is the same scent fills the room and scent long lasting</li>
    <li> I HAVE TWO OF THESE AND MY BROTHER LIKED THEM SO MUCH HE KEPT ASKING ME WHERE I GOT THEM.  I SAW THEM HERE SO I BOUGHT HIM HIS OWN.  HE WAS TICKLED PINK.  THEY REALLY DO KEEP THEIR SMELL.  SO MUCH NEATER THAN LIQUID REED DIFFUSERS ALTHOUGH I HAVE THOSE AND CANDLES ALL OVER AS WELL.</li>
    <li> It only has a scent if you nearly stick it in your nose.  Took no odors out of the house. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Pretty and really adds freshness to the room without using a power outlet.</li>
    <li> I like , but I wish the sticks were a little more scented when you want to divide them to put a few in other rooms.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.Did not last long.Can not even smell them when walking past them.</li>
    <li> I first got it at Fry&#x27;s, and came to love it!  Now I decide to get a few more.  It absorbes odors really well--I knew it from my experience putting it in the Kitchen.  My cooking usually leaves a strong smell that would stay for a few hours.  Since I started using this product, it neutralized the air in my kitchen really well.  It does not give a strong scent, which works great for me.  I actually do not like an obvious scent in the room, but do like to eliminate odors, which this product does amazingly well.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Have had this in bathroom for about 10 days. I no longer smell the fragrance  but I  also no longer smell the strong sulfur odor associated with our water.  This is exactly what I hoped it would  do. I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a small room like a bathroom</li>
    <li> We have 3 cats and we put them in the litter box room...you can&#x27;t smell and nasty odors it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I work for an Inn and was going to try them at a wedding event in a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll have to get back to you at that time.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Scent lasted only a few days.  Not as advertised.  My spray scent lasts longer!  Waste of money and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> fragrant is weak transaction was good</li>
    <li> only works for short time looks pretty but not as effective on odors as I expected from ads</li>
    <li> Pure crap. Not anything like the ads.</li>
    <li> Bought these to be used in my bathroom and other open spaces in my home. While I did enjoy the aroma they gave off, I believe it was a bit too strong. The minute I opened the package, I was overwhelmed with the scent to the point of a migrane. Would NOT recommend smelling these things up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I was pretty disappointed with their lifespan. The package reads &amp;#34;up to 2 years&amp;#34;, but they only lasted about a week and a half before the smell was completely unnoticeable. After about a month, you would have to be extremely close up to the sticks to get any whiff of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the fragrance sticks were okay while they lasted, but I would recommend to stick to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5, would pass.</li>
    <li> I hate most of the room deodorizers I have tried. They are far too strong, annoyingly cloying, or aggravate my migraines.  These are indeed subtle - you DO have to stick your nose in them to smell them, and I LOVE that! the scent is fresh and clean but not overpowering. And Absolutely my apartment no longer smells like a locker room.  Ordering more!!</li>
    <li> I thought there would be two and extra sticks.</li>
    <li> I got these on Amazon at a really low price so I figured if they didn&#x27;t work, it was no big loss. Surprisingly, they do work better than I expected. The scent is very light and subtle (but nice), especially after the first few days, but I have noticed they do neutralize odors. I put them in a smallish room that has a somewhat musty smell from old carpeting and these sticks have helped reduce the odor by at least 75%. This isn&#x27;t a powerful air-freshener or something that puts out a constant perfumey fragrance like a plug-in, but they do seem to help reduce odors to some extent. I notice their scent, but it&#x27;s very light. I have a bad perfume allergy and these don&#x27;t bother me at all. I would likely buy more of these if I got a good price, for small rooms, bathrooms, a room where pets stay or a few in the kitchen. They don&#x27;t work miracles by any means, but I do notice a positive difference in the room I currently keep them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Scent has faded a bit after a couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t notice the linen scent at all unless I&#x27;m fairly close to where I keep them, but the room smells cleaner and odors are barely noticeable. I plan to get these again if a good deal comes up.</li>
    <li> This product made my whole house smell like linen for about two weeks but did nothing to neutralize strong odors.  It&#x27;s pretty to look at though which is the only reason it is still hanging out in my home.</li>
