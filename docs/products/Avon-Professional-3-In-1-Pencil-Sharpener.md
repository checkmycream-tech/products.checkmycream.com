<li> Sharp blade and solid construction.</li>
<li> If there&#x27;s any negative, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s not really a negative to me.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe that I put up with my last sharpener&#x27;s chunky/rough mess.</li>
<li> 2 in one for Big and small sized pencil liner.</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first due to my history of using sharpeners that do nothing but eat my eye/lip liner pencils without sharpening to a usable point at all.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t let the edge as sharp as I wanted</li>
<li> Makes the tip as sharp as you want it to be for a thinner line.</li>
<li> Other sharpeners I have tried haven&#x27;t come close to performing as well as this one.</li>
<li> The larger hole is too small for my NARS lip pencils, which are decidedly &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I kept getting eyebrow pencils, and some would work with regular sharpeners but the ones I&#x27;ve been geting lately do not, so it is great to have both sizes for all the different pencils I have been using.</li>
<li> My old Lancome sharpener started doing a terrible job, so I looked on Amazon for a new one.</li>
<li> In the past I bought my sharpener at a department store and I always thought it was too expensive.  </li>
<li> I use very thin, sharp-pointed brow pencils.</li>
<li> But you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>

    <li> perfect for keeping eyeliner and eyebrow pencils in shape.</li>
    <li> So many sharpeners are NOT sharp and ruin your lipstick or brow pencils.  This one is the exception.  It sharpens cleanly and doesn&#x27;t break your product.  Good Job</li>
    <li> This makes my pencil eyeliner way better to use. Makes the tip as sharp as you want it to be for a thinner line.</li>

    <li> OK; bit doesn&#x27;t cut larger cosmetic pencils!</li>
    <li> Removable ring in larger sharpener helped me sharpen my larger chella high lighter pencil. I have no complaints. It got the job done. The blades not dull and my pencils did not break during sharpening.</li>
    <li> Doesnt fit the large crayon products</li>
    <li> I kept getting eyebrow pencils, and some would work with regular sharpeners but the ones I&#x27;ve been geting lately do not, so it is great to have both sizes for all the different pencils I have been using.</li>
    <li> Not even compatible with a regular pensil</li>
    <li> The larger hole is too small for my NARS lip pencils, which are decidedly &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;.  Otherwise, works great.</li>
    <li> Best sharpener for my eyeliners!</li>
    <li> I have wispy, fine-hair blonde brows.  I use very thin, sharp-pointed brow pencils. This sharpener works well on those pencils.</li>
    <li> This is the best sharpener I have ever purchased! Sharpens perfectly and with only a few turns. Other sharpeners I have tried haven&#x27;t come close to performing as well as this one. I was skeptical at first due to my history of using sharpeners that do nothing but eat my eye/lip liner pencils without sharpening to a usable point at all. But you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I lost a very good small sharpener and could not find  another in eye-makeup stores-this is very useful and stays sharp.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Probably get it much cheaper at dollar store though!</li>
    <li> There are three sizes on this sharpener. I use Avon&#x27;s Big Color Pencil for eye shadow, and Mac eyeliner for under eye. This sharpener works for both. I&#x27;ve had these sharpeners before, and the blades wear out. I wanted to be sure this sharpener would be the same as I&#x27;ve bought directly from Avon. It is, so next time I&#x27;ll purchase two.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Sharpens all of my Avon fat pencils that no other sharpener will fit, love it.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a sharpener. What I like is the two different sizes. If there&#x27;s any negative, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s not really a negative to me.</li>
    <li> Totally excited to see the sharpener would perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can not wait to use in the future ! Thank you Avon!</li>
    <li> My old Lancome sharpener started doing a terrible job, so I looked on Amazon for a new one. I was surprised at how beautifully this Avon products works! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fits 3 different size pencils and  does a good job sharpening.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sharpener for use with a BE eyeliner pencil and it works great! It sharpens well without taking off too much and wasting the color.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no bottom to this pencil sharpener so the shavings just fall out.</li>
    <li> been using it for several weeks and it is easy to carry  , super sharp  and work perfectly for me! i love it very much</li>
    <li> Sharp blade and solid construction. Very pleased with consistent performance. I can&#x27;t believe that I put up with my last sharpener&#x27;s chunky/rough mess.</li>
    <li> Good enough! It doesn&#x27;t let the edge as sharp as I wanted but it&#x27;s almost perfect! :)</li>
    <li> This one doesn&#x27;t wreck my pencils!</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> No suggestions for improvement.</li>
    <li> Used it as soon as I received it and immediately used it for my eye liner and eye brow pencil.  It worked great and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I had tried to use a regular pencil sharpener and it only grinded up the tips of my eye liner and eye brow pencil.  In the past I bought my sharpener at a department store and I always thought it was too expensive.  The Avon Professional 3 In 1 Pencil Sharpener is not only great in sharpening my liner and pencil, the cost was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I like this sharpener a lot.  It covers all sizes of makeup pencils. Very glad I found it.</li>
