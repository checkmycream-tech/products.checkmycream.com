### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!  </li>
      <li>Use of this plus taking some ibuprofen and skipping caffeine before the wax will be your best bet for pain reduction.</li>
      <li>A++, AWESOME!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST numbing product yet!</li>
      <li>Anyway, I use it every month and it has lasted a year, good investment.</li>
      <li>This product has 5% Lidocaine and is truly effective.</li>
      <li>and I liked it</li>
      <li>I like this one better because:  1)</li>
      <li>each time we both agreed that the orajel worked better.</li>
      <li>Tried applying more</li>
      <li>As it is, it didn&#x27;t make my waxing experience any more bearable</li>
      <li>I was very excited to buy this and tried it as soon as I received it</li>
      <li>It was the first of its kind I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
      <li>The numb-it worked to some degree but orajel is much cheaper, easily accessible, and more effective.</li>
      <li>This product is a huge breakthrough concept in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Your wax won&#x27;t be pain free, it will still hurt.  </li>
      <li>I applied it as directed about 15 minutes before my waxing and was PLEASANTLY surprised at how effective it was.  </li>
      <li>This definitely completely numbed the area, and made my waxing in sensitive places MUCH more tolerable!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth every penny to have a pain-free wax.</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would help relieve some pain of more sensitive areas associated with a brazillian.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product at a waxing boutique right before I got a brazillian.  </li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t pain-free for me and my right leg did hurt more than the left for some reason-</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get waxed but can&#x27;t stand the pain!</li>
      <li>I picked this up on a recommendation from the book by Women&#x27;s Health, Look Better Naked.  </li>
      <li>This really took the sting out of the bikini wax, and I&#x27;m going to be a product user for life!</li>
      <li>I used it in conjunction with a MOOM sugaring kit, and I can tell you my DIY waxing adventure was a positive one.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have as much of an effect as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>nothing changed really.</li>
      <li>After using it a few times I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s just as effective,</li>
      <li>The directions call for multiple applications to area; however, I did not find that necessary for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>I even use a tiny dab on my upper lip or eyebrows now because it&#x27;s so effective.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that absorbs fast and easily instead of a grainy white cream that needs to be rubbed in for a while to absorb.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone that plans to wax, get a tattoo, get a piercing, or have any type of treatment where numbing the location is beneficial.</li>
      <li>the new product works like a charm.</li>
      <li>so I purchased a new bottle.</li>
      <li>After I got waxed for the first time I decided I definitely needed something to take the edge off.</li>
      <li>I self-wax using professional salon equipment and products at home.</li>
      <li>honestly do not believe this stuff is strong enough to make any difference.</li>
      <li>if not more effective only a few minutes after applying it.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is small but the product is powerful.</li>

<li> I prefer being more numb!!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t numb all the way, bit definitely takes the edge off.</li>
<li> So I bought an epilator .... which is extremely painful to use on areas that have never been previously waxed or lasered.</li>
<li> Seriously, its wasting of money. :(</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t numb at all.</li>
<li> so I got some and also the numb-</li>
<li> Doesnt work, doesnt numb at all.</li>
<li> No product is going to get you completely numb - unless it a prescription costing in the $80 range.</li>

    <li> Yes, it takes the edge of my waxing treatment. No product is going to get you completely numb - unless it a prescription costing in the $80 range. Anyway, I use it every month and it has lasted a year, good investment.</li>
    <li> This product is a huge breakthrough concept in my opinion. It was the first of its kind I&#x27;ve ever tried and now I can&#x27;t go back to waxing without it. I was introduced to it by aesthetician had me try it before a bikini wax and the places that I used it had NO pain!!  I&#x27;ve used this and \\&quot;No Scream Cream\\&quot; by Relax and Wax and this one is my preferred one, although they both work. I like this one better because:  1) It&#x27;s a clear gel that absorbs fast and easily instead of a grainy white cream that needs to be rubbed in for a while to absorb.  2) It works fast, within a few minutes, so you can just take it with you to the salon and rub it on before they start.  3) It numbs deeper and lasts longer  I even use a tiny dab on my upper lip or eyebrows now because it&#x27;s so effective.  It&#x27;s well worth every penny to have a pain-free wax. Even if you don&#x27;t get pain-free because everyone&#x27;s different so maybe it won&#x27;t numb you completely, it will definitely help and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I followed all the instructions but the same amount of pain nothing changed really. maybe it is just not for me</li>
    <li> After I got waxed for the first time I decided I definitely needed something to take the edge off. Someone mentioned that orajel helps with the pain so I got some and also the numb-it pre-wax treatment. My friend and I compared both of these products on various parts of our body (arms, legs, and bikini area)and each time we both agreed that the orajel worked better. The numb-it worked to some degree but orajel is much cheaper, easily accessible, and more effective.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a recommendation from the book by Women&#x27;s Health, Look Better Naked.  I used it in conjunction with a MOOM sugaring kit, and I can tell you my DIY waxing adventure was a positive one.  This really took the sting out of the bikini wax, and I&#x27;m going to be a product user for life!</li>
    <li> Worth it. Anyone who&#x27;s gone through the pain of having their lady parts waxed knows beauty comes at a price. The bottle is small but the product is powerful. I applied it as directed about 15 minutes before my waxing and was PLEASANTLY surprised at how effective it was.  As always, letting the hair get to a longer length helps minimize pain and an aleve or asprin will help with redness/swelling.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get waxed but can&#x27;t stand the pain!</li>
    <li> So I bought an epilator .... which is extremely painful to use on areas that have never been previously waxed or lasered. So I HAD to find some pain relief in order to use it on my legs. This stuff definitely takes the edge off- it wasn&#x27;t pain-free for me and my right leg did hurt more than the left for some reason- but it&#x27;s a VAST improvement over doing it without anything. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a waxing boutique right before I got a brazillian.  They instructed me to wait 10-15 minutes for the numbing to take effect.  After using it a few times I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s just as effective, if not more effective only a few minutes after applying it.  Personally I don&#x27;t think it lasts 30 minutes.  Your wax won&#x27;t be pain free, it will still hurt.  I think it works well on the bikini line and surrounding areas. I was hoping it would help relieve some pain of more sensitive areas associated with a brazillian.  It helped a little, but I was still bracing myself. The overall numbing effect will differ for every person.  Use of this plus taking some ibuprofen and skipping caffeine before the wax will be your best bet for pain reduction.</li>
    <li> The NUMB-IT cap popped off, I guess it worked although?&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not believe this stuff is strong enough to make any difference.</li>
    <li> I tested this on my arm to insure no irritation. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much. The bottle says no sale on amazon, so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to buy this and tried it as soon as I received it but it didn&#x27;t numb at all. Tried applying more but it still did not work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t numb all the way, bit definitely takes the edge off.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Used for leg wax..i followed all the instructions ....it.still HURT when I got the wax done!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use a different product!</li>
    <li> I got this product and the lady that did the waxing applied it per the instructions, but it didn&#x27;t help at all. No numbing.</li>
    <li> A++, AWESOME! This was a 1st time purchase, but it will NOT be my last. I highly recommend this for anyone that plans to wax, get a tattoo, get a piercing, or have any type of treatment where numbing the location is beneficial. I self-wax using professional salon equipment and products at home. This is the BEST numbing product yet! I previously used PFNumbit liquid drops (discontinued). This product has 5% Lidocaine and is truly effective. Simply apply 1 coat generously (thick) to area, and wait. The directions call for multiple applications to area; however, I did not find that necessary for it to be effective. This definitely completely numbed the area, and made my waxing in sensitive places MUCH more tolerable!! Why suffer the pain?, when this product can take the sting of the situation!</li>
    <li> I had been given a sample of this product to try that was at the end of its expiration period and I liked it so I purchased a new bottle. Let me tell you this...the new product works like a charm. I actually use it closer to 20-30 minutes prior and can definitely tell the difference though it works using it 10-15 minutes prior to treatment. I prefer being more numb!!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work, doesnt numb at all. I got it just because waxing is too painful,but......with this gel it was even more painful. Seriously, its wasting of money. :(</li>
    <li> I followed all instructions and after I used it, it only slightly dulled the pain. It didn&#x27;t have as much of an effect as I thought it would. I didn&#x27;t expect complete numbing, but I expected it to numb more than it did. As it is, it didn&#x27;t make my waxing experience any more bearable so I tossed this.</li>
    <li> I have had many waxes and was looking for something to make them less painful. After reading the reviews I decided on this product. I applied it as directed before my wax and noticed no difference in the level of pain. I threw away the rest of the bottle.</li>
