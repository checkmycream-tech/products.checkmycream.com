      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>swear I&#x27;ve tried more than I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>it comes to using makeup, I love love LOVE using Two Faced Beauty Balm on top of the Faux Tan Face.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair naturally, and this me gives a very healthy glow.</li>
      <li>Great natural tanner &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
      <li>love this tan lotion it does not streak and makes my skin healthy looking instead of looking like casper the friendly ghost sister...</li>
      <li>It knocks off the white for sure, which is great, but doesn&#x27;t give a glow.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to apply and has never made my face streaky.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Went on easily without any streaking.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday, and best of all-</li>
      <li>So far very satisfied</li>
      <li>Rich in bronze tones, not orange.</li>
      <li>I have tried several Sunless Tanners and this is by far the very best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and natural.</li>
      <li>After two or three applications I reach the full effect of the product.</li>
      <li>Dries really quick, which is a plus.  </li>
      <li>My face is super oily, and I can develop some pimples on my forehead and chin.</li>
      <li>It gives great color, but it doesn&#x27;t look unnaturally dark or orangey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the morning to add some much needed color to my fair skin, and it gives me almost instant color.  </li>
      <li>This product does a nice job of making my face the same color of my body without being orange.</li>
      <li>and it left a nice sun-kissed tone.</li>
      <li>Go for it if you want a natural safe tan.</li>
      <li>If your not dry you would probably be ok to just apply tje faux tan and nothing else.</li>
      <li>We must become more aware of not only what we put in our bodies but also on our bodies.</li>
      <li>I have used Amazon for years and this is the first review I ever wrote.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m SUPER apprehensive about putting new products on my face.</li>
      <li>Will be using this for a long time :)</li>
      <li>and I have dry skin on top of that.</li>
      <li>and I wake up looking really refreshed.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re going swimming or plan to wash your face, the color will not stay on very well.  </li>
      <li>It only says apply to clean skin.</li>
      <li>Also, it does come off very slightly when I wash my face, so I have to apply it more often</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look overly tan at all, gives a very natural color, you&#x27;d never know I applied a sunless tanner.  </li>
      <li>The color is super dark, and looks very unnatural on the skin.</li>
      <li>One complaint is that it seems to only last maybe a day or two at most; seems to wash off easily.  </li>
      <li>SO NATURAL!</li>
      <li>(I put my toner on first, then spot treatment for the spots that I tend to break out in, THEN the tanner on top of that after those other items have dried)  </li>
      <li>it is clear.  </li>
      <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star&#x27;s is it wasn&#x27;t clear on how to use it.</li>
      <li>The toner causes me to not develop a natural tan on my face.</li>
      <li>but it really does look like i just got back from the beach.</li>
      <li>Nearly all of them make me look orange or even yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Except</li>
      <li>Does not make my sensitive face break out.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a loud smell or odor.  </li>
      <li>a bit hard to get off of skin on hands, but it is a very natural looking tan and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>My face is very acne prone and although I have not used it long it does not make my skin feel greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>Overall though, it won&#x27;t break the bank, it does the job, and it&#x27;s definitely a product that I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Tryed several times and kno several people bought it same thing with tnem very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not to heavy on face and no artificial looking color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not going to make you brown right away; the name is GRADUAL tan, so it darkens over a few hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely dry where I live</li>
      <li>Have been using sunless tanners since I was a teenager and usually my sisters make fun of me for being orange.  </li>

<li> Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not to heavy on face and no artificial looking color.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not going to make you brown right away; the name is GRADUAL tan, so it darkens over a few hours.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely dry where I live</li>
<li> Have been using sunless tanners since I was a teenager and usually my sisters make fun of me for being orange.  </li>
<li> This Bare Minerals has very little odor, goes on without streaks if applied properly and leaves a natural looking tan.</li>
<li> I was a little concerned with using this product at first since I break out easily and was afraid it would leave my face looking streaky.</li>
<li> The color is very good, but it made me get a horrible break out.</li>
<li> This self tanner is not natural looking at all.</li>
<li> I put it on after the tanner has had a chance to dry up.</li>
<li> What I do is wash and exfoliate my face, apply the faux tan and let it dry for 10 minutes then go ahead witn the rest of my night time routine.</li>
<li> It does stain your fingers slightly, but the color is gone later on.</li>
<li> I have yellow undertones, so i was a little nervous how this would turn out..</li>
<li> only downfall of this is it comes off when I rub toner on it with a cotton round</li>
<li> It has to be reapplied almost every morning or every other morning.  </li>
<li> My other big complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t provide a GLOW that I would like to have.  </li>
<li> The cream is dark, so that helps you apply it evenly.  </li>
<li> then I apply fake tan to my body, but the color does stay very well.</li>
<li> I put it on usually in the morning, let it dry for about 5 minutes then make up on over it.</li>
<li> It has a little bit of a odor but also seems to go away.  </li>
<li> This is the only face tanner that I have ever used that hasn&#x27;t broken me out.</li>
<li> Mixing the two caused a few break out spots.</li>
<li> I wear it year round</li>
<li> (but I&#x27;ve learned to just dab if I want to keep the brown-ness and less comes off!) and scrub in the shower.</li>
<li> Use very little so it lasts too.</li>
<li> Not satisfied at all.....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a bit hard to get off of skin on hands, but it is a very natural looking tan and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> For years I swore by Mary Kay sunless tanner until they changed the formual.  I searched online and found this product had great review.  It is green in color when you apply, which was weird but you can see where it is going and once rubbed into your skin it is clear.  Dries really quick, which is a plus.  It has a little bit of a odor but also seems to go away.  Nice broze color.</li>
    <li> This Bare Minerals has very little odor, goes on without streaks if applied properly and leaves a natural looking tan. I have tried several Sunless Tanners and this is by far the very best. A++++++ It outscores Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess, Clinique&#x27;s Sunless Tanner, Neutragena, St. Tropez etc..... Go for it if you want a natural safe tan.</li>
    <li> SO NATURAL! Best I have ever used. Rich in bronze tones, not orange. Will recommend to friends and reorder for myself!</li>
    <li> My face is very acne prone and although I have not used it long it does not make my skin feel greasy or sticky. Went on easily without any streaking.  It&#x27;s suppose to create a gradual tan but I saw results right away, although I have a very fair complexion.  So far very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the only face tanner that I have ever used that hasn&#x27;t broken me out. It gives great color, but it doesn&#x27;t look unnaturally dark or orangey. After two or three applications I reach the full effect of the product. I am extremely fair naturally, and this me gives a very healthy glow. Also, it does come off very slightly when I wash my face, so I have to apply it more often then I apply fake tan to my body, but the color does stay very well. I put it on at night, it darkens overnight, and in the morning I have a wonderful tan! Totally beats laying out in the sun for hours!</li>
    <li> Great natural tanner &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the change when I use it</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned with using this product at first since I break out easily and was afraid it would leave my face looking streaky. However, I used it for a week and it didn&#x27;t make me break out which was awesome and it left a nice sun-kissed tone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I actually bought this at Sephora, but wanted to leave a review here, too. I don&#x27;t write too many, but you have got to try this!! I have yellow undertones, so i was a little nervous how this would turn out.. but it really does look like i just got back from the beach. It evens out my skin tone, too. I only need to wear some concealer under my eyes..don&#x27;t have to bother with bronzer. I&#x27;ve been putting it on before bed and I wake up looking really refreshed. LOVE IT!! Will be using this for a long time :)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does not smell or stain your clothes.  Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> There is oil in this produce. The color is very good, but it made me get a horrible break out.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is not natural looking at all. The color is super dark, and looks very unnatural on the skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like getting sun on my face but I love laying in the sun (with sunscreen of course). But its always scary to me to use faux tanning products on my face. This product does a nice job of making my face the same color of my body without being orange. It&#x27;s nice and natural. It&#x27;s also nice in the winter months to give you the nice sun kissed glow. Its easy to apply and has never made my face streaky. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star&#x27;s is it wasn&#x27;t clear on how to use it. Example, with no moisture etc. It only says apply to clean skin. What I do is wash and exfoliate my face, apply the faux tan and let it dry for 10 minutes then go ahead witn the rest of my night time routine. It&#x27;s extremely dry where I live and I have dry skin on top of that. If your not dry you would probably be ok to just apply tje faux tan and nothing else.</li>
    <li> love this tan lotion it does not streak and makes my skin healthy looking instead of looking like casper the friendly ghost sister...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!  Price was cheaper than anywhere else I looked and exceeds all of my expectations!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner around!</li>
    <li> No need to wear makeup when you use this!</li>
    <li> This product almost instantly tans my face.  It doesn&#x27;t streak or splotch if you rub it in well.  The cream is dark, so that helps you apply it evenly.  It doesn&#x27;t have a loud smell or odor.  I&#x27;ve used it in the morning to add some much needed color to my fair skin, and it gives me almost instant color.  It doesn&#x27;t look overly tan at all, gives a very natural color, you&#x27;d never know I applied a sunless tanner.  It&#x27;s a brown tone, not orange.  I&#x27;ve been using it during winter, and it doesn&#x27;t look weird at all.  One complaint is that it seems to only last maybe a day or two at most; seems to wash off easily.  The color doesn&#x27;t last for days like some sunless tanners.  So if you&#x27;re going swimming or plan to wash your face, the color will not stay on very well.  It has to be reapplied almost every morning or every other morning.  My other big complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t provide a GLOW that I would like to have.  It knocks off the white for sure, which is great, but doesn&#x27;t give a glow.  I prefer the Tarte Brazilliance self tanning face towelettes because somehow these wipes actually provide a glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all..... in fact would like my money back. If u have any any small blemish goes darker looks awfull. Tryed several times and kno several people bought it same thing with tnem very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The best facial self-tanner I have used.</li>
    <li> Okay. I&#x27;m BIG into self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I swear I&#x27;ve tried more than I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly? Nearly all of them make me look orange or even yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Except this tanner by Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yellow undertones in my skin. I can take a highlighter and draw on myself and it kind of blends in from time to time. This tanner actually left my skin looking BROWN instead of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m prone to breaking out. My face is super oily, and I can develop some pimples on my forehead and chin. I HAVE to use a toner every day or else I&#x27;ll find spots. The toner causes me to not develop a natural tan on my face. And I&#x27;m SUPER apprehensive about putting new products on my face. This is where Faux Tan Face comes into play;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is tinted. So you can tell where you&#x27;re putting it. (And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either!) It&#x27;s not going to make you brown right away; the name is GRADUAL tan, so it darkens over a few hours. I use this in place of my face moisturizer if I want to brown up. Mixing the two caused a few break out spots. (I put my toner on first, then spot treatment for the spots that I tend to break out in, THEN the tanner on top of that after those other items have dried)  But using the tanner alone as my facial moisturizer hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to using makeup, I love love LOVE using Two Faced Beauty Balm on top of the Faux Tan Face. I put it on after the tanner has had a chance to dry up. It helps even out the tanner and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall of this is it comes off when I rub toner on it with a cotton round (but I&#x27;ve learned to just dab if I want to keep the brown-ness and less comes off!) and scrub in the shower. Overall though, it won&#x27;t break the bank, it does the job, and it&#x27;s definitely a product that I highly recommend! I know I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Product does what it says. Goes on easily. Does not make my sensitive face break out. This is the only self tanner I have found that works well and does not make me break out. It does stain your fingers slightly, but the color is gone later on. I never notice that the stain stays. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff.  I wear it year round and people always ask if I&#x27;ve been on vacation!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Not to heavy on face and no artificial looking color.  I am happy with the product. Use very little so it lasts too.</li>
    <li> awesome!  always have in my beauty collection!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Amazon for years and this is the first review I ever wrote.  Had to share how awesome this product is.  Have been using sunless tanners since I was a teenager and usually my sisters make fun of me for being orange.  This product leaves you bronzed and infact now I get compliments from them and everyone all day!  Make sure you exfoliate before. I put it on usually in the morning, let it dry for about 5 minutes then make up on over it. You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday, and best of all- this product HAS NO PARABENS, artificial oils and fragrance.  We must become more aware of not only what we put in our bodies but also on our bodies. Would recommend this with no reservation!</li>
