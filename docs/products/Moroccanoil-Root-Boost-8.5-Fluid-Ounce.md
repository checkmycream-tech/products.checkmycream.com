      <li>I have fine and frizzy hair, but this product gives shine and bounce.</li>
      <li>it smells fabulous</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews touting the great smell...but it over powers any other hair product that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my new favorite product!</li>
      <li>Very light for my fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>This product smells great and does not weigh down  my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It also helps to hold my style better without as much hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Use it at night, my hair in a knot and in the morning full, shiny hair.</li>
      <li>i will likely use it only when i need hair not to move, but for every day use i have found another product that works best for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - it really helps my fine hair, and the price was much better than at my local salon.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have really been able to use a product and tell that it has made a difference.  </li>
      <li>It really works well at giving me the fullness that I need for my fine hair.  </li>

      <li>I have very fine straight hair and live in humid condiitions.  </li>

      <li>now i can just do it every other day, and my hair still looks good.  </li>
      <li>I suggest using it on the under portions of hair and use it sparingly until you figure out the right amount for you.</li>
      <li>If you use the right shampoo/conditioner, like a volumizing or clarifying set</li>
      <li>and I got it quickly and reasonably priced</li>
      <li>AND I don&#x27;t have to use very much of this product to  achieve this miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I actually like the Oribe products better.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Product is truly lightweight but offers fantastic lift and hold.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says......</li>
      <li>I love this product, it helps my flat hair have some volume.</li>
      <li>It sprays on easily and makes hair easy to style with a round brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for creating volume for my hair...it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for me to tolerate the strong scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  I actually like the Oribe products better.</li>
    <li> It feels like regular old hairspray.  For the feel it leaves in my hair, I could have just gone to the store and gotten a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Sort of works but can make hair look greasy. I wish it is unscented, the perfume in it smells like old lady perfume. Unscented would make it a better product because the smell is really annoying. Product is way overpriced! I won&#x27;t purchase again due to perfume stink and price.</li>
    <li> Great for boosting  hair with no body.  Smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> if you need dry shampoo this is THE ONE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff but doesn&#x27;t give me the volume that Catwalk does. Still, it&#x27;s a respectable product, and I love the other two Moroccanoil products I use.</li>
    <li> This is another great product by Moroccanoil.  It does exactly what it says......Sprayed close to your roots, it lifts your hair.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says. I have complex hair in that it is fine and thin yet curly and frizzy on the ends so I have begun to try these products after my daughter mentioned them because I have begun using a curling wand on my hair. This stuff adds amazing volume and the smell! It&#x27;s heavenly....so much so that it actually boosts my mood. Since I&#x27;ve tried this, the medium hold hairspray and oil, you will have to pry it from my cold dead hands!</li>
    <li> Works great on my very fine hair. Gives it fullness and body. It&#x27;s a bit pricey; but,  because my hair is so fine take on a little and so a bottle lasts a long while.</li>
    <li> Great product but expensive for the item.  Smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Too much artificial fragrance in this product...I&#x27;ve read many reviews touting the great smell...but it over powers any other hair product that I have ever used.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for creating volume for my hair...it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for me to tolerate the strong scent.  The Root Boost also dispenses a very cold, bubbly, thin line.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and ordering it online!</li>
    <li> If you have not tried this product, you really need to. It works great and best of all it smells fabulous</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have fine, soft, thin hair.  When I use this with the volumizing mousse, I have more workable hair.  This is the first time I have really been able to use a product and tell that it has made a difference.  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It gives me a bit of hold and almost eliminates the need for dry shampoo 2nd day (if I get that far without washing). I find I don&#x27;t have to flat iron - the bit of boost and hold I get from it seems to tame the frizzies too and my hair just generally looks more polished and styled just from adding this little step before my lazy blowdry.</li>
    <li> This product definitely delivers volume but I do think you need to pick the days you use it as over time it will dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> volume was great but the formula made my face break out.</li>
    <li> I never had good luck with any mousse because they&#x27;re always too heavy for my very fine, limp hair.  Moroccanoil root boost is very light and smells fantastic.  It gives me the volume I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> I love the body this product provides. It does, however, leave somewhat of a dry feeling. I suggest using it on the under portions of hair and use it sparingly until you figure out the right amount for you.</li>
    <li> I had returned the first can because the foam wasn&#x27;t thick enough.  Then, I received a second one but the foam also isn&#x27;t thick enough. My hairdresser had used one on my hair so I knew what it is supposed to be like..</li>
    <li> Works well for styling.</li>
    <li> Very light for my fine straight hair. Good lift and not sticky, smell is weird to me though. Very expensive</li>
    <li> This product is the something I have been looking for to hold my style, and I think I have found it in Moroccanoil Root Boost for volume!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a product I use and I got it quickly and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Oil first on my hair when it&#x27;s wet - then apply the volumizing mousse, then the root boost.  It really works well at giving me the fullness that I need for my fine hair.  It also helps to hold my style better without as much hair spray.  I also use the Moroccan Oil Spray - just a little hold a few unruly strands in place.  It&#x27;s the best that I have found for my fine hair.  Also like it because I can still run my brush thru my hair without  breaking my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing but it weighs my fine and thin hair down. It also makes my hair noticeably more oily by the end of the day. I wish it worked for my hair better.</li>
    <li> OK, but not as good as the mousse.  I&#x27;ll stick with the mousse from now on. Doesn&#x27;t have the wonderful Moroccanoil fragrance that makes your hair smell lovely.</li>
    <li> love love love this has truly made my hair so much better!!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil products! I use the shampoo, conditioner, root boost, mask, hair spray, heat spray, and oil. I like to layer the products to extend the scent. This product smells great and does not weigh down  my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this, use it every other day and it make my hair look fuller. I have a ton of fine to medium hair so it gives my hair some thickness and helps hold the curl from the curling iron. If you use the right shampoo/conditioner, like a volumizing or clarifying set you may be able to go between washes. My hair tends to look oily sooner because it doesn&#x27;t have the super thick texture to hide it, this buys me some time between washes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hair, like most root lifters do.  Really works, and smells great too.</li>
    <li> Best  volumizer I have ever used. Ii am a senior whose hair is not as thick as it used to be and very fine. This works great without adding weight to the hair.</li>
    <li> Product is truly lightweight but offers fantastic lift and hold. There is no sticky or dirty look to your hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Gives hair more texture and makes it easier to style and hold!!</li>
    <li> Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but for my hair this is the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used. Gives my thick but very straight, fine hair great volume. Smells good. Easy to work with, not sticky. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I thought it was.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used this product - it speaks for itself</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It works well and smells amazing. It&#x27;s lightweight and totally does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It&#x27;s my favorite hair product!</li>
    <li> This stuff really gives me the volume that I want and I LOVE the smell too</li>
    <li> Great Product and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> While I love Moroccanoil products, this one is not my favorite.  I have baby fine, highlighted hair.  This product tends to make my hair sticky and not give it quite as much volume as I would like.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, bought this. Use it at night, my hair in a knot and in the morning full, shiny hair. Thank you</li>
    <li> It works just as described.  Smell is a little different than expected based on other Morroccanoil products, but still nice.</li>
    <li> Like this product I have thin hair  and live in the 98 degree weather.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it helps my flat hair have some volume. It does get a little sticky/oily after sleeping so I wish it lasted a little longer. Would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have very VERY fine thin wispy hair.  It would lay so flat against my head that you could see my scalp through my hair !  NO MORE!  This product is absolutely a miracle for me.  After I wash my hair, I towel dry it, hold up sections and give each section  a quick (light) spray of this foaming product at the root end only (concentrating at the top, upper sides and and upper back sections)---comb through and blow dry (lifting and curling with my Moroccan Oil 55mm Round Brush---also another great item available on Amazon).  Even the second day (after sleeping on it), my hair remains poofy, with so much volume that I STILL CAN&#x27;T see my scalp through my hair----it&#x27;s like I have twice as much hair as without this product!  AND I don&#x27;t have to use very much of this product to  achieve this miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is stiff or gunky feeling after using this product.  My hair moves naturally and does not feel or act like it&#x27;s been coated (unlike the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products, which made my hair feel coated with an entire can of hairspray).</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful!!!  But it also works better than anything I have used. My hairstylist used it on me and it made a difference. Holds the lift longer.</li>
    <li> This product adds a lot of volume and texture to my very fine, thin hair.  It smells fantastic, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it dull-looking. . . All around a great product.  I can&#x27;t imagine going without it now!</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The best product I have found to give workable volume and shine to my fine hair. I highly recommend it. It sprays on easily and makes hair easy to style with a round brush. No stickiness or tackiness,</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Product came with broken cap. Other than that, it was fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the salon for closer to $30.  It was recommended by my stylists and really worked well and held up for the entire day.  The product smells amazing and it&#x27;s my new favorite product!</li>
    <li> Superb product line with a clean &amp; fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best for fine hair. Keeps body in your hair all day! You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> really gave my hair body</li>
    <li> I am typically a big advocate of Moroccanoil products but this time, not so much. It does not leave my hair as run your fingers through wonderful as i was hoping. Very firm/strong holding product. i will likely use it only when i need hair not to move, but for every day use i have found another product that works best for my hair.</li>
    <li> Just received this and used it.  As with all Moroccanoil products, it did not disappoint.  I love the volume and silky smooth texture of this product..  No crunch, no stickiness, nothing.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Recieved the items very quickly. I have very fine straight hair and live in humid condiitions.  This product was average help at home but I frequently visit a dryer part of the state where it was great!  It is definitly in my travel bag!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a broken cap, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Most excellent for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine and frizzy hair, but this product gives shine and bounce. It isn&#x27;t sticky nor does it leave my hair stiff.</li>
    <li> MAKES MY HAIR FEEL NICE AND THICK AND SMELLS WONDERFUL! BUYING MORE NOW...WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT...LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products over the years &amp; am usually disappointed.  I hesitated with Moroccan Oil due to the word &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; because I have fine thin hair.  I was afraid this would weight my hair down.  I have to say, I LOVE IT!!  It doesn&#x27;t take much for my hair at all &amp; it does give it a nice lift that stays, even in Memphis&#x27; humidity!!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works for me I think you will like it  if you try it</li>
    <li> i am addicted to this product.  using moroccanoil for shampoo and conditioner and root boost and hairspray.  i used to have to wash my hair every day.  now i can just do it every other day, and my hair still looks good.  i love this stuff.</li>
    <li> The Moroccanoil root boost for fine to medium hair works very well without being overly heavy or oily.  provides nice shine and balance.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this. It made my hair feel like their was product in it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - it really helps my fine hair, and the price was much better than at my local salon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair voluminous for days.  I love this product.  I have really long hair and I need a little help with the bump on top.  This product does it.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair body and control.  It volumizes your hair.</li>
    <li> Gives me the boost I need!!</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair (short bob type style) and could not live without this stuff!!!! Pretty expensive but my last bottle lasted 8 months!</li>
    <li> WORKS WODERFULLY.  I HAVE RECEIVED LOTS OF COMPLEMENTS.</li>
    <li> a debt in the can but it seems to work</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered on time</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST for giving your hair lift!!!  I have very short hair, but insist on styling it everyday.  Just shake up, part your wet hair, wherever you need a little extra boost, squirt product on hairline, and style as usual.  I have tried practically every root boosting product out there, and finally was introduced to Moroccanoil Root Boost by my hairdresser.  I will not use anything else.  This product delivers!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives my fine hair great lift</li>
