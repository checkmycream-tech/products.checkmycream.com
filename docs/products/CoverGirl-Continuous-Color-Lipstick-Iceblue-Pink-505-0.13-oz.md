<li> Just what I expected and have used for years.&lt;br</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s frosted.</li>
<li> I just add a slightly darker shade underneath.</li>
<li> It is extremely moisturizing and is a luscious consistency!!  </li>
<li> I had a hard time finding this color.</li>
<li> It is hard to find in the stores</li>
<li> I try other lipsticks, but ALWAYS return to Cover Girl Continuous Color lipsticks!!!!</li>
<li> So sorry, it has been discontinued.</li>

    <li> A really great color. Not to light and not to dark. Perfect for those who do not like a really dark or really light lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shade of pink but much too pink for an old lady like me.  I like the smoothness of the lipstick, it makes my lips feel very soft.  The only reason I rated it with 3 stars is because of the color.  My bad; I needed to get a darker shade.</li>
    <li> This is the best shade for me.  I get compliments all the time time.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon site.  The texture of the lipstick is not sticky and lasts.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this shade and brand for my Mom, since Covergirl stopped putting it on the shelves in stores. Mom was happy to have her shade of lipstick back. Very happy with the color and who makes it, and that it could be found on Amazon. Thanks for making my Mom happy!</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere and here it was. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My grandmother has loved this color for years.  I&#x27;m just glad it is still in production.  Seems like everything she likes goes out of style!  Phew.  Thanks CoverGirl!!</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent shipping, thank you</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for years. It not only is the perfect shade for me, it is the perfect texture. So sorry, it has been discontinued. I now have 5 full tubes of this shade, 505.

    <li> Why would they take such a wonderful color and product off the market. I was so lucky&lt;br /&gt;to have found the product at Amazon.com I ordered 5 tubes. I love this color and receive&lt;br /&gt;a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Just a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  The price is right and can&#x27;t beat the staying power!  Will continue to buy.  Great brand!  Always reliable.</li>
    <li> It is my favourite  colour and I have used it for so many years and couldn&#x27;t find for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Why cover girl does not have this on the shelf is beyond me. The greatest color ever. Always great with a tan and in a picture!! Wake up cover girl!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this color in any of the local stores anymore, so I consistently buy it online. Great spring and summer color, and for fall and winter I just add a slightly darker shade underneath. Such a smooth and long-lasting lipstick. Love it.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s frosted. I don&#x27;t think frosted lipstick looks good on women my age, 53. It&#x27;s a very pretty pink though and I think it would look really cute on a young girl.</li>
