### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very good Amazon!</li>
      <li>VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
      <li>so I was very happy when seeing them on Amazon!</li>
      <li>It works great with these pads that are sold seperately.</li>
      <li>Also, you can attach skin-cleaning pads of any kind onto the head!</li>
      <li>THIS IS JUST AS GOOD</li>
      <li>Good genes or Netrogena?</li>
      <li>I love this article!</li>
      <li>This thing is fantastic and my face feels so good after I use it.  </li>
      <li>While the Mia is an effective cleanser, is cutely packaged, and comes in at around $130+, it is the Wave that I use more often.  </li>
      <li>What makes them attractive to me is they produce a ton of nicely scented lather while cleansing and delivering an extremely gentle form of exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I knew the product and was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love the Wave.</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>I am inclined to say that my skin is better since I have been using these pads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You can feel the vibrations penetrating deeply and it feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.  </li>
      <li>I use acne pads and moisturizing pads most of the time, and the rest of the time I use the Neutrogena pads (which treat acne, clean skin and moisturize).</li>
      <li>THE DOVE FACE CLEANER WAS CHEAP</li>
      <li>Buying them here was more economical than purchasing them in a store.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel fresh, clean, and soft, and when I&#x27;m finished, my skin positively glows--not to mention that it smells GREAT!</li>
      <li>Using these pads are super easy.</li>
      <li>very nice on the skin, not to harsh.. love using it</li>
      <li>The pads soap up really nice and my face feels so soft and clean after using</li>
      <li>Despite the fact that I always assume my skin is clean, the reality proves otherwise.</li>
      <li>The package came damaged, luckily the contents were intact.</li>
      <li>I own two facial cleansers, the Clarisonic Mia and the Neutogena Wave.</li>
      <li>I wipe my face  afew times with just warm to hot water FIRST without any product to get surface dirt/oil &amp; to open pores.  </li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE MY DEEP CLEAN PADS,THEY REALLY GET THE DIRT AND OILS</li>
      <li>have had no allergic reaction and the soap on the pad is mild and very subtlely scented.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>My zits are still there, but there aren&#x27;t any new ones being formed, so things are looking up!!!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product,after the very 1st use my skin was smoother,softer and far more cleaner than I&#x27;ve expected.</li>
      <li>I only wished that I could purchase more without this product being sold as an add-on item.</li>
      <li>my skin is smooth &amp; soft as a babies bottom.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted and saved time and money in the process.</li>
      <li>Each new pad is fresh.</li>
      <li>The whole product, including the Wave Sonic.</li>
      <li>I then actually use one of these pads by hand &amp; just put a light layer over face.  </li>
      <li>I just feel like my skin is so much cleaner when using this product.</li>
      <li>It does clean very deep, so use a mousterizer when your done cleansing your face with this.</li>
      <li>This really left my face feeling and looking clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking cleaner, healthier skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>I normally buy these cleansing pads in bulk.</li>
      <li>My skin looks far better than its should for someone who stays up all hours and is not exactly anywhere close to young.</li>
      <li>I have never been one to clean my face every night with anything other than soap.</li>
      <li>completely cleans my face, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily afterwards.</li>
      <li>The soft cotton pad leaves traces of dirt on the pad&#x27;s surface area.</li>
      <li>I like this product for my face which is sensitive &amp; use it in conjunction with the Microderm Abrasion pads.  </li>
      <li>I have to be careful because I super sensitve and dry skin,</li>
      <li>This allows me to reuse this pad a few times by removing some of the Surface dirt first so it doesn&#x27;t contaminate my Wave pad.  </li>

<li> That said, I like the small design of the Wave and its gentle hum as it thoroughly cleanses my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> , I use the normal formulation.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using these faithfully, my skin texture seems softer and brighter and there has been no need to exfoliate to remove dead skin cells.</li>

<li> BUT THE REFILLS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
<li> How do I get an attachment head when mine starts going bad???</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I HAVE THE WAVE POWER CLEANER. THE DOVE FACE CLEANER WAS CHEAP BUT THE REFILLS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. THIS IS JUST AS GOOD AND THE REFILLS ARE A THIRD OF THE PRICE. VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the packaging,it seems to be open from both ends.I feel like it was opened already.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help reduce skin oil, it doesn&#x27;t do that. The package came damaged, luckily the contents were intact. It works on cleaning but not deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to clean my face every night with anything other than soap. This really left my face feeling and looking clean.</li>
    <li> I like that they have different kinds of these, it makes me want to experiment a little bit. I have to be careful because I super sensitve and dry skin, and I get a lot of acne.. It does clean very deep, so use a mousterizer when your done cleansing your face with this.</li>
    <li> very nice on the skin, not to harsh.. love using it and so does the rest of my family... will continue using</li>
    <li> The whole product, including the Wave Sonic. completely cleans my face, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily afterwards. Usually products do, but I have yet to have that happen. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, and already I am seeing a difference. My zits are still there, but there aren&#x27;t any new ones being formed, so things are looking up!!!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in the store so I was very happy when seeing them on Amazon! I just feel like my skin is so much cleaner when using this product.</li>
    <li> The pads soap up really nice and my face feels so soft and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It was on the Dr.Oz show, I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Really works.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product,after the very 1st use my skin was smoother,softer and far more cleaner than I&#x27;ve expected. I only wished that I could purchase more without this product being sold as an add-on item.</li>
    <li> I love the Wave. It makes my skin feel fresh, clean, and soft, and when I&#x27;m finished, my skin positively glows--not to mention that it smells GREAT! You can feel the vibrations penetrating deeply and it feels wonderful. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking cleaner, healthier skin. Also, you can attach skin-cleaning pads of any kind onto the head! I use acne pads and moisturizing pads most of the time, and the rest of the time I use the Neutrogena pads (which treat acne, clean skin and moisturize).</li>
    <li> Even after adding shipping charges, it is still cheaper than in Singapore. That&#x27;s why I bought it in bulk polling with a few friends to get even cheaper.</li>
    <li> I own two facial cleansers, the Clarisonic Mia and the Neutogena Wave. While the Mia is an effective cleanser, is cutely packaged, and comes in at around $130+, it is the Wave that I use more often.  That said, I like the small design of the Wave and its gentle hum as it thoroughly cleanses my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Wave daily and have owned the same wave for almost four years. I normally buy these cleansing pads in bulk. What makes them attractive to me is they produce a ton of nicely scented lather while cleansing and delivering an extremely gentle form of exfoliation. Using these pads are super easy. I completely wet my face and neck and with an upward motion I rotate it over the surface of both my face and neck. If the pad seems dry I moisten it with a little tap water. Despite the fact that I always assume my skin is clean, the reality proves otherwise. The soft cotton pad leaves traces of dirt on the pad&#x27;s surface area. After I finish cleansing, I rinse my face with cold water and pat dry with a clean towel.&lt;br /&gt;These pads come in different formulations. Since my skin is neither oily or dry and I don&#x27;t have blackheads or blemishes, I use the normal formulation.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using these faithfully, my skin texture seems softer and brighter and there has been no need to exfoliate to remove dead skin cells. My skin looks far better than its should for someone who stays up all hours and is not exactly anywhere close to young. Good genes or Netrogena? I am inclined to say that my skin is better since I have been using these pads.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no allergic reaction and the soap on the pad is mild and very subtlely scented.&lt;br /&gt;The big plus to using disposable pads is that bacteria is not being redeposited on the skin. Each new pad is fresh.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of pimples. But, after I use this product with somic wave cleanser, my skin troubles getting better.&lt;br /&gt;Worth using it!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it.  This thing is fantastic and my face feels so good after I use it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Some products always need refills and the Wave Pads are refills for the Neutrogena face cleaner.  Buying them here was more economical than purchasing them in a store.  I knew the product and was pleased with my purchase.  I got exactly what I wanted and saved time and money in the process.</li>
    <li> I like this product for my face which is sensitive &amp; use it in conjunction with the Microderm Abrasion pads.  I wipe my face  afew times with just warm to hot water FIRST without any product to get surface dirt/oil &amp; to open pores.  I then actually use one of these pads by hand &amp; just put a light layer over face.  Then I use my Machine with the Neutrogena  Micro Pad.  This allows me to reuse this pad a few times by removing some of the Surface dirt first so it doesn&#x27;t contaminate my Wave pad.  I just lay it on a piece of paper towel.afterwards.  I don&#x27;t break out &amp; my skin is smooth &amp; soft as a babies bottom. I Do use either a Hyaluronic Cream or Peptide Cream afterwards.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE MY DEEP CLEAN PADS,THEY REALLY GET THE DIRT AND OILS OUT OF MY SKIN ,AND I LOVE THE WAY MY SKIN FEELS AFETR I PUT ON MY MOISTURIZER,ONCE I RUN OUT OF PADS I WILL RE-ORDER,THANK YOU,ALICIA C.BIRMINGHAM,AL</li>
    <li> very good Amazon! I love this article!</li>
    <li> In small print at the bottom of this box, it says &#x27;Attachment Head&#x27;.  Does that mean an attachment head should be included in this box??  I have been under the impression that this shipment should come with an attachment head, and have ordered this item on a number of occasions  How do I get an attachment head when mine starts going bad???</li>
    <li> Daughter loves The Wave. It works great with these pads that are sold seperately. She adds a little neutrogena facial cleaner and they work like a charm</li>
