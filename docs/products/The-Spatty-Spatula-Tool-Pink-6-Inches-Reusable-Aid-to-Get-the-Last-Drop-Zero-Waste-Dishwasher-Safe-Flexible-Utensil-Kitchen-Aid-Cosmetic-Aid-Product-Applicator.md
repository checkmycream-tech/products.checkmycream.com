      <li>I think that it&#x27;s a great concept and even purchased them for my daughters.</li>
      <li>These things are great for getting every bit out of cosmetics and beauty jars and containers.</li>
      <li>The Spatty itself is great</li>
      <li>I use this in lotion bottles but also found its great for the kitchen</li>
      <li>Was intrigued by this on &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and so happy to have found it and use it continually.  </li>
      <li>Works great to get lotion out</li>

      <li>and I need more!!</li>
      <li>Really handy!  </li>
      <li>I love Spatty, what a great tool!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;ecially when I could see a good amount at the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Loved it before it broke.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>so it will be handy when I need it.</li>
      <li>Extremely nice product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and pays for itself quickly.  </li>
      <li>but this allows me to scrape the sides and bottom for more makeup and it is amazing</li>
      <li>Oh my gosh, the amount of product that you would normally throw away is incredible.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that really works!</li>
      <li>I love Shark Tank too, I am giving these away for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I wish the end was more flexible like a kitchen spatula so that I could get up under the rim of my cosmetics bottles.</li>
      <li>However, it is better than not having a tool to use.</li>
      <li>I am glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love my Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love the product, however the glue to hold the spatty for display was beyond my wildest dreams sticky.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product has allowed me to continue use of my liquid makeup for THREE WEEKS longer that if I did not have the Spatty.&lt;br /&gt;I would have thrown the bottle away because I couldn&#x27;t get any more out of it,  </li>
      <li>I wish it had a thinner profile and was more flexible like it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>so it could better gather the stuff in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I feel like I am able to get more use out of products now.</li>
      <li>glad I ordered both sizes</li>
      <li>Try them, you will see how many uses you can use these.</li>
      <li>Will order more.</li>
      <li>I am sure it will pay for itself.</li>
      <li>How many times have you gotten irritated with cosmetic companies shaping their pots and jars and so on, into shapes that are intentionally made so you can not get to all the product that you paid for.</li>
      <li>I wish that it had been more durable because I found it to be very useful.</li>
      <li>That is great instead of getting several boxes.</li>
      <li>The spatty doesn&#x27;t fit into lip gloss tubes.  </li>
      <li>This is a great tool for getting the last part of my make-up out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Great idea will keep in mind for future.  </li>
      <li>and I really could have made my own.</li>
      <li>Ordered as soon as available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It looks like they tried to copy the ORIGINAL  &#x27;patented&#x27; Beauty Spatula - EVERY DROP BEAUTY SPATULA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just what I needed and I am ordering more for Birthday and Christmas presents for everyone because everyone can certainly use these.</li>
      <li>Its just the right size and is MADE IN THE USA folks!  </li>
      <li>It was a little larger than I would have liked, but regarding it works great!</li>
      <li>larger cooking silicone cousins are, proportionately, but it&#x27;s still a good tool to have.  </li>
      <li>The shipper sent the full order all In one box.</li>
      <li>Great for uses other than toiletries, too.</li>
      <li>it is just the item to get the last bit out of any container a great find and deal as you get two different sizes and so many uses.</li>
      <li>Finally, something that helps me get my money&#x27;s worth from many of the products I use in my home!</li>
      <li>This is a great little spatula.  </li>
      <li>The head is too tiny to really do any good.</li>
      <li>I saw this young lady who designed this great but simple tool on Shark Tank e en though she did not get her deal</li>
      <li>I think the cost is well worth</li>
      <li>and it makes me smile to know</li>
      <li>idea and glad the young lady who created this still went on to get it made even though Shark Tank did not pick.it up  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to scrape out a significant portion of my eye-cream left-overs out of the tiny bottle it comes in.  </li>
      <li>I am using it right now</li>
      <li>This is a great tool for anyone who needs to get that &amp;#34;last little bit&amp;#34; out of a bottle or tube!  </li>
      <li>It has saved me so much money!</li>
      <li>pretty uselses I find.  </li>
      <li>I first saw the product I immediately wanted it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run to have in my arsenal. :)</li>
      <li>I love the spatty, the only problem I have with it is the glue they use to keep it attached to the cardboard.  </li>
      <li>So far it has fit into every container I&#x27;ve had, it&#x27;s a gem of an idea.</li>
      <li>First saw this product on Shark Tank.  </li>
      <li>Very clever idea.</li>
      <li>It oes get every last drop, but the rubber spatula part was still too fat to fit in my makeup bottle.</li>
      <li>I much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the real &amp;#34;spatter daddy&amp;#34; as seen on Shark tank but works very well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a real problem getting to the product and getting rid of the sticky.</li>
      <li>I really like using the Spatty for the bottom of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is too big for the openings of all of my lip glosses, so it doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>Such a smart idea and useful</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>There is no other product like this on the market that I am aware of.  </li>
      <li>I love this little gadget.</li>
      <li>Really great for using ALL of the expensive beauty  products, scooping it out...</li>
      <li>the Every drop Beauty spatula rocks as it has a shoulder that gets under the bottles shoulder where most of the product gets trapped.</li>
      <li>I am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of that bottle because I will get every last drop out of it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredible, you will have products give you at least another week if not more.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much to the inventor of these, they will save a lot of users a lot of money in the long run, I know they will me.  </li>
      <li>It has also has been great for getting handcream out after cutting the end off of the tube when the cream can no longer be squeezed out.</li>
      <li>My husband ordered it for me and surprised me with it.  </li>
      <li>After using the Spatty Daddy to dig out at least another month&#x27;s worth of hand lotion from the sides and bottom of a bottle which the bottle&#x27;s pump couldn&#x27;t reach, I figured I&#x27;d practically recouped my cost of the Spatty and Spatty Daddy right there.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for mixing some of my hair products since I only have 1 hand and can&#x27;t mix things in my hands before applying to my hair.</li>
      <li>Spatty Daddy is a great little tool to get those hard to reach last drops of makeup and lotion from the bottom of container..</li>
      <li>As high as every thing is I want to get the very last drop out of every container.</li>
      <li>The handle needs to be much slimmer, and the actual tip needs to be even smaller.  </li>
      <li>The silicone is very hard and, while the product is functional, it may be improved by using a more flexible silicone for the actual spatula.</li>
      <li>We saw it on Sharktank and my wife thought it was perfect for making her makeup last, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was a little larger than I would have liked, but regarding it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this!!  I saw it on &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t wait to get one.  I use to cut my plastic bottles in half to retreive the rest of the product.  This is a great product and pays for itself quickly.  I would recommend this to everyone.  There is no other product like this on the market that I am aware of.  Finally, something that helps me get my money&#x27;s worth from many of the products I use in my home!</li>
    <li> I love the product, however the glue to hold the spatty for display was beyond my wildest dreams sticky. I tried pulling it off to no avail. Then I used mineral oil, lighter fluid, alchol, cleaning wipes and got no where. I finally had to take a utility knife to it. I actually had to shear some of the plastic off the handle to get rid of the glue. The Spatty itself is great it&#x27;s just a real problem getting to the product and getting rid of the sticky.</li>
    <li> I love the spatty, the only problem I have with it is the glue they use to keep it attached to the cardboard.  I couldn&#x27;t even get it off with nail polish remover, nasty stuff.  They need to get a different glue or use ties to attach them.</li>
    <li> I saw this young lady who designed this great but simple tool on Shark Tank e en though she did not get her deal I asm so&lt;br /&gt;great idea and glad the young lady who created this still went on to get it made even though Shark Tank did not pick.it up  it is just the item to get the last bit out of any container a great find and deal as you get two different sizes and so many uses.</li>
    <li> Appears to be well made but i haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet.  Hopefully it will work well when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Awesome product so so so happy that I bought it! It has saved me so much money!</li>
    <li> I have looked a long time for something small enough to get that last speck of makeup out of the jar and this works. I saw this product on the Sharks TV Program and did a search, which led me to Amazon. I love my Amazon. I have it in my drawer in the bathroom so it will be handy when I need it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget. I mainly use it for mixing some of my hair products since I only have 1 hand and can&#x27;t mix things in my hands before applying to my hair. Small and useful, the spatula is tiny and gets into all the small spaces that I need to reach.</li>
    <li> Spatty Daddy is a great little tool to get those hard to reach last drops of makeup and lotion from the bottom of container..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real &amp;#34;spatter daddy&amp;#34; as seen on Shark tank but works very well.</li>
    <li> It oes get every last drop, but the rubber spatula part was still too fat to fit in my makeup bottle.</li>
    <li> Not well made.  The plastic handle on the small Spatty broke after approximately 12 uses.  Loved it before it broke. It worked well to get to the bottom of the makeup bottles</li>
    <li> I do use this. I wish the end was more flexible like a kitchen spatula so that I could get up under the rim of my cosmetics bottles. However, it is better than not having a tool to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for anyone who needs to get that &amp;#34;last little bit&amp;#34; out of a bottle or tube!  Its just the right size and is MADE IN THE USA folks!  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>

    <li> pretty uselses I find.  I think I needed a bigger one.  The head is too tiny to really do any good.</li>
    <li> I hate wasting expensive cosmetic products and this helps get the last bit out of the jar!  Thank you for the product!</li>
    <li> I saw this on Shark Tank and due to some faulty dispensers remembered it and ordered it so I could remove the product into a small container because of the broken pumps. Oh my gosh, the amount of product that you would normally throw away is incredible. I hate waste and love to save money, and I had no clue I much I wasted until I started using the Spatty. It&#x27;s incredible, you will have products give you at least another week if not more. It&#x27;s plain wasteful not to have it. So far it has fit into every container I&#x27;ve had, it&#x27;s a gem of an idea.</li>
    <li> The spatty doesn&#x27;t fit into lip gloss tubes.  The handle needs to be much slimmer, and the actual tip needs to be even smaller.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea...but I wish that it had a little scoop on the end instead of the flat end. It doesn&#x27;t work real well when trying it get the last few drops out of the bottom of a small container.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell from the picture, but these are flat, like an ordinary spatula. Plus they come in two lengths. How many times have you gotten irritated with cosmetic companies shaping their pots and jars and so on, into shapes that are intentionally made so you can not get to all the product that you paid for. They do it on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;You can thumb you&#x27;re nose at them (or worse), with this spatty in hand!&lt;br /&gt;Opal</li>
    <li> First saw this product on Shark Tank.  It really is great and it helps you use every bit of lotion, makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> What a great idea, and I love Shark Tank too, I am giving these away for Christmas. Try them, you will see how many uses you can use these.</li>
    <li> It is too big for the openings of all of my lip glosses, so it doesn&#x27;t fit.  Also, the head is not flexible at all and can&#x27;t be &amp;#34;maneuvered&amp;#34; to get in small spaces.  Disappointing</li>
    <li> This mini spachula does what it is suppose to do. The shipper sent the full order all In one box. That is great instead of getting several boxes.</li>
    <li> Works great to get lotion out I don&#x27;t like  wasting lotion.</li>
    <li> These things are great for getting every bit out of cosmetics and beauty jars and containers.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made.  It looks like they tried to copy the ORIGINAL  &#x27;patented&#x27; Beauty Spatula - EVERY DROP BEAUTY SPATULA.&lt;br /&gt;I bought both...  the Every drop Beauty spatula rocks as it has a shoulder that gets under the bottles shoulder where most of the product gets trapped. The &#x27;spatty&#x27; did nothing but aggravate me and waste my time. Shame on you for misrepresenting your product and trying to be a copy cat...........</li>
    <li> I was  throwing away expensive facial moisturizers because the pump would not get the last portion out of the bottle.  It was frustrating, esp&lt;br /&gt;ecially when I could see a good amount at the bottom of the bottle.  I needed a small tool to get to it.  The 6 inch spatty was the perfect solution.  I saw it or something like it on the show, the Shark Tank, and then searched Amazon to try to find it.  I needed this product to save me money.  I am using it right now and it makes me smile to know I am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of that bottle because I will get every last drop out of it!  That spatty will has already saved me money..</li>
    <li> Was intrigued by this on &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and so happy to have found it and use it continually.  Really great for using ALL of the expensive beauty  products, scooping it out...where,  before &amp;#34;Spatty&amp;#34;....at least 20% was WASTED!</li>
    <li> I love this and I need more!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little spatula.  I wish it had a thinner profile and was more flexible like it&#x27;s larger cooking silicone cousins are, proportionately, but it&#x27;s still a good tool to have.  I&#x27;m able to scrape out a significant portion of my eye-cream left-overs out of the tiny bottle it comes in.  That stuff costs about $80/bottle, so this little spatula probably saves me $10/bottle. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run to have in my arsenal. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten TWO extra months out of my moisturizer because of this thing! TWO MONTHS I would have just thrown away!</li>
    <li> I was disa pointed in the size of the tool</li>
    <li> Extremely nice product. Came well packaged and did just what I needed it to. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. Would suggest to all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t waste a drop of expensive creams.  I do wish the handle was even longer.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Shark Tank and could not wait for it to be merchandised.  I am glad to have found it on Amazon.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I think that it&#x27;s a great concept and even purchased them for my daughters. The packaging is done poorly. I had to use Goo Gone to remove the Spatty from the packaging. The small one broke after two weeks of use. I think that the creator needs to work on another way to adhere the end spatula to the stick. I wish that it had been more durable because I found it to be very useful.</li>
    <li> After seeing this product on Shark Tank, I got this as a gift for all my female friends for the holidays.  I have always been frustrated by trying to get the remnants out of my cosmetic bottles and hated tossing that last little bit of perfectly good product.  Spatty&#x3D;problem solved.  Check out the Spatty Daddy of your bigger bottles too!</li>
    <li> I use this in lotion bottles but also found its great for the kitchen so I ordered 2. As high as every thing is I want to get the very last drop out of every container.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  We saw it on Sharktank and my wife thought it was perfect for making her makeup last, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of these at the same time but they arrived at 2 different times for some reason.  I have not used the product yet, but did send an email to the owner of the company with suggestions &amp; received a response a day or so later.  Very clever idea.</li>
    <li> I really like using the Spatty for the bottom of the lotion.  However, this may be a packaging problem, but it has glue stuck to the handle that I absolutely cannot get off, annoying.  Otherwise, I feel like I am able to get more use out of products now.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the Spatty.  It didn&#x27;t think it worked all that well. I think I expected the spatula part to have a bit of give so it could better gather the stuff in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Works perfect!  My husband ordered it for me and surprised me with it.  Such a smart idea and useful tool.&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the product I immediately wanted it.  Every woman needs a spatty..</li>
    <li> Thanks so much to the inventor of these, they will save a lot of users a lot of money in the long run, I know they will me.  Mine have been used in the makeup jars, lotion tubes, also in the kitchen, jelly jars to salad dressing jars, and I see a lot of other ways that they will be used in the future.</li>
    <li> I saw these on the t.v. show Shark Tank.&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe they were not interested.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend. I use mine to get all of my&lt;br /&gt;oil of olay off the bottom of the jar.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Cleans out every spot of lotion in your jar.  Everyone needs this to maximize your beauty product investment.</li>
    <li> Should have a flat shaft, so you can keep a grip on it, otherwise it turns around and does not get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have not had them very long to say if them are sturdy (9 days) but I have used them every day out of those 9 days to get the last of a hand lotion, expensive face cream, liquid makeup,etc.  I think the cost is well worth what I well save in the end as I use a lot of expensive face creams.</li>
    <li> Just saw this on shark tank.  Great idea will keep in mind for future.  Wish you well in your endeavors.</li>
    <li> this is just what I needed to get to the bottom of different containers. I am sure it will pay for itself. glad I ordered both sizes</li>
    <li> I thought I knew how long 6 inches was. I guess I don&#x27;t, because I was shocked when I opened my package and found this. Really small... Like I could break it by accident... and I really could have made my own. I maybe should have.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and I am ordering more for Birthday and Christmas presents for everyone because everyone can certainly use these.</li>
    <li> I have always been so frustrated trying to get the bottom of my bottles, feeling like I am wasting so much.  Now I can get it!</li>
    <li> After using the Spatty Daddy to dig out at least another month&#x27;s worth of hand lotion from the sides and bottom of a bottle which the bottle&#x27;s pump couldn&#x27;t reach, I figured I&#x27;d practically recouped my cost of the Spatty and Spatty Daddy right there. Great for uses other than toiletries, too. The Spatty worked wonders in getting the last of the mustard out of a small squeeze bottle that just kept burping air. I hate to think of all the money I wasted over the years by throwing away jars/bottles/containers that still held plenty of usable contents. This is a great product that really works!</li>
    <li> Product details states two are included but I only got one. Either fix your description or provide what is listed.</li>
    <li> I use Wen hair cleanser and it is very thick. When the pump is not bringing up the rest of the product my spatty daddy does the trick. I now have the ability to use it all.</li>
    <li> This product has allowed me to continue use of my liquid makeup for THREE WEEKS longer that if I did not have the Spatty.&lt;br /&gt;I would have thrown the bottle away because I couldn&#x27;t get any more out of it,  but this allows me to scrape the sides and bottom for more makeup and it is amazing how much was in there going to waste.  Make up is relatively expensive so this is terrific.</li>
    <li> I love Spatty, what a great tool! But mine broke in less than two weeks....bummer!  I would consider buying another one though.</li>
    <li> Saw these on Shark Tank and wanted them immediately.  Ordered as soon as available on Amazon.  Really handy!  Will order more.</li>
