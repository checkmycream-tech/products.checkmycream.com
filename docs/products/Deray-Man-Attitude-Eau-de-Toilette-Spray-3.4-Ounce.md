      <li>I was kind of laughing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not, but as someone who liked that scent, I like this one as well.</li>
      <li>and my boyfriend said he liked it too</li>
      <li>This is by far the best price I has found.</li>
      <li>I smelled this for the first time in the mall and thought it was great</li>
      <li>so she hides it to make sure</li>
      <li>he will love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it even more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok..</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this regularly and am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I also got so many compliments from my coworkers, friends and family.</li>
      <li>My favorite  and wifey won&#x27;t let me spray it on me if I was going somewhere by myself</li>
      <li>I love it, all my friends love it</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>I had originally hoped it  was a knock off for Armani Attitude.</li>
      <li>I have many colognes and this is my favorite one by far!</li>
      <li>As long as you know you are not getting Armani Attitude you will be happy...</li>
      <li>The smell is definitely worth the price on here</li>
      <li>Definitely an adult scent, everyone I know, whom has smelled it has commented on how much they enjoy it, I would recommend this for anyone!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve  bought at higher prices</li>
      <li>Good and manly fragrance; just that scent won&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Thanks.  </li>
      <li>, I really like it...</li>
      <li>if other people are around, I love to spray it on myself just so I can smell it.</li>
      <li>I believe as many other inexpensive knock offs</li>
      <li>It is mild, yet stays on the attire for a long time.</li>
      <li>This one is subtle and nice and people respond.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t last long,  comes off watery n cheap.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this $40 at the mall after thinking I talk the guy down from $120.  </li>
      <li>This has a little bet of a sweet smell to it which is the only thing that I did not like.</li>
      <li>I will say that it has a very &#x27;grown-up&#x27; scent to it meaning that i don&#x27;t think that teenagers should be running around with this stuff on because it might smell just a little bit too mature for them.</li>
      <li>you loved it and its not super expensive.</li>

    <li> I got it as a gift and the person loved it.</li>
    <li> my best friend owns this and he came over one night n i was like OMG YOU SMELL SOOO GOOD !!! and so since its xmas i decided i would get this for my boyfriend. Asking around for different opinions my bestfriend said get this one. you loved it and its not super expensive. he will love it. i hope he does cause i know i do!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell. I use it as my everyday scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell inexpensive and I get compliments on it when I go out.  I&#x27;ll be buying it regularly I believe as many other inexpensive knock offs I&#x27;ve  bought at higher prices have obnoxious scents.  This one is subtle and nice and people respond.  I had originally hoped it  was a knock off for Armani Attitude. it&#x27;s not, but as someone who liked that scent, I like this one as well.</li>
    <li> My favorite  and wifey won&#x27;t let me spray it on me if I was going somewhere by myself so she hides it to make sure lol it smell that good!!!!</li>
    <li> Great cologne, but writing this because of service. Ordered on 7/15 at 1pm. Received on 7/16 at 1030 am. Shocked when I saw UPS. Great service. Thanks.  JDW</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery for a favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best price I has found. Same product as in the store and I paid 65 U.S. dollars for it in the store.</li>
    <li> When I was reading the other reviews I was kind of laughing. They said that they got compliments from other people. I bought it and guess what? I also got so many compliments from my coworkers, friends and family. I will definitely buy this again, and again. In fact, I can even buy it as a gift for my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell, I really like it...</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Good and manly fragrance; just that scent won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> As long as you know you are not getting Armani Attitude you will be happy... This is a cheaper cologne, but it is definately a good one for the price.. Ballin on a budget? Than i&#x27;d recommend this one..</li>
    <li> I like this, I swich around what I put on almost everyday. This has a little bet of a sweet smell to it which is the only thing that I did not like.</li>
    <li> Love it.. It way cheaper than buying at the stores... Only thing is i feel like it dont stick to you that long.. Watered down maybe?</li>
    <li> I smelled this for the first time in the mall and thought it was great and my boyfriend said he liked it too so I ordered it for Christmas..This makes you want to do things to your man!</li>
    <li> you would get more ppl to fill out the questionares if you wouldnt set REQUIREMENTS for what you to fill out!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best MEN perfumes. It is mild, yet stays on the attire for a long time. I&#x27;ve been buying this regularly and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is aaaaaamazing!!</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price.  I originally bought this $40 at the mall after thinking I talk the guy down from $120.  The smell is definitely worth the price on here and it does last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my go to cologne....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.. I haven&#x27;t worn it alone to get any reviews.. I&#x27;m one of those people that doesn&#x27;t like changes....I was expecting Giorgio Arman&#x27;s Attitude</li>
    <li> Definitely an adult scent, everyone I know, whom has smelled it has commented on how much they enjoy it, I would recommend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> usually so much more in stores, its incredibly priced, if you&#x27;ve never worn this before it smells great. would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> OMGoodness!!!! I can&#x27;t seem to keep my face out of my husband&#x27;s neck.  Smells awesome.  I purchased it because a colleague of mine wore it.  I stopped him as asked what he was wearing.  I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and it didn&#x27;t mean that it would smell the same on my hubby.  Well after purchasing it, my hubby loves it and I love it even more.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for myself a month or so ago and i have still ot stopped receiving compliments on it! It smells SOO GOOD! Reguardless if other people are around, I love to spray it on myself just so I can smell it. The scent even seems to last all day! Even when i can&#x27;t smell it anymore i&#x27;ll still have people complimenting me on it well into the night. I will say that it has a very &#x27;grown-up&#x27; scent to it meaning that i don&#x27;t think that teenagers should be running around with this stuff on because it might smell just a little bit too mature for them. I have many colognes and this is my favorite one by far! and since i bought it on Amazon for only $15 -- that also makes it the cheapest! If you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s or up and you;re in the market for a ver attracting collogne, look no further than Man Attitude. I love it, all my friends love it, I know you will too!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne! Great buy!</li>
    <li> It smells good ..But don&#x27;t last long,  comes off watery n cheap.</li>
    <li> Daughters boyfriends favorite scent!!</li>
    <li> Love it ! It smells so good</li>
