    <li> It is what I ordered but it looks very stupid on my so I made it a b-day present for my lil sissy.</li>
    <li> Looks awesome on the front, although in the back it looks as if my booty was literally hanging low. It is probably because I an only 5&#x27;3 but nonetheless I would still wear it.</li>
    <li> Best pants ever made and that I&#x27;ve ordered.! Definitely order them. Just check your size. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> Im a girl and i got this so i could wear around the house&lt;br /&gt;and surprisingly the medium size(asian small) fit me really well&lt;br /&gt;and i&#x27;m a small. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and the length was just the right fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;recommend buying!&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable too.</li>
    <li> Took a little long for my pants to come but im glad it got here and its amazing, im looking foward for more</li>
    <li> Very comfy and stretchy. I can actually do a split and still be fine. plus the pants are very stylish. I&#x27;ve already have many compliments about it. Best part about these pants is that its made of the same elastic cotton blend that adidas use for their seats. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> If you know what soccer training pants feel and fit. They are alike. But the thing I didn&#x27;t like was the drop crotch. It looks weird as if it was a daiper shape. I don&#x27;t like that. The material is really good. But its just the drop crotch was not good looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im short 5&#x27;2&lt;br /&gt;I ordered \\&quot;US S\\&quot; it fits good on waist and legs but looks funny because of the dropcrotch</li>
    <li> These pants were so small my teenager son wasn&#x27;t even able to wear them.  They came up to my knees and by the time they came in the mail, the event was over :( so I gave them away to a kid.  Oh well, better luck next time I guess.</li>
    <li> I love them but I have no idea how to wash them - the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
    <li> Pants fit perfectly and really comfortable. The shipping was MUCH faster than I expected. The quality of the pants is also amazing and the drop crotch gets lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> These are made for very slim, short guys. It&#x27;s really Asian hip-hop pants. I like them, but they were not fitting right on my brother. They looked like black long johns on him. On a tiny guy the crotch probably does drop and they fit on him like they do in the picture. My brother is 5&#x27;9 and 170 with an athletic build. Average sized or muscle guys these are not for you. Maybe you can try getting a size or two up from your actual pants size. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do I sure didn&#x27;t know it! lol</li>
    <li> may be it is just me or I bought too small one or something!!! but It looks horrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is probably one of those products that you need to gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it might looks great or horrible. Unfortunately it is horrible on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this pants is Las Vegas Pants. it is a big gamble!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Good quality material. Not cheaply made like one pair I bought. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> I bought these pants and was a little scared of the size&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m a slim fit 5&#x27;7 tall guy and a size small fit me as expected&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even need to tie the strings in order to stay up&lt;br /&gt;i do get made fun of at times because of the low crotch&lt;br /&gt;but they are really comfortable and feel like they are going to last&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend these pants to any hip hop dance or break dancer that doesn&#x27;t mind the low crotch piece</li>
