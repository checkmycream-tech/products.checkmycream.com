<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best skin care product on the market</li>
    <li> Murad products are the best, and you get a lot of product with this one.</li>
    <li> Great price. Product came with factory seal.</li>
    <li> Great for winter months. finding that its to much for the humidity in the summer, but good as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Gives that extra help in winter when the heat dries my skin out.</li>
    <li> After searching google, I found this on amazon-  We use this regularly &amp; love it.  The price was almost 1/2 off!  Great!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this.  Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, always use Clinque Dramatically Different Moisturizer, I needed something more moisturizing as my skin is getting drier.. This goes on so nicely, absorbs into the skin doesnt flake or dry on it,, Really wonderful--takes the dryness away quickly...It is expensive for the size you get.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing creme. Do not expect any anti-aging properties, simply one of the best moisturizing products.</li>
    <li> Not color I wanted, and returned it.</li>
    <li> Great moisturiser for dry skin.  Best I have used yet!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing this brand.  Too early to comment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Have been using it for years now and people constantly comment on how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I have desert-dry skin. While this isn&#x27;t provide the &amp;#34;ultimate moisture&amp;#34; for me, it is keeping away the dry flakes that come with the winter time. It&#x27;s creamy and a little heavier than my regular moisturizer, so I use it at night and it does seem to protect for the entire eight hours. When I wake in the morning, I don&#x27;t have the dry patches that I usually see during the cold dry months of January and February. It was PERFECT moisturization for fall but not quite enough for winter. I&#x27;ll have to see about summertime use.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing without breaking me out! I have oily skin, but in this dry and cold of a winter as we&#x27;ve had this has definitely helped add moisture without making me feel like an oil slick. Also, it melts into your skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It was ok, not quite as hydrating as I expected.</li>
    <li> A skin care specialist recommended this product to me after taking one look at my dehydrated skin. I have been using this twice a day for a week now and my skin is starting to have life again! I suffer from adult cystic acne and have used the Murad acne line, which is wonderful, but left me dry now that winter is approaching.  I was worried about a breakout  with a moisturizing product, but there is no sign of one yet! This product is pricey, but a little goes a long way! I love it!</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic. Discovered it last fall and will continue to buy!!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, this products moisturizes without irritating. My skin loves it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this product, only thing is, i felt like the maker of the product ,Murad is cheating on their oz&#x27;s.. AWESOME PRODUCT THOUGH.</li>
    <li> Exactly as presented..best price on web.</li>
    <li> Made my face break out.</li>
    <li> My skin type: combination (oily T zone, normal everywhere else). I also have slightly sensitive skin. I usually only use cetaphil and vanicream products. I tried using this eye cream on two different occasions. Both times, I used the cream for a few days applying day/night. Within two days or so, the skin around my eyes dried out so badly that there are flakes. The only good thing about this cream (why it gets 2 stars and not 1) is that it does not have an overwhelming scent. Creams by Olay and Ponds make my eyes water. It was given to me as a gift, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m out a $40+. The hype surrounding this product is not enough for me to disbelieve the results.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Great moisturizer, not greasy at all. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry after using this on my face.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product if you have dry aging skin. It feels like velvet when you apply it and it holds in the moisture all day. My skin feels smooth and soft. This is one product I will always have in my beauty bag.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Great product</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry skin and have used Murad for a few years.  Once I started using this product every day I noticed a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m 71 so for me to see my skin improve was almost a miracle.</li>
    <li> This prodicut is a really heavy cream with the consistency of a body butter. I have extremely dry skin, and rather than moisturizing, it created a layer of oil. It felt like I literally rubbed butter on my face. And once removed, my face was still dry. Since it stayed on top of my skin without absorbing, it made makeup application difficult. I found a drug store cream for $13 that works much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and was what I expected.  It smelled pleasant and had the texture that I was used to.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I have used many different moisturizers. This is by far my favorite. A little goes a long way. It is NOT greasy. Keeps my face hydrated even through the long cold Minnesota winters but is also light enough to use in the summer. I have very sensitive skin and this product is perfect. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great price, works great..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad Perfecting Night Cream 1.7oz (PNC). It is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me trouble whether I use it day or night. Unfortunately, the site that I got it from with a deep discount was out of stock. Unwillingly to pay full price for the little tube, I ventured out to try another Murad product and stumble upon this Murad Hydro-Dynamic(TM)Ultimate Moisture 1.7 oz (HDUM) at Amazon with a significant sale. The jar is very nice looking light pale pink. It doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it, which I like. Comparing to the PNC, this HDUM is quite thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as fast. It does leave a little sticky feeling.  It does keep my skin hydrated through out the day the next day, though. Now, I have 2 tubes of PNC&#x27;s for the price of one, I will use this jar of HDUM only after my masque treatment (2-3 nights a week). Overall, it was a good buy and did what it supposed to. I just don&#x27;t use it during daytime because it can be a bit too shiny, especially when it is used in combination with SPF sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife- she loves it! Provides alot of moisture as it states in brochure.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to find something that really adds the extra moisture I need for my face without being greasy or feeling heavy. It delivers and I am excited. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs extra moisture at any time.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. My skin feels like satin all day long.</li>
    <li> Have used Merle Norman and other OTC products.  This didn&#x27;t do anything the other products did and cost 2-3X the price.  Did not renew my order.</li>
    <li> I have tried to many creams from a wide range of prices and have mature combination skin. I like what&#x27;s \\&quot;not\\&quot; in this moisturizer, no odor as many have, very hydrating for dry areas but not overkill for those few places like the T-Zone. Very hydrating and absorbs quickly. Only takes a very small amount and feels so soothing. Easy to overdo so keep that in mine. Had a few blemishes caused by my last moisturizer during hot summer weather but cleared right up after starting this cream.</li>
    <li> Nice rich cream, noticeable difference in skins appearance.</li>
    <li> This product is over 50% off retail here On amazing!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and not greasy</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  I never used moisturizer on my face before because I&#x27;ve struggled with acne all my life and all brands would cause break outs or didn&#x27;t make a difference.  This product works without breaking me out.  I use it nightly.</li>
    <li> Used daily. Have tried so many different moisturizers from high end prescription and department store brands down to drug store brands. This does not irritate my sensitive skin and does add moisture, makes skin feel smooth and hydrated, not dry.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! Great value for the price. Will definitely shop with them again!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry skin but also sensitive.  This is by the far the best product I have found and does not make me break out.  I highly recommend to anyone with very dry skin.  The price is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have older (55+) skin, that is very dry.  Many creams irritate my eyes and eventually start drying out my skin.  Not this one though - Murad HD is awesome and you only need a little.  Love it!  Also love the eye cream version.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It goes directly into my face and leaves a smooth surface.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it.she loves it&lt;br /&gt;Work as as well as a product she paid 4 x as  much she paid form a derm</li>
    <li> Very thick and nourishing without feeling greasy and heavy.  I use this twice a day.  Absorbs nicely.  Noticed a definitely improvement in my skins texture and elasticity after using.</li>
    <li> I love many of the Murad products but this is one of my favorites. I use it as a night cream and have combination skin (age 43) that tends to be on the dry side. Good price too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without any ingredients that could irritate skin such as perfumes.  It&#x27;s good for the evening as it does not contain SPF.  I am on the fence as to whether I would buy it again as it&#x27;s a little pricey.  I took off one star for that reason.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s buy.  She loves it.  She likes it better than any other product she has used and she has used almost all.</li>
    <li> I was told to use this along with Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer &amp; C-toner for good results (by my sister).  Personally, I do not think this is an outstanding moisturizer compared with the ones I have used.  It may be more suitable for people with oily skin than normal-to-dry like mine.  It would be better if it hydrates more.</li>
    <li> Love the richness of it</li>
    <li> Also for my wife.  Likes it better than other products she tried like; Olay, Revlon, Elizabeth Arden.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every night as my night cream. It lasts a long time - very rich and creamy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! I have a weird skin complex, sometimes im very oily but when i put lotion on im still peeling! and sometimes im dry and my other lotions make me breakout because of oil bases. This lotion however is the perfect balance of ingredients so if you have difficult skin try this out, you too will love it! Not only that but here its half the price as in the stores or even on other websites. Even comes with a cute pink makeup bag/case!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have dry skin and it feels silky and thick enough to make a difference.  Foundation goes on smoothly over the moisturizer.  While I have not been using that long I can already see the dimishment of fine lines and my face feels smooth.  I would reccommend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I loved this product but it seemed to be very water based so it did not last long.  I felt it should have lasted at least 4-6 weeks but it was all gone in several weeks.  My skin just used it all up.  I loved the end resulton my skin but my wallet cannot afford such luxuries.</li>
    <li> I have super dry, flakey skin and no other moisturizer helps. This vial is small, but for the Amazon price, it&#x27;s really a steal. For me it&#x27;s a miracle cream! (And it actually lasts a fair amount of time!)</li>
    <li> I like this for a night cream.  It&#x27;s a thick cream.  It&#x27;s a little pricey so I won&#x27;t be ordering this again. I prefer to use Argan Oil that seems to do the same job.</li>
    <li> My skin has become so smooth since I started using this moisturizer. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Hands down.  This is the best ~~ best moisture cream ~~ best price ~~ with beautiful packaging.  I immediately applied a light tap with my finger on the inside of the jar&#x27;s lid and applied to my face.  My skin quickly absorbed the cream making it feel so exquisitely hydrated.  And, I haven&#x27;t looked in the mirror yet!!!!  The price is the Best I have seen anywhere!.  I Will be back to storefront for more Murad products and possibly other.  I have used many top dollar, high end, Neiman Marcus Beauty Counter products, but honestly, this is wonderful.  I hope you, too, will enjoy the benefits of Murad.</li>
    <li> good moisturiser...even for my oily skin</li>
    <li> Great hydrator.  NO SPF so your make-up glides on without pilling, or turning greasy.  I use it at night as well.  Highly recommend for wrinkle prevention for over-50 combo skin.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. My skin feels so soft and fine lines seem to be smoothed. I would definitely recommend this day cream.</li>
    <li> This product works like a miracle to moisturize facial areas, no problem when I picked it up in a mail box on the Sonoran Desert, it was not affected at all.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin supple and moist. I feel like a teenager with a healthy glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> did not receive the correct product</li>
    <li> Really good stuff!!!!!!!!  Way cheaper than salon prices:)</li>
    <li> Moisturizers beautifully!</li>
    <li> perfect for me in the winter</li>
    <li> I was actually given a sample of this in Sephora. Heaven. Pure silk. My skin has NEVER felt better, had less breakouts, and been so smooth than when I&#x27;ve used this product. (I have combination skin) BONUS points for being furry friendly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d received a sample of this moisturizer and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! I feel like it started working right away and I notice a difference. My husband mentioned the other day how young I looked....now that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> This cream is too oily.  I tried several times, at the end I just threw it away. I prefer to pay a little bit more and get the Obagi #3!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great for your skin.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it makes my skin feels so smooth and nourished.  I love all of Dr. Murads products.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Murad &#x27;limited edition&#x27; set that included a 1.7 oz jar of this moisturizer from Sephora (Hydrate for Hope Duo).  I have super dry skin in the winter and was really counting on this Murad moisturizer to be THE one to hydrate. I try to take good care of my skin, use sunblock year round, clean with a non-abrasive toner, and I drink lots and lots of water. I still have to pile this moisturizer on; we&#x27;re talking 2-3 applications each morning and again at night. Normally a jar this size lasts me 3-4 months; I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and the jar is already half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the higher price and many rave reviews, this moisturizer should really do the trick with one application. It&#x27;s non irritating, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, has a decent consistency, and is practically non scented (no real fragrance like in Murad-C, but it does have that slight &#x27;lotiony&#x27; smell). But sadly for those of us whose skin needs more hydration, plan on buying this in bulk or else try a &#x27;department store counter&#x27; brand that actually delivers on promises (ie: the Lancome Bienfait line).</li>
    <li> I recieved a cosmetics bag with my moisturizer within 3 days when I ordered. Thank you so much. I love both!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! This moisturizer is amazing. I suffered from acne in high school. After using proactiv and realizing that the product was only good in the beginning, I moved on to the murad brand. It helped miraculously. It not only stopped my acne but I haven&#x27;t needed to use a regime in so long. I just learned how to cleaned my face the natural way now thoroughly to prevent any future acne. The only issue I had since I stopped using a regimen was finding a moisturizer since my face ended up feeling dry and eventually developed some dry patches from not finding a moisturizer fast enough. Then I thought, hey why not look into the murad line and see what I can find there since that matched perfectly with my sensitive skin. The way I shop, I base my decision on buying a product through reviews and several of them from different sites so I can make a confident decision. I trusted the reviews and now I&#x27;m returning the favor and writing my very own to help those who are also looking for that perfect moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and this manages to keep that balanced. Of course you wouldn&#x27;t want a moisturizer that keeps your face matte, obviously that only means its not doing its job. It will give you that fresh dewy look without it getting worst. My skin actually looks better with the moisturizer than not wearing it at all. Somehow it looks more oilier to me if I don&#x27;t wear it. Odd huh? Without a weeks usage, my patches disappeared and my face started to have that natural glow that hydrated skins have. The product is perfectly thick yet weightless on your face. It keeps your face moisturized for the whole day. If you ever have dry cracks or anything severely dry, this will cure it without looking nasty or feeling nasty. It&#x27;s become a MUST to have with me or else my life wouldn&#x27;t be complete. A little goes a long way so this lasts me about 6 months or so until I need to buy another one. This moisturizer is the best friend of your foundation/make up. It&#x27;s the best base yet. I have a matte foundation when the day comes that I need a matte face for an occasion since I&#x27;m not the type to touch up on my make up. From the first hour of putting on make up to the very minute of taking it off, this moisturizer did not &amp;#34;oil it up.&amp;#34; My foundation would keep its promise of being matte until I wash it off. Of course, I use a primer as well. And yes, you guessed it right, I use the murad primer before my foundation and it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I personally love it and will always re-order from amazon coz the murad website is just overly priced.he best base yet.

    <li> Wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this. I have very dry skin I&#x27;ve used lost of different products. I got a sample tried it and fell in love with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past two winters (when I need major moisturizer) and it rocks! I&#x27;ve been using Murad products only for over two years now and I look no further. This particular moisturizer is the ultimate for extremely dry skin. Being an Esthetician I&#x27;ve tried MANY different products over the years and Murad is my stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything else</li>
    <li> My 27-year old daughter loves this moisturizer. She has problems with combination skin - one product dries it too much, another leaves it too oily. This has been the only moisturizer that helps keep her skin moisturized perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and I have a limited amount of products I can use without my skin freaking out. This cream is GREAT for my skin. My complexion is smooth and even. However, I used this around my eyes and it dried them out tremendously. I discovered the retin a was responsible for that. Little did I know there was a cream for eyes as well. I bought that and now my face is happy. It can be a bit greasy at first but my skin drinks it up pretty quickly. A little bit goes a long way which is nice cause it can be expensive. Works well with make-up too.</li>
    <li> I have to say; I ordered this for my 83 year old Mother, as this is what she wanted for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it arrive before Christmas (we thought it would be after Christmas) but she is &amp;#34;tickled pink&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the changes in &#x27;her&#x27; skin, I am going to have to buy myself a jar now as I&#x27;m &#x27;pretty sure&#x27; she won&#x27;t share with me.</li>
    <li> Great!  Adds a lot of moisture to my skin.  I travel a lot and my skin is very dry.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Only night cream to buy - Moisturizes like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried - No more searching for me</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the moisturizer for me as it does not irritate my eye and the skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is so hydrating yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Great smooth coverage. I enjoy the texture, smell and feel of the product on my skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped give a glow to my skin.  Great product and a smart buy for those who want beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my skin. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer...I use it on top if the lightening shield at night. All murad products are good. Better then department store treatments.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from the beauty supply store near my home....I liked it immediately otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t spend so much on a cream for my face!  This is totally worth the price!  All I can add is that it is silky smoothe and feels that way on your skin!   I&#x27;m happy with this purchase---thanks Murad!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Really good texture and doesn&#x27;t smell at all. I love this product on my skin.</li>
    <li> If you want a great moisturizer that is non-greasy and lo g lasting, well this is it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have only been using it ( twice a day) for one week and can already see a difference in my skin. I got this on sale at Ulta but will pay full price next time if I have too.</li>
    <li> Great product,  results were fantastic and skin appearance was drastically improved in 4 days, in terms of skin tone.  Used together with the collagen and it is absolutely wonderful</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the very best moisturizers I have ever used. Wish I had thought of looking for it here sooner, rather than paying full price at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, lasts morning till night and has no  heavy scent like most others. I use retin-a at night and this is the perfect day cream for me. Also use the renewing eye cream and they are perfect together.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on your skin</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels so luxurious. It leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; dewy.</li>
    <li> another great Murad experience</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel good.  Less expensive on Amazon than other places.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and super sensitive skin. I use this after washing with Fresh Soy and my skin is clear and very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love the Murad products. To be able to receive them in the mail at an Amazon price is a double bonus! Prompt and perfect!!</li>
    <li> Another great buy from Murad. It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling greasy and can be used on normal/combination skin like mine all year.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> All day moisture without being heavy.  I love the way it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> This Ultimate Moisturizer is just OK.  I&#x27;ve been using it (this was my first order) in conjunction with Murad&#x27;s Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Creme.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t get the real thing?</li>
    <li> Great for winter time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Love the feel of this cream, has no smell/scent at all.</li>
    <li> I originally was introduced to this moisturizer at a spa when I had a facial.  They gave me a tiny sample of it to take home.  My husband and I both loved it.  It is not greasy at all, so if you&#x27;re worried about looking oily, have no fear.  It is so creamy and smooth.  We have purchased this large size now a few times.  I&#x27;ve had issues with other moisturizers causing a burning sensation on my face or making me look oily through my makeup, but I have neither of those issues with this Murad moisturizer.</li>
    <li> love this product. have tried many other so called deep moisturizers, non that deliver like this. The others were not cheap either, high end names... this one wins hands down</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a better moisturizer than this. I gave it up because of the cost, but I miss it! There&#x27;s just nothing of this quality out there at a lower price point (that I am aware of).</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad Time Release Acne face wash for the past few years. I love this moisture! It is light weight and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling. It also didn&#x27;t make me break out, which is what i was worried about!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. I usually buy this moisturizer from Sephora for $68 , So when I looked on Amazon and saw it for half that price....it was a no brainer! Murad is a great product. The only thing that works for my skin .</li>
    <li> Amazing facial cream!!!  Light , no scent and feels great on my skin, I am hooked and highly recommend this product !!!</li>
    <li> This is a very hydrating moisturizer that does not leave your skin greasy.  I am 59 and have used this as a night moisturizer for many years.  When I wake up in the morning my skin still feels hydrated and not at all dry.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected. I would order this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using murad products for almost 2 years haven&#x27;t come across any of the products that I don&#x27;t like. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Very hydrating however could be clogging pores. Price is a little steep for results.</li>
    <li> Just about to order my second jar</li>
    <li> I have used many facial moisturizers over the years, and Murad Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture is the best ever.  My first experience with this product was at a spa facial.  I have used it ever since.  It&#x27;s rather expense so was quite happy to find it on Amazon greatly reduced, and the product I received is as perfect as the product I bought at the spa.</li>
    <li> The best face cream i have ever bought for sure. I do not need a lot and it is remarkably smooth</li>
    <li> Reviews said this moisturizer was great, but for the price it is nowhere near good enough. Oily film that still leaves face and dry.</li>
    <li> This is a true hydrant for my skin. It is moist and yet not sticky. It is very good product</li>
    <li> I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
    <li> So disappointed. So not worth the money, has funny ingredients like soy, if my insides don&#x27;t like soy, why would my outsides? My skin has been so dry this winter, was looking for an awesome moisturizer, this breaks out my skin and hasn&#x27;t noticeably moisturized at all..so disappointed, especially bc of the money I spent! I have at least 5 Dr murad products I love, vitamin c line, just need a good moisturizer, still looking..</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. My skin used to always feel dry no matter what face lotion I put on until I found this. It&#x27;s not greasy, oily or heavy and absorbs quickly. It has a none to slight fresh fragrant that doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or feminine, I got my husband hooked on this moisturizer as well. Amazon has the best prices. I have seen this product at Sephora for $65.</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad Hydro -Dynamic  Moisturizer for 2 years. Having a super sensitive skin , this moisturizer is super hydrating yet  gentle on my skin. This is my second order from this seller. Item arrived on time and as described. I am  very happy !</li>
