      <li>No, you&#x27;re not going to grow back a full thick head of hair if you&#x27;re full on balding, but if thinning like I am it does strengthen hair with less fall-out and I actually had new growth.  </li>
      <li>I have also bought the Complex 5, which I dont know if I like, because my scalp is sensitive the burning really hurts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair has been shedding for years, I went to the doctor who told me I have female pattern hair loss, gave a steroid to use. It didnt help much. I have also been using minoxidil for year and recently started taking pre natal vitamins. I have tried way too many products already, my scalp is sensitive, oily and burns... I heard about this product and gave it a try, I didnt see anything in the beginning. It took 7 bottles until I finally noticed that the hair loss slowed down. My hair feels fuller and is a lottttttt less oily!!!!&lt;br /&gt;One thing about the bottle, I have not figured it out how to open and release the powder... I have also bought the Complex 5, which I dont know if I like, because my scalp is sensitive the burning really hurts. Will wait until the scalp gets better to use it...</li>
    <li> all natural way to stop hair loss and get a healthy scalp back.  Use 2x per week for first month and then once a week.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find it does a good job and helps keep hair healthy.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser charges me 3 times this price. I am so happy I found this site. Honestly I have genetic hair loss.  This product helps keep my hair looking nice.  I do not grow more but am happy with the results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 6 months and have found it a good natural way to help increase hair growth.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GOOD TREATMENT FOR THE HAIR , IT MAKE YOUR FEEL STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL I WILL BUY MORE</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I noticed any results. Also the packaging is strange... The white powder stays in the cap and it&#x27;s difficult to get it out. Not worth the $$$</li>
    <li> good to use twice a year</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth and still loosing hair, it is not working for me. it might work for some other people.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjuction with Vitalfan for hair loss.  It seems my scalp is not as visible as before I use this product and I had used 2 boxes, the third one is underway.</li>
    <li> Gave to a friend who was stressing about thinning hair.  He reports that it seems to be working after just 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This a great product for to strengthen fine hair acting like a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Changes texture of limp fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great price. Received in excellent condition.</li>

    <li> i highly recommend this product because it gives a great result. My hair stop falling since i started it and they grew more.</li>
    <li> This product really dried my hair out and made it feel dirty after using it. I kept using it but didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that works.  No, you&#x27;re not going to grow back a full thick head of hair if you&#x27;re full on balding, but if thinning like I am it does strengthen hair with less fall-out and I actually had new growth.  The new growth, while smaller hairs, does make my hair appear fuller mainly because there&#x27;s less light reflection.</li>
    <li> The product dried my hair something terrible.  It had a wonderful smell and, the packaging was impressive.  I would imagine you could get similar results with olive oil, and orange with a small dash of lime.  Very unimpressed, especially considering the cost.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t continue to purchase product.  I&#x27;ve used 2 boxes (2 months) and did not find any difference with hair growth.  I guess I will need to use more than 2 months.  I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product gave me an allergic reaction. I have used other RF products, so it came as a surprise that I reacted negatively to this. Unfortunately,  the seller refused to return my money.</li>
    <li> It depends on the reason for the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;It did help create new growth where it was still happening.&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed after about 3 months was that the balding&lt;br /&gt;spot had gotten smaller. The growth coming in from the outer edges!&lt;br /&gt;Had only been focusing on the inside of the spot and any growth there.&lt;br /&gt;Then all of a sudden realized the spot had gotten smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with any new growth! Hair in general is more dense too.</li>
