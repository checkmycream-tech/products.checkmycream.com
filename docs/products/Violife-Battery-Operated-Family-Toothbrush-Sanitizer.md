### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent investment for my mouth!</li>
      <li>It holds 4 toothbrush making it the ideal storage/sanitizer for a family of 4.  </li>
      <li>I ended up buying a GermGuardian that I&#x27;m extremely happy with.</li>
      <li>The battery operated family toothbrush is great in reducing the electric cost and on batteries.  </li>
      <li>This is a great way to sanitize your toothbrush after every use.  </li>
      <li>It is battery operated and I use rechargables which greatly improves the practicality of this product.</li>
      <li>(so the batteries are good), but the bulb that sterilizes the toothbrushes does not work anymore.  </li>
      <li>It is good for travel so that is what we use it for.</li>
      <li>works good</li>
      <li>I do kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten the a/c power version instead.</li>
      <li>Great price, great product and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about one month now and have been very pleased:  -Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>If so, VIOlight, Inc. needs to put out a better, stronger lock mechanism because now I can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming that the mechanism is set to detect when the top has been locked for it to be used.</li>
      <li>The item worked okay</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
      <li>and they love it too.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It is neat looking and easy to use.</li>
      <li>When I finally did, it worked Beautifully -- for about a month.</li>
      <li>Apart from the fact that it was fine for one year, the bulb goes out, and can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
      <li>The item arrived and worked fine for a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>and the light would not come on.</li>
      <li>-It seems to be easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>3-AAA Batteries, great for my tiny, one-outlet bathroom    </li>
      <li>There is one important thing I learned about my violight:</li>
      <li>Easy to use, clean, etc.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the uv light even kills it.</li>
      <li>This product has a decent battery life, is easy to clean and has a nice appearance.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied and thank you very much</li>
      <li>This is a great product and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>She repeated I needed to clean it with alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Battery compartment still clean and pristine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s compact enough to fit easily on a crowded sink ledge, it&#x27;s very easy to take apart and clean, and the instructions for use couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  </li>
      <li>Knowing my kids toothbrushes are germ free really gives me the peace of mind any  mom would want!  </li>
      <li>after three weeks it stopped working, even with fresh batteries.  </li>
      <li>They explained that it would be rare to have the bulb burn out and suggested replacing batteries and drying out the inside of the unit.</li>
      <li>The light all of a sudden did not come on.</li>
      <li>Really?  </li>
      <li>That is way too fast.</li>
      <li>These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>Now if it would just stop using up batteries so fast.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush holder/sanitizer solves lots problems with what to do with your toothbrush between brushings and how to keep everything as clean as possible.</li>
      <li>I tried contacting customer service for violight and never heard back (except for \\&quot;special promotion\\&quot; emails...spam).</li>
      <li>I live overseas and the country&#x27;s electricity is very high.  </li>
      <li>It ran on batteries, and it made decent use of the battery power.  </li>
      <li>Also said to clean and dry it and replace batteries--</li>
      <li>I like Violight products in general, even though they do have a bit of a shelf life, but I really should have read the reviews here before getting this particular model.</li>
      <li>I am looking for a new product.</li>
      <li>, however, it occasionally wouldn&#x27;t always turn on the first couple of attempts.</li>
      <li>I thought I just needed to replace the batteries, and found it odd that the batteries would die so quickly, but as it turns out the whole thing died.</li>
      <li>If you tap the outside of the unit it will come on but even then not sure how long this will last..Not pleased!!</li>
      <li>Now, I realize it&#x27;s bigger and needs to be capable of sanitizing four toothbrushes at once.</li>
      <li>The light would never light up again.</li>
      <li>Now it has completely stopped working.  </li>
      <li>Then it can be fit perfectly, dead center, right in the bathroom trashcan.</li>
      <li>I will try that before I throw in the towel, because other than the battery issue this is a handy little thing to have around.</li>
      <li>After purchasing it worked for a few weeks, then the light would go on sometimes and not other times.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking of buying one of these for my daughter as a Christmas present but after only a short period of time the light does not always come on when the blue button is pressed.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I ought to be using the high energy use type meant for digital devices instead of my trusty Rayovacs?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the dice tables in Vegas.</li>

<li> Finally, if you replace your toothbrush every 30 days, new brushes will cost you less than the price of the violite, which would have gone out months before your toothbrush budget.</li>
<li> Whether it really works or not, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> This is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the electric one.</li>
<li> Many of its products&#x27; reviews are thought to be fake by other reviewers.  </li>
<li> I had the Violight Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer at one time and it lasted just about as long as I needed it to before dying a permanent death.</li>
<li> had I not waited so long after purchasing it to use it.</li>
<li> told her it was completely dry, been sitting unused for two weeks.  </li>
<li> As a layperson, my opinion is that not enough is known about the subject</li>
<li> Since I needed to use the item immediately, I used the same part from my previous sanitizer.</li>
<li> Girl on the phone said I needed to clean the unit and let it dry out, claimed being damp or dirty could make it stop working.  </li>
<li> You are sitting a wet toothbrush head in this gizmo.</li>
<li> I look forward to trying other violight products.</li>
<li> Pretty expensive product for 1 month&#x27;s use.  </li>
<li> It burned out and like other reviewers did I called the company</li>
<li> -Compact, fits in a drawer when company is coming    The other reviewer of this product has also commented on other toothbrush sanitizers and mentions the ADA.</li>
<li> Of course a little dry toothpaste inside.  </li>
<li> and it still runs through my batteries in an average of three days.</li>
<li> Not a good way to store toothbrushes up-side down due to water accumulate inside the container and mold builds.</li>
<li> So much for their &amp;#34;lifetime bulb.&amp;#34;  Company does not follow up and replace it; they just give you garbage advice and say too bad..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not not sure if I broke it</li>
<li> I told her that, not trying to be a jerk or anything, but if you can&#x27;t get a toothbrush holder damp or dirty then there is a design flaw and I wanted to send it back</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t found one that actually works yet which is disappointing.</li>
<li> this was not good.</li>
<li> I just do not like the fact that moisture inside the unit could be the cause as there is no way to prevent this and would suggest poor design (we do shake excess water off of brushes before setting in unit as directions explain).</li>
<li> They are a rip-off.  </li>
<li> Part of the item had a broken part.  </li>
<li> or if it was already broken in package when I bought it but the locking clips on the cover both broke off.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> That was inconvenient even with using rechargeable ones.</li>
<li> and they said too bad as this model is no longer made.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get to use it. I&#x27;m not not sure if I broke it or if it was already broken in package when I bought it but the locking clips on the cover both broke off. I figured I&#x27;d try to use it even then but the sanitizer would not turn on after I installed the batteries. I&#x27;m assuming that the mechanism is set to detect when the top has been locked for it to be used. If so, VIOlight, Inc. needs to put out a better, stronger lock mechanism because now I can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> I live overseas and the country&#x27;s electricity is very high.  The battery operated family toothbrush is great in reducing the electric cost and on batteries.  If you read some of the comments/reviews about sanitizers you don&#x27;t know if they do or don&#x27;t do anything but I like them and have had one for years.</li>
    <li> After purchasing it worked for a few weeks, then the light would go on sometimes and not other times.  Now it has completely stopped working.  Trying to get it replaced but no luck with amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought mine at Walmart...after three weeks it stopped working, even with fresh batteries.  Girl on the phone said I needed to clean the unit and let it dry out, claimed being damp or dirty could make it stop working.  Really?  A toothbrush holder that can&#x27;t get damp?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her it was completely dry, been sitting unused for two weeks.  Battery compartment still clean and pristine.  Of course a little dry toothpaste inside.  She repeated I needed to clean it with alcohol.  I told her that, not trying to be a jerk or anything, but if you can&#x27;t get a toothbrush holder damp or dirty then there is a design flaw and I wanted to send it back (so they could inspect the problem) and get a refund and she told me she could not do that and I had to return it back to Walmart.  *rolling eyes*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Being a big fan of toothbrush sanitizers, I purchased this one as a replacement for my last. The item worked okay, however, it occasionally wouldn&#x27;t always turn on the first couple of attempts. It is also battery operated with no AC adapter option to plug it in. There are only 2 people in my household and I was needing to replace the batteries every 3-4 days. That was inconvenient even with using rechargeable ones. I ended up buying a GermGuardian that I&#x27;m extremely happy with.</li>
    <li> Think about it for just a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo&#x27;s electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the dice tables in Vegas.</li>
    <li> I like Violight products in general, even though they do have a bit of a shelf life, but I really should have read the reviews here before getting this particular model. I had the Violight Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer at one time and it lasted just about as long as I needed it to before dying a permanent death. It ran on batteries, and it made decent use of the battery power.  Not so the Family Toothbrush Sanitizer. Now, I realize it&#x27;s bigger and needs to be capable of sanitizing four toothbrushes at once. But I&#x27;ve been cycling it only once a day and it still runs through my batteries in an average of three days. That is way too fast. I&#x27;m using alkaline batteries as instructed. Perhaps I ought to be using the high energy use type meant for digital devices instead of my trusty Rayovacs? I will try that before I throw in the towel, because other than the battery issue this is a handy little thing to have around. It&#x27;s compact enough to fit easily on a crowded sink ledge, it&#x27;s very easy to take apart and clean, and the instructions for use couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  Now if it would just stop using up batteries so fast. I do kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten the a/c power version instead.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush holder/sanitizer solves lots problems with what to do with your toothbrush between brushings and how to keep everything as clean as possible. It is neat looking and easy to use. If you try one, you will like it because of the pease of mind it will give you.</li>
    <li> Not a good way to store toothbrushes up-side down due to water accumulate inside the container and mold builds. I don&#x27;t know if the uv light even kills it. It defeats the purpose of sanitizing.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these Violight Toothbrush Sanitizer&#x27;s for years. My husband and I love it.  We purchased this one for our daughter and family as a gift and they love it too.  It keeps your toothbrush heads stored out of the bathroom elements and sanitizes them at the same time.  You can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> The only downside is cleaning this unit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon but did not take it out of the package to use it for about 6 months. When I finally did, it worked Beautifully -- for about a month. The light all of a sudden did not come on. I changed the batteries, but nothing I have tried will get it to work. Pretty expensive product for 1 month&#x27;s use.  I would call Amazon, had I not waited so long after purchasing it to use it. I am looking for a new product.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit 1 week ago.  I used it once a day and today it quit working.  The on/off switch lights up (so the batteries are good), but the bulb that sterilizes the toothbrushes does not work anymore.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> The batteries only lasted for 3 weeks of using unit twice a day. Used rechargeable (Eneloop) batteries second time around and the light would not come on. I thought it was the lightbulb and emailed customer service. They explained that it would be rare to have the bulb burn out and suggested replacing batteries and drying out the inside of the unit. Haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but customer service was prompt in responding and am confident they will work with me if the unit fails. I just do not like the fact that moisture inside the unit could be the cause as there is no way to prevent this and would suggest poor design (we do shake excess water off of brushes before setting in unit as directions explain).</li>
    <li> If you are one of those fear of germs folks on you toothbrushes (like me), then this product is for you. It holds 4 toothbrushes. Doesn&#x27;t use a lot of battery power. I change batteries every 7 - 8 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month now and have been very pleased:  -Easy to use.  -It seems to be easy to clean.  -Uses 3-AAA Batteries, great for my tiny, one-outlet bathroom    -Compact, fits in a drawer when company is coming    The other reviewer of this product has also commented on other toothbrush sanitizers and mentions the ADA. So, I went to the ADA website and read that they think sanitizers might be valuable to immunocompromised persons. Denists I have spoken to use them at home and insist that their children use them.     As a layperson, my opinion is that not enough is known about the subject and I am not taking any chances.</li>
    <li> This item is terrific.  Easy to use, clean, etc.  Excellent investment for my mouth!</li>
    <li> works good I am satisfied and thank you very much</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying one of these for my daughter as a Christmas present but after only a short period of time the light does not always come on when the blue button is pressed. If you tap the outside of the unit it will come on but even then not sure how long this will last..Not pleased!!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to sanitize your toothbrush after every use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I wish I would of known about this product sooner!  It holds 4 toothbrush making it the ideal storage/sanitizer for a family of 4.  Knowing my kids toothbrushes are germ free really gives me the peace of mind any  mom would want!  I look forward to trying other violight products.</li>
    <li> The item arrived and worked fine for a couple of weeks and now it no longer works. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> There is one important thing I learned about my violight: Apart from the fact that it was fine for one year, the bulb goes out, and can&#x27;t be replaced. Then it can be fit perfectly, dead center, right in the bathroom trashcan. Alternatively, it fits well in the office trash and even the kitchen trash. No fuss. But remember to recycle the batteries.  And did I say it eats batteries? Gulp, gulp. Finally, if you replace your toothbrush every 30 days, new brushes will cost you less than the price of the violite, which would have gone out months before your toothbrush budget. Batteries not included.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and lasts for a long time. It is battery operated and I use rechargables which greatly improves the practicality of this product. Great price, great product and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Part of the item had a broken part.  Since I needed to use the item immediately, I used the same part from my previous sanitizer.</li>
    <li> This company sells junk.  Many of its products&#x27; reviews are thought to be fake by other reviewers.  PRODUCTS BREAK AS SOONN AS WARRANTY ENDS.  They are a rip-off.  Stay away from this company.  Buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and within a week it died. I thought I just needed to replace the batteries, and found it odd that the batteries would die so quickly, but as it turns out the whole thing died. The light would never light up again. I tried contacting customer service for violight and never heard back (except for \\&quot;special promotion\\&quot; emails...spam). Save your money. This thing is junk.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read  this through I thought it was electric which I do have one in one of my bathrooms. This is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the electric one. It is good for travel so that is what we use it for. It does the same thing as the electric.</li>
    <li> this was not good. broke within a week. don&#x27;t like this or violight with the door. Haven&#x27;t found one that actually works yet which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> It burned out and like other reviewers did I called the company and they said too bad as this model is no longer made.  Also said to clean and dry it and replace batteries--did that and it still does not work.  So much for their &amp;#34;lifetime bulb.&amp;#34;  Company does not follow up and replace it; they just give you garbage advice and say too bad..</li>
    <li> This product has a decent battery life, is easy to clean and has a nice appearance. Whether it really works or not, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
