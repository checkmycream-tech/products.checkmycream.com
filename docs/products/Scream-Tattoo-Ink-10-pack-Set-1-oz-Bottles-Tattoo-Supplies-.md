      <li>good ink</li>
      <li>thanks For The Great Service!</li>
      <li>nice color assortment.  </li>
      <li>This ink runs with the best of inks I love it nice brute colors and blacks that really pop.</li>
      <li>Bright and bold colors...</li>
      <li>this ink is one of the best i have just tested it out on a piece of white paper</li>
      <li>, IT NOW WORKS BETTER THAN EVER</li>
      <li>Love this ink.</li>
      <li>but when i got mine the box was in perfect condition no leaks and full bottles, and it heals nice and bright and so far no fades, thanks a lot</li>
      <li>The colors that came with the ink set came out better than I had originally anticipated.</li>
      <li>this ink is of exceptional quality for the price, i liked it enough to order the 43 color pack, i just wish those had been 1oz.</li>
      <li>And Went In Smooth</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO INTENZE INK IN MY OPINION YO, THE COLORS HOLD UP AND POP VERY</li>
      <li>but the contents were just fine, all my colors were full,  </li>
      <li>Contents settle, overall good value for money.</li>
      <li>is exactly what i ordered.</li>
      <li>Comes with the most common colors, which can make most any color.</li>
      <li>this ink was very cheap and pretty much what i expected.</li>
      <li>is I would personally like 2 more colors rather then more black,  </li>
      <li>Packaging did looked like they kicked it the whole way.</li>
      <li>it was an even better experience than I had expected.</li>
      <li>; really pissed her off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>everything looks good,  the only thing I have to say that&#x27;s not completely positive</li>
      <li>I will be sure to recommend this product to other people.</li>
      <li>and i will continue my orders with you, four thumbs up and a big smile from this guy.</li>
      <li>LARGER VARIETY ALSO VERY FAST SHIPPING WILL TELL OTHERS ABOUT THEM</li>
      <li>The two blacks it comes with were only about half full, But the colors were very vibrant and ink packs very well.</li>
      <li>I order this after all the reviews i had read were favorable and i have to say the colors are vibrant and hold very well.i plan on trying more colors from scream but will probably use another seller.about half of the bottles were only half to 2/3s full.way more room than just an empty headspace in the bottle.i</li>
      <li>I like most artists have black in larger quantities</li>
      <li>the tat is faded but completely there, I give it till the end of summer</li>
      <li>I Have Been a Professional Tattoo Artist</li>
      <li>and wow the colors pop.</li>
      <li>I have Recently Used The Dodger Blue Super Red</li>
      <li>Colors come out vibrant, except the white.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews, anyone who thinks these inks are expired clearly can&#x27;t understand English, the date on the bottom is the manufactured date,  I was concerned about the packaging</li>
      <li>it arrived quick but was missing the white ink.</li>
      <li>Two weeks later you could barely see it..</li>

<li> Not one of the bottles were sealed, half of them are 2/3 full, and their nowhere near thick.</li>
<li> the black ink seems to be ok for shading and some line work but the collors are weak and seem to fade soon as the tattoo is healed.</li>
<li> I think some of the other people that complained of &amp;#34;half full bottles&amp;#34;, may have not taken the time to realize they only appear half full.....until you shake them!</li>
<li> I will be likely to purchase again and hope they step it up a little bit.</li>
<li> Yeah it came with the box their in the picture with, but it was crushed leaving the bottles to fend for themselves.</li>
<li> World Wide Tattoo Sent me ink bottles</li>
<li> , i was worried cuz other reviews said that it arrived damaged and half empty bottles</li>
<li> I received it in half the time we had anticipated.</li>
<li> 1 star only cause it makes me in order to post the review otherwise negative 5!</li>
<li> that&#x27;s not okay.</li>
<li> i am not sure if i was sold a KNOCK OFF and intend to contact the company</li>
<li> Too say I&#x27;m unhappy with this purchase would be a major understatement, I&#x27;m furious!</li>
<li> The absolute worst packaging ever, I mean who puts ink in an envelope and not even a padded one at that.</li>
<li> WHICH GENERALLY A TOUGH COLOR TO SHOW ON SKIN.</li>
<li> ink really stinks in the skin colors</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad</li>
<li> i do not recommend this to any self respecting tattoo artist or even a beginner. :(</li>
<li> i am so disappointed and will NOT order this ink ever again.</li>
<li> You guys should stop selling this crap cause even you don&#x27;t give it any respect since you ship it like the garbage it is anyhow.</li>
<li> very bad choice.</li>
<li> horrible service</li>

    <li> this ink is one of the best i have just tested it out on a piece of white paper and wow the colors pop. cant wait to get the 43 pack of the ink. xD</li>
    <li> World Wide Tattoo Sent me ink bottles and their were only 2 out of 10 ink bottles properly sealed. When I received the package the box was all damaged and the post office had to re package it. Their were also finger print marks from the ink on the outside of the bottles....horrible service I would never use this to ink someone, I would not go with this company I have been waiting for over a week for 1 reply from the company and still have not heard back.</li>
    <li> One of the best inks on the market. Comes with the most common colors, which can make most any color. Colors come out vibrant, except the white. I use Startbright for whites and pinks.</li>
    <li> THESE COLORS ARE VERY BRIGHT EVERY CUSTOMER IS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. WILL SOON ORDER LARGER VARIETY ALSO VERY FAST SHIPPING WILL TELL OTHERS ABOUT THEM</li>

    <li> This ink runs with the best of inks I love it nice brute colors and blacks that really pop. good ink</li>
    <li> The ink was expired when I purchased it.... that&#x27;s not okay. .. I would never suggest buying this product. ..</li>
    <li> The colors that came with the ink set came out better than I had originally anticipated. I will be sure to recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> I think some of the other people that complained of &amp;#34;half full bottles&amp;#34;, may have not taken the time to realize they only appear half full.....until you shake them! Contents settle, overall good value for money.</li>
    <li> They are bright and mix well when you need to develop another color.  They go in well and heal nicely!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews, anyone who thinks these inks are expired clearly can&#x27;t understand English, the date on the bottom is the manufactured date,  I was concerned about the packaging yeah the box isn&#x27;t going to be in a museum lol but the contents were just fine, all my colors were full,  everything looks good,  the only thing I have to say that&#x27;s not completely positive is I would personally like 2 more colors rather then more black,  I like most artists have black in larger quantities and I prefer  Kira sumi.</li>
    <li> Love this ink. Bright and bold colors...I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> this ink is of exceptional quality for the price, i liked it enough to order the 43 color pack, i just wish those had been 1oz. bottles as well, RECENTLY I SAW A VIDEO CLIP THAT EXPLAINED THAT SCREAM REQUIRES THAT THE NEEDLE BE DIPPED IN WATER AFTER EACH DIP IN THE INK TO GET THE BEST PERFORMANCE OUT OF THE INK, IT NOW WORKS BETTER THAN EVER</li>
    <li> I order this after all the reviews i had read were favorable and i have to say the colors are vibrant and hold very well.i plan on trying more colors from scream but will probably use another seller.about half of the bottles were only half to 2/3s full.way more room than just an empty headspace in the bottle.i did however like the the \\&quot;rattle\\&quot; in the bottle to mix the ink like in a paint can.Good ink,Bad Bottling.</li>
    <li> i am so disappointed and will NOT order this ink ever again. i am not sure if i was sold a KNOCK OFF and intend to contact the company BUT the ink caps LEAK and don&#x27;t even close properly. AND some of the tips are cracked and leak ink ALL THE TIME. very bad choice.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO INTENZE INK IN MY OPINION YO, THE COLORS HOLD UP AND POP VERY WELL! ESPECIALLY THE &amp;#34;SILK WHITE&amp;#34;. WHICH GENERALLY A TOUGH COLOR TO SHOW ON SKIN.</li>
    <li> The absolute worst packaging ever, I mean who puts ink in an envelope and not even a padded one at that. Yeah it came with the box their in the picture with, but it was crushed leaving the bottles to fend for themselves. Not one of the bottles were sealed, half of them are 2/3 full, and their nowhere near thick. Too say I&#x27;m unhappy with this purchase would be a major understatement, I&#x27;m furious! I&#x27;m just gonna buy quality ink from now on so I don&#x27;t feel raped out of my money. You guys should stop selling this crap cause even you don&#x27;t give it any respect since you ship it like the garbage it is anyhow. Well I guess money is money no matter who you rip off to get it huh guys? 1 star only cause it makes me in order to post the review otherwise negative 5!</li>
    <li> nice color assortment.  hold up well in the skin</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get product cause ink really stinks in the skin colors it&#x27;s just like there name scream ink run when u see it.</li>
    <li> this ink is awesome, goes in good and  heals up great. would buy this ink again, recommended this ink to my co workers</li>
    <li> this ink was very cheap and pretty much what i expected. it arrived quick but was missing the white ink. the black ink seems to be ok for shading and some line work but the collors are weak and seem to fade soon as the tattoo is healed. i do not recommend this to any self respecting tattoo artist or even a beginner. :(</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time. Packaging did looked like they kicked it the whole way. The two blacks it comes with were only about half full, But the colors were very vibrant and ink packs very well. Do like the rattle feature in the bottles. I will be likely to purchase again and hope they step it up a little bit.</li>
    <li> this ink was great!!! it arrived on time and was in great condition, i was worried cuz other reviews said that it arrived damaged and half empty bottles but when i got mine the box was in perfect condition no leaks and full bottles, and it heals nice and bright and so far no fades, thanks a lot and i will continue my orders with you, four thumbs up and a big smile from this guy.</li>
    <li> This ink goes in and stays in! No spreading, no veining!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin got a tat on the arch of her foot from another artist because I would not do it.. She is stubborn.. Two weeks later you could barely see it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I told you so&amp;#34; really pissed her off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad so I agreed to give it a try, that was 2 months ago and the tat is faded but completely there, I give it till the end of summer and it will be gone completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know tats, you know how big of a testimony that is to this INK... Hands and feet are a  NO NO..</li>
    <li> If have to give 5 stars on the shipping i offered it on Monday night and it was here Wednesday Morning ... the Bottles Are Great Size For The Price And The Packaging Is quality! I have Recently Used The Dodger Blue Super Red And The Silk White ... All Held Great And Went In Smooth ... I Have Been a Professional Tattoo Artist For  4 Years And I Would Definitely Recommend This Product To Others... You Can Look Up My Work On Facebook @ AllStar Tattoo Or @ Obeyy Kiddinkk ... thanks For The Great Service!</li>
