    <li> This Pick Worked Perfectly With My Hair.</li>
    <li> This pick is over priced and my natural hair is not very fond of it. It can be purchased everywhere else for much less. I saw it at Sally&#x27;s and my local beauty supply store for a dollar and change. I would suggest purchasing the metal long toothed comb. It&#x27;s cheaper and works better.</li>
    <li> My son loves the design.</li>
    <li> This is just like the one my mom had when I was younger.  I am happy with this purchase.  It is not more or less sturdy then other picks out there.</li>
    <li> A pick is a pick so the expectations can&#x27;t be that high for pick, however that being said, there was white writing on it. Big white lettering on it at that.  That was not cool and not at all what I expected, that is not reflected in the picture.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Everyone got a kick out of it when I gave it to them as gifts.  Fist is to small, but over good.</li>
    <li> I bought this pick for my son because he is really into the throw back 70&#x27;s era and he seems to be very pleased the purchase. I would suggest it for anyone looking for a nice pick at a great price.</li>
    <li> well made. I advise this to all how have Afro hair it works great.</li>
    <li> This groovy pick is about as smooth as you can get on the dance floor, baby. Pick it up and rock it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and his big curly hair. I originally bought as a joke but he loved and even wore to school and got many compliments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap plastic comb pick ,not much can be said about it other than it works.  My twins which are  4 yr old and I and 14 yr old daughter natural hair are thick and curly Now detangling became a Breeze ~~because of this pick not too much pulling of hair because that process weakens and breaks it out we have nappy hair  A tip don&#x27;t let hair dry out after you use conditioner are on non wash hair days you use the hair lotion whatever moisturizer used ~use pick right after it make&#x27;s ~your&#x27;s and children hair easy to manage no crys : ) . Love it, love it, love it. The color black is nice and goes with everything  and the tips are soft on our scalps If by some miracle this one I purchased breaks I&#x27;ll be back to buy another just incase you&#x27;ll would like to know it is A&lt;br /&gt;7 inch Afro Pick. Love your item Mayabeauty</li>
    <li> It did the job when I had my Fro.</li>
    <li> better than the picture! Very fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I just got the pick in the mail; it only took three days which was great.  It is, as another reviewer has said, like the picks I had growing up (70&#x27;s).  I needed to replace the one I had from high school (!) which I use for general combing of natural hair.  I like the fact that the tines are sturdy but also that the plastic has a little give to it so it is not rigid.  This is how my original one was so I am so happy that I was able to get one that was similar. (I was wondering why there were so many reviews for a simple hair item but I now see why--this is really good quality).  And the white writing that someone referred to:  it says &amp;#34;Salon Elements CHINA&amp;#34; across the front but it is not huge and is not a problem for me.  The fist is awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb for my wife.  Its a quality built plastic comb that reminded is of when we were kids.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old grand son in the winter likes his hair uncut now we are thinking how to come it i went on line the first thig pop up! it was a wrap</li>
    <li> A part of the laminate part began peeling not too long after buying. Still is able to pick my hair out, but don&#x27;t like that issue that happened after shortly  buying it.</li>
    <li> YuH!  Mah hair is so fly now, so soft....wicked fro!  and i&#x27;m lookin cool with mah black fist in da back pocket</li>
    <li> When i switched from the pick i WAS using over to this one, everything changed in the way I picked!  I enjoyed it SO much more, alot less pain was involved.  Ir&#x27;s also very sturdy, i was never dissatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Very healthful for my beard.</li>
    <li> wonderful product and expedited shipping results!</li>
    <li> The very best pick for afros&lt;br /&gt;Must have for big poofy afro typed hair</li>
    <li> I give 5 stars because this pik is sturdy, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and the design is nice. Well to me it is. Haha I highly recommend to people with thick curly wavy hair textures. I&#x27;m mixed with two or more races (white,black,&amp; etc.) if that helps anyone.</li>
    <li> In true throwback Thursday style, this afro pick looks just like the one I remember my dad having back in the day. I love the fist shaped handle and how easily it is to grasp it. It glides through my hair easily and while the teeth on his were metal, I&#x27;m still very satisfied with how my &#x27;fro looks after using this pick.</li>
