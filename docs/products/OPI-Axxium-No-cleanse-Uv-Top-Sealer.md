      <li>Honestly the kind of nail product I&#x27;ve been waiting for my whole life.</li>
      <li>If you are able and willing to do your own gel manicure, nothing beats OPI products.  </li>
      <li>Then along came my Christmas wish for OPI Axxium No-cleanse Uv Top Sealer and a UV light.</li>
      <li>my nail shop laughed ay me that i would pay this much for something that does not work..</li>

      <li>Cracks easily and has a burning sensation when finishing under light .  </li>
      <li>Lets just say, removal was a huge pain.</li>

      <li>AS THERE ORIGINAL SOAK OFF GEL SYSTEM AXXIUM.</li>
      <li>here I sit, the morning before New Years Eve, filing away at my once long, strong, beautiful nails because OPI didn&#x27;t see fit to put any sort of consumer warning on their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this sealer on my nails I can use straight acetone to remove even the most stubborn glitter in no time.</li>

      <li>Its also came out better when I used a regular top coat first and then the product.</li>
      <li>This is a nail laquer that is cured on with a UV light and lasts for between 2-3 weeks completely chipless and is easily removed with ACETONE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it ♡♡ perfect, shiny,hard doesnt crack and dries soo smooth and perfect. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is not meant for natural nails. It is meant for gel nails or acrylic nails. Do your research before buying it. Clearly you have the internet to buy the product now do the research behind it. There is nothing wrong with this product if it is used correctly. If your not a nail tech don&#x27;t use it!!! You are clueless and stick to your bi-weekly manicures and save us all the headaches of your dumb @$$ reviews. PLEASE!! It&#x27;s not product error it&#x27;s your error</li>
    <li> I recently started going back to the salon for manicures and asked many questions about the OPI Axxium products vs. acrylic nails (which aren&#x27;t for me).  This product is meant to be used in conjunction with the OPI Axxium soak-off gel, which comes in many OPI colors, and is not meant to be applied to bare nails.  When used correctly, it is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> i wouldnt recommend this product to anybody...dont waste your money...it does not work...the people @ my nail shop laughed ay me that i would pay this much for something that does not work..it is suppose to keep your nails looking white, it didnt, they turned yellow!!  bad investment</li>
    <li> I read the previous customer review and was left shaking my head that anyone who wished for the axxium system did so without ANY understanding of the item. This is a nail laquer that is cured on with a UV light and lasts for between 2-3 weeks completely chipless and is easily removed with ACETONE. My nails have lost none of their previous strength. Filing them is ridiculous and harmful...OBVIOUSLY! And applying this with the intent to remove it a few hours later will probably strip your nails of moisture therefore harming them. It&#x27;s like washing your hair...using shampoo once a day is ok...five times a day will make it dry and brittle. There is a TON of info on the net on safe application and removal and the OPI axxium kits come with DVD&#x27;s and instuction books. Do the research and use the products properly and responsibly...you&#x27;ll love these products as much as most of us devotees!!! Enjoy...I AM!!! And to the unhappy camper who gave this a 1 star because of her own stupidity, you are supposed to rate the product, not your ability to screw it up!</li>
    <li> It cracks really bad after one day. It&#x27;s really not worth the $10. But it does give a nice shine that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I use this with my LED light from Gelish and it cures perfectly! I think this has a better shine than Gelish top it off, but thats just my opinion.</li>
    <li> so much better than having to use alcohol and cotton balls!</li>
    <li> This is my go to gel to use over my acrylics that I do at home and its also easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have had acrylic nails for many years and I have had colored nail polish over the years.  The last few years I went to a new manicurist and she did the french nails with the natural or soft nails look and than added the gel coat and I sat under a UV light for about 4 minutes my nails are nice and shiny and are hard and I can say that I very rarely break at nail. That is great news as it cost about $5.00 to repair a nail.  OXXIUM---O-P-I. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose and I am sure you manicurist will love it too.  Oh, yes you can&#x27;t use it on regular nail polish. I purchased this from Amazon and it was less expensive through them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them forever, and love them. THey&#x27;re clear and glossy, and dry up quickly under a UV light.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known this product existed when I first started doing my own acrylics. For over a year I used nothing but non-acetone remover for fear of melting my nails with acetone. Lets just say, removal was a huge pain. With this sealer on my nails I can use straight acetone to remove even the most stubborn glitter in no time. Also helps protect my acrylic from water damage to prevent lifting. I will use this as long as I have acrylics!</li>
    <li> This topcoat is amazing. Holds my 3d nail art on and doesn&#x27;t come off. Staple product. Had bought two extra so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This goes on great but cracks after 2 days. To its credit I put it over gel polish on my natural nails, so I cannot say for sure that its no good.</li>
    <li> I use this on acrylic nails. if you are going to use this over regualr polish you must give the nail polish at least 24 hours to fully dry and cure before applying this top sealer, or it will crack. It is also, not for soak off nails/nail gel, but work just fine over other gels, just not soak off. It also has a slight yellow tinge to it, so I would not use this over white or really light colors.</li>
    <li> If you are able and willing to do your own gel manicure, nothing beats OPI products.  I am thrilled with this.</li>
    <li> Axxium opi gel topcoat is amazing! Nails stay super shiny the whole time! Drys in uv dryer in one minute and no cleanse.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s super shiny and provides an excellent top coat with no inhibition layer. Clients are ready to go as soon as it cures. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This is good for a shiny finish on top of acrylic or gel. I use it after filing and it fills in any little dips. I&#x27;ve noticed on some gels it looks like it yellows the white gel. I think CND Brisa shouldn&#x27;t be used with this.</li>
    <li> perfect top coat for acrylics. as a nail tech this is the only one i use. arrives super fast and much cheaper than in stores.</li>
    <li> Great top coat I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> This product burns when you put it in the lamp to cure.  When i say burn i mean it really hurts.  I won&#x27;t use it on my natural nails again just over fake nails from now on. : (</li>
    <li> Until this morning I had long, beautiful nails that I was proud of. Then along came my Christmas wish for OPI Axxium No-cleanse Uv Top Sealer and a UV light. Wish granted ... nails RUINED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere in this item listing or on the bottle is there any warning that this product CANNOT and MUST NOT be used on natural nails, or that the only way to remove it is to FILE IT OFF thereby destroying your natural nail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A phone call this morning to the OPI company where I spoke with Nail Technician Terri got me this; \\&quot;you&#x27;ll have to file it off, it wasn&#x27;t meant to be used on natural nails, you should&#x27;ve known that.\\&quot; Just HOW I was to have known that remains a mystery, though Terri did go on to say this product wasn&#x27;t meant to be sold on Amazon (she claims it&#x27;s illegal) and that it&#x27;s only supposed to be sold to \\&quot;professionals\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, there is NO WARNING on the bottle or in the listing or in the product packaging to indicate any such thing. That OPI would sell or allow to be re-sold a product that RUINS natural nails is apalling and tremendously disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I sit, the morning before New Years Eve, filing away at my once long, strong, beautiful nails because OPI didn&#x27;t see fit to put any sort of consumer warning on their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER recommend this product and I will NEVER use an OPI product again. SHAME ON OPI!!!</li>
    <li> i put this product on my natural nails and i couldnt take it off not even with pure acetone. im sure its a good product for fake nails but dont put it on natural, i had to cut mine down to the core.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. It cracks after a day so then the polish chips. it leaves nails harder than some leading gel cures and I wanted to love it but I dont. Also let it be noted that it has a STRONG chemical odor.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better than others i have tried. I like that there is not a sticky residue. Helps my real nails grow too!</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I had the worst nails ever! I always got gel nails and I would spend almost $100.00 a month and then the no chip system came out and I started getting my nails done with the no chip it was great but was getting very expensive. So I purchased the set myself and have been doing it ever since! I must agree that it has not harmed my nails IF YOU USE IT CORRECTLY! You need to have patience with the product and carefully follow the instructions. Why would you not use this product? It&#x27;s wonderful and is easy to remove IF AGAIN YOU USE IT CORRECTLY!  I have had nothing but complements when it comes to my nails. I even use it on Pedicures and it lasts and is awesome.</li>
    <li> this product is great it is designed to put on as a sealer over your opi gel do not use it on your natural nail as a normal nail polish!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have the OPI Axxium soak of gel kit and bought this top coat to replace the blue top coat bottle that comes with the kit (it accidentally was cured). This OPI Axxium No-Cleanse UV Top Sealer is for use with Axxium only, not Axxium Soak Off Gel nails. Look on OPI website for difference between the two systems(basically Axxium is for artificial nails nails/tips, Axxium Soak Off Gel is for natural nails). I used this top coat with the soak off gel system- could not get the gels off, even after soaking nails for two hours in pure acetone. OPI should have named the two products something more different. Bottom line-if you use the OPI Axxium Soak Off Gel system, only use the blue top sealer, stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> I have read other reviews, and I realized the ones that gave a bad rating just didnt know what they were doing. So I had to try the product myself, and after watching nail technicians, I learned alot through trial and error. If you are complaining about cracking then your using to much of the product. Also removal can be challenging if you dont know what your doing....but it took me less than 10 minutes to remove using a nail drill gently to remove the gel coat and then pure acetone to remove the rest. Its also came out better when I used a regular top coat first and then the product. You dont have to put it under the UV light immediately,  but it comes out better if you give at least 1-2 minutes before curing. Im stocking up on this product.  My advice is watch some tutorials on youtube before giving a bad rating. After 3 weeks I havent seen any cracking or chipping.  I love this product, OPI got themselves a guaranteed customer right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Misfit and Lillie~</li>
    <li> Great product and great seller!!!!</li>
    <li> Over the years Ive tried several different top coats and by far this is the best. Very hard to chip if properly applied and dried an extended time.I recommend Not going home and doing dishes or giving the kids/pets a bath, so your polish has time to cure. I love this product and I purchased 6 when I ordered.</li>
    <li> Hello,    The Opium Axxium No-Cleanse whas at my door with in 10 days. That&#x27;s ok. Only one bottle whas broken and gave a lot off mess in the small package.    Joanna</li>
    <li> I use this as a top coat for acrylic nails and it never yellows, looks like glass and holds the shine for weeks!</li>
    <li> After spending so much money at the nail salons I decided to get my own nail gel instead of going back to the salon for a touch up. I always get pink and white with the gel over it. The gel makes my nails last for weeks. So.. when I saw this I thought I could save some money and extend the nice look of my nails. The gel is very oily and will not dry. I looked at the UV dryer they use in the salon but that runs about $50.00. I was just very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product at firs but when i arrived I was more than pleased.  1 thin coat did the job.  For all you do it your selfer&#x27;s, I highly recomend the OPI Axxium No Cleans Uv Top Sealer.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first, but then my nails would crack and chip off. I stopped using because maybe product got old. Used as a clear over natural nails to test and did the same thing, but not on all nails.Not sure what to say.</li>
    <li> First time using Axxium No-cleanse Top Sealer, I am very pleased with the out come.  I used with my UV dryer, very nice. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was really satisfied with this product.I will keep using it. love it and it was on time sooner than a thought</li>
    <li> Terrible! Cracks easily and has a burning sensation when finishing under light .  Would not recommend .. Buy any other brand</li>
    <li> What an amazing product!  I&#x27;ve been using acrylic nails and then using this as the topcoat, put under a uv lamp for 3 minutes and it protects the nail for many weeks.</li>
    <li> It dries fast which helps for those who are constantly on the go, however it dries hard and can shatter if you use your hands a lot to wash dishes, gardening, vacuum, and do laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product but would be better if the formula allows for some flexing as one goes from dry to wet and dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline&lt;br /&gt;Santa Clara, CA</li>
    <li> Great for use with artificial nails. Leave them perfect and shiny everytime!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I love gel polishes but hate that most top coats have to be cleaned with alcohol or the nails are sticky. This product applies just like regular top coat, dries quickly under UV lamp, and NO CLEANING necessary!!! That makes doing my nail so much quicker, nicer and less messy. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. It cracks after a day so then the polish chips. it leaves nails harder than some leading gel cures and I wanted to love it but I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is what is used in nail salons.  I liked how the polish stayed so I bought this product &amp; very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve found I really love it.</li>
    <li> Just used for 1st time, will update on how long it last.</li>
    <li> This is a professional use only product meant to seal uv gel extensions or acrylic nails to give it the finish shine. This is a acetone resistant product which means it CANNOT BE SOAKED OFF TO BE REMOVED ONLY FILED OFF. This product is not meant for natural or soak off nail services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI MADE THE MISTAKE OF NAMING THERE UV PERMANENT GEL SYSTEM THE SAME NAME AS THERE ORIGINAL SOAK OFF GEL SYSTEM AXXIUM. only difference is color of the bottles. Since then OPI has made changes and renamed there soak off gel system named gel color products are in OPI signature bottle shape and not in plastic pods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed nail tech in NYC for 20 yrs specializing in artificial nails.</li>
    <li> OPI says it all!  I am a new DIY acrylic nail lady who is tired of paying out 60.00 a month for her nails.  This helped make the nail process easy to choose a known name!</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat for acrylic nails. It looks like I had them done in the salon when i do them at home. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This top coat is really great! It&#x27;s a hard gel and not meant for natural nails.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years &amp; it has always worked great. This last bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up well at all. Clients complain that it looks dull and has cracks in the sealer. Upon inspection they are correct, after about 1 week the product cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used on my gel nails to keep my gel manicure shiney tip my next appointment.</li>
    <li> This topcoat is nice since you don&#x27;t have to cleanse it with alcohol, but the trade off is that it cracks like glass very easily.</li>
    <li> works great like any and everything OPI.  It helps that you dont even have to wipe after using this product</li>
    <li> I have tried many UV gel cured sealers and they sucked! I love this product being that it has been a long journey finding a good quality sealer. It goes on quick and easy, dries quickly, no mess, looks beautifully shiny.... What more could a girl ask for?! Absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Opi is the best! Works amazingly! My nails are done better then when I go to the salon!</li>
    <li> amazing cant find anything bad to say quick cure non strong smelling very shine and great no cleansing after your manicure</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.  Will look for some items in the future.  Seems to me, I can convey my satisfaction in less words thn you expect.  Take it or leave it!</li>
    <li> the top coat cracks like glass! not good!</li>
    <li> I have the whole DYI kit and bought this for the &amp;#34;no cleanse&amp;#34; part.  I used the gel polish with the base coat and normally use the opi gel top coat and thought this as no cleanse it should be good too.  Well it dries very nicely and look oh my very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;However, unless all you do is sit around and sit around it&#x27;s not for you.  If you are one that has to wash dishes, clean, have pets, drive a car, type a lot, cook or any other real activity, this isn&#x27;t for you.  The very nice shiny top cracks if you use your hands too much.  I was told that I should have stuck to what I had or ordered the blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this is not for the gel nails, this is for acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> This baby works like a charm!! So far I&#x27;ve only used it on acrylic nails I must say. I cure it in a 32 watt UV lamp for about 4-6 min depending on how dry my nail polish was when I applied the topcoat. The product gives any nail color or design a high shine that makes you nails look irresistible! The color last way longer than any ol topcoat. Honestly the kind of nail product I&#x27;ve been waiting for my whole life. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more</li>
    <li> The product is good, however I bought 2 bottles, one will not stop leaking, and the other the brush fell in the minute I went to use it for the first time.  Good product otherwise, just be careful when you open it for the first time to make sure that the brush is secure.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!!!!!and it works in led!!!! It&#x27;s awesome!!! Finally I have been searching for something like this</li>
