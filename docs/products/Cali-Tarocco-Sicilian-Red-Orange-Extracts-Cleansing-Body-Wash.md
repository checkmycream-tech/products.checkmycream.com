      <li>Love the fragrance of this body wash!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>The aroma is amazing and everyone who smells it asks where to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff cleanses well and is very refreshing, even after many uses.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked it more if the lather were richer.</li>

      <li>Used this shampoo while on vacation, ordered a bottle and still love it</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love the scent</li>
      <li>My favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>and I am glad Amazon had it.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I purchased a bottle for $6 not the full price!</li>
      <li>I first discovered these products as samples at a hotel in Las Vegas and fell in love immediately!  </li>
      <li>Without using a conditioner this shampoo is easy on the hair and hold its light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Item met my requirements based on the description as detailed in the ad shown on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My husband seems to really enjoy this body wash.</li>
      <li>You smell nice AND get clean with this particular wash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But worth every penny I assure you !</li>
      <li>an actually soap that happens to be nice smelling on top of it all.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Had whiffs of nice smell, but nothing special and definitely nothing that had any staying power.</li>
      <li>They are very good products and the scent is unique and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Very gentle soap.</li>
      <li>Really lathery now !</li>
      <li>A customer mentioned that no matter how much product they used this body wash did not lather up.  </li>
      <li>I also find this product does not dry my skin and will most likely buy Tarocco Body Wash again.</li>
      <li>He highly recommends the product.</li>
      <li>However, the box for this Amazon fulfilled order was too big for the contents; one of the glass bottles of some vitamins I ordered had many layers of bubble wrap; the other had zero bubble wrap but soap remnants on it.  </li>
      <li>As mentioned by another reviewer, while the scent (to me) is extraordinary, the actual body wash is nothing that different from anything else you can buy in the grocery store.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much you put on your sponge, it doesn&#x27;t lather up like my regular body wash does.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper to buy similar products in any store</li>
      <li>Only gripe I have with this particular soap is - it does not lather well.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very subtle and combined with the lotion, you feel and smell good all day long!</li>
      <li>Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin ( thanks to the olive oil ).</li>

    <li> Arrived on time and was as advertised</li>
    <li> I first discovered these products as samples at a hotel in Las Vegas and fell in love immediately!  The fragrance is very subtle and combined with the lotion, you feel and smell good all day long!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> If you like the lotion this is great! Without using a conditioner this shampoo is easy on the hair and hold its light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Too expensive, not worth the cost. Similar items exist for fraction of the cost. Much cheaper to buy similar products in any store</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the Cali products. Love the scent</li>
    <li> You smell nice AND get clean with this particular wash.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I&#x27;m a bar soap adherent but this is one of the few body washes I&lt;br /&gt;like.  After using Tarocco products (the shampoo especially) at a hotel (the&lt;br /&gt;Virginian in Arlington VA), I sought this out and started home use.  I also&lt;br /&gt;recommend the shampoo.  Make note, this is not a perfume or a deodorant,&lt;br /&gt;but an actually soap that happens to be nice smelling on top of it all.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
    <li> A set of products by this company was in a hotel where I stayed once. I have since purchased several items from this line. They are very good products and the scent is unique and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item. Item met my requirements based on the description as detailed in the ad shown on Amazon. Would recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband seems to really enjoy this body wash. He highly recommends the product. The body wash has a Fragrant orange smell and is good for both women and men.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo while on vacation, ordered a bottle and still love it</li>
    <li> smooth to the skin, not drying and has a good arroma when using.  I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> Took a lot of pumps into my loofah for it to work up enough foam to cleanse myself. Had whiffs of nice smell, but nothing special and definitely nothing that had any staying power. There are plenty of body washes out there, save your money and skip this one!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my mom on her birthday every year. I haven&#x27;t used it myself, but I can tell you it smells amazing! Honestly, I hate most smells, but I can just sit at her house and smell her shampoo constantly.</li>
    <li> As mentioned by another reviewer, while the scent (to me) is extraordinary, the actual body wash is nothing that different from anything else you can buy in the grocery store.  Thankfully I purchased a bottle for $6 not the full price!</li>
    <li> A customer mentioned that no matter how much product they used this body wash did not lather up.  I, too, thought that was a problem until yesterday.  But, when I adjusted my water temperature about 2-5 degrees warmer (I have a very expensive mixing valve with temperature control) and it lathered up so much I felt like Lucy in the washing machine segment on TV.  What a difference just a little change made on how this lathers.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Had it in a hotel a while back and I am glad Amazon had it. if its tossed sideways in a bag it will leak a little.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash. Very gentle soap. Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin ( thanks to the olive oil ). The aroma is amazing and everyone who smells it asks where to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only gripe I have with this particular soap is - it does not lather well. You have to use alot of it to get a good lather. To remedy, I usually mix 1 part soap to 3 parts water to water down the soap. I shake up the container and voila ! Really lathery now ! It also helps to stretch the soap out. Because lets face it, this stuff isnt necessarily the cheapest soap on the market. But worth every penny I assure you !</li>
    <li> This stuff cleanses well and is very refreshing, even after many uses.  However, the box for this Amazon fulfilled order was too big for the contents; one of the glass bottles of some vitamins I ordered had many layers of bubble wrap; the other had zero bubble wrap but soap remnants on it.  The shampoo was in two separate zip lock bags but the Body Wash was by itself without a bag.  The lid on the body wash was not on very tight and some of it escaped in the box, rendering the box useless for using again and leaving some soap residue on some of the other items in the box.  Certainly the shipper can do a less sloppy job at this.  I am not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this body wash!  I also find this product does not dry my skin and will most likely buy Tarocco Body Wash again.</li>
    <li> I would have liked it more if the lather were richer. No matter how much you put on your sponge, it doesn&#x27;t lather up like my regular body wash does.</li>
