      <li>this is the best out there</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>My BEAUTIFUL Dolly Wink lashes were 100% ruined by this GARBAGE.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>We started off good then upon drying</li>
      <li>thank you...very good</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>The absolute best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply with the brush.</li>
      <li>very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Best clear adhesive I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is much more sticky.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I use to suck at wearing eye lashes not any more.</li>
      <li>Better than the tube duo.</li>
      <li>Ok so I bought this adhesive based on the reviews, and we&#x27;ll all I gotta say it, it stings my eyes.</li>
      <li>if you add more it might look a bit shinny</li>
      <li>This is, hands down, the best eyelash adhesive you will ever buy.</li>
      <li>but I feel like my review is important.</li>
      <li>I heard good things about this and needed something for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>and I thought it was cool how the formula changed color (whether intentional or not).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reviewing this particular eyelash adhesive because it RUINED my lovely Dolly Wink lashes.</li>
      <li>Gentle, flexible, easy to apply, my lashes have stayed on up to 3 days with this glue.</li>
      <li>latex-free formula is safe for contact lens wearers and sensitive eyes.&amp;#34; I do like that</li>
      <li>I think I will have to practice brushing on the right amount.</li>
      <li>No mess to clean up!</li>
      <li>Sure can hold my eyelids to the skin above them, though.</li>
      <li>so I can make the eyelashes stick exactly where I want them.</li>
      <li>DeleVery was on time, better than the blue duo, quick dry and easy to apply</li>
      <li>I love them and love how they look and have been experimenting A LOT lately and on the hunt for some extremely light weight lashes and glue that doesn&#x27;t give me an almost instant reaction.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about adding to much.</li>
      <li>and when you take them off just gently  pull off your lash frm corners😉</li>
      <li>This also got stuck in my real lashes.</li>
      <li>This adhesive is really great for applying false eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Easy, no mess applicator brush makes putting it on your lashes a breeze, the glue changes from white to blue to indicate the exact time to stick it to your eyelid, and then goes perfectly clear for a sleek, stylish finish to your look.</li>
      <li>I got worried after seeing the completely watery consistently.</li>
      <li>The only thing is the glue starts drying around the top of the bottle making it tough to screw the top on.</li>
      <li>Works great, I  usually use the standard white glue in the tube.</li>
      <li>came early..</li>
      <li>I apply it directly to my lids</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the positive reviews and that people kept mentioning that it had better ingredients or a lack of bad ones (i.e. formaldehyde), but I can&#x27;t really tell what the ingredients are in this item because there&#x27;s no listing on the box or the product or the website.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even consider my eyes to fit the classic profile of being &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; but when it comes to false lashes, forget it.</li>
      <li>turning blue and then clear</li>
      <li>The glue dries up instantly and no mess.</li>
      <li>I usually got the eyelashes on my eyes between the first and 30th time before completely trashing the eyelash.</li>
      <li>I put such a small amount on because I read reviews before using it to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t mess up.</li>

<li> there&#x27;s no fishy smell like the other DUO eyelash adhesive and that it does turn blue then to clear after application.</li>

<li> I highly recommend it, clear and a thin layer will do it.</li>
<li> I spent the rest of the day feeling like I was in the middle of a sand storm.</li>
<li> i found this one is easier to use than the blue one and pink one.</li>
<li> I like this glue a lot and my eyelids don&#x27;t get red or irritated like other brands that contain formaldehyde.  </li>
<li> It seemed as if it didn&#x27;t dry.</li>
<li> It does work all day but it never seems to really dry.</li>
<li> This glue compared to duos other glues is it doesn&#x27;t dry fully and has a post it note type stickiness that continues on which is easier for me</li>
<li> In comparison to any other eyelash adhesives including the smelly DUO</li>
<li> Alot less mess when putting on lashes.</li>
<li> and it felt sticky even after a few hours.</li>
<li> I PROMPTLY ripped the lashes off (carefully of course) but it was too late for the glue.</li>
<li> stays on forever with little glue!</li>
<li> So use a generous amount of adhesive and hold it there for longer than usual to get it to stay.</li>
<li> I had a hard time getting the ends of the eyelashes to stay on.</li>
<li> I really hurt from this stupid stuff.</li>
<li> i mean no lifts or anything like that .....</li>
<li> This itself is bad enough to warrant the one star review.</li>
<li> Just brush a small amount across the lash line on the fake lashes</li>
<li> But the worst part is that it BURNED my skin and eyes SO bad almost right away.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so irritated and sad.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to get off your eyelid even with soap and water.</li>
<li> So, so painful.</li>
<li> Just awful...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use to suck at wearing eye lashes not any more. The glue dries up instantly and no mess. I don&#x27;t have to worry about adding to much. This is my second bottle, I like to keep one extra in my purse, but since I got this I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about them falling off.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best eyelash adhesive you will ever buy. Easy, no mess applicator brush makes putting it on your lashes a breeze, the glue changes from white to blue to indicate the exact time to stick it to your eyelid, and then goes perfectly clear for a sleek, stylish finish to your look. You&#x27;ll never use another brand of glue again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used the Duo in the tubes up till now.  this is so convenient to use and it seems like it is tackier then the regular duo.  I will be using this from now on.  Alot less mess when putting on lashes.</li>
    <li> DeleVery was on time, better than the blue duo, quick dry and easy to apply</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I apply it directly to my lids so I can make the eyelashes stick exactly where I want them.</li>
    <li> does not seem to work for me!</li>
    <li> i found this one is easier to use than the blue one and pink one. 2nd time purchase of it.</li>
    <li> came early..thank you...very good</li>
    <li> The absolute best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gentle, flexible, easy to apply, my lashes have stayed on up to 3 days with this glue. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I heard good things about this and needed something for sensitive eyes. I am a makeup lover and wearer daily-mascara, eye shadow, liner.....the works. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider my eyes to fit the classic profile of being &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; but when it comes to false lashes, forget it. I love them and love how they look and have been experimenting A LOT lately and on the hunt for some extremely light weight lashes and glue that doesn&#x27;t give me an almost instant reaction. We started off good then upon drying it felt like I had just glued pelican wings to my eyes with rubber cement.....then came the itchy, watery, red nightmare. I PROMPTLY ripped the lashes off (carefully of course) but it was too late for the glue. I spent the rest of the day feeling like I was in the middle of a sand storm. Even after rinsing and eye drops, the irritated itchy feeling remained. I am bummed and was hoping this would solve my issues. *SIGH* Back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this elsewhere but I feel like my review is important. At this point, I&#x27;ve almost never reviewed products. I&#x27;m reviewing this particular eyelash adhesive because it RUINED my lovely Dolly Wink lashes. My BEAUTIFUL Dolly Wink lashes were 100% ruined by this GARBAGE. This itself is bad enough to warrant the one star review. But the worst part is that it BURNED my skin and eyes SO bad almost right away. I put such a small amount on because I read reviews before using it to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t mess up. I got worried after seeing the completely watery consistently. It is way too sticky and doesn&#x27;t even hold the ends close to the eye. Sure can hold my eyelids to the skin above them, though. So, so painful. I just want to cry. I&#x27;m so irritated and sad. I really hurt from this stupid stuff. Eww. I actually have fairly long lashes. This also got stuck in my real lashes. What is this stuff? Just awful... I hope the pain will go away soon... ;___;</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it, clear and a thin layer will do it. if you add more it might look a bit shinny</li>
    <li> very tiny. very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of an eyelash apprentice. I usually got the eyelashes on my eyes between the first and 30th time before completely trashing the eyelash. This glue compared to duos other glues is it doesn&#x27;t dry fully and has a post it note type stickiness that continues on which is easier for me so I can manage to get the lashes on</li>
    <li> Best eye lash glue .  also comes in a brush style application</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this adhesive based on the reviews, and we&#x27;ll all I gotta say it, it stings my eyes. 👀💦 and it felt sticky even after a few hours. It seemed as if it didn&#x27;t dry. Gave it 3 🌟 because it got here on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews and that people kept mentioning that it had better ingredients or a lack of bad ones (i.e. formaldehyde), but I can&#x27;t really tell what the ingredients are in this item because there&#x27;s no listing on the box or the product or the website. The DUO website only states &amp;#34;This latex-free formula is safe for contact lens wearers and sensitive eyes.&amp;#34; I do like that there&#x27;s no fishy smell like the other DUO eyelash adhesive and that it does turn blue then to clear after application. Instructions don&#x27;t mention anything about it turning blue and then clear, just says to wait 30 seconds before adhering, so I waited 30 seconds. In comparison to any other eyelash adhesives including the smelly DUO this adhesive is weaker. I had a hard time getting the ends of the eyelashes to stay on. I&#x27;ve tried this twice already today with different eyelashes to compare. So use a generous amount of adhesive and hold it there for longer than usual to get it to stay. I think I will have to practice brushing on the right amount. Otherwise, I like the cleanliness of using a brush to apply, the lack of fishiness and I thought it was cool how the formula changed color (whether intentional or not).</li>
    <li> Better than the tube duo. stays on forever with little glue!</li>
    <li> This adhesive is really great for applying false eyelashes.  Just brush a small amount across the lash line on the fake lashes wait about 15-20 seconds and put them on.  No mess to clean up!</li>
    <li> Works great, I  usually use the standard white glue in the tube. This is much more sticky. It does work all day but it never seems to really dry. It&#x27;s always sticky to the touch and it&#x27;s very difficult to get off your eyelid even with soap and water. It is very easy to apply with the brush.</li>
    <li> I like this glue a lot and my eyelids don&#x27;t get red or irritated like other brands that contain formaldehyde.  The only thing is the glue starts drying around the top of the bottle making it tough to screw the top on. I wish it was in a squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> Love this! Best clear adhesive I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye glue everrrrrr🙊 it holds all day and night wont come off at all this is the best out there i mean no lifts or anything like that .....no burning whats so ever and when you take them off just gently  pull off your lash frm corners😉</li>
