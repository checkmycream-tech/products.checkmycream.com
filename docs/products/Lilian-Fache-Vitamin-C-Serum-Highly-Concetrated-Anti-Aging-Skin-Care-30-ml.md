<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful packaging and it arrived very quickly.  After using this product, which I received for my honest review, I have to say that I really like it.  It&#x27;s made my skin smooth and my under eye circles have dramatically lightened.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this product free on line to try out.  I really like that fact that it leaves your skin smooth and it reduces puffiness under the eyes.  I started to use it during the day under my makeup but then changed it to using it at night before going to bed.  I have found that it works  better that way overnight.  I wake up with even less puffiness.  I truly like the product and look forward to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. I did receive a free bottle of the serum and after a few days of use I could see a reduction in fine lines under my eyes. I am very happy! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it, at first I thought it is thick, but then I noticed that my skin absorbed it really well! It is my my first day, but I can tell how good it is. I want to wait for a week or two to edit my review then!</li>
    <li> Im leaving a 3 star review to be revised in a few weeks. I recieved this product at no cost to review with my honest opinion and frankly having been sick with a sinus infection and allergies my face tends to take a beating and while I can say I have nothing negative to say,  I also need a few weeks to reevaluate the product. It wouldnt be fair to say otherwise. But at this juncture I  can foresee positive results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every night for two weeks and the skin under my eyes is much softer. I think the dark circles are starting to go away as well. The bottle is pretty big and will last me a while. Definitely worth the money, I will certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the first vitamin c serum that I have seen that targets the undereyes. I love it! It feels wonderful when you massage it under your eyes. I have very oily skin but dry undereyes. After a few days of use I already feel a difference. I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use so I can see a difference.i did receive this product for review but it would not change anything. It seems to really be working!</li>
    <li> Go on nicely seems to be working&lt;br /&gt;ok need more time to give it to work&lt;br /&gt;It feels good.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I get rashes easily, when stressed or when low quality cosmetical products touch my skin. I have been trying this Vit C product, as I received a sample for free, for a few days. For the moment I did not experiment any reaction against it. It is a good product to use in the mornings if you are in a rush, as it absorbs quickly, so you can place your make up after a  minute or so as there are no oily remains. My eyes skin seem to be more terse and my puffy eyes have also improved. I am happy with this product and will use it again.</li>
    <li> I use it only for a week, so no big changes in appearance of my skin, but I have to admit that my skin became very-very soft.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for one week and can already see a difference in my skin tone. It is brighter. Can&#x27;t wait to see further results as I use this serum!  I&#x27;m recommending this vitamin c serum because  it goes on smoothly,  a little goes a long way and it works beautifully all over face and neck. Seems to be helping with firming as well.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to post this review so I could get a good idea about this product.  I like that the product is light feeling and absorbs well.  The smell is nice.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  I don&#x27;t necessarily like this as far as an eye serum.  The serum sort of plumps up my skin.  This bothers me under my eyes, perhaps because I have allergies and this made me feel like I had an allergy attack.  However, I actually like this on my forehead wrinkles.  This plumps up my wrinkles, making them less noticeable.</li>
    <li> purchased this to try it out, but ended up giving as a gift and they are enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Great serum! Happy with transaction.</li>
    <li> As a 72 year old woman, I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  However, this under eye serum has been a pleasant surprise.  It smoothes those tiny wrinkles that are developing under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and am so pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks and it is amazing.  It feels good on your skin and really does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  It&#x27;s easy to use-just gently apply.  My skin looks and feels better.</li>
    <li> This is really good vitamin C serum to use on your face. The main reason I got this serum is because I heard it works on acne. I use it on my face and back to get rid of my acne and so far I&#x27;m seeing results. I feel like I don&#x27;t need to wear make-up when I use this serum because it makes my skin look brighter. When I apply is on my face it is absorbed fast and easy. It leaves my skin soft after I use this product. I do have sensitive skin mainly on my face and this serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;m very happy with my results so far. I received this vitamin C serum free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a week now and I love it. After researching the benefits of vitamin C and alpha-hydroxy acid, I was looking for a product that delivered these in its purest form and highest potency. My face is beginning to show the signs of aging and my goal is the stop it in its tracks! My first application is in the morning, after I wash my face. The application is light and easily absorbed into my skin. I am using this around the delicate skin around and under my eyes as well as on lip lines around my mouth. Immediately after applying, my skin feels refreshed and and tighter. In my research I found that vitamin c helps generate new cell growth and the alpha hydroxy acid helps with repairing the skin&#x27;s tone and texture. This &amp;#34;one, two&amp;#34; approach is in alignment with what I am wanting to affect on my face so it seems like the perfect product to reach my goals.  (I plan to update the review in a month with more review notes.) My decision to try this product was based on the reviews and my desire to have a product with high efficacy. I want results and feel that after a week, I am on my way to getting those results. So, after I use the serum in the morning, I apply my daily moisturizer and long that they work so seamlessly together. In the evening, my routine is the same: I wash my face, dab the serum to the zones I am trying to &amp;#34;anti-age&amp;#34; and then apply my overnight moisturizer. Seems to be working brilliantly together. I will update my review in about a month with more detail but for now, I am loving the Vitamin C Serum by Lilian Fache!</li>
    <li> I was asked to review vitamin C under eye and skin care facial as part of I love to review company.  Well after only using it for one week- I have to say that I really like it.  I apply it to under and around my eyes every day in the morning and night.  Occasionally I put it on my dark spots- pregnancy spots!!  Ultimately in just one week I&#x27;ve noticed that everything looks brighter and more refreshed.  Can&#x27;t wait to use this after I start micro needling!!  Great product will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying the serum in the evening. Feels nice</li>
    <li> I just Love it! i&#x27;ve used a lot of products for my skin condition but i havent have the results i have with this vitamin c...my face is getting clear around the nose and chin (was always red  and irritated) this have help me to heal the areas, and under the eyes are even better, i look younger..what i like the most? the quality and the price goes toguether!</li>
    <li> Ordered this randomly: too soon to fully review.  After 3-4 days I don&#x27;t see any miracles yet, but do see a lil less darkness and bagginess under the eye area and that&#x27;s a good start! Hoping as I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks or months there is even greater improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum. I have tried others which made my skin very tight. This one does not. It just leaves your skin smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> I try a lot of facial products, this is one of the best vitamin c serums that I have used yet.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used it on your eyes and lips, and talk about works magic for dark circles. It absorbs really fast and easily. The vitamin C leaves your skin feeling light and fresh with no greasy or oily residue. That is always a top priority of mine. So far so GREAT... I&#x27;ve even had friends and family notice a difference; I can&#x27;t wait to see what a month or two will do.</li>
    <li> Used few times and seems to help.  Will see with long time use and revisit this review and let you know further.  Received as a discount for helping to give reviews.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that Vitamin C is good for your health and when applied to the skin it becomes a powerful antioxidant with superior anti-aging properties. The higher the dose of Vitamin C, the more powerful of an antioxidant it becomes. As a licensed Cosmetologist I can tell you that aging and sun damage cause the skin to lose elasticity. Using Vitamin C serum helps increase collagen production in aging skin, prevents wrinkle formation and restores skin&#x27;s elasticity. With its heavy-duty antioxidant properties, Vitamin C serum has been shown to protect against ultraviolet sun damage, and has the ability to repair existing sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C serum from Lilian Fache contains 25% vitamin C, which is one of the more potent serums on the market. This serum helps brighten the dark circles, improve hydration and firm skin around the eye area. In addition to Vitamin C, this formula also uses AHA (alpha-hydroxy Acid) which is used to rejuvenate the skin. AHA works mainly as an exfoliant by causing the cells of the epidermis to become &amp;#34;unglued&amp;#34; allowing the dead skin cells to slough off, making room for regrowth of new skin. AHA combined with Vitamin C helps to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin which helps eliminate wrinkles, roughness, and help heal sun damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a just a few short weeks, I have noticed a considerable improvement in the tone and texture of my skin. Lilian Fache makes a very rich, thick Vitamin C formula that works extremely well. I love the fact that it comes in an amber bottle, which keeps it from oxidizing and an eye dropper so that I have control how much I use; it also helps avoid contamination as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I received a complimentary bottle of this wonderful Vitamin C serum by Lilian Face in exchange I would test the product and post my honest and unbiased opinion here in this review. All statements made reflect my own personal opinion and experience using this Vitamin C serumand I would absolutely, without a doubt, recommend this product. I have to agree with this product&#x27;s description, it is &amp;#34;youth in a bottle&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Sticky serum.  I was surprised to see the sticky serum.  I did not read all the critical reviews prior to buying.  I put it on all over my face last night.  It bothered my eyes a little bit and took long time to dry before putting on night cream.  When I woke up this morning, my face is a little bit sticky.  I am in my mid-50&#x27;s but have the look of early 40&#x27;s.  I have been trying to preserve what I have and so far so good.  I think I will continue using this serum around and under my eyes and use my other very good Vitamin C serum for my face.  Aloe Vera might be the reason this serum is so sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this serum goes a long way expectations.im using tiny amount to put in either small lines areas, or face and neck, your choice.i&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days, but i see the results my skin appears to have a better tone.i this purchase upon promotion in my own honest opinion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand and thought I&#x27;d try yours and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I&#x27;m very fair and prone to sunspots on my 60+ skin. It&#x27;s brightened my skin and most of the time I don&#x27;t use any other face cream with your choice serum.</li>
    <li> I was very eager to try this product. I am on day 10, using the serum. Twice a day, morning and eve.  I have used a handful of other&#x27;s, this one has given better results then the last.  This product is clear &amp; fragrance free. It is very hydrating, it makes your skin very soft. If Your suffer from &#x27;bag&#x27;s &#x27; or dark circle&#x27;s, due to age or like me lack of sleep. Then this is a MUST have. Apply, rub in, dries quickly, then off to start your day or even just to crawl back in bed and be lazy.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free or a reduced rate in order to give an honest opinion.  To be honest I was skeptical about this product.  After using it for a week, I am pleasantly surprised.  It does seem to reduce lines around my eyes.  My trouble with this product is that it leaves a very sticky residue that I do not like.  I find myself trying to wash it off after awhile because of the sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and brand. Received it quickly! I&#x27;m only a week into using this product. Feels great on my face.. Too early to notice any results.</li>
    <li> My wife says she can feel the difference on her skin. She loves it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a big fan of Lilian Fache products! I received this&lt;br /&gt;vitamin c serum, free of charge, for my unbiased opinion...&lt;br /&gt;I own and have tried several vitamin c serums... They are all a&lt;br /&gt;little different.&lt;br /&gt;This particular one, comes in a brown, glass bottle, with an orange&lt;br /&gt;label and a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;It does not really have a scent, just a faint, sort of&lt;br /&gt;producty smell- that fades..&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be in more of a gel form, which&lt;br /&gt;actually, on me turned into lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It did not upset my skin, and I liked the way my face feels when I&lt;br /&gt;use it....</li>
    <li> High quality product! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I got the Vitamin C Under Eye and Skin Care Facial Serum by Lilian for my mother to try on her skin, here is her review: She liked the light feeling and that it didn’t leave a sticky residue behind. The bottle comes with an eye dropper applicator which makes for easy usage (less chance of spillage), just a drop on your finger tip and gently message into areas of concern - eyes, nose, mouth and chin. I have noticed that her skin is looking better, now I want to try it on my dark circles under my eyes!  I did receive this bottle at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any highly visible difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a week and already notice a difference in my skin. Good price for the amount u get. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! Saw results right away.</li>
    <li> There are twenty ingredients listed on the label of this serum with Vitamin C listed as the very last ingredient.  It would appear that vitamin c is a very, very minor portion of this serum.  The label clearly states it is a &amp;#34;Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; and also states &amp;#34;High Potency Eye Area Serum.&amp;#34;  Agreed, it does not state what is high potency but &amp;#34;Purified Water&amp;#34; is the first ingredient and I seriously doubt it&#x27;s potency.  In my opinion, this product is very misleading and had I read the ingredients I would not have made this purchase.</li>
    <li> 2015/08/24 - bought this for my mother, day one of applying it immediately saw results. it fills in the wrinkles. used it on myself and noticed a sticky feeling (haha convinced it must be some kind of glue). i&#x27;ll update if anything changes, but so far mom&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
    <li> Did not bother my sensitive skin. Seemed to help my acne and with my dark circles.  Nice smell and feels nice on my skin and does seem to be helping my skin.  I really like this product so far i have not broke out in an allergic reaction. i received this free in exchabge for an honest reveiw.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I have been using this for about a month now. Day and Night i hardly notice a difference for my eyes and his there is no difference what so ever. This is not a good product for dark circles and puffy eyes, maybe for wrinkles but even then barley noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love it. I received it as complimentary for review.It makes my face glow, and I will recommend to try it.</li>
    <li> I couldnt use the code, it kept saying cannot use the code for this product.</li>
    <li> awesome product. love it.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad serum,  but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the others I have tried.  I like the consistency, which is almost a gel, but it smells like tempra paint and is a little sticky on the skin.  Mine actually strings a little from the dropper when I remove it from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that concerns me is the inconsistent information on the amount of vitamin C in the serum.  The title says 25% vitamin C; in the Q &amp; A, a company rep says 20% vitamin C; but the package lists vitamin C as the very last ingredient.  There are about 20 ingredients listed,  so it is impossible for the bottle to be 20% vitamin C, unless what it is actually saying is that a 20% solution of vitamin C was used, in which case the amount of vitamin C would be negligible and the title would appear even more unclear.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and I prove it really works mine, I used daily and there is a big changes in my skin , I love it, proven and tested product, excellent, and it&#x27;s worth it. I love this product it freshen my face and looks great now.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this vitamin C. It goes on a bit sticky but it dries soft. It makes my skin feels so smooth and soft. The lines around my eyes and forehead look finer and my pores appear smaller.  It smells so good. It&#x27;s not as thick as a serum should be, but it works.</li>
    <li> This Lilian Fache high potency Vitamin C is organic and contains a very light, fresh fragrance.  We purchased the Serum in a promotion for testing and review,  The serum glides on nicely without sticking and quickly absorbs into the skin.  After application, it gives a bright and radiant.  This is an excellent serum to use after applying a face mask, exfoliating or waxing since it is lightweight, moisturizing and does not irritate skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome vitamin c serum. Within a week of trying i can tell a major improvement in my skins texture and dark spots. Will definitely be a part of my skin care regiment. Thanks for letting me review this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised and pkg was sufficient. Looking  forward to purchasing  this product again.</li>
    <li> I do think this serum is great stuff! I am turning 62 next week and have been using this for about a month, and just reordered some more yesterday. It applies very nicely and has helped my fine lines enormously! I&#x27;ve used it on my hands too. It&#x27;s really helped keep those darn old age spots in check.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..5 stars, my face and neck love it.....great service. Thank you...</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c serum, it has tighten and brightened my under eye area. It smells nice too. It comes in a glass bottle with a dropper so it&#x27;s easy to use. I dod receive it to review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little under a week and it has really improved things so far. It seems to help not only with lines and signs of aging but also with darkness under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I was given this product In exchange for a review. Such a great product!! I am very pleased at my results.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed too! Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Easy packaging, good product, gives skin dewy youthful complexion without redness. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I believe it is as effective as some of the more expensive Vitamin C products that I have tried .</li>
    <li> I was given this product free for review and have been pleasantly surprised with the results. It arrived on time and was package securely. The serum is not heavy or greasy and rubs in quickly. I have only used it for about a week, but have already noticed some tightening of the skin, which is amazing. I will continue to use and would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and give it to my mom. Few days after we noticed reduce fine lines under and sides of her eyes. Cant wait what it can do in the next few weeks after using this one. This serum works wonders and magic.</li>
    <li> Really like the serum and am happy with the results.  However, I feel I need a little more moisturizing than a serum can provide. I feel serums, although &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look dry on the skin.  That has been my experience with most serums.  I like this vitamin c serum and will continue to use in conjunction with a cream moisturizer</li>
    <li> my skin loks and feels great.. Other c serums make me break out.. This goes on so clean and just soaks in.. Fantastic product I will keep buying!</li>
    <li> so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I like oz naturals better for serum, thought I would try a new serum, just didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> This product deserves five plus-I keep waiting for it to quit working!  Bought retail in June and nails kept growing!  Like Amazon price better and delivery!  I use-it gives me nails!! Almost a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and have been using it every night for a couple of weeks. Noticed my frown lines over my eyebrows are gone! This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful serum. It helps with small wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t take much just like a pea sized amount will go along way! I of course am not seeing any results as of now but I&#x27;ll leave another Review in a couple of weeks! But it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell so that&#x27;s a plus, very oily of course but so far so good!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I noticed a difference after the first day!  Also, it was shipped very quickly.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, i noticed lines were starting to fade away within a week of using it. I would recommend this to my freinds and family.</li>
    <li> I recently got a facial and was told I need to start using a vitamin c serum to help lighten dark spots, do I was so happy when I found this serum! A natural way to help my skin, goes on light and pleasant smell with no color or stickiness. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using it. My skin looks healthier and my skin tone has evened out.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Feels delicious on your skin!</li>
    <li> I have received my product. It works very well under my eyes and I like the results</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything. I have tried other vitamin c serums that really help with skin issue like acne and such. This did nothing! Nothing at all! I wish I could return it but can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll stick with Mary Kay or Mario badesu vitamin c serum since they work well for me.</li>
    <li> I ride a motorcycle and the wind damaged my face. As soon as I started using my eyes and skin looked 10×s better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. I&#x27;m recommend!!</li>
    <li> Very nice on skin. No break outs which is something I have a probably with because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Great product amazing customer service</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, I&#x27;ve noticed my dark under eyes and acne scars lighten up a a bit in the last 2 months of use. Ive also been using a rose hips oil in combo to this serum and the combo has really helped brighten and hydrate my skin without breaking out. I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff&#x27;. Really works.</li>
    <li> This product makes my Skin feel amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this off and on for about a month.  I can&#x27;t really see any difference in my eyes at this time.  I am hoping for a change in the near future.  It feels good and easy to apply.  I bought it to use under my eyes.</li>
    <li> By FAR this is the single best skin care product I have ever purchased. And being a female...I have purchased many items.  I even worked in Cosmetics and Nordstrom for years and was able to use many skin care products.  Last year I moved to high desert.  About a month ago I looked at my face and I thought...you look old!  The lines were much deeper and I was so dry.  I am dry anyways, always have been but when I put lotion or cream on it is instantly absorbed.  I bought this product and not only does it take a while to absorb...but it actually absorbs!  Meaning...I can SEE the hydration!  I bought it and told my friend at work that I was trying it...I got the idea from Dr. Oz and with a wild stab in the dark I chose this product. I told her...watch my skin and see if you can tell a difference.  3 weeks later I am convinced and super excited.  I just bought another one for myself and one for my friend.  Incidentally, I was so excited that I thought...spending more money must mean a better product.  I bought another brand off Amazon for just shy of $40.00 and this one kicks it&#x27;s butt! I swear...if you have dry skin that is hard to hydrate this is the BEST PRODUCT!. I truly even see lessening of wrinkles, shrinking of pores and my skin tone is evening out.  I am definitely liberally slathering it all over my face. More than they say to use.  But the results are awesome! I only use it in the morning...I get a sticky residue, probably due to the amount of product I am using but if I wash my face with a bar of soap it still feels hydrated after.  Before a bar of soap would have made my skin feel like it was about to crack and burst open it dried my skin so much.  I know I am just babbling now but my goodness this stuff actually works!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product,however,I don&#x27;t like how sticky it stays on my skin! But if it does the job, I&#x27;ll deal with it! It can&#x27;t be worn under make-up because it&#x27;s so sticky! I won&#x27;t  be able to use it twice a day as the manufacturer recommends,so it may take longer before I see any results. Will write a follow up review next month.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good Vitamin C serum. It has no smell, which I like. Most of the products in this niche add fragrance to their products. This is a no-no for me. It is a bit sticky as far as the consistency is concerned. I don&#x27;t really mind this, but this may be a deal breaker for some people. It rubs off after it dries though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> First time using it , my skin fault so soft I love it</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything it said it would.</li>
    <li> A little sticky for my liking and a little definitely goes a long way. I need a Vitamin C serum for my skin routine but I don&#x27;t think this is it.</li>
    <li> This is the second product by Lilian Fache that I&#x27;ve used because I have been using their hyaluron topical serum for a while now and love the results so well I decided it was time to give their vitamin C serum a try. I was already using another vitamin C serum and have tried others in the past but for the price this one is very very good. The results are true and it definitely has given my face a nice glow as well. It also helps with my occasional breakouts to clear up quickly. My skin is softer after using and it doesnt leave any sticky residue. The 1oz bottle should last me over a month as little as is needed to cover my problem areas. I use a drop under each eye, around my mouth and forehead, and a drop on any blemishes I may have. The dropper makes for easy application and the dark bottle helps preserve the vitamin c and nutrients. I really like the results I&#x27;ve gotten and based on this would recommend this serum for anyone looking for an effective product at an affordable price. I was able to receive this first bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience after having tried it.</li>
    <li> I love the Serum, it blend into your skin very well , I haven&#x27;t use it for long so i have not seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> The order arrived in perfect condition. This is my first time using the product but it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
    <li> Great --don&#x27;t apply excessively</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Very, very mild. Smells a bit like the blowing-bubbles solution you give kids.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Leaves something of a mildly sticky film. Not surprising with glycerine and sorbitol as the second and third ingredients. Made my sensitive skin feel hot about 30 minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Probably best for dry skin. Too sticky for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No indication.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Amber glass bottle with glass and rubber squeeze dropper.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* None on my face or hands. Very dry skin on my upper arm looked moister and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* I’ve seen more impressive formulations (this one has a lot of fillers), but it does have three forms of vitamin C, peptides, silk amino acids, hydrolyzed silk protein, and extracts of thyme and chamomile. The product listing talks about AHA - maybe I’m blind but I don’t see that on the ingredient list. Note: Some reviewers have mentioned vitamin C is last on the ingredient list; there are actually three forms of vitamin C in there: Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citric Acid, and Ascorbic Acid. MAP, the most common form in skin care, is #8 on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

    <li> I&#x27;m still young but they say you have to start young.  So far I love the way it makes my skin feel. I guess that means it&#x27;s working or doing something.happy I received this free for review.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  A little goes a LONG way</li>
    <li> loved it, so difference in the skin from the first application.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day under my eyes and also on any trouble areas and am seeing a difference in how my delicate eye area looks! Less puffy in the am, no darkness.  The serum absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face feeling refreshed. I definitely have made Lilian Fache Vitamin C serum a part of my beauty regimen and am addicted! Thank you for creating such a gem!</li>
    <li> Got this for free as a promotion &amp; I absolutely love it! Been using it everyday since I&#x27;ve received it in the mail. Feels refreshing after along hard day. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received this product and was excited to try it since it does not contain harsh chemicals that can really dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets really dry from traveling and dry air, this really add moisture to my skin.  My eyes feel amazing and much less puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is comparable to much more expensive creams and serums, at about 30% of the price, try it you will be happy.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> I have tried other oils that seem to be thiner. This product is sticky but with lotion works alright. Not my favorite but does the job</li>
    <li> I saw improvement on my overall face within days, my skin looked more even and radiant. I am a new mom and I needed a quick solution for day and night that will make me look healthier overall (my new everyday routine really showed under my eyes and overall on my dull looking skin). This product worked sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> First, I like the citrusy smell, I usually put this after washinng face before putting foundation. I put it in lines and some blemishes in my face. I love that it absorbs well and have no problem with greasiness. I got this at a promotional rate to give review on the product.</li>
    <li> I I got this product for free to review. This did not affect my review in anyway. Very nice under eye serum. Felt smooth didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It arrived today on time but I think it was over packed in a huge box. I started using it and hoping for the best! Well I&#x27;m still using it and like its texture and how it feels on the skin but I still didn&#x27;t see much result, however I&#x27;m thinking of buying somewhere to see a better result by continuing.</li>
    <li> This stuff if pretty good. I put it on after I wash my face and then I use moisturizer with it. I then put my makeup on after. In just a few days the texture of my skin has improved DRAMATICALLY!! I have used many other vitamin C serums but this eye serum is something I am using all over my face and this formula leaves my skin hydrated and smoothed whereas others left it feeling dry and tight. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is overall much smoother and glows from the extra hydration. I think it had helped my complexion immensely! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has aloe, thyme and chamomile all that natural good stuff to reduce redness, shrink pores for a flawless appearance. You just need a tiny bit of the product so this one bottle will last a really long time, it&#x27;s an unbelievable deal for such a high quality product</li>
    <li> This product has a good consistency and its not too thick when you put it on. I like that it absorbs quickly so I do not have to waste time in the morning waiting to apply my moisturizer. I have always suffered with puffiness under my eyes and after using this product I have noticed a big change. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels softer and brighter since I began using this serum. I&#x27;m lucky I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review and I can say it works!</li>
