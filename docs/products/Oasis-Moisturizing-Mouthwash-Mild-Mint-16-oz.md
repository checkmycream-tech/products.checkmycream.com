    <li> Oasis mouthwash met my expectations.  I ordered this for someone else and that person swears by it.  It appears to be better than the biotene. I can&#x27;t tell you much more about it as I do not use it. .</li>
    <li> only product my wife uses</li>
    <li> The Best mouthwash for dry mouth, I have been on a lot of medication that causes dry mouth  and this is the only thing that really helps  and buying it on Amazon.com gives me the best price around</li>
    <li> The product has always done a great job keeping my mouth moist.  I use before I go the bed.  The only criticism tha tI have is that it causes my towlels to fade, if I whipe my mouth.  I have to keep an old towel hand handy.  I ruined several hand towels before I realized what was causing the issue.  I thought  I&#x27;d gotten bleach on the somehow.</li>
    <li> Oasis is the best mouthwash for my chronic dry mouth. It freshens first thing in the morning and when going out in the evening. It tastes better and lasts better than any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Using this every morning has almost completely eliminated my dry mouth problems. Highly recommended. This is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> All was fine.  I love this mouthwash and it is not available at my local CVS or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for almost 10 years. It&#x27;s convenient to order this product in bulk</li>
    <li> I started using this because of dry mouth, but after a while it became very hard to find.  I tried another brand but I did not like the taste.  I was very glad to find it on Amazon.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but at least I can get it.  Now I need Oasis Spray as well and you don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash was recommended to me by my dentist.  It is far superior to biotene and helps my dry mouth problem caused by medications</li>
    <li> I use an inhaler that is very strong and can cause thrust.  This mouth wash has protected me by about 98 percent of the time.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I recommend this mouthwash because it works and does not taste bad.  I use it all the time for my dry mouth problem.</li>
    <li> I use the mouthwash all the time it works great and was delivered when promised,</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry mouth.  This product Oasis does the job and taste better than any other dry mouth product I have tried.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I cannot find this product in any of the stores around me. I look everytime I go into a store that carries mouthwash. I had radiation treatment seven years ago, and one of the results was dry mouth. This is the best mouthwash I have found for it, and when I took a long shot and decided to look on Amazon, I was thrilled that they carried it. Delivery was on time, never a disappointment.</li>
    <li> the only one to use  can&#x27;t find it in any store</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Dentist after I have had surgeries that have left me with a dry mouth problem.  The other popular brand of mouthwash that I see everywhere has something in it that causes an allergic reaction.  This product works well for me, but I cannot find it in any of my local stores......</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash that you can find, in my opinion.  I used to buy it in a local convenience store; however, they discontinued selling it; so now, I buy it at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great taste (no, I don&#x27;t drink it :) ) and leaves your mouth very fresh.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mouthwash.  It is the only washwash I have tried that helps alleviate dry mouth, which I have as a side effect of several drugs I am taking.  It also tastes quite pleasant.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with dry mouth that cannot be solved by brushing or rinsing with water alone.</li>
    <li> Every Thing was great.</li>
    <li> For ANYONE plagued with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Stop searching, OASIS is the hands down best!&lt;br /&gt;100X better than that other brand that starts with &amp;#34;Bio&amp;#34; and feels like SLIME!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oasis is long lasting and very refreshing. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years now and still love it!&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;bigeasy</li>
    <li> It never fails... I find a product I like and then can&#x27;t find it anymore.  Not many people order mouthwash from the internet but I&#x27;m grateful to have found this much needed item.  Now I have a fresh, moist mouth!</li>
    <li> far better than the primary competitor brand.  have to order online as not carried in my local stores, well worth it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all my friends. My dentist suggested it for me, since I have DRY MOUTH and it works wonders for me.</li>
