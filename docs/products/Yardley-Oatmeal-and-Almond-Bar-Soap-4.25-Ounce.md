      <li>I have been using this soap for years and people frequently  comment on my beautiful complexion.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually pretty good at moisturizing your skin for a soap.</li>
      <li>I used to live in England and miss it a great deal some days), all I saw was the \\&quot;London\\</li>
      <li>The main reason I&#x27;m impressed is because I really see a difference with this, with my skin looking clearer and more even-toned.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite scented soaps, good value and soft skin is a result of the oatmeal..........</li>
      <li>it was great removed old skin and left a great gay smell</li>
      <li>It starts out sort of like mild vanilla-tinged oatmeal with maybe an almond hint, and with use turns more</li>
      <li>After using this soap once we noticed a huge difference in how our skin felt.  </li>
      <li>Smelled great, cheap, only drawback was its got literal pieces of almond which kinda hurt.</li>
      <li>is probably one of the important things when it comes to picking a soap, just the feel of the lather.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s - Animal cruelty free -</li>
      <li>It has a light oatmeal scent with a touch of almond.</li>
      <li>How this has really come in handy is for both travel and the gym.</li>
      <li>It is also lightly textured with oatmeal (but could never be considered abrasive).</li>
      <li>Yardley Oatmeal and Almond soap is simply fantastic.</li>
      <li>Com for offering the Add-On Program for reaching free shipping for purchases over $25.</li>
      <li>This was one of those chance buys to get free shipping here on Amazon which led to stocking up over and over.</li>
      <li>Yardley&#x27;s came into a much richer and creamier lather on its own than Dove</li>
      <li>Good old fashioned soap.</li>
      <li>This particular Yardley soap is definitely the best smelling.</li>
      <li>So Light and Fresh!</li>
      <li>If you want to feel good and small good you will like Yardley soap.</li>
      <li>After the first bar, I immediately ordered three more.</li>
      <li>originally picked this up on a spout of homesickness, (</li>
      <li>I bought it solely for hand washing, and my goodness, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>, Likewise I put one dove by the shower on the dish and another in it&#x27;s original box.</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft, smooth and has a nice smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>Dove is overall the best soap on the affordable market (Olay is better, but at 7 bucks a bar, not worth it, along with many other exotic soaps), but Yardley is still a good soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I knew right away that the scent would bother him because it was way too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>Yardley has amazing natural exfoliants that Dove lacks, which made my skin feel cleaner, but dove however does sell an exfoliating variety that I have yet to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It really moisten her skin and made it more smoothe.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good old fashioned soap.</li>
    <li> Edited:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a long time since I used Dove (Over two months when I wrote this review) and somehow I forgot about the Dove experience. I have deducted a star from Yardley, and change my conclusion. Dove is the superior soap, Dove is the only soap that leaves my skin soft, and it does not leave any tightness whatsoever, just like the more expensive body wash (Along with better moisture!). Yardley leaves quite a bit of that tightness that makes me feel sticky. Dove is overall the best soap on the affordable market (Olay is better, but at 7 bucks a bar, not worth it, along with many other exotic soaps), but Yardley is still a good soap.&lt;br /&gt;(Original review underneath)&lt;br /&gt;______________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally picked this up on a spout of homesickness, (I used to live in England and miss it a great deal some days), all I saw was the \\&quot;London\\&quot;, I&#x27;m usually particular when it comes to soap because it&#x27;s a long commitment, but, one sniff and that was gone. All of Yardleys varieties smell delicious, but this is the one I settled upon for now (The oatmeal just sounded so soothing, and it is!). This stuff smells amazing, this is, by FAR the best smelling commercially available brand of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After long, drawn out side by side testing of both the popular Dove Beauty Bar (the standard for bar soap, of course) and Yardley&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been attempting to discern which one was better, overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;The Dove beauty bar contains quite a bit of moisturizing creme (So much so that it&#x27;s not technically soap!), so this would appear to be hard for Yardley to come ahead just at first, however Yardley contained so many natural skin conditioners that it also made my skin just as soft as, if not softer than the Dove Beauty bar. They both left that certain tightness on the skin that all bar soaps do, I suppose that&#x27;s where the phrase \\&quot;Squeaky clean\\&quot; comes in.  I will note that the softness of Dove seems to last longer, however I can not be certain because I forgot an important variable, I used a different lotion. Yardley has amazing natural exfoliants that Dove lacks, which made my skin feel cleaner, but dove however does sell an exfoliating variety that I have yet to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:&lt;br /&gt;This is probably one of the important things when it comes to picking a soap, just the feel of the lather. I did this test without a loofah, just to get a pure idea of the soap. Yardley&#x27;s came into a much richer and creamier lather on its own than Dove did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look:&lt;br /&gt;While Dove has always helped me to maintain a good young complexion, Yardley added an extra \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin, which made me look perkier and overall better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;I never particularly liked the smell of Dove. It smelled like soap. Maybe it&#x27;s because Dove used to be the only bar soap I used, so, it just by default was only comparable to itself, but Yardly has an extremely good scent, winning this part by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Residue:&lt;br /&gt;This may go into feel, but, It seems to be something else, so it gets it&#x27;s own category. This is where Yardley&#x27;s lost some points with me. Dove leaves absolutely no soap residue (once more, it&#x27;s not technically soap, it&#x27;s a beauty bar), which gives skin a nice long lasting clean feel. Yardley&#x27;s, on the other hand, is soap. Which means it leaves soap residue, which by the end of the day can make my skin feel gross. This is a characteristic of all soap non-dove soaps, which is what sets Dove apart from the rest. It goes into the chemistry of soap. It&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melt:&lt;br /&gt;Neither Yardley or Dove melt like other cheaper soaps, This was tested vigorously because this is what chased me away from bar soaps for some time. I got two brand new bars of both Yardley and Dove, used all four to wash once, put one bar of Yardleys on a dish by the shower and the other bar of Yardleys in it&#x27;s original box by the shower, Likewise I put one dove by the shower on the dish and another in it&#x27;s original box. They were both left on the ledge for two months (And that shower is used at least twice, sometimes three times a day!). Considering it&#x27;s a smaller bathroom that gets hot easily, I really expected mush. The yardley&#x27;s was practicaly like the day I left it, both bars perfectly usable after a quick rinse (Dirt got on all four bars, but, that was to be expected), Dove fared usable, but not as well as Yardleys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I would drop Dove for Yardley&#x27;s in a heart beat if Yeardley didn&#x27;t leave that soapy feeling, but, I love so many things about both, I just have both and let my mood decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I compared Yardley with Dove soap, this is because of the vast popularity of Dove soap as the standard bar soap, and as the generally accepted best bar soap.t&#x27;s original box.

    <li> this soap company from London has been in business for over a 100 years.  I found this soap to be helpful in exfoliating skin, has a great scent, and mositurizes the skin as well.</li>
    <li> i love this soap! really soft for the skin, and i love the fragrance... i also use jergens almond &amp; cherry they have the same sweet &amp; mild scent, i bought this soap in walmart and its only $.99 !!!</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful.  Both my husband and I love it.  I have sensitive skin that is extremely dry and his job makes his skin dry.  I have always had to use either a lot of lotion after showering or oil so I wouldn&#x27;t look and feel dry and itch constantly and he would only use lotion if I forced it on him.  After using this soap once we noticed a huge difference in how our skin felt.  Now after using it just a few times, I only need a little lotion on a couple of places and he hasn&#x27;t had to use any at all.  It has a light, fresh scent that is delightful. It rinses clean and your skin feels fresh and soft and looks healthy and supple.  So that it will keep longer we put it in a mesh bag and hang it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft, smooth and has a nice smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I got this soap for a friend who has psorasis and thought it would help his itching and dryness...he hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to tell the difference yet, but hopefully it will later...it being natural, I&#x27;m hoping it will at least help some...it has a pleasant smell and if this doesn&#x27;t work, I hope someone out there can help me find a better soap...poor thing is in misery.</li>
    <li> The wife likes this soap and so do I.The kids now like it also.It smells nice and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son has eczema. I was tired of the medicated soaps and opted for something new and natural. This soap has done wonders for his skin. The soap is a little coarse to the touch it is soft scented and does not leave the skin with a film or residue. After one week, I have already seen a tremendous difference in his skin. Great product and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> Yardley Natural Oatmeal, and Almond soap is my favorite out of the Yardley brand. I don&#x27;t like to use any other brand of soap, because it&#x27;s not natural like Yardley soap. I usually go through a bar a soap a week. I can&#x27;t live without soap. I have to be clean, or it will make me go crazy. Yardley brand is the best bar of soap there is.</li>
    <li> The Yardley soap is a very good product overall.  It is lightly scented and coarse to touch.  The soap doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy scent or a build up of scum after one uses it.  Also, the soap lasts quite a while for those who are budget minded.  I would suggest a slanted soap dish to extend its life.  Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in my youth years and stopped because it became hard to find in retail stores in NYC. I found it and have stocked up on the oatmeal and almond. I also use it on my face, which was acne toned skin and it doesnt irritate or buildup any more oil. Love the produce inexpensive and the light scent is wonderful. I wish they had body sprays for each scent! So Light and Fresh!</li>
    <li> This product reduces the skins dryness and leaves the skin soft..product delivered as expected excellent condition would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Drugstore.com as an add-on item with a coupon that got me two bars for $0.89 each. I had never heard of Yardley and really just bought it because I needed a no-frills, basic body soap. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this ended up being surprisingly impressive for the price. It cleans well, as expected. It may be a bit drying, but I have dry skin and honestly can&#x27;t think of any soap or body wash (cheap or pricey) that hasn&#x27;t had this effect. The main reason I&#x27;m impressed is because I really see a difference with this, with my skin looking clearer and more even-toned. Besides that, it has a very nice smell. It starts out sort of like mild vanilla-tinged oatmeal with maybe an almond hint, and with use turns more sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happy to buy this again, and am interested in other Yardley soaps now as a result.</li>
    <li> Yardley Oatmeal and Almond soap is simply fantastic. The smell is wonderful and earthy, the best part is that it lasts throughout the day! I particularly love that this soap has oatmeal in it because it is a gentle exfoliant, which I definitely need. My skin is incredibly soft and I will definitely buy Yardley soap again! PS. Another bonus is that it is cruelty-free! &lt;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice soap, what else can I saybut if you insist I can make it upo, please I don&#x27;t have seventeen words to compliment this item</li>
    <li> I just discovered this soap and I love it- smells like marzipan and it is gentle on the skin.  Wow- I bought for everyone in my family.</li>
    <li> This particular Yardley soap is definitely the best smelling. It&#x27;s nice and calming if your skin gets irritated easily. This is the soap I recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this soap.  It lasts quite some time.  1 bar will last probably a month of normal use showering.  At about a dollar a bar, the cost is entirely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and cleans at least as well as Dove, or any of the major brands - probably better.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted residue.  it&#x27;s not much more expensive than buying &#x27;zest&#x27; or any cheap soap at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Lavender, and Lemon Verbena from Yardley as well.  Although I can&#x27;t say I dislike this soap at all, I like the others better.  So, I&#x27;ll probably not be getting this one again, if I do in small quantity.  Not because I dislike this, but simply because I like the others by Yardley somewhat better.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It has a slight gritty feel that is excellent for light exfoliation. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or melt easily. If you take long hot showers this soap will stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap, very different from the usual commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has neutral fragrance and acts like a mini scrub due to the almonds.</li>
    <li> Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;love this soap and have re-ordered many times</li>
    <li> I use this soap regularly, and typically get it at Walgreen&#x27;s. For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t find it at several different stores I visited. But I had no trouble finding it online. Since then, Walgreen&#x27;s has restocked it, but for my purposes it was very helpful to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, however it leaves residue that takes away from this product. Would not purchase again because of the huge residue this product leaves behind in tub</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful! I loved the price because it was very easy to add it on to my order.</li>
    <li> If you want to feel good and small good you will like Yardley soap. Try it and see what I&#x27;m talking about</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the Florida humidity, but I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a month and a half now and I LOVE IT! Everything from the smell to the way it moisturizes my skin; I don&#x27;t need to use lotion anymore. I&#x27;m about to order some from another amazon vendor that has it for cheaper lol.</li>
    <li> Hate it! opened it and threw it away. This smells like a very strong baby powder! Made me sneeze immediately upon opening it. I am very sensitive to certain smells. this bothered my nose as I said upon opening it. I bought it thinking I was buying a  mild, natural product. How in the world they made oatmeal and almond smell like baby powder is just not right! Almond is supposed to smells like cherries. Oatmeal should have no smell at all! I have made my own oatmeal and almond soap and it was very mild smelled faintly like cherries. Waste of my money!</li>
    <li> It really makes your skin soft. Has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit prone to dry skin, but find that this stuff works pretty well for me.  I especially like that it seems to rinse easily without residue.  The aroma is not unpleasant, although my wife doesn&#x27;t really like it, and so she doesn&#x27;t use this soap.  But it works for me!</li>
    <li> This was one of those chance buys to get free shipping here on Amazon which led to stocking up over and over. Not only does this smell absolutely delicious but it&#x27;s actually pretty good at moisturizing your skin for a soap. How this has really come in handy is for both travel and the gym. Especially travel where skin really likes to act up and taking colloidal oatmeal baths and tons of medicated lotions is pretty much out of the question. Or at least way too much of a hassle. This has enough oatmeal in it to exfoliate and soothe plus the smell makes anyplace smell homey. The downside, looking at the ingredients, is the almond in this is only fragrance and not a genuine addition. Something else sad is the leaping bunny logo has vanished making me wonder if Yardly is still cruelty free?</li>
    <li> Way to much fragrance for me.</li>
    <li> Smelled great, cheap, only drawback was its got literal pieces of almond which kinda hurt. Not to be a wimp or nothin</li>
    <li> We try many bath soaps in our house, looking for the *one* that we all agree on. Yardley Oatmeal and Almond is the that soap. While it may not be everybody&#x27;s absolute favorite, we&#x27;re all happy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mildly scented without being overpowering. It is also lightly textured with oatmeal (but could never be considered abrasive). Helps with dry skin during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only limited availability in brick and mortar stores, but worth trying if you see some.</li>
    <li> Great soap , inexpensive, smells great . Best of all  it&#x27;s - Animal cruelty free -</li>
    <li> My fiancé loved using this product. You might want to give it a try. It really moisten her skin and made it more smoothe.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because it does not leave residue on my skin. i would have given it five stars but sometimes the package it comes in is very big and I pay more to clear the item.</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve just got the Yardley Lemon Verbena at my local Wal-Mart. I&#x27;ve had eczema since I was little and it had gotten worse. I just tried it and it doesn&#x27;t leave that itchy feeling when I use other soaps so I hope it help with the eczema. Plus it has an amazing light scent and is only $0.96 here.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap so I would have enough for the free shipping. But I used the soap and really like it. I will be ordering more of it.</li>
    <li> I loved the oatmeal in it it was great removed old skin and left a great gay smell I felt 100% homo</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I have actually used this soap.  As soon as I opened the package, I was taken aback by the smell of this soap.  The scent is so strong, that I was afraid to put it in my bathroom where my boyfriend would have to smell it!  I knew right away that the scent would bother him because it was way too strong for me.  I have wrapped it in plastic and hope to give it away to a friend or donate it to charity at the next opportunity.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, it&#x27;s nice on your skin, but too much money because it melts very quickly in the shower</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years and people frequently  comment on my beautiful complexion.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the soap box was not sealed in cellophane.</li>
    <li> Great product! The experience was great! A solid product. I would recommend this to anyone who liks soap! It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I really love using it when showering and washing my face, love the scent of it! I would definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scented soaps, good value and soft skin is a result of the oatmeal.......... l love the almond scent</li>
    <li> I added this to my natural routine of washing my face and it is awesome! I have blackheads on my face and dry oily skin also and this soap helps get the job done. It makes my face feel nice and in the end my face looks clear and this soap smells good too. I love it. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Works up a good lather. Smells different from other soaps, but I like that because I can have a special smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap from a local pharmacy for a few dollars less than it is being offered for online. I bought it solely for hand washing, and my goodness, I&#x27;m not disappointed. It has a light oatmeal scent with a touch of almond. The soap lathes richly, so you don&#x27;t need much to wash with, and it leaves your hands soft, smooth and lightly fragrant. I am sure it would be luxurious for bathing. It is a bit coarse to the touch (as it is a mild &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; soap), but that isn&#x27;t the least bit bothersome.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for many years and find it to be the best I ever used..It would have got a 5 rating , but again one of the bars was crushed by faulty packaging..which seems to be happening more often now by all the on line stores...Poor Quality Control in the Packaging Department...</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well and smells great. One of my biggest annoyances with bar soap is when I put it on my loofah and the later runs out halfway through washing my body. I never have that issue with this soap. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this soap makes me itchy. I am now using the Yardley Lemon Verbena  and it is great for me. Walgreens has all the Yardley flavors for  $1.39 all the time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I usually use body wash, but I have used this soap twice this week and my skin feels so much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after I shower. I think I may have a new bath product that i love.</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly and it is very moisturizing.  Very happy with this brand and the sent.  Will order again when this batch is done.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It has a great scent and the little pieces embedded in the soap act as scrubbers and make the bar easier to hold.  After the first bar, I immediately ordered three more.</li>
    <li> This soap was fragrant and soft, I bought it as a part of a gift and it was a nice little addition at a nice price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, thick, luxurious soap.</li>
    <li> I do love these soaps.  Very inexpensive and they don&#x27;t make me feel like I washed with essence of fiberglass.  :)</li>
    <li> First, thank you Amazon.Com for offering the Add-On Program for reaching free shipping for purchases over $25. After reading other reviews, the decided to try this &#x27;flavor.&#x27; I am very pleased with the aroma and the after-shower feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap.  It has really helped his psoriasis!  I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from dry skin or other skin disorder.</li>
