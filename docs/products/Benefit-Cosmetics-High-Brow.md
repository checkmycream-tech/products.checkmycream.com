### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>This took a bit of a learning curve, but once I figured out how to use it I was impressed with the product.  </li>
      <li>The matte finish is perfect with any makeup style and powdered shadow can be applied over it if desired.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I bought one for my best friend as part of her birthday</li>
      <li>But im not too impressed.  </li>
      <li>goes on like silk and blends perfectly!</li>
      <li>Highlights perfect!!!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect makeup for under your brows.  </li>
      <li>A very good product.  </li>
      <li>It beautifully defines the bottom of your eyebrow, brightening the skin and by result, increasing the contrast of shadow and eye brow.</li>
      <li>I saw great reviews for this product.  </li>
      <li>Blends so great.</li>
      <li>So amazing!</li>
      <li>I love that it brightens up my face and this price is very good.  </li>
      <li>A bit too bright and a bit to mushy for me.</li>
      <li>Good shoping and think you</li>
      <li>With a great amount of blending it works ok.</li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>Makes you look more awake!</li>
      <li>It drags a bit too much against my skin, perhaps because I have drier skin, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it perfectly smoothed under my eyebrows without a bit of effort and additional powder eyeshadow to help the cause.</li>
      <li>Does a great job at highlighting and it can be used heavily on light and lightly while taking pictures.</li>
      <li>Nice and creamy, blends easily to a matte finish (no shimmer, which I like).</li>
      <li>follow it up with their brow wax-pencil(all available for a better price on Amazon!)</li>
      <li>Love highlighting my eyebrow arches.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite beauty products, I try to have this in my makeup bag always.</li>
      <li>but I wish it was a bit more blendable.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot more than eyebright.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it does exactlly what it says.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a great product!</li>
      <li>a great accent to your eyes, really contrasts with the eyebrow line the accent the contour of the face</li>
      <li>Be sure an apply it before you apply powder, it&#x27;s more blendable that way.  </li>
      <li>it really does make your brow bone more accencuated!!</li>
      <li>It is not as nice as the high brow glow, which is what I used to use and loved it.</li>
      <li>I bought high brow impulsively, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it once it was home - thinking it made me look</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and smudge with a brush.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>I use this all over my face as a highlighter in different places and it look great when blended.</li>
      <li>Great product for highlighting the upper lids</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and looks great.</li>
      <li>Since I first used it, I&#x27;ve been in love ever since.</li>
      <li>This is probably my 4th or 5th high brow pencil - I just use it right under my eyebrows ... works better than white/light eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>jam this on top and blend without stressing too much.</li>
      <li>This does a nice job of giving a natural highlight.  </li>
      <li>Very nice pink based liner.  </li>
      <li>While it looks great highlighting the upper part of the brow, it also looks good if you apply it underneath your eyeliner under your eye, takes away the harshness that dark undereye liner can have.</li>
      <li>My eyes seemed more open and my brows had better shape.</li>
      <li>However, you need to look in natural light to make sure you blended everything together.</li>
      <li>It blends so easy, really adds to your brow line.</li>
      <li>I have light but olive toned skin, very oily.</li>
      <li>I am blonde with fair skin so the slight peachy pink tone in High Brow is awesome for me.</li>
      <li>I get a better lift or def of brown,  but outline brow with plan white pencil and then blending it in.    </li>
      <li>I have purchased it before from the local beauty store, but its priced much better here.</li>
      <li>a great after fix too - shadow go too far or look too dark?</li>
      <li>i run it across the top of the outside arch as well and blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i have been using Benefit High for years!!</li>
      <li>I applied very heavily under my brow and it looked nice in evening light</li>
      <li>That said, I&#x27;ve taken the &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; out of some old ones and smooshed it into a little compact with great results.</li>
      <li>arrived exactly as described packed very well.</li>
      <li>So far, great product at much more reasonable price than Sephora or expensive department store.  </li>
      <li>This little crayon is amazing.</li>
      <li>Use this for a nice little highlight around the eyes.</li>
      <li>In addition to highlighting my brow bone, this comes in handy when I&#x27;m a little overdue for a visit to the brow bar by camouflaging stray brows that are growing in.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>very neutral so anyone can use it.</li>
      <li>It really works to brighten the eyebrow area.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Then I read a Cosmopolitan mag article where a celebrity make-up artist said her best secret was to use highlighter over undereye circles.</li>
      <li>it helps open up your eye and helps the brow do its job--frame your pretty face!!</li>
      <li>One: to other reviewers - you dont need to put this on top of a concealer, it&#x27;s meant for your arch.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>The color is a pale pink  which is pretty good for highlighting the area under the brows but the consistency leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little firm/dry for my very dry skin, but when applied over an eye cream, I&#x27;m able to blend just fine.</li>
      <li>Benefit cosmetics high brow pencil .&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Make sure its blended neatly or it tends to look a bit messy.</li>
      <li>I use this on the inner corner of my eyes and right beneath my eyebrow.  </li>
      <li>but I noticed on a photograph taken that you could \\&quot;see\\&quot; the big white spot under my brows with flash photography in dim light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft</li>
      <li>Only bummer is that I&#x27;ve never had uch luck sharpening it down when the product gets low, so I need to replenish more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and gives a fresh look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pricey but lasts a long time even with frequent use.  </li>
      <li>I left it alone for a week and it still never went back to normal.</li>
      <li>I dug out the High Brow and after using a layer of my regular undereye concealer, I dusted the High Brown in the dark circles and blended.</li>
      <li>In a pinch, when I want a more dramatic brow, I will still use it...</li>

<li> Also, the color is really pink.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still a pinkish hue, though not as pink as Benefit&#x27;s eyebright.</li>
<li> so be careful putting the lid on</li>
<li> I use everyday in the corners of my eys and at the outside corners.</li>
<li> Too me not worth it.</li>
<li> or it &#x27;smooshes&#x27; the tip down</li>
<li> I usually order it for HSN</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using my husband&#x27;s name for this. Hope he doesn&#x27;t mind. Hehehe. I am blonde with fair skin so the slight peachy pink tone in High Brow is awesome for me. I bought high brow impulsively, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it once it was home - thinking it made me look \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; so I threw it in a corner and forgot about it. Then I read a Cosmopolitan mag article where a celebrity make-up artist said her best secret was to use highlighter over undereye circles. I dug out the High Brow and after using a layer of my regular undereye concealer, I dusted the High Brown in the dark circles and blended. It doesn&#x27;t get that cakey look like some yellow concealers I&#x27;ve used. Its been my thing for 5 years now!</li>
    <li> I use this on the inner corner of my eyes and right beneath my eyebrow.  I love that it brightens up my face and this price is very good.  Makes you look more awake! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this!  Great product for highlighting the upper lids and it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it. It really works to brighten the eyebrow area. Easy to apply and smudge with a brush.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does exactlly what it says. It blends so easy, really adds to your brow line.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil.  It&#x27;s very pricey but lasts a long time even with frequent use.  One thing I did notice though, don&#x27;t overapply if you&#x27;re having photos done.  I applied very heavily under my brow and it looked nice in evening light but I noticed on a photograph taken that you could \\&quot;see\\&quot; the big white spot under my brows with flash photography in dim light.</li>
    <li> When I received the product, it was only about 60 degrees (F) outside but the stick was melted and mushy. I tried to use it and it squished everywhere, so I left it out at room temp for a day and then tried to sharpen it. It would not sharpen correctly as the product was still almost liquid. I left it alone for a week and it still never went back to normal. Also, the color is really pink. It is not as nice as the high brow glow, which is what I used to use and loved it. I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Use this for a nice little highlight around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I got this after researching for lighter concealers. My plan was to use it under my eyes, rather than as an eyebrow highlighter. It&#x27;s still a pinkish hue, though not as pink as Benefit&#x27;s eyebright. It&#x27;s a little firm/dry for my very dry skin, but when applied over an eye cream, I&#x27;m able to blend just fine. I like it a lot more than eyebright.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect makeup for under your brows.  It lasts a long time and looks great.</li>
    <li> I love it. I usually order it for HSN but they were out. It only took 3 weeks through you guys and a bunch of bull crap. I&#x27;m not sure I will be using Amazon again. Every one deserves another chance. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again</li>
    <li> In addition to highlighting my brow bone, this comes in handy when I&#x27;m a little overdue for a visit to the brow bar by camouflaging stray brows that are growing in.</li>
    <li> Way too creamy for my liking.</li>
    <li> A bit too bright and a bit to mushy for me. The tip was mashed in quite a bit when I got it, which was annoying too. With a great amount of blending it works ok. I have light but olive toned skin, very oily.</li>
    <li> Benefit cosmetics high brow pencil .&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived exactly as described packed very well. Just what I had hoped for. Would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Great product! Love highlighting my eyebrow arches. I bought one for my best friend as part of her birthday and she loves it too. It&#x27;s long lasting and gives a fresh look.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 4th or 5th high brow pencil - I just use it right under my eyebrows ... works better than white/light eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> I read about this highlighter in a beauty magazine and decided to try it. It works great! It&#x27;s extremely soft so be careful putting the lid on or it &#x27;smooshes&#x27; the tip down but you can still use it. A little goes a long way and it really does &#x27;lift&#x27; your brow.</li>
    <li> I saw great reviews for this product.  But im not too impressed.  I get a better lift or def of brown,  but outline brow with plan white pencil and then blending it in.    Too me not worth it.</li>

    <li> This took a bit of a learning curve, but once I figured out how to use it I was impressed with the product.  My eyes seemed more open and my brows had better shape.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. makes the eye brows pop could use alone or with shadows. very neutral so anyone can use it.</li>
    <li> Received product expeditiously. So far, great product at much more reasonable price than Sephora or expensive department store.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference...</li>
    <li> Highlights perfect!!!</li>
    <li> goes on like silk and blends perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the small amount of highlight made such a difference in the glow that I got in my face. People have actually asked me &amp;#34;What are you doing different or you&#x27;re looking good&amp;#34; even on days that I feel like I could lie down and go to sleep on a park bench.</li>
    <li> When your tired or droopy, this pencil really gives eyes a lift and makes you look awake - even when you don&#x27;t feel like it!</li>
    <li> One: to other reviewers - you dont need to put this on top of a concealer, it&#x27;s meant for your arch.&lt;br /&gt;A lid primer and this pencil wont combat each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my MUST HAVE as a makeup artist. Since I first used it, I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. It beautifully defines the bottom of your eyebrow, brightening the skin and by result, increasing the contrast of shadow and eye brow. i run it across the top of the outside arch as well and blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great after fix too - shadow go too far or look too dark? jam this on top and blend without stressing too much.</li>
    <li> a great accent to your eyes, really contrasts with the eyebrow line the accent the contour of the face</li>
    <li> I use everyday in the corners of my eys and at the outside corners. It brightens and takes years off.</li>
    <li> Although the pencil is soft and doesn&#x27;t hold a point, it&#x27;s extremely blendable and a little goes a long way.  Just a touch under the brows and then blending with an angled brush gives subtle definition.  Be sure an apply it before you apply powder, it&#x27;s more blendable that way.  The matte finish is perfect with any makeup style and powdered shadow can be applied over it if desired.  A very good product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This little crayon is amazing. I use this all over my face as a highlighter in different places and it look great when blended. I have purchased it before from the local beauty store, but its priced much better here.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty products, I try to have this in my makeup bag always. Nice and creamy, blends easily to a matte finish (no shimmer, which I like). Only bummer is that I&#x27;ve never had uch luck sharpening it down when the product gets low, so I need to replenish more often than I&#x27;d like. That said, I&#x27;ve taken the &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; out of some old ones and smooshed it into a little compact with great results. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i have been using Benefit High for years!! it helps highliht the brow bone and hides any strays in between threadings(or wax--your preference!). it really does make your brow bone more accencuated!! it helps open up your eye and helps the brow do its job--frame your pretty face!! follow it up with their brow wax-pencil(all available for a better price on Amazon!) and your killer brow look is polished!!</li>
    <li> So amazing! Blends so great. It applies smoothly. Does a great job at highlighting and it can be used heavily on light and lightly while taking pictures. Make sure its blended neatly or it tends to look a bit messy. Overall, a great product! One of my highlighting favorites!</li>
    <li> Very nice pink based liner.  While it looks great highlighting the upper part of the brow, it also looks good if you apply it underneath your eyeliner under your eye, takes away the harshness that dark undereye liner can have.</li>
    <li> Good shoping and think you</li>
    <li> The color is a pale pink  which is pretty good for highlighting the area under the brows but the consistency leaves much to be desired. It drags a bit too much against my skin, perhaps because I have drier skin, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it perfectly smoothed under my eyebrows without a bit of effort and additional powder eyeshadow to help the cause. In a pinch, when I want a more dramatic brow, I will still use it... but I wish it was a bit more blendable.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday!  I LOVE this product.  I don&#x27;t know what I have done in the past without it.</li>
