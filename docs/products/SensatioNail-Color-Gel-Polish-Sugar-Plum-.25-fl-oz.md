    <li> Smaller than I thought, and bled somewhat around the edges. Didn&#x27;t hold up as well as others for around the same price, and finish was a little dull even though color was beautiful.</li>
    <li> As described, no box but bubble wrapped &amp; secured.  Appears to be new.  Love the color.  Good savings over retail price.</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle than I expected! Love it!!!</li>

    <li> Loved it! Beautiful, long lasting color.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it arrived and looked like it had been run over.  I was giving it as part of a birthday present for my sister so she understood and the nailpolish itself was fine.  Product was great but the presenation was terrible.</li>

    <li> Nice plummy dark pink color. Lasts about 2 wks and stays shiny!</li>

    <li> Just as described! Works great so far!</li>
    <li> Is a nice color if you are looking for a dark red wine color.&lt;br /&gt;Came in an small botle, everything as promised.</li>
    <li> It chipped the very next day, and peeled off.</li>
    <li> Really pretty.  Was darker that I expected.  Almost a dark red color.</li>
