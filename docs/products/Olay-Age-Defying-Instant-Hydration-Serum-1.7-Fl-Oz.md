    <li> Use it all the time and love it</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy. The serum goes into the skin very fast and after that you can apply your makeup. My skin feels nice and soft and hydrated the whole day without flaking. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break me out.</li>

    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. Its scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it goes on really well, just like many of the other reviewers said. The texture is unique in that it goes on well, leaving my face non oily, absorbs right into the skin and leaves my skin super soft. I will definitely buy it again. A great lotion for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s not sold in stores here in the U.S. (at least not to my knowledge). It says it&#x27;s made in Poland and distributed from Canada. Unfortunately, when I see awesome skin care products for a great price here in the U.S. they are either taken off the shelves or their ingredients are changed to &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; with no improvement and less results.</li>
    <li> Adds the best pure moisture to your face and Perfect for Sensitive Skin....</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Seemed more like a thin oil than a special serum. It really did nothing for my skin, but it surprisingly didn&#x27;t feel too heavy, sticky, or oily when it was applied.</li>

    <li> I love love love this serum! I use it every day and have gone through a dozen bottles or more!</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum that is not sticky for me.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.  Just started using. Seems to absorb fast.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product only because it was in a small container and travel-friendly.  I used it on a vacation and loved it so much I came to Amazon to find it again.  Light-weight, smooth and wears well under make up.</li>
    <li> Of course I&#x27;ve tried a lot of serums over the years, but always come back to this one.  It really hydrates and firms.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My skin quite likes this serum, which I wear under moisturizer for daytime. For my tastes, it&#x27;s a bargain compared to the Chanel serum I liked to splurge on back in the day.</li>
    <li> I have not found any other face lotion like this one.  It is refreshingly hydrating, yet light and transparent.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for my acne prone oily sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now. I use this in the morning after cleansing my skin and at night before bed after cleansing again. It has a wonderfully powdery silky feel similar to how a primer feels but doesn&#x27;t make my skin oiler or uncomfortable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum because it&#x27;s light and perfect for the tropics. My skin feels soft, smooth and hydrated. I wish I got the non-scented one instead of this one but that&#x27;s only because I have a sensitive nose. Otherwise I have no problems with this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> GOES ON VERY SMOOTH DEEP IN THE SKIN. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR DRY SKIN WHICH&lt;br /&gt;MATURE SKIN IS GOOD  PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Trusted brand. Did not cause sensitive skin irritation. Good moisturizer. Consistency reminds me of primer. Not a miracle cream, but a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase and the sender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many lotions made by many manufacturers throughout the years.  My 30-something year old face is prone to breakouts and has an oily T-zone. During the winter months in Pennsylvania my skin gets dry.  I&#x27;ve tried several lotions from heavy to light wear, medicated to not, sunscreen to none, etc.  This is by far, the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 2 months now and apply it morning and night.  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly but not too quickly that you feel like you never applied anything.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a nasty cold this winter and typical to nasal issues my nose and surrounding area started to get red, irritated and dry.  I applied this lotion just slightly thicker than I was using and within ONE day my nose was back to normal color, no peeling or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering about the small size of the bottle?  The size of the bottle was daunting when looking at the price but in actuality it took me over 2 months to use the bottle.  I applied a SMALL pea-size of lotion to most of my face every morning and evening, making sure to include under my eyes, my T-zone, and my jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  (Note: I use Olay Regenerist Pore Scrub in the evening and Olay Regenerist Thermal Mini-Peel in the morning as part of my daily facial routine in addition to using this lotion.)</li>
    <li> First time using this product it made my face feel a lot softer. I think that I will be using this for now on.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and silicone like. (Feels like a face primer) light weight, easily bendable, unnoticeable, not oily, thick or creamy. hydration is great. I wear it under make up and to bed. a little goes a long way. feels like protection for my skin which is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and easy to put on your face without feeling oily. Your face will feel hydrated and refresh.</li>
    <li> Quickly absorbs into skin. Keeps you hydrated without looking oily</li>
    <li> I received this very soon after placing order and it&#x27;s a great product for the skin.  It is absorbed quickly and there is no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum smooth my wrinkles and my face. You can see the difference right away. I use it every night .&lt;br /&gt;Good value and price. I recommend Olay Hydration Serum to my friends.</li>
    <li> Another great serum from Olay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Olay serums. I have been using the Regenerist for years and found this day serum. It&#x27;s a little thicker but works great.</li>
    <li> Outstanding I have use some Olay products before so it was a no wonder that this product works, I have always love all of these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better serums, but sometimes have difficulty locating them.  This one is okay, but not fabulous...</li>
    <li> Just like it says. A lot of hydration in a small bottle. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the too was broken. I replaced it with an old one. Great product and was here fast.</li>
    <li> Great hydration without making the face oily. Perfect for any season.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Olay products.  It feels great on the skin without being sticky AND its a day moisturizer without a SPF sunscreen added, which is hard to find.  I highly recommend this hydrating day serum.</li>
