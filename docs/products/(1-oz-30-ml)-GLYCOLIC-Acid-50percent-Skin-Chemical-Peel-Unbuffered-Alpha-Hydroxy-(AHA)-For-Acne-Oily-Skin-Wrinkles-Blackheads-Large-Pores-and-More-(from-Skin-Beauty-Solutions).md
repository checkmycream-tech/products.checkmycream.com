<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had professional peels before so I felt safe using this product at home.  I will continue using it as long as it is available.  The first treatment was so invigorating and the second was a little easier on me.  The instructions were fantastic as they recommended using cool air to reduce burning sensation and it worked.  I was expecting a lot of peeling which did not happen but the good thing is I felt great going out in public after the treatment.  It brought up deep blemishes I was not aware I had.  And my pore size was reduced as well as my butterfly rash that usually burns and looks ugly.  Thank you for this wonderful product at such a ridiculously affordable price.</li>
    <li> Well, I have not used this much for my face, though the couple times I have it really did clear it up. I think one of the biggest things is how this stings your skin. It is more of a prickly feeling that is quite annoying but I would not say it hurts. I have actually been using this for stretch marks. It has actually worked very well. In about a week with using this and then after applying lotion to them there is a huge difference. It says to leave it on for about 2-10 minutes, I have been leaving it on for about 5-7 and then washing it off with water following it with either a face moisturizer or some kind of aloe skin lotion for stretch marks. I have also noticed it works very well for blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;works&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;more than one use ( acne, wrinkles, blackheads, stretch marks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;very tingly</li>
    <li> If you don’t like doing things yourself, especially when it comes to cosmetics (I don’t like some things like waxing), I suggest you should go to a spa and let professional handle it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I recently spoke with the esthetician at the spa where I’m a regular and she said that they are using like 15-20% glycolic acid for their peels and if I want one, I shouldn’t expect any dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something: I was using a 30%-one at home before this one and I loved it but I do want a more dramatic results and 50% is just doing the job. You have to be very careful though and know your skin type and the way your skin reacts to different products. No tweezing or using other products that irritate the skin before using this peel. Also, you have to be persistent and do it at least 4-5 times in 2 weeks to see a good results (depending on a skin of course). Stay away from the direct sunlight as well.</li>
    <li> Be very careful, this is strong stuff.  I&#x27;ve used stronger products in the past but they all had buffers added.  The first few times I used this I did get some scabbing on my cheeks.  But now I&#x27;ve figured out my sensitive spots and the peels are going much better.  Be sure to have a good PLAIN moisturizer on hand to slather afterwards.  Any additives in the moisturizer might cause stinging.  Excellent product at a great price once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product once before, a long time ago, and it yielded awesome results. This time unfortunately was not so great. I have hyper pigmentation so when using this and letting it sit for so long it caused my skin to develop dark/burn marks around my mouth. I guess certain areas of the face I should have not placed the product, but like I said Ive used this product before and it worked wonders in clearing my skin. This product is okay for spot treatment in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old caucasian woman with fair skin and red/blonde hair. I have acne rosacea and my skin is very sensitive. The glycolic acid is good to use initially to shrink pores and do a thorough exfoliation. I find it a bit too harsh for repeated use. My skin tends to be drier and flaky even after the healing is done. I started using lactic acid and get much better results. I would use this glycolic peel every so often (maybe every fourth peel) just to keep my pores small. The price is right and everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Younger people with oilier skin may find this better suited for them. Read up on what each type of peel does for the skin before making your choice. Some are better for scars, some for acne, some for wrinkles.  Any peel you use will initially make your skin look awful, like a bad sunburn and inflamed blemishes for a few days until the skin is done peeling and healing. Plan your activities accordingly for those days and always use a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have used this product once a week for 3 weeks now.  I have a very oily Tzone and huge pores on my forehead, along with the inside of the cheeks near the nose.  My skin is now far less oily, my pores have tightened up considerably and my skin is really smooth.  I did not have a lot of blackheads to begin with but what I did have is gone.    Honestly I got more results from the professional TCA peel that I had done but I also had to live through near 10 days of blood red, cracked and peeling skin that looked awful and required Aquaphor ointment smeared on it every hour or so.  If you want results over time this is probably the product for you.  If you need immediate dramatic results you may be better served with the TCA peel.  I noticed a significant difference after the first use and have continued to see positive results.  I am satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It worked good. I need stronger next time because of my age. But it worked exactly as advertised got here quickly. Would do it again. No burns no problem when used as directed.</li>
    <li> I used to have noticeable eye bags and dark circles. I used creams and serums which did not give me any lasting results. Then I came across the web that a women got rid of her eye bags and circles with a glycholic peel so I decided to buy this product. Wow, after a couple of months, my eye bags and circles were gone and I didn&#x27;t need cosmetic surgery after all. Even my friends at the job noticed. This product really got rid of my eye bags. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;Left a horrible scar on my face&lt;br /&gt;It has not faded away, I&#x27;ve had it for one month!</li>
    <li> Nice, gentle peel.  Great for peels where you don&#x27;t want what you&#x27;ve done visible on a daily basis (like at work for example).</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft, breakout free and brighter</li>
    <li> My skin is average, not to sensitive and no so tough either. I used the Taklon Fan Mask Brush for peels, which is great and I applied the peel. I left the peel on for the full 10 minutes and washed it ff with cold water/baking soda rinse. It did sting and pinch when i first put peel on but not that bad where I couldn&#x27;t take it. My skin got a little pink, felt a little sun burned. Pink skin was gone next morning, but still felt a little sun burned. My skin started to flake on third day and than continuously peeled for the next 5 days after that. I slathered on organic coconut oil everyday and exfoliated with a wash cloth. I did have some scabbing as if I broke out with acne, which lasted through the five days of peeling. As it continued to peel the scabbing and break out healed and my skin looked much better.  I gave my self another peel 9 days after the first peel and went through the same process again. I had slight scarring from acne as a kid and now, at 51, I had wrinkles that were starting to show on my forehead, around my eyes and on my upper lip...not anymore. The lines and scarring are very light now not to mention that my pores are so small that you can&#x27;t see them anymore. I just did a third peel for week three, going through same process as the first few times and I can see a major difference in my skin even as I peel. I only wear bare essential makeup which has sunscreen in it and I only use the organic coconut oil. Coconut oil has not only helped my skin but also my lashes are long and my eyebrows are full again. I will only do this peel 3 or 4 times in a month than take a break for a month. Once the weather starts to warm up and I am outdoors more I will not do a peel at all until late fall/winter. I am very happy with the results but please use this with caution. Make sure to wear something with a good sunscreen on your face when going outdoors always.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I have not had any peeling but I can feel my face tighten up so it must be working... Maybe I&#x27;ll try 80 next time</li>
    <li> Another worthless peel. Burned, did not peel. Don&#x27;t consider wasting your time or money it is not professional quality. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Worked great.... Had no problems! Although they need to provide instructions</li>
    <li> My face is so smooth now. You would pay much more for this treatment in a Dermatologist office. This bottle lasts for many treatments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic so I suffer from melasma. Melasma is caused by hormones, basically its dark spots on the face and body. I usually get professional face peals to lessen my dark spots but this time I wanted to use something in between peals. This product really didn&#x27;t do anything for me so I gave it a three stars cause it wasn&#x27;t that bad. However, I rather spend $20 dollars on this product I got from my local beauty supply store Obooja Supply called apple peeling gel. Its made in Korea, and its real soft and helps make your skin bright and fresh. I really like this product and I use it on my neck, under arms, in between my legs, anal area and my heals too. With this product, you really can tell the difference right away. Also, I usually wash my face right after with baking soda and it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing!  Love it and the results have been amazing. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering the next strength up product.</li>
    <li> fast delivery to Europe, neat packaging with detailed instructions, great results on my post-pregnancy chloasma. i use it once a week and get initial irritation at first, but then.. wow!</li>
    <li> I have gone for chemical peels before and the effect is similar, though not as powerful as the ones I have had. That&#x27;s probably a good thing as most people are not professionals at applying these types of chemicals.  There is definitely strength to the percentage so pleaseeeeeee don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.  You probably know your skin pretty well. I fell asleep the other day with it on and I think I burned my face a little.  I can tell a big difference with just a handful of uses.  It is definitely a good idea to have a light moisturizer for sensitive skin to slather on after every use, and for when the natural flaking, peeling process starts to occur, which could take a day or two, depending on your skin.  Also, who can beat the price for the results!</li>
    <li> This was great for removing little warts I received while pursuing an intimate relationship with my pet baboon. One application did the job.  I did not dilute this.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as advertised.  The product is very strong so I am following the directions carefully.  Having had peels before, this is what I expected.  It definitely stings which is what you want.</li>
    <li> Beware.  It is very strong and don&#x27;t use in the shower.  Put this on my face and got in the shower and it burned everything else. I mixed it with another face cleanser and seemed to do okay, but don&#x27;t use it by itself and don&#x27;t leave it on long.  I threw it away after about 2 months and started using Alpha hydroxyl and it works better and leaves your skin refreshed like a layer has come off.</li>
    <li> I used to hate glycolic acid peels because they stung like crazy and never did anything but make me break out. This peel, being unbuffered, did sting like crazy, but it didn&#x27;t break me out and I actually got the desired result from it. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. I was looking at another formulation that was buffered, but I decided on this one because, if I&#x27;m going to spend the money, I want real results. I&#x27;ve been using chemical peels and other treatments since beauty school, and I&#x27;m not kidding when I tell you that this is one of my new favorites. I&#x27;m so glad it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This chemical peel works great, as long as you read and follow the directions.  Don&#x27;t think you know better, and leave it on for longer, until your skin has built up the tolerance of the acid.  It makes my skin very soft and evens out the tone, and helps with scars &amp; sun spots.  I love it!  I apply it with Q-tips.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;The product proved to be fantastic after just one use. I have combination skin, with acne(and rosacea) on my cheeks and chin primarily. This product combined with taking l-carnitine and pantothenic acid has cleared my acne up 95% in a matter of a few days. My skin is smooth and tight and feels so clean. It truly seems like a miracle and too good to be true right now! Very happy. My only worry is that the 50% solution does not feel as strong as a 30% solution that I used years ago. But that could be my skin changing, also. I would purchase from this seller again. Also check in to l-carnitine and pantothenic acid if you&#x27;re an acne sufferer; it is working wonders for me and quickly.</li>
    <li> 10% glycolic acid is usually recommended for daily use.  This product with 50% goes a long way.  I applied to damp skin and emulsified a couple drops in my hand and dot applied to skin then smoothed over.  I leave it for 1 minute and rinse with cooler water, not cold.  I have seen results with smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I usually use a 40% solution on my face but I thought I wanted something stronger so I got this.  I left it on for five minutes.  It&#x27;s been over a week now and I don&#x27;t really see that the 50% versus the 40% is any better.  Caution:  I had a little of the solution up in my hairline and didn&#x27;t rinse it off there but quickly saw the red burn there from where I&#x27;d forgotten to remove it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased all the different strengths of this product and they all work really well.  If you are just getting started you may want to start with the 35% strength (I think that is the lowest they have) and move up to the 50%, then finally 70% if your skin can handle it.  I used the whole bottle at the lowest strength first and then moved up to the next level.  My skin is pretty tough apparently and I can handle the 70% with minimal redness now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product because of significant sun damage to my skin over the years.  Once you use these products for awhile your skin will be much smooth and any pigmentation spots from the sun will start to fade away.  I use if for a few days and then lay off a few days to let the light peeling effect wear off.  This seems to work best for me but test it out for your skin.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have used this type of product &amp; once you get past the fear of the first use ( feels like your face is burning off after only a few seconds) will probably work better. I intend to use again since I know what to expect next time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using for a few months now.  Skin looks more youthful.  However, my sunspots are still visible but they did get much lighter.</li>
    <li> I disliked the product because it was too strong for my skin. I diluted it with water and it was still too strong for my face and it caused burns on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item more than one month ago. The delivery was worldwide so i was supposed to get it in italy too.otherwise you shouldn t have sent it in italy as many other sellers dont. The custom border stopped my item and i have never receive it. So i spent my money for nothing. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> It seems TO work but skeen is very dry after!  Ut is necessary to have a good cream TO Apply after</li>
    <li> I have discoloration on both my elbows because of dead skin. I applied this product and left it on longer than what the instruction said. Results were almost instantaneous. Dead skin started peeling the following day. This product is awesome and will continue to use it as needed.</li>
    <li> Thank you for quick mailing and added tips that were included.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, but received damaged bottle , the seller was so kind and shipped me a new one which I got few days later ! I did try it on my skin and just feel how it&#x27;s working right immediately !!! Have to be careful because yes it is strong !Great stuff !!! Awesome seller !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, even tho I&#x27;m older I still break out, and this stuff works on me.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my skin after I use it. It burns more the first time you use it but it does work. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it, bought more!  It worked so well I am now trying the 70%.  Noticeable difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Have purchased the 70% before with great results but wanted something a little more gentle this time. Still very effective. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I actually bought it to lighten a tattoo &amp; it works, I have used this in the past on tattoos, I dont know if it will remove it completely but over time I dont see why it wouldnt...I can get it light enough so I can at least get it covered up     as for a chemical peel I love it !! It works great just make sure u get it nuetralized completely &amp; rinsed off !  regular use &amp; your skin will look %100 fresher &amp; healthier ...</li>
    <li> If you went to a professional and they put this exact same stuff on it would cost double or TRIPLE for them to do the exact same thing - ONCE. For 20$ you will get almost 10 applications that would cost almost a thousand dollars if you have a dermatologist do the same thing. It helps with acne and skin tone (wrinkles- not so much) this 50% should be your second purchase - and comes after the -20% - use that whole thing first. Then put this on for about a min the first time - then a couple days later try 3min. Then move up to 5 and then finally 10 with at least 2-5 days apart. Do not go in the sun before or after using this! Also keep in mind that your skin improves weeks to months after - not the next day. Take breaks or switch the type of acid because your skin will get immune to a certain type of acid. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you use it right!</li>
    <li> This s*** burns man.. but if you can get past the 5 minutes of the feeling of acid melting your face it does work.</li>
    <li> works well, but it&#x27;s strong</li>
    <li> I am going to be 64 years old in May, I have, also, had to battle severe acne on both upper arms for the last three years. I tried benzyl peroxide, as well, as salicylic acid, in over the counter ointments. They seemed to make it worse, and, bleached my bed sheets. I tried hyalauronic acid, which didn&#x27;t help. I tried the glycolic acid 30%. I used about a third of the bottle, without significant results. The bleeding, oozing, and new breakouts were awful, no sleeveless for me. Finally, I tried the 50% glycolic acid. I have been using the liquid twice a day. It got worse, before it got better. Now, today, April 20 2013, I am seeing clear skin on my upper arms. No more, horrible cyctic acne in stages of eruption. The acne cysts were very painful, as well as numerous. Today, I am able to move my arms without feeling the pain of the cysts pressing on my skin. I am glad I was patient, especially, when it got worse, with new red breakouts. The skin got very dry, when I saw less breaking out, I applied a good body lotion. I think I have finally won the battle with old lady arm acne, cos it was very ew.</li>
    <li> I used 35% peel before and it worked well. I hope the stronger will be better.You just have to be careful.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve noticed that my pores are smaller. i just can&#x27;t use it everyday, I use it once a week.  A GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do and maybe this is just me but it also gave me horrible acne.</li>
    <li> Its very powerful and works. Be careful though.. ... .. . . . , . . . . , .</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly what I wanted. Receipt of product was very timely. I would definitely reorder this product from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Probably great for more seasoned skin peel pros, but for those starting out (like myself) this might be too strong.  I am back to Mandelic acid, which is a lot gentler and seems to give more immediate results.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. My sum spots are disappearing. YES, buy it and use it sparingly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to peels so I decided to start with the 50%. Kind of wish I did the 75%, but I can tell a difference after one use. Make sure you moisturize well after use with a simple hydrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that the seller included gauze pads with the order and shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> This product makes me skin feel clean, tight, and has helped clear my face up.  However, a couple days after I use this product the areas where I have blemishes seem to get darker much to my chagrin.  I would love to know what causes this.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. The result it has on my skin is amazing. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of the 50%, I worked my way up to this percentage as well as how long I left it on. I started at 2 minutes and and now up to 8 minutes., Anything longer will irritate my face. After the 8 minutes I neutralize the acid with baking soda and water, then wash my face with just water, pat dry and apply an aloe E gel. I find that anything cream based will irritate my face and sting so I just stick to the aloe for a couple of days. I usually use ROC and a vitamin C serum daily so I skip those as well for a couple of days. In about a week my face is really clear and stays this way for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good product. I gave it a 3 because I have only used it 3 times and although it does a good job keeping my breakout to a minimum. The salon glycolic peel does provide my skin with a better glow and less dryness then this product. In addition I do get longer lasty results from the salon peels. I will continue with the product and just go way less often to the salon ;) use as directed it work fine for me no blister or burning .felt just like the salon very mild tingling.</li>
    <li> I have used a few different chemical peels and I would say this brand is the second best.  The first product I ever used was in the 1980&#x27;s and was discontinued.  I&#x27;ve tried others that couldn&#x27;t compare. This one is the closest to being as good as the first product.  I am African American and in my 60&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but my skin was looking a bit dry and leathery.  After using the product, it took almost 2 weeks for a noticeable difference.  My skin had a clearer cleaner look.  I only used it once 2 nights in a row and haven&#x27;t used it since.  I purposely only used it for 2 nights to see what the outcome would be.  I purchased a 50% and 70% and started with 50% first.  Next month I will use the 70%.  The sting is a bit uncomfortable but bearable.  I rinsed my face with my hands multiple times using cold water.  I&#x27;ve read baking soda water neutralizes it but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  You will definitely need a good moisturizer as your face feels pretty tight when dry.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this chemical peel. If I had been disappointed in it, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it again.</li>
    <li> Just, yay! I&#x27;m a 20-something African American with hyperpigmentation from acne primarily on my chin and bottoms on my jawline and I decided to use this. It was my first peel ever and I did it by myself. Since I had never used any peels before I diluted it to a %12.5 solution and for my first peel used that. Didn&#x27;t feel much until I neutralized it with sodium bicar- Baking soda hah, I&#x27;m a chemistry major so I call things different names. Anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stung a little and of course no immediate effects. I applied emu oil generously to my face and went to sleep. Woke up and (yes I know you&#x27;re not supposed to do this daily but) I repeated the process with a %25 solution this time. Started to see more visible results. Had some peeling,  more like flaking, about two days later. Then I did the undiluted %50 the day after my flaking was over. I did a second layer of acid on the really dark places (there are about 5 I treated with a q-tip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy snot do I see a difference. It&#x27;s been like 2 weeks and nothing I&#x27;ve ever used, ambi, clinique laser corrector, black and white fade cream, pro activ and all the other junk I&#x27;ve used, nothing, has worked so well to fade my acne marks. I will say I did break out a little bit after the %25 treatment but that&#x27;s to be expected as existing acne is exposed and rises to the surface. They mostly were superficial and actually faded the next day. I got one that was deeper but the healing process was sped up like %900 because it appeared, started to flake over, marked and BEGAN TO VISIBLY FADE all within a week so, I was pretty okay with that to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions to those who try this:&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;ve never done it before, it&#x27;s ACID. DILUTE IT TO SEE HOW YOUR SKIN REACTS AND SPOT TEST IT!&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you make your neutralizing solution (baking soda + water works fine) BEFORE you put any of this acid on your skin so if anything goes wrong you can quickly stop it&lt;br /&gt;- Wash your face thoroughly before and after&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturize REALLY WELL. If the skin is going to come off, the skin WILL come off. Do not try to rush by drying out your skin to let it peel.&lt;br /&gt;- Do your research. I watched a ton of online videos (not just youtube), read a lot of websites and even then was careful to spot test, dilute and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got favorable results. All in all if I continue to see good results I WILL buy this again!and after&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturize REALLY WELL. If the skin is going to come off, the skin WILL come off.

    <li> Facial Peels are my thing, and thanks to you I don&#x27;t have to pay outlandish prices to have a spa quality glycolic peel. I really care for my skin but like most people I want to get the most from the money I spend and I feel good knowing that you provide that opportunity for me............................................................................................Victoria</li>
    <li> I started using glycolic acid at 35% a few months ago. I used it once/twice a week and it gave me a good idea of how this stuff works, the right way to apply it, effects on the skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just upgraded to the 50% and it&#x27;s a big jump. Its MUCH stronger and while I could leave the the 35% on for several minutes...the 50% works fast...I can only do it 2 minutes max or it causes my face to redden/scab for a day or 2. Per instructions use a good moisturizer immediately. But several days later my face is much smoother, pores smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find using a facial scrub a couple of days afterwards make the skin even smoother.</li>
    <li> Do read the direction&#x27;s.I was looking for a similar reaction from my facials with an estetician. I put it on for much longer. This  cost $400 at a dermatologist, which putting Aloe Vera immediately would have done the trick and a follow up with vit E. You will like the results doing it correctly.</li>
    <li> This is a first class glycolic acid peel.  It is so awesome to be able to buy this over the net!  Be careful in using it, though.  Follow the directions.  It is a serious clycolic acid . . . did you get that?  Acid.  It can burn.  Pay attention!</li>
    <li> Used exactly as prescribed but did not peel skin :(</li>
    <li> After going for facial for last 20 years, no more this does the jobe my skin has never been better, skin looks alive and younger.I thing my sun damage may get better , I do some improvement.</li>
    <li> Male 27 Hispanic complexion:&lt;br /&gt;Have used it 3 times in about 4 weeks diluting by 50% the first time and leaving on for 60 seconds and progressively using a stronger solution each use, using a non-diluted full 50% solution this past week. The results were not bad but I did not have bad skin to start with, my goal was at a minimum to fade a few acne scars from blemishes past, but wanted to fix some acne that has been persistent. To that end, it did work; they scars are less noticeable, but I did find it a little difficult to balance this peel with the enough moisturizer to keep the skin from getting too dry, but not enough such that my face would break out more. All in all I am happy with my results and will continue to use the product. I think that I may have had a super high expectation that was unreasonable to start with.</li>
    <li> Its really good for melasma..........but need to be careful while ur using this..... need to know how much ur skin acceptable for this product.... but its done well...</li>
    <li> Good product for my skin. I use it every 2 weeks to help prevent acne.</li>
    <li> Love this. But I have been using peels for a few years. You need to be careful if you have sensitive skin. That being said worked wonders on my dark circles. My skin looks amazing . Very happy</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, used 3 weeks in a row did not get significant peel.</li>
    <li> Very good product. But not for first time uses... Its very strong, so if your skin is sensitive look for something less strong.</li>
    <li> I am a 41 year old female and this did nothing for my pores, age spots or wrinkles.  Would tingle while I had it on but only result I got was dry skin.</li>
