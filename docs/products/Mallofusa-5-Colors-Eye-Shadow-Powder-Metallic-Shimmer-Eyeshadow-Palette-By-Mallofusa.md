      <li>I like it, just wish the pigment was better.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between most of the colors once they are on my skin.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>

      <li>Not a bad pallet by any means.</li>
      <li>Love this it was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>It took a bit to arrive, but was well worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more pigmented than most other products at this price point.</li>
      <li>, I was originally going to return because I brought too much eye shadow from another site (bh cosmetics), i had even requested the return on-line but decided to keep it...</li>
      <li>These are awesome when applied wet or dry, with sponge or brush!</li>
      <li>Also, pink in the photo is my own liner and is not included in this palette.</li>
      <li>Floor wax is the first ingredient?  </li>
      <li>Can be subtle or very luminous, and I LOVE how easily it is removed.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>They have lots of pigmentation and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>This shadow stays on all day, but doesn&#x27;t put up a fight when I&#x27;m ready to remove it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, but I should have read the ingredients before purchasing.  </li>
      <li>Thanks and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as nice as Urban Decay, and has a very pretty shimmer to it without falling off your eyelids and getting all over your face like a lot of other shimmer/glitter shadows.</li>
      <li>but these colors are very complementary and make for pretty natural contouring.</li>
      <li>Not sure about using it; though the colors look lovely it looks like its been used and at the bottom it also says &amp;#34;if feel redness, itching, sting abnormal condition, please stop using.&amp;#34; box says england and europe company on the side, just worried that it may not be, given the actual wording does not seem at all logical, perhaps it was translated from elsewhere.</li>
      <li>and I am 42 years old!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please note, shadow is a bit more metallic than it looks here; my camera is not very good.</li>
      <li>Cae in a small box and at first I thought, &amp;#34;oh cool, brand new packaging that wasn&#x27;t shown in the actual picture.&amp;#34; the back of the package has very unusual phrasing.</li>
      <li>I hope my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to it.  </li>
      <li>And, even then, a quick swipe of my finger eliminated creasing with only minor diluting of pigmentation.</li>
      <li>Colors are bold enough to see but not overwhelming.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
<li> When i opened the product itself the white shadow was missing shadow judging by the size difference in comparision to the other shades, the brush has shadow on it as well.</li>

<li> My only complaint is the lack of pigmentation, but for the price it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
<li> Just needs another application tip, the one in the box is very hard and just not manageable.</li>
<li> Although one color was broken.</li>
<li> I know women are instructed to shy away from metallics as we age</li>
<li> Some shadows are awful when it&#x27;s time to wash off, and leave streaks or smears.</li>

    <li> Not the best coverage, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between most of the colors once they are on my skin. I use it more for shimmer in addition to other eyeshadows as this has poor coverage.</li>
    <li> Nice Eye shadows. Easy to apply. Just needs another application tip, the one in the box is very hard and just not manageable.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, but I should have read the ingredients before purchasing.  Floor wax is the first ingredient?  Yikes!!  I hope my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to it.  Nice colors though.</li>
    <li> Not a bad pallet by any means. My only complaint is the lack of pigmentation, but for the price it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shimmer in these eye shadows. They have lots of pigmentation and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> Best eye shadow I have purchased in my lifetime and I am 42 years old! It makes your eyes look amazing in the day or the night. I will recommend to others and if you are debating on ordering this product don&#x27;t debate it. You will be very satisfied with your purchase.</li>
    <li> So beautiful, I love the colors The colors are shiney and beautiful. I do suggest an eye shadow primer, and you will get the most stunning colors. Great for smokey eyes. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! These are awesome when applied wet or dry, with sponge or brush! Great all around eyeshadow, and the colors all work well together. Can be subtle or very luminous, and I LOVE how easily it is removed. Some shadows are awful when it&#x27;s time to wash off, and leave streaks or smears. This shadow stays on all day, but doesn&#x27;t put up a fight when I&#x27;m ready to remove it.</li>
    <li> Colors are bold enough to see but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush dident go on well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. The reason I gave 4 stars is because I only use 2 colors. I don&#x27;t need the other ones</li>
    <li> Cae in a small box and at first I thought, &amp;#34;oh cool, brand new packaging that wasn&#x27;t shown in the actual picture.&amp;#34; the back of the package has very unusual phrasing. The ingredients list as well as description and warning label don&#x27;t actually make sense, the wording isn&#x27;t in actual sentences and I found that worrisome and uncredible. When i opened the product itself the white shadow was missing shadow judging by the size difference in comparision to the other shades, the brush has shadow on it as well. Not sure about using it; though the colors look lovely it looks like its been used and at the bottom it also says &amp;#34;if feel redness, itching, sting abnormal condition, please stop using.&amp;#34; box says england and europe company on the side, just worried that it may not be, given the actual wording does not seem at all logical, perhaps it was translated from elsewhere. This cost 9 dollars and i could have gotten something from a company with understandable directions, safe clean packaging, etc. I personally reccommend spending your money on something you&#x27;ve heard of.</li>
    <li> This pallet stays on all day. It doesn&#x27;t not fade or rub off. The colors blend well and I am extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I like it, just wish the pigment was better.</li>
    <li> These go on and stay on nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this it was better than I expected. Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> It took a bit to arrive, but was well worth it. It&#x27;s just as nice as Urban Decay, and has a very pretty shimmer to it without falling off your eyelids and getting all over your face like a lot of other shimmer/glitter shadows. I will be continuing to buy this.</li>
    <li> this palette is very  nice!  I went on a makeup buying spree and this was one that was apart of that spree, I was originally going to return because I brought too much eye shadow from another site (bh cosmetics), i had even requested the return on-line but decided to keep it...so glad I did!  This palette is so pigmented and the colors are beautiful!  nice for a natural look for work and I amped it up for the evening look.  Thanks and the price is right!!</li>
    <li> i love it!  despite conventional thinking, these are wonderful colors for a senior gal!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the palette. It&#x27;s much more pigmented than most other products at this price point. The shimmer is a really gorgeous balance. I know women are instructed to shy away from metallics as we age but these colors are very complementary and make for pretty natural contouring. It stayed on all night from 5pm to midnight, outdoors, with no primer and minimal creasing. And, even then, a quick swipe of my finger eliminated creasing with only minor diluting of pigmentation. But I didn&#x27;t do that til I was already home and about to wash it off. 100% recommend to all ages and faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, shadow is a bit more metallic than it looks here; my camera is not very good. Also, pink in the photo is my own liner and is not included in this palette.</li>
    <li> Great product. Although one color was broken.</li>
    <li> Product was great, but I received a used palette, which is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s just what I expected. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> wasnt as pigmented and glittery as i thought</li>
    <li> Nice eyeshadow. Goes on best with primer.</li>
