<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Really helped my hair grown stronger.</li>
    <li> Has stopped my head itching and finger nails from breaking easily-exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Did not feel it lived up to the advertising by any stretch of the imagination</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended it to me when I share my concerns about losing hair and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems less dry and fuller than before taking it. It seems to be working for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THIS WAS EXEACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  WILL ORDER MORE OF THIS PRODUCT WHEN I CAN</li>
    <li> I find the product to be as advertised.  Biotin is one of several supplements I experiment with to guage the affect of a given supplement on my overall general health.  It seems to work well.</li>
    <li> It also did not see effect</li>
    <li> I started taking this supplement because I noticed that my hair was thinning out. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference upon taking this pill. My skin was definitely softer, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem to grow thicker. After this I tried Moroccan oil conditioner and that seemed to work.</li>
    <li> it was deliverd on time. and I love it, and after I need buy it again. I will decide it.</li>
    <li> Having a thyroid problem, I&#x27;ve suffered with weight issues and as a result, problems with skin, hair, and nails. The biotin was recommended to me by my doctor as a natural way to help combat the symptoms I was experiencing. Within 2 and a half weeks of starting the biotin I had noticeable changes in the strength of my nails and in my skin. My feet were not nearly as cracked any more. It took a little longer for the changes in the hair to show up...probably closer to 4 weeks, but it definitely helped. My hair was the most noticeable to other people and it caused me a lot of anxiety so I was happy to see it growing and improving.    These particular capsules are a lot larger than I prefer- they&#x27;re a high dose but the pills themselves are bigger than necessary. For me it&#x27;s difficult to swallow. I also encountered a bit of acne in taking them. However, when I coupled my biotin intake with another supplement for hair growth ([[ASIN:B00MMA7W5C Hair Growth Essentials: #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men - Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment With 29 Powerful Hair Growth Vitamins &amp; Nutrients for Rapid Growth - 20 Day Supply]]) I was able to reduce the acne and my hair improved more rapidly. The folic acid hair growth pills really did wonders for my skin too.  These pills are actually capsules and smaller and easier to take but of course I have to take 3 a day so that is downside to me.  However, in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using these products, I&#x27;ve had no hair loss in that time and better yet my hair now grow faster than it has before I ever had any medical issues so I guess I&#x27;m still taking a big pill of biotin and a handful a capsules and shouldn&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I have always had awful nails.  Thin, peeling, breaking, ridges.  I&#x27;ve tried everything...calcium, vitamins, copper peptide to rub into them, hand creams to moisturize them.  Nothing made a difference until now.  I still take a multivitamin and the calcium and now that I&#x27;ve added the Biotin I actually have nails.  First time ever since I was pregnant and took prenatal vitamins.  I have also started to use OPI nail strengthener as well and that has made a huge difference as well.  The Biotin started them growing out much stronger and the OPI has stopped the peeling.  I would recommend both products. Have a little patience with the Biotin.  You have to take it for a while to see results.  It doesn&#x27;t work overnight.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 3 months and I&#x27;m very happy now.  I take 5mg twice daily. They don&#x27;t upset my stomach at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this abt 3 weeks ago, and now I am beginning to see my hair get denser and longer! amazing vitamin supplement.</li>
    <li> I have found that taking Biotin makes my nails grow two times as fast even when I cut my nails they grow back very fast. I also find that taking Biotin gives my skin that extra glow and I have smoother skin since taking the supplement. I have only been taking these pills for about two weeks so its way to soon to tell if they are actually promoting hair growth or if there just placebo pills. But since hair grows 1/2 inch per month I will continue to take Biotin for six months before writing another review. Hopefully this product helps promote hair growth since that was the main reason I perchased it to begin with.</li>
    <li> Ok, so first of all, this product did make my hair grow slightly faster. However, I started breaking out when using it. Biotin causes cystic acne, which is a very painful, under the skin type of acne. I&#x27;ve never suffered from these kind of breakouts in my life. I took these pills for about 2 months and finally realized why my skin had become so horrible. Not worth it! Google it, you&#x27;ll see that it is a common problem.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to gradually ease up on dosage, but that didn&#x27;t happen since it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Maybe this was just me being stupid, but I thought they&#x27;d be in the form of a pill. Instead, it&#x27;s powder in a little plastic container. It&#x27;s kinda hard to get it all out of the little plastic wrap, but not a major inconvience so I&#x27;m okay with it.  There were a few forewarnings about this product that I didn&#x27;t think too much of. One of them was that this product causes cystic acne - it does. The day after I started taking it (one vcap a day) I got a giant, sore pimple on my chin. The sucker was huge and sore, but easy enough to cover up until it finally got a white head (yuck!). After another two days, I got another one but thankfully on my hair line, so it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable. I already have light, moderate acne so it wasn&#x27;t a big, big deal to me, but it&#x27;d be nice of this side effect, well, just didn&#x27;t take effect. I suggest drinking a lot of water while taking biotin so your body can get rid of it properly (I haven&#x27;t been doing that too much, so I&#x27;m gonna start; this should help ease up on the acne problem). I don&#x27;t think the acne should be a problem anymore, since my body may be adjusting??? (if that makes sense?)  I have also heard about this prodcut causing loss of body hair. I shave my legs, so the only place for concern would be my arms. About five days in, nothing. If anything, they have thinned but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just my imagination expecting something to happen. The reason I bought this was for LONGER, healthier hair. I&#x27;m in the process of trying to grow it out. I haven&#x27;t straightened it in about 3 months (I used to every day and it is so damaged! I wish I never did!), but I finally did and it looked a lot healthier! Now I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all due to the prodcut, but just a week before straightening it (no use of biotin 5000mcg yet), it looked pretty dead. I expected the millions upon millions of split ends to show but nothing! My hair looked like it was never damaged! It looked amazing (perhaps it was the Mane &#x27;N&#x27; Tail in conjuction with this product?) !! I usually have to use CHI silk infusion to help hide the split ends, but nope!! Safe to say, my hair looks awesome. Also, my nails do seem stronger and that&#x27;s a bonus. I usually peel them and it&#x27;s easy to do; they&#x27;re a bit on the softer side. But lately I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s harder to do!! That&#x27;s good, right?! They grow really fast as is, so I won&#x27;t really study for any increase in growth for them.  As for complexion, besides the cystic zits, my forehead had all these little bumps, and those are pretty much gone (in all fairness, I also use proactiv plus the salux japanese cloth to exfoliate; that basically scrapes them off (not as gross as I made sound!))! I also had body acne, and that&#x27;s starting to clear up a little, too (not as much as I&#x27;d like, but hey, I haven&#x27;t even been using it for a week yet!) I suggest you just GET IT! Try it, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, it was only a few bucks!    (I ordered from Alll Starr Health, and shipping was very prompt)  I WILL UPDATE ON THE PRODUCT IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS, BAD OR GOOD.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s been close to a month that I&#x27;ve been using it. Not sure about hair, but my nails do seem stronger and aren&#x27;t breaking and flaking now! I read about people breaking out, but haven&#x27;t experienced any of that. But I never have had problematic skin, so maybe that makes a difference. Anyways, pleased with my nails, will have to pay more attention to my hair so I can assess that, but all in all, it&#x27;s a great product at a good price!</li>
    <li> Great product - have purchased Biotin 5000mg for years for healthy hair, nails and skin -- highly recommend.  SUPER Fast Shipping!!</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed. Not sure if it grew my hair. i didn&#x27;t see any difference after use of almost two months. but my skin was keep breaking up. i never had acne on my body but use of Biotin caused acne on my back and face. i am going to stop using it as other people complained the same bad experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d started experiencing hair loss &amp; my nails would not grow. I started taking Biotin 2 years ago &amp; immediately noticed that my nails were growing out thicker, not splitting or breaking. My nails grow out so well it looks as though they are fake!&lt;br /&gt;The problem with my hair took longer. There was a spot on the crown of my head that was thinning &amp; every time I brushed my hair more would end up on the brush than staying on my head. After a couple months my hair started growing out fast &amp; was thicker, now the bald spot is growing back in. My hair is longer, healthier &amp; thicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple times I stopped taking Biotin, for reasons I don&#x27;t even know only to have all my nails break &amp; hair stop growing so nicely. I won&#x27;t be without Biotin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are skeptical, give it some time &amp; take your Biotin every day. It may take longer, or you may see noticeable results right away. No matter how long it takes, once the Biotin starts working for you it is a wonderful thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now started my grandmother on Biotin for her nails &amp; hair loss. 2 years ago I was losing so much hair that I wanted to put it all on a wig for when I went bald, and my nails were so pitiful that I was having them salon done. Now my hair is thicker, fuller &amp; growing back in. My nails look like a pink &amp; white manicure from the salon, yet they are real! This stuff works. Give it time to do what it needs to, but it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! My hair has grown an inch in 2 weeks. I&#x27;m very impatient so I took the recommended dose of 1-2 pills twice/day. I take 2 pills 3 times per day with meals.  Six pills/day has been getting the job done and the product it&#x27;s cheap enough to do it. However, my hair has been drier than normal lately, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the Biotin. It could be because I have all of my car windows down when I drive and my hair takes a beating. I&#x27;ll have a better idea of what&#x27;s causing the dryness when I keep my windows up this winter.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and was pumped to see what Biotin could do for me.      Well, after two bottles I can safely say it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. (I did give it a couple of months.) My nails are just as brittle and my hair is just as thin. There was no extra energy going on. Nothing. Dang it.    Supplements don&#x27;t work for everybody: I get that. Evidently I&#x27;m in the minority here, but just want to give a heads up to others who have great hopes of a miracle happening by using this product.    I give this two stars because I can honestly say it&#x27;s not a faulty product. It just didn&#x27;t help ME at all - but I wish it did.</li>
    <li> As said in the subject line, I have been using this in combination with Kirkland&#x27;s 5% minoxidil and I am seeing my hair coming back to me, which is a blessing since before this I have been trying many ways. For someone with a very low budget like myself (that is, no way I could afford a surgery), this proves to be effective and affordable.</li>
    <li> not sure, i cant really tell if this helps. i originally bought it because im loosing hair on the top.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested I take a daily biotin supplement to help my slow-growing hair. I used this particular product for two full months, and here&#x27;s my experience: Initially, I started with 1 pill, but it didn&#x27;t seem enough (due to research, which says 10,000mcg is better), so I increased my daily dosage to 2 pills. I can say for certain that my nails grew like CRAZY with this supplement. But, it didn&#x27;t help the hair on my head in ANY way, though it made my skin extra smooth. Here&#x27;s the caveat: I have noticed some body hair loss on the arms/legs, which concerns me - that&#x27;s not normal. So while I think this may not necessarily be a bad supplement, I am re-thinking taking more of it (or Biotin altogether) due to the body hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE (April 3, 2011): I have decided to STOP taking this Biotin supplement because I have noticed more body hair loss on my arms, which I never had before. Now that I&#x27;ve stopped for a week, there are tiny hairs growing back out, but they are very fine. Not sure if this is my individual reaction to this product, or to Biotin in general, but it is best not to take it further. The hair on my head does not seem to be affected one way/another with this supplement (or perhaps I lost more being on it!), but my nail growth has slowed down (which is okay). Now it makes me wonder about the quality of the product, or biotin in general,...because it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair grow, not cause hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE (June 11, 2011): The hair on my body is nearly back to normal since I stopped taking this supplement. Not sure if it&#x27;s the quality of the ingredients in this particular brand or biotin in general, but it caused patchy body hair loss all over. Now I&#x27;m certain it was the biotin because 3 months later, the hair that was gone on my body is back! The supplement may not affect everyone in the same way, but it definitely does have side effects for some of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE (December 17, 2012): I just found out that biotin INCREASES testosterone in the body. That makes total sense that many who have taken biotin in the hopes of decreasing head hair loss have instead ended up with body hair growth and cystic acne instead (a definite sign of excess testosterone in the body). I believe the whole \\&quot;biotin will increase hair growth on the head\\&quot; is a marketing scheme that even physicians are buying into without doing their research. Do not recommend for hair growth!INCREASES testosterone in the body.

    <li> Really helps my nails from peeling and splitting so badly!</li>
    <li> Now Vites are great products.  I have no functioning thyroid, but Biotin, taken with a Stress B vitamin capsule, causes my hair to grow and keep some of its natural curl.  It falls out and breaks less as well.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. Strengthens my hair and nails.  Cleans up my blemishes and somehow seems to smooth out my cellulite.  Also seem to help in weight loss.  I have tried other brands though and they do not work as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the sole purpose of helping my hair grow because I ended up getting a tragic haircut. I&#x27;ve been taking biotin for about a week and a half. Obviously this is not long enough to see any real results on my hair. But what has happened, and why I decided to write this review this early, is I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic improvement on my sleep and I think that it can be attributed to the biotin. I&#x27;ve dealt with insomnia and sleep walking since I was a kid, and I average about 4 hours of sleep a night and am tired and groggy every day. Even on the weekends when I manage to get a decent amount of sleep I&#x27;m still dragging. After a day or two of beginning these supplements, I noticed that I was falling asleep so much easier. After about a week I noticed that I feel asleep as soon as I went to bed, and actually stayed asleep throughout the night! Best of all, within minutes of waking up, I&#x27;m alert and awake. Taking biotin is the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently, so I&#x27;m sure that it is the cause of my improved sleep.    As far as my hair, I am using this in conjunction with the Mane N&#x27; Tail shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in how my hair looks as far as shine and softness. It has grown a bit, but nothing drastic, but I assume it takes a month or two of taking these supplements to see any major growth. At this point, I really don&#x27;t care though, I&#x27;m so happy with being able to actually sleep that I will continue to take these supplements for that purpose alone.    Update 6/14/11: It has been a month and I noticed a definite increase in hair growth! My hair grew a little over 1 inch since taking the pills (2 a day), which is exactly what I was hoping for. I still have about 2 more inches to go before this haircut grows out but I&#x27;m very pleased with the rate of growth. I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems other reviewers talked about so I will continue to take these pills, and just purchased another bottle. Oh, and my nails are long and strongnow too!</li>
    <li> Product works great! I have been using it for a month and I&#x27;ve seen significant difference in my skin, nails, and hair. Being that I am a black woman I have tons of products at home that don&#x27;t do what they claim, so it is quite refreshing to finally find a product that not only is good for my health but also will aid in my hair growth, limit hair shedding, provide me with bright clear skin, and strengthen my nail growth. All in all, this is definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, i love it!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It grows your hair really thick and fast&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It grows ALL your hair really thick and fast. Beware of nose hairs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just keep this simple and straight. Months ago, i had a 6 hours surgery and ended up in ICU for a week. Weeks after that, i had massive shedding and feeling weakness.  The weakness i just attributed to the surgery but had no clue about the shedding.  The shedding was really extensive that i was afraid to take a shower.    Search the internet.  Found this on Amazon. Read customer&#x27;s review on this product. Bought it a month later. Few weeks after i tried this, shedding stopped to the point that i can finally comb my hair.  I started to feel energize. My mom was the one who noticed it and told me to sit down for a change.    I am not here to encourage you buy this product.  I am simply writing my own experience and what this product has done to me.     It really helps when you read other people&#x27;s reviews on the product and to have the open mind and try it. I will be re-ordering this when all is gone.</li>
    <li> I am a 49 year old female.  A few years ago I started losing more hair than usual and it was not growing back as fast as it used to.  Biotin has really slowed down the hair loss.  It is still thinner than I would like on top, but I think that is part of aging.  I definitely recommend Biotin for healthy hair.  I have noticed no change in my fingernails.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and well.  Have been pleased with product performance.  Will reorder!</li>
    <li> I feel good with no after effects.</li>
    <li> I get very tired because I&#x27;m anemic. So I got these, so now I don&#x27;t have to take like 3 naps a day. I didn&#x27;t need these for my nails because they grow really fast and are strong. My eyelashes are beautiful, they got longer like 2 weeks of using these vitamins. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 months now. My hair grew about 1 inch, but I went natural so I&#x27;m not sure on how much the vitamins helped with hair growth. I don&#x27;t get the crazy body hair like a lot of people say that they get.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very well made and high quality finish is very good. Thanks, greetings from Colombia. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I decided to try adding Biotin to my daily supplements after reading that it often helps with thinning hair. I chose the Now brand because it&#x27;s attractively priced and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the quality of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably too early to judge as far as my hair, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the month I have been taking it. My fingernails are a different story, though. Wow! I have long, strong fingernails for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take one capsule twice daily, as directed on the bottle. The capsules are not huge and I&#x27;ve had no stomach upsets even though I take them on an empty stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have always been weak, thin, and prone to peeling and breaking. I am an avid DIYer with an old house and I constantly have some sort of project going on that is murder on fingernails - grouting tile, stripping furniture, heavy yard work, etc. I kept my nails cut extremely short because if I let them grow at all, they would split and tear immediately. I&#x27;ve tried the polishes and oils that claim to strengthen weak nails but they had no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the month that I have been taking Biotin, my fingernails have not split, peeled or broken once and they are long for the first time ever! They are thick and strong and I&#x27;ll bet I could carve my initials in a tree with them. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the scheme of things, long fingernails are not high on my list of priorities but I am certainly enjoying having long, feminine nails. I suspect that I will see improvements in my hair over time, too, since hair and nails are made of the same structural proteins called keratins, but so far I see no difference. I will update this review in the future if I see improvements in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works with sustained use</li>
    <li> I actually think it helps! My hair was growing and my nails were healthier and I didn&#x27;t notice until I stopped taking the vitamins!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on these pills for a month now and it is great. My hair stopped falling and I can see little new hair growing back.  I highly recommend it   :D</li>
    <li> The product is great, my nails are stronger and my hair grew fast. However, because its such a high dose of Biotin, my body couldn&#x27;t deal with it, and i started breaking out. Biotin can cause cystic acne, it all depends on if your body can handle it. I cut down to one pill unstead of two and my face cleared up. The product itself is great, and shipping time was pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now. The first sign that it was working was my nails. I got acrylics put on, and they have already grown out almost a centimeter over a week, which is almost double how much they usually grow. Second, i noticed my hair seemed stronger and a shinier, healthy texture. I&#x27;ve notice less split ends and less dryness aswell. As for hair growth, i am unsure if it has increased at all since i havent been taking them all that long yet. I hope to see much hair growth because that is why i bought this product. I&#x27;m liking the results so far and i will update from time to time to give results!</li>
    <li> This is good product.  I was taking two pills each morning.  BUT, it did NOT thicken up my thining hair.  My hair was shiny.  But, no change in helping with the bad thining.  However, my nails are beautiful!  They grew very quickly and strong.  So, if you have a problem with nails, I recommend it, but not for hair thinning.  I will have to try something else for that.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Now vitamin supplements for years and this Biotin is no different as is excellent in price and quality. I like the size of these capsules, they are not to hard to swallow. What I find that helps when taking them is to stick the supplement in your mouth, rinse it around for a little bit in water before swallowing. It helps smooth the sides of it, so it will go down easier. Being a vegan, it is hard to find supplements that don&#x27;t have animal products in them, that&#x27;s why I can count on Now Foods to give me the products I need. I do not work for Now Foods, but I would recommend their products. God bless!</li>
    <li> I have been taking Biotin 5000mcg for a few months now.  It has really made my hair thicker and healthier looking.  My nails have also gotten strong.  I definitely recommend the Biotin 5000mcg, however I suggest getting the Spring Valley Brand because they are small gel caps.  If you like me you don&#x27;t like swallowing those huge pills/capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link for the Spring Valley Biotin 5000 mcg is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026QPS4E/ref&#x3D;as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;9325&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0026QPS4E&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;facebaccou06-20\\&quot;&gt;Spring Valley - Biotin 5000 mcg, Super Potency, 120 Softgels&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#60;img src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t&#x3D;facebaccou06-20&amp;l&#x3D;as2&amp;o&#x3D;1&amp;a&#x3D;B0026QPS4E&amp;#34; width&#x3D;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; height&#x3D;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; border&#x3D;&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt&#x3D;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; style&#x3D;&amp;#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&amp;#34; &amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This Vcap Biotin is wonderful. I take it in conjunction with a number of other vitamins as part of a regimen.  It works great.  I was taking it one time a day and now take it twice and the results are remarkable.  They are very easy to swallow and do not upset my stomach.  I am still using them with great success.  A must for anyone who is trying to grow out their hair and nails (and seeking beautiful skin).</li>
    <li> Just began to use, therefore I have no comment at this time.</li>
    <li> My nails are easily damaged because they are so soft. I purchased this in the hopes that my nails would become a bit more resilient, but I&#x27;m seeing no difference.</li>
    <li> I am going to keep taking it as I think it&#x27;s working a bit.......my hair isn&#x27;t quite as thin as it was looking.  They say you have to take it three months or so before really seeing the effects, but enough people told me about it that I am willing to keep with it....... I&#x27;m on my third bottle and intend to stay with it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be Working well for hair and nail growth and the transaction with the seller went really smoothly.  The effects of hair and nail growth showed up with in two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of Biotin. I have received the most benefits from this brand compared to the pricier products I have used. I have been using this brand for 6+ months. My nails have always been thin and peel. Since using this product my nails are strong and long, I have to clip them (never needed to before). My hair is also pretty thin in the front, and I have had new growth and its starting to thicken up. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I started taking Biotin about 3 weeks ago and notice a HUGE difference in the strength of my nails, but most importantly, I&#x27;m shedding much less hair, which was the original reason I bought the Biotin. Ever since I had my daughter 9 years ago, I&#x27;ve been losing so much hair. I used to have thick, curly hair, but I&#x27;ve lost so much hair in the shower, brushing my hair, etc. I was desperate to find something that would slow the hair loss down because I&#x27;m only 28 years old, and I knew I shouldn&#x27;t be having this problem already. The Biotin has been awesome! I barely shed any hair in the shower or when brushing it. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using and buying this product.</li>
    <li> Good vits at a decent price.  This is the second time I order them. That&#x27;s all I have to say so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male who has thin hair in the front part of my hair (non hereditary). I&#x27;ve been taking this product since around 2 months. I used to take Perfectil before (a British medicine for hair and nails, but that was very expensive).    Biotin seems good. My nails are strong and don&#x27;t break. They used to break with my hand.    As to the skin, I don&#x27;t know if anything has changed.    Regarding my hair, I&#x27;m already taking Minoxidil for men from Rogaine, prescribed by a doctor. It&#x27;s giving me very nice results, and have been taking it since a couple of years. So the purpose of taking biotin is that I read good reviews about it, and I decided that it maybe give better results if taken along with Rogaine. I didn&#x27;t read any warnings for doing that. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s giving me better results. But I think my hair is growing faster.</li>
    <li> I really like this product I noticed improvements in a short period of time. My nails are stronger and healthier and my hair is growing I would recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their nails or hair or both. The only downside is that you get an increase in hair growth everywhere.</li>
    <li> Excellent, arrived quickly, easy tO take and I can see some results after nearly 4 weeks of taking it, price is great too. I noticed some People say they get acne; I amms</li>
    <li> My wife and I live in Chicago and had been experiencing severe hair loss, and had tried several home remedies of eating healthy, applying oils/ointments but nothing worked. Finally someone suggested this and it works like a miracle. Our hair loss has stopped and hair have strengthened. Too bad we didn&#x27;t know about this earlier and I Lteady lost half my hair.</li>
    <li> MY NAILS ARE GROWING STRONGER AND MY &amp;#34;ALMOST&amp;#34; BALD SPOT ON THE TOP/BACK OF MY HEAD IS GONE.  I ALSO BOUGHT THE 10,000MCG CAPS AND USE THEM INSTEAD OF TAKING 2 OF THE 5,000MCG PILLS.</li>
    <li> I am finishing off my bottle this week. I wanted to wait until i was almost done with the bottle before I wrote a review...   I love this product! I have received so many complements on how long my hair has grown! My boyfriend loves it :)  2 weeks ago I went to get a trim and told the hair dresser not to snip too much, she said \\&quot;not cut too much? your hair is so long you wont even be able to tell!\\&quot; This product really strengthens the hair (I&#x27;m not sure about its use in improving thickness, my hair is already thick) and adds length! I can literally feel my hair touching down the middle of my back. It just took a while to see results, that is why i gave it 4 stars, but its worth it! Will defiantly be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I have been taking Now Biotin for about 3 weeks now, and I have noticed length, strength, and less hair fall out, and my nails have grown twice as fast. It is really a wonderful product if you need your hair to be healthy and strong. Along with a healthy lifestyle, Now Biotin is a great supplement to add to your daily routine.</li>
    <li> Its working for me, I have seen the improvement in just 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> After using this product for almost 2 weeks now there is a big improvement in my hair texture,silkier,smoother,and stronger.</li>
    <li> biotin is great for hair and cell growth. i have been taking biotin for a month now and i can see the difference.but i already have thick hair  i just wanted it to grow faster.yes it does work for me.so try this product if you want longer thicker hair.now it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. you have to pump your body with it for a month or two to see it working.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything but make me burp. No hair growth, my skin wasn&#x27;t any different. This product sucked.</li>
    <li> I and my husband have used this product for last 3 months. We took two a day morning and night. I see that my nails got thicker, but I have not seen no change at all on my hair and my husband. It looks like we have lost more hair!I am planning to take another brand one. I hope it works this time.</li>
    <li> I have heard good things about this product. Since I have only been taking it a few days I can&#x27;t say it works for thinning hair yet. But I can say it arrived on time as promised.  I would like to do another review later to updated you.</li>
    <li> This supplement is supposed to be beneficial for hair and nails.  I use it just in case it will work.</li>
    <li> Ive been taking biotin twice a day and my hair, though it generally grows quickly, is growing not only longer but thicker too. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that my nails are growing faster as well. Love it. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of this product and have been using it for over 2 months now. My hair fall has reduced considerably. I can see new hair growth. Good product but takes time to show results.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product is working after just taking it for a week, but my nails are growing and my hair looks thicker as well, which I always had thinning hair and soft nails. I take it twice a day.  The only side effect that I have is a little bit of acid reflux after taking them, but other than that Im okay with this product</li>
    <li> I honest to God am shocked on how well this product worked! Ive only used one bottle of it and my hair is healthier and 3inches longer. I a m also taking prenatal pills so i don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with the great results i have gotten from it. I&#x27;m so glad i bought a few bottles because i love this stuff!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes. I.e. cystic acne etc. Will update product feedback after prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013&lt;br /&gt;I bought his product a year ago. I haven&#x27;t noticed any acne. What I have noticed is the tremendously THICK hair on my head. My nails grow the fastest they&#x27;ve ever grew in life. Very pleased with this product. One downside is that I do feel lethargic after taking this despite the comments about raging with energy. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, I don&#x27;t know. I only take one a day. Other than that,  everything&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I recently just went natural so I need it a lil help to make my hair grow. At first I was a lil hesitant but the pills really came through</li>
    <li> My hair did grow, but I got awful acne on my face and back like some other reviews stated. I guess it just depends on your body...</li>
    <li> i am an 18 yr old female and after losing a lot of hair probably due to school stress i decided to take biotin. I did see great results after 2 months on consistent use and was very happy. i was taking it only once a day as i heard more than that might strike up acne for people prone to it. however after three and a half months of using i noticed some hair growing on one side of my face in the aideburn area and immediately went off. as much as i like to have thick hair on my head i dont need it anywhere else! ill probably go back on it in about a month.</li>
    <li> wonderful for my hair...now products are the most outstanding quality according to my doctor!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! My hair and nails have grown since using this biotin product for 6 weeks.. Amazing!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> NOW is an excellent quality brand; good price and shipping time; would buy again...</li>
    <li> I lose lots of hair after the pregnancy three years ago, this really helps my hair &amp; nail grow faster. The only downside is I start having headaches before my monthly periods, now I&#x27;ll stop taking these few days before my periods is coming. I still recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great product, this has strengthened my nails and helped increase my hair growth. I am glad to find something that actually works because there are so many vitamins out there that have so many claims. This is a potent strength of biotin so most will want to see how your body handles it, I only use 1 pill per day and that is enough to see results.</li>
    <li> Taking for hair growth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been paying a like more in a store for a similar product. Plus I had the inconvenience of having to go to the store. This was more economical and convenient. It arrived on time and was well-packaged. The product has really helped my nails and hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had acne since I was a teenager.  After 2 months of biotin, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much gain in hair growth (although the hair that I do have appeared to have thickened) but last week I got a breakout of cystic acne!  Doing some research, I found that others have experienced the same issue.</li>
    <li> hair and nails grow at great speed and hair not thinning due to age and menopause</li>
    <li> I started using Biotin because of hair loss.  My family has a history of hair loss in women.  I am a 46-year old African American female.  I also use hair relaxers on a regular basis.  Every two weeks I had collected about a baseball size amount of hair from my clothes and hair comb/brush.  I was devastated. My dermatologist determined the hair loss was due to female patterned baldness (not the use of hair relaxers) because the hair was coming out at the root (not breaking).  She said other methods of hair styling (going natural, cornrows, pressing, etc.) can also result in hair loss so she did not recommend that I change my styling methods.  Although I am female, she recommended Men&#x27;s Rogaine.  After doing some research, I found out that Men&#x27;s Rogaine is more effective but not recommended for women because the FDA has not tested it on women.  Also, Rogaine is designed to \\&quot;regrow\\&quot; hair, not to stop it from coming out.  After using Rogaine for about a month, I had a nice little mustache like a 13-year-old teen boy.  Yikes!  I always had some facial hair, even over my lip, but this was very noticable to me and my husband (other&#x27;s said they couldn&#x27;t tell a difference).  I got a hair remover and got rid of that.  I also stopped using the Rogaine.  I started using Biotin but I also made sure to take my multivitamin EVERYDAY, my calcium supplement EVERYDAY, and my fish oil pill EVERYDAY.  Although I was taking these things before, it was more sporadic.  Now, about 2 months since starting Biotin, I barely have any hair in my comb/brush and I do not have long strands of hair all over my clothes.  I am very happy.  Not sure if it is the Biotin alone or the combo with the fish oil and calcium but I am not going to stop taking any of them.  My mom said to make sure to drink plenty of water because you could tax your kidneys with trying to flush the excess out.  As far as the acne, I did notice a few pumps on my forehead but nothing horrible.  I just got some Clearsil acne treatment from the grocery store and after about 3 days of use, the little pumps are almost gone.  I hope this review helps you with your hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> Based on some reviews that 2 capsules of 5000mcg give an adverse effects (hair falls off, dryer skin), I decided to take only 1 capsule. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and no change for me. Still dry skin and lifeless hair. One more week then I&#x27;ll up the dose to the recommended 2 capsules a day.</li>
    <li> In conjunction with gelatin, Biotin has helped my dog&#x27;s problem with losing his nails.  At one point, my dog lost all of his nails, but now they are growing back and we are able to dremmel them to continue to strengthen them.  The process has taken some time, but with some patience and persistance, this product does work.</li>
    <li> My girls and I use this, we did not see desired results. We was looking for hair growth, no change in our hair at all. I would not recommend this product at all. [[ASIN:B0052TMXYU Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively young but my hair has been thinning out recently. So I used this before all my hair had gone and in just a month I noticed quite a bit of difference, four months down the track my hair is a lot thicker (thank goodness). My nails also look a bit shinier and less dry. Really happy with Amazon in this purchase, got good shipping rates and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My hair and nails were very much thinning due to Throid conditions, but since I start taking this poducts it has helped a lot and my hair now thick, happy! a MUST BUY.</li>
    <li> My nails naturally peel and are not very strong. So I started taking biotin on the advice of a health care provider. It definitely works, but you have to take it long enough for your nails to produce new growth before you stop peeling. Now my nails don&#x27;t peel at all except if they&#x27;re damaged by something I do.</li>
    <li> Hi, I am a 49 yr old menopause woman, experiencing hair loss due to menopause,medication &amp; frequent use of hair dyes.  My daughter came across this product and ordered it for me. Within a 2 weeks of using it, I noticed a decrease in the falling of my hair and by the end of my first month, my hair had totally stop falling out and looked healthier. Friends did noticed &amp; commented how my hair looked healthy and nice.. I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss! My 18yrs old daughter also uses it when she notices hair hair is falling alittle more than normal due to flat irons, blow drying and dying.. It really worked for both of us. I would recommend it anytime..</li>
    <li> i took biotin for hairloss and after taking it for 5 months i didnt see any improvement instead my hair continued to fall out. [[ASIN:B000NL6U8W Biotin 5000 mcg - 60 Count]]</li>
    <li> My hair had started breaking off and shedding - I use the biotin along with other hair products shampoo, conditioner, etc.  My hair is doing alot better and I can really tell the difference - Took a while to see results.</li>
    <li> I had stopped getting my haircut back in May 2011 and wanted to grow it out after a terrible haircut.  Took this for about 3 months and I had grown some awesome hair, leading to Nov 2011 when unfortunately I got another terrible haircut.  I am now going to take this for the next three months to work my way back to where I was before this haircut.  Awesome product, although keep in mind that 5000 mcg &#x3D; 5 mg when shopping around, its the same formula.</li>
    <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
    <li> I take this for thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t help it get any thicker but it does keep it fom getting thinner. My alternative Doc suggested it and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I am a 27 year old male that&#x27;s been losing hair for 5+ years. After intense research on the internet, I first came across Nioxin recharging complex 120 capsules. After reading all the reviews I was convinced to try nioxin. I was taking nioxin for 3 months and the results were minimal to none, I use to experience heavy shedding on my pillow, after using nioxin I saw little change, but no drastic change at all. After reading reviews from other customers that used nioxin, I discovered biotin was the main ingredient that nioxin used for hair. So after reading a few reviews I was convinced to switch to Biotin which has 5000mcg Vs Nioxin&#x27;s 300mcg (big difference). I&#x27;ve now been using Biotin for 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the shedding on my pillow that I once witnessed is gone. I went from 15+ strands of hair on my pillow to 2 max. I&#x27;ve always shed in the showers while shampooing my hair, I sometimes see hair on my hands and on the shower floor, now there is minimal to almost none. Wow I can honestly say this is the result of Biotin. For someone that&#x27;s been suffering intense hair loss, to see those results were quite amazing. I come from a family that has a long pattern of balding men. I recommend this product to anyone losing hair (I cannot say weather I grew any new hair using this product because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough) I will update once I see results.</li>
    <li> I have been taking 2.5 mg of Biotin via Appearex brand supplements for 3 years but was looking for a lower cost alternative. Even though the NOW brand are 5mg biotin, they are just not effective. My fingernails returned to the original condition where they would tear very close to the nailbed as soon as some growth was attained. Either lower bioavailability or something in the compounding, but this just doesn&#x27;t have the desired effect on my fingernails. I am going back to Apperex.</li>
    <li> use this supplement to repair/renew my nervous system/nerve cells that are damaged BEYOND SUCH state as per diabetic docs/med personnel who are quick to steer peeps to rx meds like &amp;#34;lyrica&amp;#34; that are just a rip-off and don&#x27;t work on the pain, just the anti-depressant effect on your mind so that you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; you get relief!  also taking niacinamide,p-5-p (b6)B1, B12 patches(real effective!!)b vitamins in general and have rx &amp;#34;deplin&amp;#34; but will be switching to l-5mthfr (B9-folate) when that runs out. so far am very pleased considering have had neuropathy for 15yrs and prior to my regimen had suffered doing everyday activities of living but no more!  cant do heavy rx opiods bc kidney function (genetic base) is issue either.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair and nails are growing like crazy</li>
    <li> Anytime i order Biotin in the same 5000mcg, it&#x27;s usually a tiny pill and i miss the tiny pill.  These veggie caps are huge at least double the tiny biotin veggie caps i normally get.  With all the vitamins i take i love it when i have a tiny vitamin.  So yeah, i&#x27;m sorry but i won&#x27;t be ordering these again:(</li>
    <li> I have been taking Biotin capsules off and on for the past two years, and I do notice a difference in my skin,hair, nails and eyelashes when I take the supplements. However the difference is slight. I have the greatest results when I take Now Foods Biotin and Now Foods Hyaluronic Acid [[ASIN:B000PWGDZ4 NOW Foods Hyaluronic Acid 100Mg 2X Plus, 60-Vcaps]]  together. And to be completely honest you will see a significant difference in your appearence with the Hyaluronic Acid alone if healthier hair and skin is your goal. However, it may upset those with sensitive stomachs, and for these people Biotin is definitely the way to go(Not sure why so do the research before you purchase!).     I purchased both of these products on a site called IHerb which basically the online Walmart of supplements. Check it out. You can save $5 on your first order using the following code: HAJ736    In any case the Now Foods brand is definitely the way to go!    HTH</li>
    <li> Biotin will help your hair to grow.  You can also get Biotin in a multivitamin that resembles a prenatal vitamin sans the high iron count.  I was worried about the cystic acne that I had heard other users talk about.  I suppose it helped that I started out on a much lower dose and worked my way up.  Also I made a very conscientious effort to stay hydrated so that I could flush out whatever Biotin my body wasn&#x27;t using.  I also took biotin with Hyalruonic acid which helps with joint flexibility and your skin&#x27;s elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a little research on Biotin, but apparently what your body doesn&#x27;t need, it flushes out.  Most people do see results in about two weeks.  I had been using Maxihair and my hair was already on a fast track of growth so it would be hard for me to gauge exactly how fast my hair was growing with just biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple things going on here.  I lost some hair due to my neurological medication  that I take because of an automobile accident, and then I also have PCOS.  Women with PCOS usually have all kinds of fun hair on their face and such, and they also are insulin resistant.  Interestingly the biotin helps to  reduce triglycerides as well as a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; form for cholesterol called \\&quot;VLDL\\&quot; which tends to be present in PCOS patients blood.  And the Biotin and a combination of Chromium can help to reduce the blood sugar of diabetics.  So in trying to grow back my lost hair I ended up doing something pretty good for my PCOS.  I would suggest that if you have PCOS you should have a little chat with your doctor before you go ahead, especially if you are already on something for your insulin issues.  (I am also on Metformin for my PCOS, but apparently not as high a dose as you can go.) For any other PCOS patients who may be concerned about growing hair other than where hair should be, I have had no new facial hair as a result of using Biotin.  My eyelashes are longer and thicker, but this is desirable, my eyebrows are about normal, no new mustache, no beard, no neck hair.  Just my eyelashes and my head.  No increase in my arm hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.he, no beard, no neck hair.  Just my eyelashes and my head.  No increase in my arm hair either.      Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other reviewers but there is no smell to the NOW Biotin caps.There are in gel caps so it&#x27;s easy to swallow and so far I have not seen any side effects.I have taken it with and without food and I&#x27;m loving it.I can&#x27;t wait to see my end results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I really don&#x27;t see a difference.  Appearex was better.</li>
    <li> Good price. Quick shipping. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great company and products! Can see a big difference in my hair since using this product.</li>
    <li> Ive been taking Biotin on and off for over a year, and its great for my nails and hair.  I like the Now Foods brand because of the quality. I wasnt happy with the size of the pill, however its a VCAP so it goes down a lot smoother. After a horrible experience with Gel Nails, it left my natural nails weak and brittle. I had to cut them down to the nailbed and start over. I purchased this Biotin over a month ago and my nails have seen significant growth.</li>
    <li> I have thinner hair and nails as time as marched on. I started using Biotin over six months ago and have seen a positive difference. My hair has not gotten thinner, my eyelashes are much, much longer, and my nails are stronger and no longer split. Don&#x27;t expect a noticeable change right away, it has taken time. Biotin is part of my vitamin regiment and I can&#x27;t see ever not taking it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I was told by my dermatologist that it would help prevent hair fall. I have been using it for about 1 week now and have noticed that my hair has stopped falling so much. Although it is still coming out, it has definitely stopped coming out by the hands full. I will continue using this product and see how long it takes for my hair to get back to it&#x27;s normal thickness.</li>
    <li> I take Biotin supplements on a regular basis and I had run out of my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; ones. I happened to be shopping on Amazon one day and just decided that I would try these, since I&#x27;ve ordered from this company before and liked their products. Don&#x27;t know if it was the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; or what that bothered me but I did not enjoy taking them. Finished the bottle and then went back to my regular brand.</li>
    <li> As a Diabetic, I have been taking Biotin for many years but at the 1000mg level. This at 5 times that is dificult to say after a couple of months whether it has added benefits or not. Will probably take atleast 6 mo to a year to totally evaluate it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will use it faithfully. My hair and nails is doing great. I really thank my dermatologist recommended this product.</li>
    <li> One gelcap a day and after a while, 2 weeks or so, you start seeing the difference in your hair and nails too.</li>
    <li> I take it to prevent hair loss while taking high doses of Alpha lipoic acid. I never took it alone so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was lookin for a vitamin/ supplement for my hair and nails. I didnt notice any difference with this product after 6 months. I started taking pre natel gummie vitamins and my hair is long and silky. My face is clear and I couldnt be happier. I dont recommened this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I purchase.  I have notice my hair grow rather quickly since I started to take these vitamins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I have been using this for a month. He noticed a difference in his beard in 2 to 3 weeks, and my hair seems healthier and shinier. I also think that it is growing faster.</li>
    <li> I decided to wait several months before writing a review for this product because I wanted to be able to give a full description on it&#x27;s impact to my hair / health. I&#x27;ve been taking Biotin since August and have been very happy with the results. I am bi-racial (mother white / father black) with thick, curly hair. For the last 10years I have straighten my hair... the first 5 years chemically and with heat, the last 5 years only with heat. I put heat on hair everyday... every single day. As you can imagine, my hair was breaking a lot and it growing unevenly and slowly. For the most part, I couldn&#x27;t get it to grow past the top of my shoulders. I decided to try this product after receiving a recommendation from a stylist.   The first change I noticed after taking Biotin was my nails grew thicker and quicker. My nails have always been rather brittle and would break and split. For years I wore acrylics or would keep them really short. I no longer have those problems. While I do not keep my nails long, they are much tougher and stronger.  It took about 1-1.5mths before I noticed an impact on my hair. This could be because I got a bad hair cut (by a different stylist) shortly before trying Biotin. Overall, my hair is growing much quicker and fuller. It has a really nice sheen and is very thick. Even my family and friends have commented on my hair growth.   I have not noticed an impact on my skin. I have never been prone to acne and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it since I started Biotin.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product and already have to friends. Just be warned that is not some miracle drug that will give you hair like Rapunzel. It does take time to have an effect on hair. I plan on continuing for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.  I am not really sure if I would buy it again.  I am not sure if I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent for nourishing your hair.  I combined this with a multi vitamin, but have run out of the vitamin and am just taking these, and the hair growth and good skin have continued, so this product is the main reason for my thicker and healthier hair and it&#x27;s faster growth.  It has made a believer out of me!  My hair has grown lush new growth of 3 1/2 - 4 inches in 8 months, thick and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;One down side is that the hair on my legs is thicker and stiffer, so while it does wonders for your head hair, it obviously makes you overall body hair thicker and healthier~  lol.  Totally worth the extra shaving to have a wonderful head of hair again, I cut most of my hair off and realized that was a huge mistake for my face and body type, so I bought this to assist mother nature in expediting long hair again and I have not been disappointed, will continue to purchase and use from now on.</li>
    <li> Good price, seems to improve hair smoothness.</li>
    <li> Have been taking this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed stronger nails with less breakage at the tips. I have even jammed my nails fully expecting a break but was surprised when they didn&#x27;t. Have not seen any real difference in hair growth which is what I really wanted but I am also starting slow at 1 pill a day. Will up it to 2 and see if there is a change. Have not had any stomach issues but I also take it food and with a good glass of water. Will likely buy again if anything to help my nails.</li>
    <li> I cant say if this works by itself, all I can say is that if you use it with the Kirkland minoxidil you might have a good chance at hair regrowth. It has worked for me greatly, so hope it works for you too.</li>
    <li> Good product, good seller, all right!</li>
    <li> Take 1 tablet daily for stronger, healthier and vibrant hair. I&#x27;ve already noticed a huge difference in my hair. My hair is shiner and stronger</li>
    <li> Having thyroid problems effects your hair and nails.  Big improvements once I had been on this biotin for more than 3 months.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved since starting to use this product, but I can&#x27;t decisively say it&#x27;s due to the biotin, as I use a couple  other product along with it.  Have definitely noticed that hair and nails seem to grow faster.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotin now for 2 weeks and can already see a difference in my skin and a difference in my nails.  They are both significantly different in appearance.  My skin is smooth and glowing and my nails have grown considerably and are definitely much stronger, I can&#x27;t believe in just 2 weeks I can notice the changes already.  I will have to use it for a couple more weeks to see a difference in my hair but I am sure I will like my nails and my skin notice a difference.  So far I am pleased with the results and would have no hesitation in recommending this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a carribbean woman and was sceptical at first in using this product but I am so far very pleased with the results. [[ASIN:B000BY2N7S NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps]]</li>
    <li> use it together with selenium and works great.</li>
    <li> used it for over 3 months. did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Since I Have started taking these pills one a day with meals I have notices that my hair has gotten longer about 1.5 times its normal growth rate. Of notable mention is  my stubby nails which for the first time in years have grown passed the nail beds. They are so beautiful now I do not bit them any more.</li>
    <li> My mother recommended biotin after I complemented her on how thick her hair looked.  She said that her hair and nails got thicker after she started taking it.  I&#x27;ve been taking this for over a year.  My hair might be MAYBE just a tad thicker--certainly not a lot.  There has been no change in my nails -- they still occasionally split down at the quick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Biotin supplement for 3 months and I have already seen about 2 inches of hair growth. Not only is my hair growing faster than usual, it is shinier and overall appears healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown, thick, sometimes wavy, sometimes curly, sometimes straight hair, that I do not treat in any way. The most damaging thing I do to my hair is wear it in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use this supplement to grow long illustrious hair.&lt;br /&gt;My finger nails also seem stronger than before, but that is more subjective.&lt;br /&gt;The pill is on the bigger side, but I have no trouble swallowing it at the same time as 4 other smaller pills, as the pill casing is smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken Biotin for a couple years now and this one does what it says it does. I feel much better having this supplement in my regimen. I was excited to see this offered on Subscribe &amp; Save. That way, I never have to worry about running out.  It&#x27;s nice having it delivered right to my door.  Life is good and it&#x27;s getting better everyday. The shipping is fast and the product works. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> pills are in a very good price, I recommend them to anyone who wants to buy them are very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would help my hair stop thinning. Not sure if it did that, but my nails did grow much faster than they used to.</li>
    <li> Works as described. No problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for hair growth, hoping it would stop my hair from falling out. Now, almost all of my acne has cleared up. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Easy to swallow pills. Their coating doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly if you&#x27;re slow at taking pills. They don&#x27;t taste all that great but they don&#x27;t taste bad either.</li>
    <li> I have been breaking these up since I don&#x27;t want to take too much. I am trying to build it up in my system and since I have a very  sensitve thyroid, I have to be careful. I love that you can do this with the veggie caps. UPDATE: 5/1/14. Sadly, even a low dose of the Biotin is causing alot heart palpitations. Had to discontinue use and wasn&#x27;t allowed to return product.</li>
    <li> I expected more dramatic results from this. I took two daily. Morning and evening. I saw growth over the 2 months but I expected more. My hair grew about two inches. My nails look great though. No breakouts.</li>
    <li> This pill is amazing. I have been taking this for 1 year now after I cut off my hair to about 3 inches(growing out of my perm) and within 4 months all of my hair grew back (about 8 inches). I am still taking this and my hair is still growing not to mention my nails. It made my sister jealous enough that she bought some for herself. Just great!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I see the results more with my skin and my fingernails. My skin is clear and smooth since I started taking this a few months ago. People at work have taken notice and complimented me on the difference between now and when I first started my career. My fingernails have grown so much that they look like salon nails, and they are much stronger. Before I started taking Biotin everyday (1 per day), my nails were so thin and brittle that they would break from the slightest impact. They are so long and strong now that I can go to a nail salon and have nail art &amp; designs put on them. My hair has grown also, but not as fast as the nails. My skin was the first thing that I noticed, and the results were immediate. My nails took a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you start taking this, please don&#x27;t lose hope if you don&#x27;t see immediate results - it does take the skin and hair some time - it may depend on your body. A co-worker&#x27;s husband slammed his finger in his car door and it took most of his nail off. She bought him Biotin, and within a few weeks there was a change, and now it has been about 3 months and you cannot tell anything was ever wrong with his nail.</li>
    <li> Great product! Nice quality, reasonable pricing and fast shipping :D</li>
    <li> noticed change in my skin straight away.skin is smoother and glowing...well, I think anyway :-).....glad I didn&#x27;t have the pimple reaction that others have unfortunately experienced.</li>
    <li> I have only gone to the Dermatologist twice and each time he told me something that changed my life. Biotin came up on my second visit. You see, my fingernails had always split and peeled and been stubs with no white. I didn&#x27;t bite my nails. They were just so unhealthy they never grew right. The dermatologist told me to take biotin. I did. And ever since then, for the last 30 years, I have never seen splitting or peeling and my fingernails are harder -- they don&#x27;t bend anymore -- and I actually have to file them down. Amazing!! Now I always have whites on the ends of my fingernails. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation of a friend. She said it helped her lose less hAir and it strengthened her nails. I didn&#x27;t need it for nails, but I felt like I was losing too much hair. I hAve to say that since using this, I&#x27;m noticing less fall out. My hair is stronger and I even think it&#x27;s growing faster. This supplement is gentle on stomache and doesn&#x27;t give burps.</li>
    <li> Since I have started using this my skin looks amazing, I have acne prone skin and it does help.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s given me extensive cystic acne on my face, chest, and back. My hair and eyelashes look longer and feel stronger, but it is so no worth the red, angry, embarrassing pimples.</li>
    <li> More capsules,  These do not agree with my tummy.. I will be looking further for softgels with same strenght in future..</li>
    <li> I am in the process of trying to grow out a chin length bob, after donating over 11inches of hair too the locks of love. I have done lots of research on natural ways too do this and after reading a lot of things about biotin I decided to add this with my hair,skin,and nail vitamin regimen. I truly believe that this vitamin is whats causing my hair and nails too grow, not the hair,skin,and nail vitamin. I have been taking this for exactly three weeks now and I have already grown 1inch of hair! Thats really good for me considering i may grow 1/2inch a month,if that! Overall these vitamins are wonderful, i plan on purchasing another bottle when i run out!</li>
    <li> I love all of NOW products, and their Biotin tablets have been the most effective biotin tablet that I have taken for my hair, and skin.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair and nails have improved. I get this through amazons subscribe and save feature which I love.</li>
    <li> already noticed my finger nails are stronger just using it a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I used this products for maybe 2-3 bottles worth and never really noticed any difference in my nails/hair. It could be because I already have thick hair and nails, but I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m sure it would work better for someone with thin hair and nails, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my hair thicken. After total loss to chemo, I didn&#x27;t feel the hair was coming back as well as I hoped. After a couple months on this Biotin I was seeing a difference. I continue to take it for well being four years later.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I instantly saw an increased length in my eyelashes, and my hair grew much quicker in the months that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotin from this company for a while now and I am very pleased with the results. I am using this for thinning hair and it has stopped my hair loss.  You just have to keep taking it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  My hair had gotten so thin due to taking a statin for cholesterol.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and some of my hair is growing back and I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m going bald anymore.  Not a good thing to happen to women.  Thanks to NOW foods and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Still need time....would like to use for at least two months</li>
    <li> This is fine but I prefer the gel caps</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good!i like it.I will use it in my life.Good!It&#x27;s very good.I like it . Good, good,good , good ,good.</li>
    <li> have used this brand at this dosage for decades.  Great product.  Great value.</li>
    <li> This really works. Your hair will grow a lot..everywhere. I mean everywhere. Be prepared to shave a whole lot more often. Make sure you drink double or triple the amount of water you normally do! You need to drink water to break down the biotin and also to keep your skin clear on this. If you drink a lot of water, your skin will be ok, but if you don&#x27;t, even those with good skin may seem some spots. But this amount of water shouldn&#x27;t discourage! My nails grow incredibly fast and i can finally get shellac on them and they look so good! I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Who ever really knows the efficacy of supplements?  Do they really contain the dosage and purity they say?  Is the preparation done to not harm the phytochemicals necessary for it&#x27;s absorption and viability?    I take the product preventively but have not had any noticeable improvements from ANY biotin brand.  That being said the cost per dosage on this brand is uncomparable.</li>
    <li> Biotin did great things for my hair, I used it for two weeks, and almost immediately I could see the difference in my hair. It looks healthier and thicker.  After two weeks of taking one capsule daily, I started having really bad acne.  My skin was really clear before I started using this product, so I am discontinuing my use of it.  It&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t end up with huge pimples all over your face.</li>
    <li> been using it for a month. need more time to rate it.   otherwise, no bad taste, no upset stomache, no allergic   reactions.</li>
    <li> I think my hair is getting thicker and growing longer - definitely can tell with my bangs. Its working and I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times now I think it&#x27;s been helping with my nails and hair, amongst a whole other slew of products I use and deploy with my beautify routine.</li>
    <li> GREAT BARGAIN. LOVE THE SPECIALS</li>
    <li> This product broke my skin out so bad after only a few days of taking it.  I threw the remainder of the bottle away.</li>
    <li> works great for hair loss combined with black currant. everyone has noticed my new hair growth and fullness.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and with the results !!!</li>
    <li> Not noticing any change, in fact, all my nails broke off after I started taking it.</li>
    <li> My hair was not growing and was falling too. A friend recommended me.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist for my very dry cuticles and peeling skin under my nails and he suggested I use Biotin. This is actually a higher dose than he prescribed but it still did not make any difference in my nails. They&#x27;re still weak and dry but at least I didn&#x27;t get cystic acne which I&#x27;ve heard is a side effect.</li>
    <li> I take it for my hair and nail health. It looks like it&#x27;s working and hopefully will work for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered this supplement two times. It&#x27;s by far my favorite out of all the Biotins - and I have tried a whole bunch of them! I notice a lot less hair loss in the shower, even after re-starting after just two days (Ran out - was waiting for more to come!). My hairdresser told me my hair was growing in much faster with a lot less dead ends. For the price - you can&#x27;t go wrong! Best on the market in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste</li>
    <li> Good supplement for hair, and at a very good price. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> NOW brand is my preferred brand for supplements</li>
    <li> Started taking these after taking some beard grower vitamins but I noticed the main ingredient was biotin.  Is making more facial hair grow which is what I wanted and the hair on my head is getting thicker and even regrowing in spots.  Nails are hard as rocks.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because a Dermatologist recommended it for thinning hair. Working well. Took a month or so to see the results. I was loosing hair and was told my hair needed more protein.</li>
    <li> I love NOW foods period! So to be able to find biotin in this brand makes me extremely happy! Enjoying the product!</li>
    <li> I have been taking these supplements for a little over 3 months now and I can already see a big difference. I&#x27;m a young guy but my hair has been thinning out recently (thanks grandpa) and my nails which have never been great due to my own bad habits have started to look a bit thin and feel brittle. Just one month in I noticed a difference and now three months in, the difference is even more pronounced.    While I cannot be certain about the effects of biotin on my hair (I am using Nioxin and Rogaine for that as well) I can clearly tell that my nails looks and feel thicker. They also seem shinier and look more healthy. Additionally, my cuticles now seem less dry then they did before.     Overall, this is a great product and you cannot beat the price that you find here on Amazon. Results were quick and overall I am feeling better about my appearance. Having good nails is a must for self confidence. I had such bad nails growing up but these supplements really seem to be helping. Great product!</li>
    <li> It breaks me out like crazy! THis has made my hair and nails longer and stronger, but I stopped taking it regularly because my skin is suffering. I&#x27;ve gotten pimples on my face, back and shoulders. Not good. I drink a lot of water with this and STILL experience breakouts. Does anyone know how to avoid breakouts when taking this product?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair than any other BIOTIN which is why I will not be repurchasing.  (I&#x27;ll stick to Spring Valley brand)</li>
    <li> I have been using this to help regrow some hair thinning that another supplement caused. It has worked very well in that regard.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Ive been using it a little over 2 weeks and my finger and toe nails have grown and are very strong. I had to file them down a bit because they were growing so fast. I also noticed a slight difference in my hair. My hair line is starting to become full. I noticed little curly baby hairs that weren&#x27;t as defined before. I definately recommend this product, especially for nails.</li>
    <li> A 1000mcg dose seems to work exactly the same as the 5000mcg dose, based on many months of experience taking biotin daily. There&#x27;s no difference so there&#x27;s not much point in megadosing. My nails are much harder, stronger, and grow faster, but while my hair grows much faster too (not twice as fast, but probably close to it!), it has not gotten any thicker, which is what I was hoping for. Bummer! I just started taking a multivitamin with 400mcg biotin so when I run out of biotin-only pills, I won&#x27;t bother with restocking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experienced less shedding of my hair and the new growth is thicker and my hair has more elasticity. will continue to see if i can get more growth.</li>
    <li> about 2 months of taking this, i started to break out with acne. i have alway had flawless skin even as a teen. I did not change anything about my diet except adding biotin daily. My hair grew some but in exchange for the unbearable acne, no thank you. Now, 2 months later I am still still struggling with acne. I have spent hundreds on buying acne mendications and my skin is scarred now too. I can&#x27;t leave the house without makeup an dbefore I never wore makeup. Just stick with a balanced diet and dont put this in your body.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with thin hair and this product seems to help.  My hair seems to be growing again slowly but that is okay.  I am definitely satisfied with the results.  I have used this product in the past and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This brand was not as effective for me as Spring Valley. Perhaps because they were softgels and this was not.  The service was good and I received the product quickly</li>
    <li> Great for hair and nails!!!</li>
    <li> repeat purchase. good price</li>
    <li> i use this for my hair .after 3 months my hair looks great .my advice is take it at night .it may make you sleepy for that first three months after that it does not matter</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male (mid 30&#x27;s) and I&#x27;ve been taking this pills for 1.5 months and my hair is growing like it never did before... long, strong and fast.  Before buying, I read that some people were having acne problems... well, Im not exeption to the rule.  I got quite some pimples every week, so be prepared to deal with that.  Apart from the pimples, very good product.</li>
    <li> BEEN TAKING THIS FOR YEARS!!!  GREAT HAIR!!!  GREAT FINGERNAILS!!!  IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old. Have had a pimple here and there but I&#x27;ve been mostly clear. I started on 1000mcg Biotin once a day for my hair and nails about a month ago.. in about 2 weeks, my face was really oily! I literally had to wash my face like 3 times a day. New zits showed up too so I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago and my face has been less oily, but I have a really deep pimple on my cheek, and just noticed this morning a really deep bump on my face by my ear! Maybe I&#x27;m just being paranoid, but I&#x27;ve never had it this bad in  my life..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this one star because I noticed the CA Prop 65 warning and wondered why, so I called Now Foods (I&#x27;ve noticed it on other products of theirs too). I was unimpressed with the answer which was basically retailers just put this warning on products across the board to cover their butts in case it ships to California.  He said it&#x27;s done to other companies too. Weird because I haven&#x27;t noticed it on other companies. He then said I should call Amazon and ask them why they&#x27;re putting the warning on there. I said, No, I think you should be calling Amazon because it&#x27;s your product. I&#x27;d think you would want to clear it up so there isn&#x27;t a warning there because it&#x27;s misleading and causes me to not purchase your product. He wasn&#x27;t interested.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while and my hair grew the longest its ever been. I stopped using it a long time ago, don&#x27;t know why, but afterwards my hair continued to grow even w/o taking it. My hair has been cut so many times, now I&#x27;m trying to grow it back so I&#x27;m going back to what I know and that is NOW Biotin!</li>
    <li> shipping was on time and the product its too soon to know. I have took about have the bottle still my hair still fall out and it might be to early to see see result but i will buy at least two bottle to see.:/</li>
    <li> very good product thank you very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three postpartum baldnesses. After each kid, my hair has fallen out about 4 months after the birth and I&#x27;d gotten HUGE bald spots by my temples. It doesn&#x27;t stop the hair from falling out- but I believe that it does stimulate new growth- at least it appears that way for me. I think it&#x27;s important to continue using vitamins- especially for nursing moms- for as long as it takes for your body to rebound and then beyond. I like it, it&#x27;s working for me :-D</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and would order again, shipping was fast. &lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Did not work for me and switched to Natrol instead which does work well for me.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 2 weeks and only took one a day until I started noticing more acne. Stopped using product right away and my skin cleared up. I understand people react differently to Biotin so I will try another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. didn&#x27;t use it long enough to really notice a change in my hair.</li>
    <li> Been using product for a month. Started noticing results after two weeks, when I noticed after I shampooed and then applied conditioner and combed through, not as much hair as before was found in the comb. Now I see that hair&#x27;s fuller, nails are not peeling as much and skin is looking better. Change is subtle but visible, looking forward to more dramatic results with continued use. I am a very satisfied customer and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I literally saw results in two weeks! My hair and eyelashes along with my nails grew so much faster than usual! I read reviews and was skeptical but it did work. However I did notice a bit of acne after taking it but other than that I had no aversive reactions.</li>
    <li> Update:  I wasn&#x27;t aware that magnesium stearate was a toxic chemical, so I would not recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this and I didn&#x27;t buy another bottle until my hair started falling out again.  It&#x27;s great to have a back up bottle of this.  My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, when I take this.  This is a great product if you are losing your hair.  It might take a couple of weeks to a month to work, but it definitely works!</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been taking this product for 3 weeks, and so far I am impressed!  I usually have tons of hair falling out, since i&#x27;ve been taking this product, my hair is feeling thicker, and my hair falls out about 95 percent less than it used to.  So far i&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
    <li> I have use the whole bottle as described, but did not notice a slightest change.  I am not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> nails are longer than ever!!! it;s a must... my skin is always terrible because I have acne but i have noticed a major improvement in hair and nails! Gals if you want to up the beautification than get these... they are better quality than any other biotin supplements I&#x27;ve tried... and I promise I dont work for the company... I &#x27;m a regular consumer like you and I want to share a truthful review because I&#x27;m tired of getting conned by all these bogus 5 star reviews that I get suckered into</li>
    <li> yep biotin makes your hair and nails grow! these are powder filled caplets about the size of tylenol caplets... for those of you wondering about size of the pill.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing AMAZINGLY. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I have taken biotin for years at half the strength of this product and gotten longer (though not stronger) nails and plenty of extra hair as a result. I took NOW biotin for several weeks and noticed absolutely no growth. In fact, I lost what I had gained previously on my fingernails. I agree with other reviewers that this product does NOTHING AT ALL and I am returning it. I can&#x27;t believe there is much if any biotin in this product. If there were, they certainly should not be recommending that people take this high dosage TWICE a day for good results, as they suggest on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Just exactly as described. I am very pleased with this purchase. I like Now Foods products. This has many benefits and is very easy to take.</li>
    <li> I continue replenishing my line of supplements with NOW Biotin, for it maintains my hair, nails, and skin in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while and I don&#x27;t know if it is helping or not.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything.  I get better results when eating a better diet and no supplements.</li>
    <li> I love the NOW products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Hi quality Biotin in a high dosage so we don&#x27;t have to take a lot of pills.</li>
    <li> I had just about given up on my chipped, cracked, constantly breaking nails when I came across this product.  Now my nails are strong, long and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Increases my shampoo bill though! I absolutely love what this stuff has done for my hair. I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> Good supplement for my hair and skin - have been taking this for nearly a year, and have experienced much healthier and stronger hair, nails, and clearer skin tone.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the quantity.  I feel it has helped me dealing with Candida, as it is supposed to inhibit it&#x27;s ability to change into its invasive fungal state.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the fringe benefit of stronger nails and hair too :)</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills for a few months now and my nails are definitely stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue taking Biotin.</li>
    <li> I am currently growing out my pixie hair cut and have been taking this for a few months to help the process. It&#x27;s definitely helping! And my nails are super strong and growing like crazy (which they never did before).</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Really to purchase another bottle. Probably wise to order two bottles at once.</li>
    <li> great price for buying! I really love the price and good quality from this product. hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> Great product! Have always had good luck with NOW brand supplements and this one did not disappoint. Highly recommend this biotin.</li>
    <li> Biotin has made a big difference in my fingernails and has greatly helped control my hair thinning.  I am 73 years young and thinning hair and cracking nails.  Biotin is easy to take, does not create heartburn, and does not have any reaction with my other meds.</li>
    <li> Was told to order these. After using 1-2 capsules for 3 months, even my hairdresser noticed the significant positive difference, stating, &amp;#34;Your hair feels and looks great!&amp;#34; great product.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones that I was buying at a local vitamin store at double the price and they work just has well.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see my hair growing much faster after using this. I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome!</li>
    <li> Is your hair thin or thinning? Your nails not much better?  Taking this myself &amp; recommending it to clients, we see results in no time!</li>
    <li> Not the strongest biotin problem but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I take two capsules a day, one in the morning and one at night and I feel good, more alert, more stamina and I haven&#x27;t gotten any colds this season.  It&#x27;s a good product and good price.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be doing what it is supposed to be doing. It ls a little to early to know for sure.</li>
    <li> I have now been a member of the Amazon Subscription Service for over six months. My Biotin is sent promptly every 60 days, and I no longer worry about shopping or running out. The NOW Biotin is an excellent supplement that I have used for over two years due to cracking finger nails. I am very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> My hair and nails are growing very well thank you.  Easy to swallow and has no taste ehats so ever.</li>
    <li> Taking Biotin to help my hair grow. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair grows twice as fast while taking these as it normally would. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using a biotin supplement long enough to know if I will see significant improvement in hair re-growth. It appears to have enabled some re-growth on the top of my head.  I have short, rather than non-existent fingernails for the first time in a couple of years, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The capsules are easy to swallow and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> My hair seemed to not falling off so much.  I will have to use it more time.</li>
    <li> I have not used this for myself, but I know a couple of people who take it and they seem to be happy with it. It&#x27;s good for hair, skin, and nails I think. Both people I know are taking it mainly for their hair, for balding.</li>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;m taking biotin is for candida though but I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s preventing the candida from growing into its more aggressive form. I hope it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m also waiting for this to start affecting my eczema but it hasn&#x27;t changed my eczema too much. I&#x27;ve only been taking this a week though so we&#x27;ll see what happens. My nails however have been growing fast and hard but this is not what I bought the product for.</li>
    <li> I love this biotin!!  It has done wonders for my hair!!!  I don&#x27;t shed and my hair grows faster than ever!!!</li>
    <li> It helped my nails a lot, my nails are very strong now.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think it helps my hair or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel little bit stomach pain whilst i was using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I really like &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; in general.  Biotin has helped my hair and nails to grow and to be stronger in general!</li>
    <li> Huge bottle--lasted me a while. I religiously take Biotin daily and have been for over 2 years now. My hair has grown both in length and thickness. My nails are longer and stronger, and my skin has been better than ever. This is an easy daily supplement to take in the morning with breakfast, no taste or smell. You&#x27;re not going to see miracles right away--it takes a good few months for this to start working but if you stick with it and keep on taking it you will definitely see results. The price from this seller was also a lot cheaper than buying it in a store such as GNC. I will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to see any difference.  So far my hair seems a bit better but that could be different choice of shampoo also..  Ask me again in 3 months/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shopped around for Biotin and this seems to be the best deal I can find. Whereas target and walmart only sell 60 capsules in 1,000 mcg which you&#x27;d have to take five to equal the amount your getting in one of these capsules, it&#x27;s a complete steal!</li>
    <li> This makes my leg hairs grow long. I am on my way to braiding them a dream come true.</li>
    <li> Now Foods ought to stop selling GMO modified junk from China and not disclosing their source.  We should reject any vitamin or food product that does not clearly identify where they are getting their raw materials.  Come on these are vitamins and supplements we take for health therefore they are going into our bodies.  This caused severe rash, itching and skin problems even the dermatologist could not diagnose the cause.  It is the nutritionist who found this as the culprit and after months of discomfort and itching all over the body, removing this item turned things around within weeks.  As they say, BE CAREFUL OUT THERE  IN THIS megabillion supplement and vitamin industry there is more trash in the products of some manufacturers than any health giving item. We&#x27;ve moved from BigPharma to BigSupplaVi, and many of the pharmaceutical companies own the supplement companies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this for a short time but I have noticed a difference in my hair. No difference in the strength of my nails yet but that will take time. I like to purchase NOW products whenever possible because they are wheat and soy free. Love that Amazon offers this as an add-on product.</li>
    <li> noticed the change in both hair color and thickness after 2 months also notice my skin to be smoother. side not is i did notice my back hair also got darker and thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> After I gave birth to my son, I lost so much hair, It was horrifying, I had friends commenting to me on my hair loss. I was so embarrassed. I have been taking biotin supplements every day since about 2 months postpartum, and within about 6 months I had all my hair back, plus MORE!! -- The only reason I take off 1 star is because if I don&#x27;t take this with food in my stomach, it makes me feel sick. Other than that, I have zero complaints!!</li>
    <li> I love &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; vitamins. And I have found and was told by doctor, that taking Biotin twice a day is helping my hair grow. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this now Biotin product specifically for rapid and healthy hair regrowth. It works awesome - and that goes with saying I have tried several other Biotin products from different companies and they do not work the same as now. It is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added benefits I found by taking this: more energy (noticeable), my lashes are longer and fuller, and my fingernails are growing quicker but with more health and sturdiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it on a regular basis, and have for almost a year now. I will take this supplement for ever and ever. Healthiest head of hair I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> Maybe the dose is to high for me but it gave me such pain that I thought I was having a gall bladder attack :-(</li>
    <li> So I ignored all the acne comments thinking that I just need my body to adjust. Well after 2 months of taking 1 pill daily my nails are gorgeous and my hair is growing and strong, however I have the worst acne of my life... worse than when I was a teenager. Huge welts all over my cheeks that only seem to dissapear for a few days and return quickly. Unfortunately nice nails are not worth the price of an acne face.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 3 months now. It makes my hair grow about 3 times faster than it normally does.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Biotin 5000mcg vcaps. The mailing was prompt and the quality of the Biotin is genuine! (I had a lab geek friend of mine evaluate the potency and quality) This product delivers! My skin or complexion has improved; my nails have grown stronger with little brittleness as I had before; lastly, I have notice improvement of the condition of my hair... I would highly recomend this product and will be reordering as needded! I take two vcaps a day and this seems to be the best dosage for my noticable improvements... a must buy and try for sure! Give the product a couple of weeks and you should see a difference in your hair, nails and complexion!</li>
    <li> I take 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the evening and I have noticed that my hair looks healthier and shinier and I lose less hair on a day-to-day basis.  Also, my nails are growing more quickly than without the pills.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the Biotin 5000 mcg for a little over a month now and am beginning to see amazing results. I have always had extremely brittle nails and I started to take this in combination with high doses of Vitamin D and Calcium and my nails have greatly improved. This stuff definitely works but it takes several weeks before you start seeing results.</li>
    <li> Have been taking these for three years and my hair is now fuller and longer. There was a time where my hair did not grow past my shoulders, but thanks to these pills. I can now say with confidence that my hair is close to my bra strap.  Only problem now is that because I have fuller hair, people think I have a wig! The nerve right? :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for an extended period of time and without this, and just using my regular multivitamins didn&#x27;t notice a difference in hair or nail growth but with this product have definitely grown stronger nails and hair.</li>
    <li> A boost of energy along with great hair and nails.</li>
    <li> I started taking this for a receding hairline about 2 months ago.  Hard to tell if it has helped due to other changes in my regimen.  At first I had a heck of a time swallowing these pills.  Then I realized I had to tilt my head forward to get them to the back of my throat since the pills float!  I haven&#x27;t tried taking them without water.</li>
    <li> This has really helped with my hair growth, I have been using it for a little over a month see improvement!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My fingernails are in much better shape since I have started taking biotin.  Not breaking and peeling as they used to do.</li>
    <li> I have been using biotin less than a week and my eyelashes have gotten thicker and longer.  They use to be curled and thinner but now the curl has stretch. .also my skin is clearer and smoother looking.  Will Give Another Review latlater. 1/07/2015</li>
    <li> Biotin made my skin less blotchy and softer! My hair is softer. My fingernails are stronger. It took 6 months, so stick with it! It&#x27;s a lot more inexpensive than some others and I like the Now brand!</li>
    <li> purchased this to help with hair growth. It certainly works !!</li>
    <li> What can you really write about a bottle of Biotin pills? They&#x27;re by no means a miracle pill but it seems they do what they claim to do.</li>
    <li> Used it about  for 8 months. According to the reviews it helped a lot of people, but really don&#x27;t want to disapoint you guys, it didn&#x27;t help me at all. I have fine and thin hair. What I noticed castor oil helped me a little, used it as hair masks, at least I stopped losing hair. Now will try Hair Revive 5, have a hope for it.</li>
    <li> you already know that your hair, skin and nails need biotin that&#x27;s why your are hear in the first place, I&#x27;m a 27 yrs old male, my hair is about 1 inch, it works for me i used to be on a 2 caps per day dose for about 6 months, now I&#x27;ve reduced it to only 1, I don&#x27;t notice that much difference between the two doses, however i&#x27;m planning to keep using biotin for good.</li>
    <li> received package in good condition.  am trying to grow hair in a spot I pick at.  I heard Biotin is good for hair and nails, my nails are growing fast and have just started the biotin, will report back in a month. but received package in very timely manner.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Larger size than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> My hair is wonderful, I have gotten biotin pills in the passed, but I was shocked as I started to benefit from the product.  I recommend this product to anyone that is shedding hair.</li>
    <li> My hair have grown a good inch since I got these pills and been taking them. Great for hair growth technique.</li>
    <li> I need maximum strength. Volume too light. No difference in loss or thinning. Hair is still not filled in. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well, i took this to help with my s***y beard growth, and it helped, i went from slowly growing beard hair with the thickness of normal hair to growing much thicket and faster, it has so made the hair on my head incredibly soft and healthy feeling, definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Made me breakout on my face (I drink at least 8 glasses a water a day, didn&#x27;t help).  Can&#x27;t attest to hair growth.  I took for about 3 months and constantly had braids.  Did NOTHING for nails.  Won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> I have previously bought Melatonin from this brand (NOW foods) &amp; they work great for me, so when I ran out of my Biotin that I bought at Sam&#x27;s, I decided to see if NOW foods had Biotin.  I have a terrible gag reflex &amp; therefore highly prefer a capsule or a coated tablet in any medication that I take.  These are on the big side, but I have no trouble with them since they are a tablet.  I get lots of compliments on my \\&quot;shiny pretty hair\\&quot; &amp; I have to give credit to Biotin.  I mainly started using Biotin to help my hair &amp; nails grow faster &amp; it is working like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought the 60 caps (one month supply) to give it a try and now finished it and ordering the 120 caps. It seems to be growing out my hair and it&#x27;s not as dry as it used to be. I used to take ProCaps vitamins for hair, skin, and nails which only has 3,200 mcg of biotin and while it did grow out my hair, it also ALWAYS made me break out! Since I switched to this one, I haven&#x27;t had any acne/skin problems. The other one also made me burp (yuck) and this one doesn&#x27;t. My nails are definitely harder. I think side effects depend on every person&#x27;s body, so I definitely think this one is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Biotin really works! My hair was shedding, very weak, breaking, horribly. I take two caplets daily. Most people only need one. I have to take a medication that makes my body very acidic. It increases my needs for B vitamins. This is the reason that I double my dose of biotin. I will continue to use this. It keeps my hair from falling out as it has done in the past and keeps it growing strong. It improves my skin and nails. I recommend this product to absolutely anyone. I have used many Now brand supplements and they are very high quality.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this Biotin some years ago before my hair had all but totally vacated the top of my head. I had read that it would help make your hair stronger and healthier. It did a good job. The problem is that when you get to the point that you have maybe 10 hairs per square inch on the top of your head, no amount of thickness and healthy glow is going to keep you from looking like a cactus. So, I started shaving my head, with plans to evolve into a Vin Diesel-with-no-muscles sort of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, Biotin and I parted ways, and somewhere in the medicine cabinet, the rest of the last bottle still lurks, a silent monument to all the times my Grandma told me that if I didn&#x27;t quit dyeing or bleaching my hair, it was going to fall out. Sadly, Grandma is no longer with us, but she did live long enough to see me lose my hair, and rub it in my face several times. Joke&#x27;s on her though, because I used her vintage hand mirror to scoop a clog out of the toilet when I was a kid, and never told a soul until just now. RIP Grandma &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I took these twice daily for 3 months. I got no results what so ever. I switched brands first to purvana and got shiner, thicker hair. After 4 months, quality  control issues with purvana caused me to switch to a vitamin shoppe brand. So far so good. Will update in 3 months.</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes my hair look healthier than it ever has before. I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails don&#x27;t break as easily as they used too.</li>
    <li> I began taking Biotin prior to weight loss surgery.  Within a couple of months my hair started looking rather bad and I was concerned.  One day, about a year after my surgery, I gave up on trying to fix my hair and just let it dry on its own.  I was so surprised to discover that I now have curly hair!  Except for a couple of cowlicks, my hair has always been stick straight and now it has a delightful and bouncy array of curls.  Was it the Biotin that caused the hair to curl?  I can&#x27;t say for certain but I&#x27;m not going to stop taking it to find out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, I definitely notice my hair feeling stronger. I don&#x27;t take this everyday but it does work. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that from using this my hair has began growing an extra 1/2 inch each month. I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects upon using this. Also, my millia has began healing much faster.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my nails growing, and my hair being thin. since taking this product the last few weeks I have seen a drastic improvement in the thickness of my hair as well as my nails growing, and growing in thicker which is exactly wheat I wanted. I highly, highly recommend this product to anyone in need.</li>
    <li> Biotin works for me to reduce some strange toenail stuff that looked like fungus but is not, and seems to make my nails grow faster.  I&#x27;m not a doctor so I can&#x27;t attest to what it will do for you.  I&#x27;m not a doctor so I can&#x27;t say whether it will work for you, but I can say that what&#x27;s in the bottle seems to match the label and has no side effects that I can discern.</li>
    <li> These pills are pretty big. I never had a problem swallowing pills when I purchased them so it wasn&#x27;t a problem.  But in recent years I&#x27;ve come to dread pills, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle these again.  I was pretty inconsistent with taking them as well, but I do believe they had a little bit of an impact on my hairs growth! :-) I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this one based on the reviews from other customers (thank you!) and the fact that it has Vcaps. I am a white, 26 year old female and I have had skin problems since i was four years old. My theory is that i am highly allergic to mosquito/insect bites, which cause a lot of itching, and then i scratch the skin, which then gets infected and ultimately i am left with scars all over my legs. Some are brown, some lighter, some darker, some just really damaged skin without a discoloration. To this day, all the dermatologist i have seen not only have not been able to give me a diagnosis or improve my skin condition, but some of them made it worse. On top of this, i have really dry, dark knees that no amount of scrubbing and moisturizing has been able to solve. To add to all these, i have dry eyes, and migraines. I did some blood tests and I was not deficient in Vitamins, but with my history of medical doctors, i stopped trusting them (and no, you cannot blame me).&lt;br /&gt;Well, two weeks ago i started taking the Biotin. Today, I noticed my eyelashes are fuller and longer. I checked my legs and the dark patches on my knees are lighter, the surface smaller, and not as dry. My scars are lighter (this deserve a celebration as hundreds of dollars spent on lightening creams, coconut oil, Scaraway patches- you named it, i tried it, and still did not work) and my skin is smoother generally. And my nails are stronger and do not break as much. I also do not have to use eye drops as often as I used to, and my headaches have improved a lot. On another good note (which i am not sure if it is related) i am losing a few pounds.&lt;br /&gt;The only con that i had, was that my face broke out (the T zone) while i was PMS-ing, and usually i do not. But it is a small price to pay for a few days only. I do recommend it, highly so, but based on my experience I also know that what works for someone, does not work for someone else. Unfortunately, you will have to try and decide for yourself and this may take some time.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product, especially for the price. I would buy again and recommend to others i</li>
    <li> I have been taking this Now biotin 5000mcg product once a day for exactly a month today and i have seen no improvement in the health of my nails, in fact, they are even shorter now than before i started taking this biotin. No difference in my hair growth and/or health. NOTHING. Very disappointed. The only difference i see is from all the water ive been drinking!All that water intake really helped my little ance areas. After reading reviews about people seeing results within 2 weeks really had me wondering if i was sent a placebo or something. I guess its too late to get my money back??</li>
    <li> New taking this hopefully it helps my hair loss some what. ...helps me somewhat. I know I do feel better by taking it .</li>
    <li> u can find better than that.</li>
    <li> I took one a day for about 2months, it didn&#x27;t make my hair or nails grow faster like biotin is normally used for, the only thing it did do was make my hair a tad more shiny, and the roots of my hair seemed a little thicker. Overall I liked this product, but it&#x27;s only something I&#x27;d buy again if I had some extra cash left from all the actual necessities.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband to help his hair grow. I also decided to try it out to get my hair to grow faster. I used to have acne prone skin, but haven&#x27;t had problems since using oil to cleanse my skin. Despite all of the reviews that mentioned getting acne, I decided to try it. Big mistake! I took one pill the first day and noticed 2 blemishes on my face the next day (I haven&#x27;t had spots like that at all in the last few months since using oil cleansing.). I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a coincidence or not, so I took another pill the next day. Two more blemishes on the other side of my face after that! Definitely not taking this anymore. It seems that it works great for some people, but then it totally breaks out  other peoples faces....and I am one of those people. My husband has not yet experienced this and will continue to take it until otherwise.</li>
    <li> I started taking Biotin as my hair is thinning due to lupus. It is also helping my finger nails get stronger as well. I have only been taking this for less than two months, so I have not noticed a big change in my hair as of yet, but both my doctor and my hair stylist recommended this</li>
    <li> I have been taking Biotin at the 5,000 mcg level daily now for about a month. I have noticed that my skin and scalp are much oilier than before, but that&#x27;s okay as I had dry scalp and combination skin. I have to shampoo my hair more often (daily instead of every other day) b/c it&#x27;s blonde and it really shows oil. I started taking Biotin b/c I have very weak nails that peel and split. My nails are stronger, but nothing miraculous. I think I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle and see if it&#x27;s worth the extra face shininess and shampooing! Also, as others have said, drink lots of water!</li>
    <li> Seems to help with my hair.</li>

    <li> Has strengthened by hair and nails.</li>
    <li> Had this for my hair loss, but the second bottle started giving me acne a lot so stopped :(</li>
    <li> Did they work? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to two years, it really works I have lots of new hair growing.</li>
    <li> Great supplier - great prices - highly recommend checking them first.  As for the product, who knows whether or not it&#x27;s effective since it&#x27;s working on the cellular level so I&#x27;m actually rating the supplier here.</li>
    <li> I gave a review at the beginning of this form on Biotin 5000 Healthy Hair, Skin, etc.  I don&#x27;t remember ever having taken this product so I can&#x27;t give you a summary on it.</li>
    <li> I have taken Biotin for a few years now to help with some hair-loss I was having from some medications I am on. I have used some other brands and recently changed to this brand. I am finding that the quality of this brand is fine and that the price can&#x27;t be beat. I will continue to order it. Also, my nails are amazing while taking this just once a day. I have long nails for the first time every in my life and the loss of my hair has stopped and it is thicker than ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for skin and nails. I am hoping for good results but Biotin takes awhile to show results.  The formulation and price are a good combination.</li>
    <li> I think it keeps my fine and thin hair looking good.</li>
    <li> I take it everyday and it has really helped my nails.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference, maybe will work for others.</li>
    <li> gave me heartburn....I purchased because I couldn&#x27;t find silica and just as I had read from previous users using biotin, I experienced terrible heartburn</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair.  Went to the doctors and he said it was from stress.  I&#x27;ve been taking this faithfully for about 3 months now.  Hair is noticeably fuller and my nails have gone from brittle and peeling to longer and thicker so they don&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Biotin really does work! My hair definitely grows faster, my nails grow faster and stronger... overall, definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re not happy with your nails or hair!</li>
    <li> Well, i took this to help with my s***y beard growth, and it helped, i went from slowly growing beard hair with the thickness of normal hair to growing much thicket and faster, it has so made the hair on my head incredibly soft and healthy feeling</li>
    <li> I use this as an immune booster.  As a cancer survivor twice I wanted to boost my immune system as much as possible.</li>
    <li> Buy it and take them. My hair has grown 5 inches. Amazing! This product is sold elsewhere for more. Not sure if any biotin will work but this one sure does.</li>
    <li> Biotin is great for your hair. I&#x27;ve taken it for 40 years, and I still have pretty hair.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any noticeable difference with this product.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything until I ran out. My nails went back to peeling and snapping off and my skin started looking dry and ashy. Ordered another bottle and have started taking again. Have very fine hair, not sure it is doing anything for my hair but oh well.</li>
    <li> NOW brand has proven to be a quality product and getting here at Amazon is very convenient</li>
    <li> BEWARE OF PIMPLES DONT TAKE EVERYDAY</li>
    <li> Great for hair and nails- and yes I notice a difference!!!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended taking this to help a little with thinning hair.  Thyroid problems run in my family and the first sign that I&#x27;m destined for it too is my thinning hair.  I&#x27;m only 22 and I noticed it starting when I was about 18 when I would see handfuls of hair come out every time I combed my hair after a shower.  I&#x27;ve been taking this since I was 19 and while it doesn&#x27;t produce any results I&#x27;ve noticed as far as regrowing lost hair, I have noticed that it has significantly reduced the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing.  And according to my mom my hair does look thicker...not sure I believe her but neither here nor there.  One pretty awesome side effect is that I think this is responsible for a serious boost to my immune system!  I used to catch every little sniffle that came around and was sick at least 2 or 3 times a year. I haven&#x27;t been sick (knock on wood) for at least 2 years now and I sincerely think that this wonderful little pill is responsible.  Overall if you have patience and keep it up with this I truly believe it has some great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brand goes, I think biotin is biotin....it&#x27;s a reasonable price and it&#x27;s the brand I&#x27;ve used for well over 3 years now.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter. She was losing some of his hair. After 3 weeks she started to see the baby hair growing in the front and the back of her head. Very good product.</li>
    <li> The size and easy capsules make it easy to swallow. I will likely buy this product again in the future.</li>
</ol>
