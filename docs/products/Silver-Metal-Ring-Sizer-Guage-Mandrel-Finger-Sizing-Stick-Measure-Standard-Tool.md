      <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>scratched very easily.</li>
      <li>I think instead, it is a Ring Sizer Gauge! :-)</li>
      <li>Am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>This stainless steel ring mandrel has a great feel and weight.  </li>
      <li>But, I have found it challenging to use and interpret.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to be able to measure my rings and I can.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and clear markings make it ideal for a traveling kit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Based on the rings that did fit me, this tool has come in handy in establishing just what size I need for the fingers those rings fit.  </li>
      <li>I love this item offered at a very reasonable price!!</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and it works great.</li>
      <li>Good as new.</li>
      <li>Specifically, the flats milled onto two sides allow for accurate sizing without interference from settings.  </li>
      <li>Who would know if it is accurate?</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just too light.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice weight with clear numbers for reading.</li>
      <li>I love this stainless steel ring mandrel.  </li>
      <li>Thank You for such a good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many rings either gifted to me or left to me by relatives, some of which actually fit me, but I never knew the sizes.  </li>
      <li>Thanks you so much I love it so much</li>
      <li>I give it a 5 star rating because it was worth the price, and the wait to receive it.</li>
      <li>I expected this mandrel to be very light in weight and cheaply made.</li>
      <li>nice solid piece, handy tool and love that it is metal, not plastic and that it has grooves for each size as lettering would wear off in time but with grooves this will last a very long time!  </li>
      <li>then I thought it would be, it will last a good long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent considering I bought it on a whim.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy enough if I need to do a light hammering.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seller shipped it out really fast.  </li>
      <li>The mandrel is okay for measuring rings, but I was after a stainless steel one because I wanted a harder material to use as a reshaping tool.  </li>
      <li>I think this mandrel is a high quality tool.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also comes in handy with softer metals, which can be stretched when heated and pushed down further than their original size.</li>
      <li>it works great not sure what else to say about it other than it serves its purpose</li>
      <li>One of mine was loose at the end, but it was just a matter of applying a dab of super glue to it.</li>
      <li>I have a hard plastic ring mandrel and it works OK</li>
      <li>Numbers are clearly visible.</li>
      <li>the mandrel was aluminum and too soft.</li>
      <li>, I do not know what I am doing trying to make rings, but the rings I made are not round.  </li>
      <li>Seems a bit lighter in weight than I expected stainless steel to be</li>
      <li>Aluminum is too soft for long term use in this application.</li>

    <li> Jewelry makes will like some of the features of this ring bar.  Specifically, the flats milled onto two sides allow for accurate sizing without interference from settings.  It&#x27;s light weight and clear markings make it ideal for a traveling kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT a bar one would use to reshape rings on.  Measurement only, but in that it excels.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I think this mandrel is a high quality tool.  I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Great item to re-check ring sizes. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the craft project I got it for</li>
    <li> Thanks you so much I love it so much I get to make coins rings now thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, love it!!!</li>
    <li> nice solid piece, handy tool and love that it is metal, not plastic and that it has grooves for each size as lettering would wear off in time but with grooves this will last a very long time!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> it works great not sure what else to say about it other than it serves its purpose</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to try making some wire rings after watching youtube videos.  This mandrel has good markings and seems sturdy, but two of the sides (with the markings) are flattened .  I confess, I do not know what I am doing trying to make rings, but the rings I made are not round.  I had trouble wrapping the wire around without the flat sides making flat sides in my rings.  Maybe this is the way they all are, maybe not.  It didn&#x27;t work for me and I gave up and moved onto another project.</li>
    <li> scratched very easily.</li>
    <li> I love this stainless steel ring mandrel.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.  I have a hard plastic ring mandrel and it works OK but it&#x27;s just too light.  This stainless steel ring mandrel has a great feel and weight.  Sturdy enough if I need to do a light hammering.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped it out really fast.  I received it just as described.</li>
    <li> Item is as described. Seems a bit lighter in weight than I expected stainless steel to be but it serves its function. Numbers are clearly visible. Am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is very heavy, and sturdy, and the cutouts make measuring rings with large or wide settings a snap. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I expected this mandrel to be very light in weight and cheaply made. That was not the case. It is a nice weight with clear numbers for reading. The numbers for measuring your rings are etched onto an aluminum strip which is glued to the mandrel. One of mine was loose at the end, but it was just a matter of applying a dab of super glue to it. Good as new. For the price, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty decent considering I bought it on a whim.  Good weight to it, it works for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool so I could size rings I am trying to sell.  I&#x27;m not sure how one of these should work, so my comments are of limited value.  But, I have found it challenging to use and interpret.  It gets me close enough, I guess.  I&#x27;m not sure I would make the same choice again</li>
    <li> the mandrel was aluminum and too soft.</li>
    <li> The mandrel is okay for measuring rings, but I was after a stainless steel one because I wanted a harder material to use as a reshaping tool.  Aluminum is too soft for long term use in this application.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be able to measure my rings and I can. Good quality, good price.</li>
    <li> I love this item offered at a very reasonable price!! I checked on other ring sizers and they were plastic and the one I received was metal...aluminum I think.......Very durable!!!  Great seller!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Yup, it measures the size of rings. Who would know if it is accurate? It seems to be well-made, and not dorky looking. It is listed as a Ring Sizer &amp;#34;Guage&amp;#34; [sic]. I think instead, it is a Ring Sizer Gauge! :-)</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 star rating because it was worth the price, and the wait to receive it. My husband has started making some wood and spoon rings, this has come in very handy for him. I would recommend to others and order again if I had to replace his. Thank You for such a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many rings either gifted to me or left to me by relatives, some of which actually fit me, but I never knew the sizes.  Based on the rings that did fit me, this tool has come in handy in establishing just what size I need for the fingers those rings fit.  It also comes in handy with softer metals, which can be stretched when heated and pushed down further than their original size. If you&#x27;re serious about the rings you wear or might wear, this tool is a must-have.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and it works great. Heavier then I thought it would be, it will last a good long time.</li>
