    <li> I have very, very dry skin and this is the only lotion I have found that helps. I do not find that it leaves any residue after application. Love the smell, very light. Everything gives me headaches and this does not. Fragrance goes away quickly so there is no conflict with perfume. Better value from Amazon than even Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Use every day.  Helps with the dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product; non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Love. Want to order again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Lubriderm, what more should I say?</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever found that effectively helps the eczema on my arms. Very thick creamy formula, not watery at all. It&#x27;s unscented.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin, I break out in rashes from nearly anything. I can&#x27;t even use scented fabric softener. This is the perfect lotion for sensitive skin, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great Lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> We go thru this stuff like water.  We use it in the summer and winter. It is not watery like alot of lotions. It really feel good when you apply it.</li>
    <li> great price quick shipping</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Arrived as expected</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recommend it</li>

It was very hard to find a product that would be hydrating enough without leaving my skin oily or sticky. Usually creams that dry too fast don&#x27;t have much hydrating power and the ones that are good mosturizers don&#x27;t seem to ever dry. This is an exception. It&#x27;s the perfect mosturizer. As other reviewers also said, it offers really good hydration without making your skin sticky or oily. It dries super fast and it has a very subtle scent that goes away fast.

    <li> I love libriderm, especially this kind. Makes my skin feel moist al day.</li>

    <li> Excellent lotion.......it works really well on dry skin, and the price for the 3 pack is excellent.</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion that I use.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion, especially if you have very dry skin. it moisturizes very well and does not leave a sticky or oily residue. It is also not scented, so I don&#x27;t have to go around smelling like a flower or some type of nut.</li>
    <li> Great product, have used it for years, have somewhat dry skin so the blue bottle that Lubriderm sells is wimpy in comparison.</li>
    <li> The absolute best everyday lotion! Scent is plain enough for my boyfriend to use (not girly); not greasy; not sticky!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase as a 2pk with a purse-sized lotion included at our neighborhood BJ&#x27;s warehouse store, but Lubriderm no longer supplies it.  Great price, quick shipping.</li>
