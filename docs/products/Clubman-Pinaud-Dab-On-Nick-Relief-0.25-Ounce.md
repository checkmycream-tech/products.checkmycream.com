      <li>happy customer.</li>
      <li>everything was as advertized and it arrived in good time</li>
      <li>This product hasn&#x27;t done a good job stopping the bleeding from razor nicks.  </li>
      <li>We have used this product for years and are very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Have used this product before and was delighted to get a 3 pk for the price I was able to pay.</li>

      <li>Really is quick, but does sting (supposed to!).  </li>
      <li>He bleeds easily so this is very useful.</li>
      <li>sometimes a girl&#x27;s got to have smooth legs in a hurry</li>
      <li>However, they never were kind enough to send me the cost of my postage for their mistake, which was 3 dollars and change.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this old time favorite anywhere except online.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>The dab-on method is more effective, and for a guy who still uses a safety razor (not a straight razor but still old school), nicks aren&#x27;t merely a mild bit of distraction, they tend to be pretty deep and take longer for the astringent to work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>I was asked to send it back and they did send me the right item after they received my package.</li>
      <li>It is the only product that works extremely well and very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Three pak is great form home and travel use.i keep one in my overnight bag with razor and shave creme, One at home and third at office if late afternon shave is neccessary for late meetings with bosses and other important clients.</li>
      <li>With the dab-on, the nick is quickly contained and without the mess.</li>
      <li>I would have no other when shaving with my razor.</li>
      <li>They were nice to deal with when I explained that they sent me the wrong item.</li>
      <li>We will certainly search for other products on amazon again.</li>
      <li>It stops bleeding after shaving well, doesn&#x27;t leave any dried blood if you do it right, and doesn&#x27;t leave as much white residue as a styptic pencil.  </li>
      <li>I first bought it locally, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it, so I&#x27;ve been ordering in on Amazon.  </li>

    <li> Top notch nick relief. Easy to use, effective.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and was delighted to get a 3 pk for the price I was able to pay. Speedy delivery as well.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for years and are very satisfied with it. It can be used for any small cut.</li>
    <li> My husband has me order this for him because he can&#x27;t find locally. He bleeds easily so this is very useful.</li>
    <li> Husband likes &amp; will also use if I happen to nick myself shaving</li>
    <li> everything was as advertized and it arrived in good time</li>
    <li> This was the only place to find this product. We were thrilled to be able to get it.  We will certainly search for other products on amazon again.</li>
    <li> This stuff gets the job done. Occasionally, you&#x27;ll need to make several applications to stop really bad cuts, but this is much better than bits of tissue stuck all over your neck.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t done a good job stopping the bleeding from razor nicks.  I have been very disappointed and I have 3 of them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 20 to 25 years.  I would have no other when shaving with my razor.</li>
    <li> Best stuff around for cuts.  Can&#x27;t find in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this old time favorite anywhere except online. Three pak is great form home and travel use.i keep one in my overnight bag with razor and shave creme, One at home and third at office if late afternon shave is neccessary for late meetings with bosses and other important clients.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever found for shaving nicks and minor cuts when working.  Really is quick, but does sting (supposed to!).  Took a while for me to find this since even Walgreen&#x27;s did not carry it.  Highly recommend this.  I take Plavix and my blood is a little thinner and slow to coagulate.</li>
    <li> I can hardly shave my legs without nicking myself somewhere, so I usually wax -- but sometimes a girl&#x27;s got to have smooth legs in a hurry and therefore I still end up with a few nicks.  This stuff works like a champ to stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> I have used the dab-on relief from Clubman for many years.  It is the only product that works extremely well and very quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried the dry stiptic pencils and other products -- nothing compares to this liquid product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clubman liquid styptic for years.  I first bought it locally, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it, so I&#x27;ve been ordering in on Amazon.  It stops bleeding after shaving well, doesn&#x27;t leave any dried blood if you do it right, and doesn&#x27;t leave as much white residue as a styptic pencil.  One tube lasts a long time.  The sponge on the tip sometimes wears off, but you can still dispense it onto your finger and use it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stops shaving nicks almost instantaneously. Definitely a must in your shaving kit.</li>
    <li> great product.  the family uses and i even have one for the pets. will order again and again.  happy customer.</li>
    <li> Best product for nicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to using a styptic pencil. The dab-on method is more effective, and for a guy who still uses a safety razor (not a straight razor but still old school), nicks aren&#x27;t merely a mild bit of distraction, they tend to be pretty deep and take longer for the astringent to work. With a styptic pencil, this could mean applying and reapplying repeatedly until finally the nick is stanched. With the dab-on, the nick is quickly contained and without the mess.</li>
    <li> Not super impressed.  But cheaper than having door etc. painted at body shop.  Noticeable, when you look close, but not from a distance.</li>
