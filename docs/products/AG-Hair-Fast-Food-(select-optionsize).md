### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Put a dime sized amount in the palm of you your hand, apply all over head and hair, and blot or wrap up hair in a towel for a minute for best results.</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price.</li>
      <li>Great buy.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, is not greasy, and its just conditioner</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great.  </li>
      <li>This is the best leave in for very fine haor that I have found.</li>
      <li>This is good for calming frizzies, keeping curls hydrated &amp; reapplication doesn&#x27;t create that caked-on look.  </li>
      <li>If the experts recommends it then it has to be good</li>
      <li>Its a good conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my stylist and I have really enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>Great product - really works well</li>
      <li>i love ths stuff</li>
      <li>But in my opinion, not any better than others.  </li>
      <li>Just what was expected, arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>In fact my hair is soft and shiny and looks great.</li>
      <li>It smells like cotton candy to me, which I kind of think is fun and don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>Not for fine or oily hair, I might think.</li>
      <li>but it smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I love other AG products, but this one I just didn&#x27;t see any great changes in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I use this leave in conditioner when I do not wish to blow dry my hair and it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Just work a good bit of it through after washing (I use 1.5 - 2 T and my hair is long), then scrunch as it dries.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing how little you need and it will make your hair look jacked if you use more than you need.</li>
      <li>(On between-washing days, if it&#x27;s limp, I put in some re:coil, which is also a great product.)</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I use it first after washing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using fast food as a grooming product--I put two or three dollops in before drying and more after drying, and that actually does the trick: no frizziness!</li>
      <li>so I ordered a small one and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to upside down packaging for easy access, especially when the contents start to get low, but otherwise, it is great for your hair.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need too much of this conditioner at all.</li>
      <li>California Curl Up Curling Balm for more curl enhancement while my hair is wet.  </li>
      <li>AG Fast Food gives my hair a lot of moisture without leaving any residue or firmness.  </li>
      <li>This product really helps with detangling and restoring my hair to a healthier texture.</li>
      <li>and I have been using Fast Food for about 10 years.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though.</li>
      <li>matter how much of it I put in my hair</li>
      <li>And apparently people love how it smells and constantly wonder what it is I use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Get it from amazon because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive in most stores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Needed to get an applicator in order to avoid having to pour directly from the large container.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little to be effective.</li>
      <li>greta for me, especially this winter in New York, all the heat in the house because of the cold , dies the hair out and the stay in moisturizer ois perfect.</li>
      <li>(Following some advice I saw on youtube, I rub it between my hands first to emulsify</li>
      <li>This is not at ALL what I was expecting - I&#x27;m back to Terax which is a much higher quality product.</li>
      <li>I first got this as a promotional freebie when buying a different product of this brand.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair moisturized and soft for days.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
      <li>and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>And because I use it all year round, I bought the bigger bottle because you get more for your money.  </li>
      <li>Gives the right texture and lift to my thin and short, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Several members of my family (we&#x27;re latino) have curly hair ranging from loose curls to extremely tight curls that easily tangle, with this product it makes our hair very manageable.</li>
      <li>If you have thick curly hair, this product will make it soft, manageable, and extra lovely.  </li>
      <li>When applied after wetting your hair it&#x27;ll keep it smooth and controlled, less fly aways and loose hairs sticking up all crazy like.</li>
      <li>My hair is thick and fine and tends to be wavy.  </li>
      <li>A small amount of AG does the trick and it can pretty much brush it into how I want it and then let it dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently grew my wavy, frizzy hair out, and had been struggling with how to control it. I&#x27;ve been using fast food as a grooming product--I put two or three dollops in before drying and more after drying, and that actually does the trick: no frizziness! (Following some advice I saw on youtube, I rub it between my hands first to emulsify it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much of it I put in my hair, it&#x27;s not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. In fact my hair is soft and shiny and looks great. (On between-washing days, if it&#x27;s limp, I put in some re:coil, which is also a great product.)</li>
    <li> Been using this for years ... small amount on wet hair, leave in ... silky smooth hair when dried. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and I do not blow dry it.  I also don&#x27;t like a lot of product, especially if you can feel it in your hair.  My hair is thick and fine and tends to be wavy.  A small amount of AG does the trick and it can pretty much brush it into how I want it and then let it dry.  Can&#x27;t even tell I have anything in my hair.</li>
    <li> Just what was expected, arrived on time and in excellent condition. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Its a good conditioner.  But in my opinion, not any better than others.  I love other AG products, but this one I just didn&#x27;t see any great changes in my hair.  However, it didn&#x27;t change it for the worse either.</li>
    <li> Several members of my family (we&#x27;re latino) have curly hair ranging from loose curls to extremely tight curls that easily tangle, with this product it makes our hair very manageable. When applied after wetting your hair it&#x27;ll keep it smooth and controlled, less fly aways and loose hairs sticking up all crazy like. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or like you applied anything to it. And apparently people love how it smells and constantly wonder what it is I use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for curly haired individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it from amazon because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive in most stores.</li>
    <li> You really don&#x27;t need too much of this conditioner at all. Put a dime sized amount in the palm of you your hand, apply all over head and hair, and blot or wrap up hair in a towel for a minute for best results.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described and arrived quickly. Needed to get an applicator in order to avoid having to pour directly from the large container.</li>
    <li> i love ths stuff i this doesnt leave my hair greasybought it about 15 years ago and i ave never changed</li>
    <li> This is not at ALL what I was expecting - I&#x27;m back to Terax which is a much higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I use this leave in conditioner when I do not wish to blow dry my hair and it is a great product.  It keeps my hair moisturized and soft for days.  The only reason I gave it a four is because it did not ship in the container displayed online.  I wanted to upside down packaging for easy access, especially when the contents start to get low, but otherwise, it is great for your hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair, this product will make it soft, manageable, and extra lovely.  Just work a good bit of it through after washing (I use 1.5 - 2 T and my hair is long), then scrunch as it dries.  Scrunching removes any slight crunchiness and keeps the strands of curls together.  I cannot \\&quot;do\\&quot; my hair without this.  I use it daily. Love this product.  Worth every penny.  Works well with AG Recoil and also with Redken Ringlet 07.</li>
    <li> Great product - really works well</li>
    <li> Great buy.  This stuff smells great.  My hair dresser uses it so I had to have it.</li>
    <li> greta for me, especially this winter in New York, all the heat in the house because of the cold , dies the hair out and the stay in moisturizer ois perfect.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Smells great, is not greasy, and its just conditioner so you can even go to bed with it in your hair.</li>
    <li> Gives the right texture and lift to my thin and short, fine hair. Easy to apply and it looks natural.</li>
    <li> This is good for calming frizzies, keeping curls hydrated &amp; reapplication doesn&#x27;t create that caked-on look.  Not for fine or oily hair, I might think.</li>
    <li> AG Fast Food gives my hair a lot of moisture without leaving any residue or firmness.  I use it first after washing my hair.  Then, I add KMS California Curl Up Curling Balm for more curl enhancement while my hair is wet.  Later once my hair dries, I add a styling gel.  My hair is naturally curly and I have been using Fast Food for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist and I have really enjoyed it.  Don&#x27;t use too much though. It only takes a little to be effective.</li>
    <li> I discovered this leave on conditioner at a salon.  This stuff not only tames thick and curly hair but it smells fantastic.  The stylist/owner of the salon for 30+ years doesn&#x27;t use anything else.  If the experts recommends it then it has to be good so I ordered a small one and loved it.  And because I use it all year round, I bought the bigger bottle because you get more for your money.  Highly recommend it.  Just a small coin size amount will do wonders.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in for very fine haor that I have found. A little bit goes a long way, with no greasy feeling or weighting down.</li>
    <li> I first got this as a promotional freebie when buying a different product of this brand. It sat in my cabinet for quite a while until I was recently in a pinch and realized I was out of conditioner. I decided to give it a try and it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that was extremely chemically damaged by an unfortunate bleach job about a year ago. I have to condition after washing, period. This product really helps with detangling and restoring my hair to a healthier texture. It smells like cotton candy to me, which I kind of think is fun and don&#x27;t mind. Nothing negative to say about this product except that you should really be careful not to use too much. It is amazing how little you need and it will make your hair look jacked if you use more than you need.</li>
