      <li>It works just fine.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very useful, it&#x27;s needed to avoid lifting on gel nails.</li>

      <li>This product drys the nails really well so that the acrylic sticks better.  </li>
      <li>I start first with Mavala Scientifique Original Nail Hardene, 0.16 Ounce, also available here on wonderful Amazon.com for $20 with a Prime membership and about the same including shipping from individual suppliers.  </li>
      <li>Dehydrates super quick, in two seconds i would say</li>
      <li>Starting with a clean dry nail keeps everything you pile on top of it a good anchoring system.  </li>
      <li>so right.  </li>
      <li>does nothing .nails come right off</li>
      <li>But I think it works very well, and the good thing is - it lasts really long.</li>
      <li>IBD Dehydrate is a much own product for all who desire long wear polish and nails.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>It is my first dehydrate product ever, so I do not have anything to compare it with.</li>
      <li>Just received this item today so ready to use it !</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable!</li>
      <li>This is doing exactly what it should do.</li>
      <li>I would not do my nails without applying this product first.</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>Love it and will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>Then I finish with Cnd Cosmetics Colour Super Shiney .33 Oz High Gloss Nails</li>
      <li>Really helps bond the acrylic to your nail much better than only using primer.</li>
      <li>By using this product together with all the ibd line it really works</li>
      <li>This dehydrate worked very well</li>
      <li>I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s fast).  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>This one dehydrates the PERFECT amount to where my acrylics will stay on, but it won&#x27;t dry it out too much, make my nails thin, or make my nails tear.</li>
      <li>Then I finish off with my manicure using the Shellac system (Which I highly recommend.)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a dehydrator that isn&#x27;t as harmful on your nails as others.</li>
      <li>Its the right size and one bottle seems like it will last forever.  </li>
      <li>the smell was a little strong</li>
      <li>Perhaps the tops of the bottles are made a little cheaply, because mine screws on crookedly every time since the first time I went to replace the top again, however it&#x27;s still a tight enough seal that it doesn&#x27;t leak or evaporate</li>
      <li>That stuff is a MAGIC for making your nails hard as, well, nails.  </li>
      <li>I bought the IBD gel nails professional kit.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it needs to do, which is remove any oils and dry the nail bed to prevent lifting of your acrylic.</li>
      <li>The price is worth it because this will last you a long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my cuticles, wash my hands with antibacterial soap, rough up my nails with a fine grit, put two coats of this on (letting them dry in between), and then push the cuticles back as far as they will go.</li>
      <li>this product is honestly the only thing tat held my nails on when I was using some cheap and worthless primer.  </li>
      <li>It makes manicures last so much longer, especially for those of us with oily skin who generally have trouble making nail polish stay</li>

<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> The difference between when this has been used before applying acrylics as opposed to when it hasn&#x27;t been is quite noticeable - acrylics stay on a lot longer and seem noticeably less flimsy.</li>
<li> The dehydrate helped a little but, I still have some lifting.</li>
<li> This is a waste of money...</li>
<li> I know it sounds wrong, all wrong, but it&#x27;s right,</li>
<li> Lifting nails is now a thing of the past.  </li>
<li> There are probably cheaper alternatives, but it hasn&#x27;t done me wrong.</li>

    <li> I know it sounds wrong, all wrong, but it&#x27;s right, so right.  Starting with a clean dry nail keeps everything you pile on top of it a good anchoring system.  I have found it works wonders and I use my hands A LOT for work.  I start first with Mavala Scientifique Original Nail Hardene, 0.16 Ounce, also available here on wonderful Amazon.com for $20 with a Prime membership and about the same including shipping from individual suppliers.  That stuff is a MAGIC for making your nails hard as, well, nails.  Pardon the pun....  Let that dry (it&#x27;s fast).  Then use this.  I don&#x27;t use a base coat but you could.  I just go for it with the nail polish.  Then I finish with Cnd Cosmetics Colour Super Shiney .33 Oz High Gloss Nails Shine Top Coat Polish Salon, also available here.  THAT is also MAGIC...A nail tech used it on me 15+ years ago and I&#x27;ve tried everything; it&#x27;s the shiniest.  Truth.  Glad all these products available here, so thank you, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the IBD gel nails professional kit.  After a couple times of doing my nails, they kept lifting so I reluctantly purchased the IBD dehydrate.  Lifting nails is now a thing of the past.  This product is a must for me!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
    <li> does the job just what you think it would do</li>
    <li> This is doing exactly what it should do. Perfect. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> The price is worth it because this will last you a long time. Really helps bond the acrylic to your nail much better than only using primer.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast. It does exactly what it needs to do, which is remove any oils and dry the nail bed to prevent lifting of your acrylic. It works just fine. A little goes a long way. I only had to wet the brush once for 5 nails. It doesn&#x27;t burn or smell bad. The price is reasonable! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great with the monomer and the translucent powder</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time tonight. I&#x27;ll let you know in about a week. March 23, 2015-This is a GREAT PRODUCT ;-} I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-} I&#x27;ve tried this both ways; with &amp; without.  The gel seems to stay longer when I use the dehydrater. ;-}</li>
    <li> Works just as it says it does.

    <li> This product very good for nail. specially when you want care and protect your nail. i use this product all the time before put polish</li>
    <li> It does its job. There are probably cheaper alternatives, but it hasn&#x27;t done me wrong. It&#x27;s perfect after I buff the shine on my nails.</li>
    <li> Got this for applying silk wraps, but is great for a pre-prep for polish too. Dries the nail bed and evaporates within moments.</li>
    <li> Seems to work like it should. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with lifting nails. The price is good. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Needed something to help nail polish and nail wraps to stay on my nails.  This is amazing.  This works so great.  Its so easy to use with no smell at all.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Just received this item today so ready to use it ! Just got one bottle to begin with since I&#x27;m only going to be working on myself . Ready to try soon!!!</li>
    <li> Dehydrates super quick, in two seconds i would say</li>
    <li> I use this when I do my nails at home.</li>
    <li> works amazingly well...will purchase again!!! A must have for gel wearers!!! I love it... i have been disappointed before. happy ive found this</li>
    <li> The dehydrate helped a little but, I still have some lifting.</li>
    <li> I used this once for acrylic nails and they are still on! yay! I used it about two weeks ago I was having problems with my nails staying on not any more!</li>
    <li> Worked wonder. My acrylics held up better because there was no oil on my nail. The acrylic is able to adhere better</li>
    <li> does nothing .nails come right off</li>
    <li> IBD Dehydrate is a much own product for all who desire long wear polish and nails. For gel nails, it assists products in adhering to your nails by removing oils.  For polished nails, it increases the time you can wear nail polish application.</li>
    <li> I use this before putting on Jamberry Nails to take the moisure out of my nails. flawlessfingers.jamberrynails.net ......It works great!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need this for any gel system.  I used my Gelish phbond the first couple times I used my IBD system and thought I&#x27;d better try the IBD brand dehydrate and it works great!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It makes manicures last so much longer, especially for those of us with oily skin who generally have trouble making nail polish stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my cuticles, wash my hands with antibacterial soap, rough up my nails with a fine grit, put two coats of this on (letting them dry in between), and then push the cuticles back as far as they will go. Then I finish off with my manicure using the Shellac system (Which I highly recommend.)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I can finally do my own nails and have them stay on longer than a day</li>
    <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
    <li> A lot of the dehydrators in the past have been harmful and dried my nails out too, too much to where they tear, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that! This one dehydrates the PERFECT amount to where my acrylics will stay on, but it won&#x27;t dry it out too much, make my nails thin, or make my nails tear. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a dehydrator that isn&#x27;t as harmful on your nails as others.</li>
    <li> Very good for the work that its doing,on time! Ill buy again from this company !</li>
    <li> It is my first dehydrate product ever, so I do not have anything to compare it with. But I think it works very well, and the good thing is - it lasts really long.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my gels last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful, it&#x27;s needed to avoid lifting on gel nails. By using this product together with all the ibd line it really works</li>
    <li> love this product, helps applying acrylic nails a lot easier. i will have to buy more, considering i do all my nail work myself since it is way cheaper. nice price and great shipping</li>
    <li> Great product fast service</li>
    <li> A great, cheap nail dehydrator. I use it constantly on clients, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love doing my own gels, you ALSO need a bonder so don&#x27;t forget that. This replaces the acetone step.</li>
    <li> Looks like glass over your polish. Adds protection and prevents polish from wearing. Quickly dries under UV light.</li>
    <li> This dehydrate worked very well the smell was a little strong but i experienced no lifting and no problems with it overall I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do...removes any oils from the nail bed so artificail nails apply better. It does have an offensive smell, but it is nothing compared to the strong stinky feet smell you get at a salon.</li>
    <li> Use this dehydrator before anything else or your nails will pop off.  Its the right size and one bottle seems like it will last forever.  Good value and a great tool in the kit.</li>
    <li> This makes a big difference.  I would not do my nails without applying this product first. I think that this product is as important as the bonder.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time because I do my nails at home when I am not traveling, Thank you</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Great product, just what I ordered, Arrived safe and intact.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!  This is a waste of money...just use isopropyl alcohol.</li>
    <li> works perfect with the soak off gel</li>
    <li> if your going to DIY nails you have got to get quality products and this is very nice. My nails came out great.</li>
    <li> Good product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I do my own gel nails and this is a must have. I use IBD gel and was having problems with it popping off - this is a great product and will help reduce pop offs and lifting (as part of proper prep). Love it and will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product drys the nails really well so that the acrylic sticks better.  this product is honestly the only thing tat held my nails on when I was using some cheap and worthless primer.  It is an awesome product.  I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
