### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>The best procedure for winkles, and scars.</li>
      <li>When I comparison shopped for this tool, this seemed to be the best value</li>
      <li>&amp; I still think I chose the best tool for the value.</li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>The quality is very good.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the micro roller for a couple weeks and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>but it works great</li>
      <li>I think that you will be happy with the supplier of this item, too.</li>
      <li>The 0.5mm hurt more!!</li>
      <li>I know this it , it is very good and give a nice result ....</li>
      <li>This is an amazing item, promotes healing of keloids!</li>
      <li>Unusually easy way to stay beautiful!!</li>
      <li>All good.</li>
      <li>After reading some good reviews, I decided to give this micro needle system</li>
      <li>- I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good thing or not...  :</li>
      <li>This unit is great, almost pain free and great results in my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving 3 stars for now because the item seems to be in a great quality - it&#x27;s not one of those flimsy rollers that can break easily.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this would honestly work</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice box in a glass bottle with glass dropper.</li>
      <li>When I told my dermatologist about it, she said that it is an effective practice to use with serums.  </li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>After rolling, I wash my face,pat gently and apply a vitamin C serum (Timeless Beauty), wait 15 minutes of so before applying a light moisturizer (Perfect Image).</li>
      <li>it rolls without any catching, it does produce a very mild stinging -</li>
      <li>but it is better to check with Dr not for use alone .</li>
      <li>i think i will go for the one size longer for a better effect.  </li>
      <li>I am in my 60s and enjoying my face.</li>
      <li>This was not a miserable treatment, but haven&#x27;t yet decided if it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
      <li>much pleased.</li>
      <li>I think I see a difference, but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure whether I can keep up with it or not.  </li>
      <li>It hurts even more on the forehead.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting this product, the 1mm, to hurt a lot more because of the length and quantity of needles.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I roll over easy.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to clean it thoroughly after each use and store in a sealed container.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines are lessening and my pores are shrinking.</li>
      <li>i have had laser treatments for my fine lines and they worked, but took about six months for the results.  </li>
      <li>I have used the MRS rollers for several months now and am happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with it until a few days ago.  </li>
      <li>For the record, the company offered a full refund</li>
      <li>Far more comfortable, better coverage, gets in small spots, and works great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>effective little clear plastic box thing,  good explanations included, their website is super helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;big fan.</li>
      <li>It &#x27;kills&#x27; my lips and eyes to roll, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I have since purchased another, and when that one wears out, I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>But, it hurts too much to roll it that many times on the same area.  </li>
      <li>The jury is out on how well this product works, if it actually does get more of those high dollar skin products into the deeper layers of dermis.  </li>
      <li>I use Pure Hyaluronic Serum (2 oz.)</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
      <li>Knowing how much pressure to use will take practice.</li>
      <li>I really feel like how it gets the serum into my skin instead of sitting on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I received this item much quicker than anticipated.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, the roller can get its groove back and function properly back on track if used with that kind of care.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether this actually works, it&#x27;s a pretty objective call, but this particular product is very nicely made and seems like it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
      <li>The roller really helps the serums be absorbed by the skin and this winter is the first winter I haven&#x27;t had dry flaky skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used another roller with less needles and had more pain than this one.</li>
      <li>Despite concerns about contamination from some reviewers, I bought this product and have been using it successfully for the past several weeks.  </li>
      <li>The roller is like a little lawn mower, and it would work just fine if operated over a smooth, flat surface.  </li>
      <li>It is a new procedure for me ...</li>
      <li>Also my skin is very sensitive, yet after using this at night, I never see any &amp;#34;consequenses&amp;#34; in the morning.</li>
      <li>but am very conscious of how I look</li>
      <li>received this today, and rolled it on my face for the first time - actually just now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Certainly worth a trial period to see if there will be some long term results.</li>
      <li>The vendor I got it from (Skin Beauty Solutions) sent it out quickly &amp; included extra medical info./printouts that were in addition to what was provided by the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Also, it comes in a clear plastic storage container.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I can&#x27;t see anything change on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The roller fixed itself.  </li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>i recommend this for sensitive skin - the longer one for others.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised...</li>
      <li>This is complete rubbish.  </li>
      <li>The instructions say to roll 10 times on the same spot, working around your whole face.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how, but it somehow realigned the wheel back on track and it&#x27;s working just fine.  </li>
      <li>I barely applied pressure.  </li>
      <li>When \\&quot;mowed\\&quot; over the contours of these irregular areas, the wheel can get pinched or out of alignment, so be careful to not use it with too much force when going over rounded or lumpy (e.g. the Adam&#x27;s apple)areas.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the .50 size roller by MRS, which is the professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;(on a personal note)...</li>
      <li>this roller works on the same principal - damage the skin and new cells grow back.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t very sharp or really did anything I rollers it</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms because they get real dry</li>
<li> Everything I expected.</li>
<li> I use it every other night (usually) and then rest for a week when I see major flaking (I&#x27;m using Obagi and Retin-A.)</li>
<li> But the face and throat/neck are not smooth, flat surfaces.  </li>
<li> I am seeing some progress, but want you to know that this is somewhat uncomfortable to use at first.  </li>
<li> It does not hurt at all like other rollers I have tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used another roller with less needles and had more pain than this one. This unit is great, almost pain free and great results in my skin. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This broke after several uses.  Not a great buy.</li>
    <li> I received this item much quicker than anticipated.  I previously used a 0.5mm roller, a different brand, for about a month and thought I should try the 1mm.  I was dreading it. I don&#x27;t care what people say.... it hurts.  I wanted to see what it felt like so I rolled it on the back of my hand... Hmmm.... it didn&#x27;t hurt.  So I rolled the 0.5mm and OUCH!!  The 0.5mm hurt more!! The 0.5mm had 192 needles and was a different brand.  I was expecting this product, the 1mm, to hurt a lot more because of the length and quantity of needles.  Nope.  I wish I started out with this brand from the start.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this would honestly work but I have a lot less breakouts. The fine lines are lessening and my pores are shrinking. Great product.</li>
    <li> It just makes sense that poking the skin helps to plump it up! Unusually easy way to stay beautiful!! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used for very long, haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but am continuing to use. So, guess that I shouldn&#x27;t be in such a hurry!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this actually works, it&#x27;s a pretty objective call, but this particular product is very nicely made and seems like it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> It does make your face a little red, but doesn&#x27;t last.  This was not a miserable treatment, but haven&#x27;t yet decided if it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
    <li> I somehow received a different brand of roller from this supplier than what was advertised and ordered.  When brought to their attention, I had an immediate correction of the problem.  I have used the MRS rollers for several months now and am happy with the results.  I think that you will be happy with the supplier of this item, too.</li>
    <li> THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;omg. this thing.  i had no idea. and now i do. it&#x27;s so effective. i mean not overnight, granted. ..well, yeah, sometimes even overnight. buy this thing. seriously. effective little clear plastic box thing,  good explanations included, their website is super helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;big fan. much pleased. wow.</li>
    <li> it looks like it&#x27;s made alright.&lt;br /&gt;But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sharp enough to do what it supposed to do though.</li>
    <li> i have had laser treatments for my fine lines and they worked, but took about six months for the results.  they were VERY painful and EXPENSIVE. this roller works on the same principal - damage the skin and new cells grow back. i bought the .50 mm roller, but think i should have gone longer.  it does NOT hurt, like some people say and my face doesn&#x27;t even get red.  i think i will go for the one size longer for a better effect.  i probably won&#x27;t see results for a few months. i recommend this for sensitive skin - the longer one for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the micro roller for a couple weeks and my skin looks great. Everybody notices the difference in my skin. Love it!!! I use retin-A with it. Before when I used the Retin-A without the roller I really couldn&#x27;t see any improvement but when I started using the roller before applying the cream the improvement is dramatic!!</li>
    <li> The best procedure for winkles, and scars. It does not hurt at all like other rollers I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using the derma roller for about a month along with the Vadik Brahmi and Amla oils to help promote growth of my thinning hair line.  I am seeing some progress, but want you to know that this is somewhat uncomfortable to use at first.  Knowing how much pressure to use will take practice.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great!  It is a new procedure for me ... but it works great and I will use it often.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The needles were smaller than I expected, but I can see the change on my skin after just one use!</li>
    <li> I used it for a week n 3 times, it&#x27;s a bit pain if I didn&#x27;t put the lotion on my face before use it.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I can&#x27;t see anything change on my face.</li>
    <li> I like this roller. I roll very hard, and it has yet to break my skin. When I looked at how doctors do it, they do break the skin with it. They practically pulverize it. I just do a little everyday. We&#x27;ll see how it works.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t yet comment on the results as it&#x27;s not been long enough since I started using it, what I can say is that it is not as painful as many people described here, and I usually don&#x27;t tolerate pain well.  Also my skin is very sensitive, yet after using this at night, I never see any &amp;#34;consequenses&amp;#34; in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use.  Be sure to clean it thoroughly after each use and store in a sealed container.  The jury is out on how well this product works, if it actually does get more of those high dollar skin products into the deeper layers of dermis.  It&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable to use (with some prudence).  Certainly worth a trial period to see if there will be some long term results.</li>
    <li> made my pores smaller, and wrinkles less visible.. im only 38 but am very conscious of how I look</li>
    <li> This is an amazing item, promotes healing of keloids!</li>
    <li> Save you money.  I don&#x27;t see any improvement to my skin.  This is complete rubbish.  It is supposed to reduce the appearance of scars? Wrong!</li>
    <li> Despite concerns about contamination from some reviewers, I bought this product and have been using it successfully for the past several weeks.  When I told my dermatologist about it, she said that it is an effective practice to use with serums.  The roller really helps the serums be absorbed by the skin and this winter is the first winter I haven&#x27;t had dry flaky skin.  I think the roller and the serums have done the trick!</li>
    <li> I really feel like how it gets the serum into my skin instead of sitting on the skin.  I roll over easy.  Don&#x27;t push, just glide it over.  I use this with the vitamin C&amp;E Ferulic Acid Serum.  Two weeks and I can see benefit.</li>
    <li> Yes it works! The instructions say to roll 10 times on the same spot, working around your whole face. Your skin will get puffy where you rolled because you are actually breaking the skin. It &#x27;kills&#x27; my lips and eyes to roll, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms because they get real dry and it helps the moisturizer absorb. I purchased the .50 size roller by MRS, which is the professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;(on a personal note)...If you are not using a serum on your face, you must make it part of your daily skin care! I use Pure Hyaluronic Serum (2 oz.) by Cosmedica Skincare ($13.95)(2 oz. goes a long way). This serum holds 1000x its weight in water. It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs quickly. Once it absorbs, use your regular moisturizer over it. My daughter in college now uses it on her skin. I&#x27;ve been using this serum since January 2013. It comes in a nice box in a glass bottle with glass dropper. I was desperate for a moisturizer and ordered this! I was so surprised...I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. I was concerned about horror stories: crooked needles, scarring skin, pain, etc. All good. If I think I should have purchased the 1 mm. I think I see a difference, but I can&#x27;t be sure. I use it every other night (usually) and then rest for a week when I see major flaking (I&#x27;m using Obagi and Retin-A.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this derma roller for about 2-3 weeks and I&#x27;ve used it about 4-5 times per week.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it until a few days ago.  It rolls about 3/4 then stops rolling.  It&#x27;s like hitting the brakes.  Do you have any idea how jarring (and dangerous!) that is to the skin when there are micro-needles involved?  My hand is pushing or pulling the roller, and for some reason the wheel goes tight and stops rolling, so the force of me pushing/pulling makes the needles tug on my skin: not the intended use of this device!  Thankfully, my skin didn&#x27;t tear or anything.  Hopefully they replace it because it&#x27;s too dangerous to use right now....&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE -- 4 DAYS LATER **&lt;br /&gt;The roller fixed itself.  I&#x27;m not sure how, but it somehow realigned the wheel back on track and it&#x27;s working just fine.  I think the trick is in learning how to use it with care.  The roller is like a little lawn mower, and it would work just fine if operated over a smooth, flat surface.  But the face and throat/neck are not smooth, flat surfaces.  When \\&quot;mowed\\&quot; over the contours of these irregular areas, the wheel can get pinched or out of alignment, so be careful to not use it with too much force when going over rounded or lumpy (e.g. the Adam&#x27;s apple)areas.  Thankfully, the roller can get its groove back and function properly back on track if used with that kind of care.  For the record, the company offered a full refund but I chose to keep it once it \\&quot;got its groove back.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Been using a dermal roller for a while, and this one is a total upgrade.  Far more comfortable, better coverage, gets in small spots, and works great.  I have since purchased another, and when that one wears out, I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very sharp or really did anything I rollers it and it never even pinched the skin. Tried it once</li>
    <li> I ordered .5 size and adhere to recommendations in hygiene and sterile area when using.  I try to use once a week and have noticed an improvement on dark spots on my face. Spots are definitely going away. After rolling, I wash my face,pat gently and apply a vitamin C serum (Timeless Beauty), wait 15 minutes of so before applying a light moisturizer (Perfect Image). I am in my 60s and enjoying my face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t stayed on a regimen of constant use with this tool, so I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my keloided scar. Though it&#x27;s certainly not pleasant or comfortable in any way to roll this over a scar, etc, the needles are sharp enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do without added discomfort. The quality is very good. The vendor I got it from (Skin Beauty Solutions) sent it out quickly &amp; included extra medical info./printouts that were in addition to what was provided by the manufacturer. When I comparison shopped for this tool, this seemed to be the best value &amp; I still think I chose the best tool for the value.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the problem mentioned in other reviews... it rolls without any catching, it does produce a very mild stinging - but isn&#x27;t that what sticking needles into your skin does?! So far, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or anything, but I feel like my skin is losing elasticity, so I wanted to stimulate collagen synthesis.  After reading some good reviews, I decided to give this micro needle system a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this today, and rolled it on my face for the first time - actually just now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, this hurts!  I barely applied pressure.  According to the instruction, you&#x27;re supposed roll it horizontally/vertically and diagonally 10 times each.  But, it hurts too much to roll it that many times on the same area.  It hurts even more on the forehead.  My face is now red &amp; throbbing with pain - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good thing or not...  :-?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 3 stars for now because the item seems to be in a great quality - it&#x27;s not one of those flimsy rollers that can break easily.  Also, it comes in a clear plastic storage container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure whether I can keep up with it or not.  If I do, I will update the review later about whether I see a result or not.</li>
    <li> I know this it , it is very good and give a nice result .... but it is better to check with Dr not for use alone .</li>
