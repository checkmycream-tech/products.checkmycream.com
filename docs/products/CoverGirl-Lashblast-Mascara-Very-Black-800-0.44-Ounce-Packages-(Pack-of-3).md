      <li>okay, you see how in the picture it shows an orange top &amp; bottom?</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be able to get this in Singapore.</li>
      <li>I love the brush.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love this Mascara.  </li>
      <li>So glad I bought a 3 pack.</li>
      <li>Okay, maybe not to the rescue</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascara over the years, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>And I love that I can now get it on Amazon in 3 packs with Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
      <li>I have used Covergirl Lastblast before and its simply amazing for the price its worth!</li>
      <li>the brush is perfect for my lashes too (they&#x27;re long and clump easily).</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly without too many clumps.</li>
      <li>I heard alot of good reviews about this Mascara and really wanted to try it.  </li>
      <li>Nice mascara but no miracles in this fat orange tube just old fashioned mascara that does what most mascaras do - darken!</li>
      <li>The price is great on Amazon, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome mascara!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge either, yet it&#x27;s easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>and it makes my lash really Beautiful especially when curling them before applying the mascara.  </li>
      <li>The pack of 3 is a super deal and cheaper than buying it elsewhere!</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, love how it stays on and makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy stocking up on essentials such as mascara at a good price.</li>
      <li>As a side note, it sometimes makes my eyes itchy, but I am very allergic and most products do this to me.</li>
      <li>The brush is big and adequate to get a good application of mascara.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is trying to find it for cheap where I live, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
      <li>Since their conception, I have preferred this type of applicator to the classic \\&quot;brush\\&quot; - I feel like it causes fewer clumps and defines my lashes better.</li>
      <li>I love, love this mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my eyelashes full and long.  </li>
      <li>It is a good mascara but doesnt give me the long lash look</li>
      <li>How lush your eyelashes are after application will be determined by how many eyelash hairs</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m glad that the reviewers are clear that they received a free sample of the mascara, I completely disregard the reviews that are driven by a free sample.</li>
      <li>The color is really dark and it&#x27;s kind of cheap.</li>
      <li>Leaves your lashes looking thick and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the brush of this mascara very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras - for volume, length, etc</li>
      <li>It is cheap and great solution to long and full lashes, and much better than some triple expensive products I used to use.</li>
      <li>My only issue is needing to use another mascara to get more length and curl.</li>
      <li>Among all of the different \\&quot;blasts\\&quot; from CG, I like this volumizing formula the most.</li>
      <li>I also tried other CoverGirl mascaras over the years, but nothing can top this one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a second try.</li>
      <li>It coats my lashes nicely and they don&#x27;t seem to stick together like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My lashes look just as good using this brand as they do wearing the more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>I have long eyelashes but need some more volume to them.</li>
      <li>I like the mascara, not so hot on the wand because it is so beefy for the corners.</li>
      <li>Overall the product gives a great affect on the eye and for less than 4 bucks a tube it is a deal.</li>
      <li>the Mascara is Really great, I used it every day since I bought it (about 2 and half months now),   for daily use I apply 1 coat &amp; sometimes 2; for night out</li>
      <li>but; sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry I apply it fast and the brush hit my lid</li>
      <li>I would definitely try this if you are looking for something cheap and that does the job.</li>
      <li>I apply 3 very carefuly..</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The wand separates my lashes and really does make them look longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>you have - skimpy, then there won&#x27;t be much for the mascara to coat to -</li>
      <li>CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara is the mascara that really works for me.</li>
      <li>it enlarges them and it is  real waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too big, and at the tip of it the bristles are wayy too short, so the mascara kind of clumps up there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier for me to hold it steady as it&#x27;s large</li>
      <li>I found that this mascara works better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I used to use the super expensive mascaras whose designer names I thought could make me look gorgeous.</li>
      <li>The liquid goes on smooth without clumping and doesn&#x27;t flake-even at the end of a long day.</li>
      <li>Now I never worry about it running out or drying up before I buy a new one!</li>
      <li>Just this particular mascara</li>
      <li>Well I got cheap mismatched mascara( you know the limited edition ones that came with lashblast volume purple tops)</li>
      <li>I have tried high end mascaras and lots of drug store brands</li>
      <li>I just had to switch out the brush from one of my old ones, it suckss!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite mascara, love how it stays on and makes my eyelashes really pop. It takes quite a bit to get it off but I need that so it&#x27;s perfect for me</li>
    <li> This is one of the few drug store make up items that is far better than all the high end mascaras out there. Seriously, don&#x27;t bother spending the money on the fancy stuff, this is so much better. Applies evenly, giving good volume. Stays on well for a non waterproof version.</li>
    <li> This product is not the same as what is pictured or advertised.  The product is quality is acceptable and not worth the trouble to  return, but I won&#x27;t make this mistake again.</li>
    <li> You said it was a pack of three but i only had one mascara! Wheres the other two? It feels like you stole me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a long time since I use mascara daily and it&#x27;s one that works the best for me. The color is great and 2 layers make eyelashes look awesome. The only complaint is that the product gets dry too quickly inside the bottle, so I feel a lot of it goes to waste which sometimes seems like a scam. As a side note, it sometimes makes my eyes itchy, but I am very allergic and most products do this to me.</li>
    <li> Eh, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product I buy in the store. It&#x27;s never in stock anywhere anymore so that&#x27;s why I chose to purchase online. I received three total:  the two pack and then a third individual mascara. This third one appeared to come in an opened package. I&#x27;m not sure if these are really old and taken off CVS shelves (sticker found on the back) or mismarked containers. These are poor quality and dont apply very well.</li>
    <li> I heard alot of good reviews about this Mascara and really wanted to try it.  this was a very good deal..   the Mascara is Really great, I used it every day since I bought it (about 2 and half months now),   for daily use I apply 1 coat &amp; sometimes 2; for night out I apply 3 very carefuly.. and it makes my lash really Beautiful especially when curling them before applying the mascara.  but; sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry I apply it fast and the brush hit my lid.. so be careful ;)  I will definetly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too surprised at the mixed reviews.. Like any other makeup item, everyone is very particular about their favorite mascara and seems to love or hate any given variety. I happen to really love this one, and I (like everyone else) have tried a lot! Since their conception, I have preferred this type of applicator to the classic \\&quot;brush\\&quot; - I feel like it causes fewer clumps and defines my lashes better. Among all of the different \\&quot;blasts\\&quot; from CG, I like this volumizing formula the most. My lashes are already pretty long, so I like to beef them up and I think this does an awesome job of that. The Very Black color is just that, and even though this is not a waterproof formula, it stays on very well for me and does not smudge or run. The 3-pack is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a note, obviously if you&#x27;ve never tried a product before you should probably test out a single first before buying a multi-pack!</li>
    <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago because my eyelashes are not as thick as they used to be and Lashblast plumps my lashes up and makes them look fuller then the product I used to use.</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara is the mascara that really works for me. I do replace each month as I find it can flake after that.</li>
    <li> I have fairly long lashes to start with. I used to use the super expensive mascaras whose designer names I thought could make me look gorgeous. I found that this mascara works better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The orange is my favorite. There&#x27;s another color (the package) that smells chemical and I tossed it out. I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a second try. I love it and use it every day. People keep asking me if I get my lashes done. I tell them no and they say they hate me. I can&#x27;t decide if I should divulge my secret weapon. I love you CoverGirl!</li>
    <li> I love the brush. It separates my lashes. The color is really dark and it&#x27;s kind of cheap. I just ordee another package of three</li>
    <li> I really enjoy stocking up on essentials such as mascara at a good price. I like the way the mascara goes on and stays on.</li>
    <li> Wow, 3 pack at Costco, with a coupon, was under $11 bucks! I like the mascara, not so hot on the wand because it is so beefy for the corners. Overall the product gives a great affect on the eye and for less than 4 bucks a tube it is a deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for at least 4 years.  It is the BEST EVER!!!  I use 2-3 coats depending on how pronounced I want to make my lashes.  People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes all of the time when I use 3 coats.  It extends and volumizes my long blond lashes.  My hair is dark but my lashes are blond.  It works wonders!!  It doesn&#x27;t work well when it starts to dry out so make sure you keep a spare on hand.  It doesn&#x27;t run or flake (unless you rub your eyes) at all, and comes off with soap and water.  If you wear it to bed you may look a little raccoon-ish in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried almost every mascara on the market.  None of them do what this mascara does!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative: watering eyes, a drop of rain, eye drops, tears...will all take a bit of this mascara off.  If you keep your eyes dry the mascara stays on until you take it off.  Keep a tube in you purse if you have concerns about this.</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 pack to break up in to 3 individual stocking stuffer gifts this year.  Great deal and, even better, great price!</li>
    <li> this has been my go-to mascara for years - never found a better kind! the brush is perfect for my lashes too (they&#x27;re long and clump easily). Been asked more than once if they&#x27;re fake while ive been wearing this mascara! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras - for volume, length, etc and they all make my eyelashes look spidery and clumpy.  Until I tried Lashblast - it gives volume and length without clumping.  And I love that I can now get it on Amazon in 3 packs with Subscribe &amp; Save.  Now I never worry about it running out or drying up before I buy a new one!</li>
    <li> okay, you see how in the picture it shows an orange top &amp; bottom? Well I got cheap mismatched mascara( you know the limited edition ones that came with lashblast volume purple tops) i used to see those at walgreens for half price. Its the same great mascara, but not the same brush which was very disappointing because when I buy my mascara it has to be that brush or I&#x27;m UNHAPPY. I just had to switch out the brush from one of my old ones, it suckss!! don&#x27;t buy unless you want a different brush!</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite mascara in the world!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this because I would never be able to find one i liked as well as this mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I had bought the L&#x27;oreal mascara which also seems popular, but I like the thicker handle and the brush better on the lashblast. It&#x27;s easier for me to hold it steady as it&#x27;s large and I have large hands, and it&#x27;s not as clumpy or wet going on as the l&#x27;oreal mascara. It hasn&#x27;t smeared or flaked off either, even when I touch the lashes after they&#x27;ve dried. The only downside is trying to find it for cheap where I live, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought a 3 pack. I don&#x27;t regret it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lengthens, curls, thickens well&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts long&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t clump too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Wand brush doesn&#x27;t reach into inner corners of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-Flakes a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Opened mascara has a shelf life of 3 months (replace after this to prevent eye infections). Unopened tubes have a shelf life up to 3 years.</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara.  I try high end brands and other mascaras and I always go back to this.  It makes my lashes a little longer and I don&#x27;t have to use a comb to separate lashes after.  This is the least smearing mascara that I have ever used.  I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> My elelashes look wonderful it enlarges them and it is  real waterproof mascara. The only thing is that you have to be patient when you take it out.</li>
    <li> I buy these in bulk! The absolute BEST mascara around!</li>
    <li> It is a good mascara but doesnt give me the long lash look i like. doesnt clump a lot which is good. i like it but im not in love with it.</li>
    <li> I love, love this mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my eyelashes full and long.  Being fair haired and fair skinned, a good mascara is a must  otherwise you end up looking like death warmed-up.  I use a lot of Mary Kay makeup and used to use Mary Kay mascara until I ran across this stuff, on a whim I tried it.  Not only is it cheaper than Mary Kay it last longer and doesn&#x27;t clump.  The pack of 3 is a super deal and cheaper than buying it elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascara over the years, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found. The brush makes my eyelashes spread apart so there are no clumps. It works great.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be able to get this in Singapore. So i got it mailed to a U.S. address and they shipped to singapore for me. I have used Covergirl Lastblast before and its simply amazing for the price its worth! Thank you yeahgoshopping!</li>
    <li> My Daugther introduced me to this product. I love, love, love this product! It delivers thick lashes with minimal smudging! The Seller&#x27;s price point was beyond all &#x27;Google&#x27; searches and store searches! The delivery time was equally good! Would definitely recommend LashBlast and the Seller for future purchases.</li>
    <li> A mi esposa le encanta, es de muy buena calidad, definitivamente muy bueno.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it, high quality is definitely very good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but when I read amazon reviews (and I have come to rely upon them....), I expect reviews from regular people who have purchased the product. While I&#x27;m glad that the reviewers are clear that they received a free sample of the mascara, I completely disregard the reviews that are driven by a free sample. Booo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite mascaras ever! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years now and I have no intention to stop! It is cheap and great solution to long and full lashes, and much better than some triple expensive products I used to use. Highly recommend! But only the this orange packed one! I also tried other CoverGirl mascaras over the years, but nothing can top this one!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a beauty expert but I have been through tons of products looking for what suits me best. I have long eyelashes but need some more volume to them. I have tried high end mascaras and lots of drug store brands and I always seem to come back to this one. It coats my lashes nicely and they don&#x27;t seem to stick together like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Even though it&#x27;s not a lengthening mascara, I still get comments all the time about how long my lashes are. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! I would definitely try this if you are looking for something cheap and that does the job.</li>
    <li> Great mascara!!! Leaves your lashes looking thick and beautiful. It is the best mascara I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years,... I have tried all the new and improved mascaras that promise to give you eyelashes like  giraffes and butterflies  but always wind up coming back to this brand. This is an excellent, no frills mascara. It goes on nice and evenly without leaving clumps. It doesn&#x27;t smudge either, yet it&#x27;s easy to remove at the end of the day. The wand separates my lashes and really does make them look longer and fuller. My lashes look just as good using this brand as they do wearing the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mascara! It goes on smoothly without too many clumps. I also love that I can put on one coat for a natural look or 3 or 4 coats for fake looking lashes (needed for: drama and cheer leading). I definitely recommend this over the waterproof version-it doesn&#x27;t completely come off for days, literally.</li>
    <li> The brush on this mascara finds everyone of my lashes, big small and in hard to reach areas.  The liquid goes on smooth without clumping and doesn&#x27;t flake-even at the end of a long day. Leaves me lashes feeling healthier than before I put it on.</li>
    <li> I like covergirl so my rating on this is because I like covergirl It does work for my lashes I have very thin light lashes and it does fill them in, the price was very good</li>
    <li> Este producto combina varios elementos interesantes que lo hacen recomendable; el precio, la cantidad y la calidad, vale la pena</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush of this mascara very much. It&#x27;s too big, and at the tip of it the bristles are wayy too short, so the mascara kind of clumps up there. It is much different than in the picture. I do love covergirl make up though, so don&#x27;t give up on them! Just this particular mascara I would not recommend because of the bristles on the brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. The brush looks a little intimidating at first, but it definitely helps to create more volume. My only issue is needing to use another mascara to get more length and curl.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this mascara, I&#x27;ve used it since they first came out with it. I always get tons of compliments on my eyelashes and people always seem to think I use some really expensive mascara. The price is great on Amazon, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome mascara!</li>
    <li> Not the one I thought it was but it&#x27;s ok. I have to apply a lot of coats to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Okay, maybe not to the rescue but I would say it is one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  The brush is big and adequate to get a good application of mascara.  If you are hoping for it to give you lush eyelashes then you might be disappointed.  How lush your eyelashes are after application will be determined by how many eyelash hairs you have - skimpy, then there won&#x27;t be much for the mascara to coat to - just a fact of life.  I also have not noticed any lengthening of the lashes either so if that is something you want then I would guess this is not what you are looking for either.  There was a day when I had long and thick eyelashes and the old fashion wet-the-cake mascara even made them look glamorous but nothing seems to make thinning eyelashes better than maybe a prescription from your eye doctor.  Nice mascara but no miracles in this fat orange tube just old fashioned mascara that does what most mascaras do - darken!</li>
