      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>Most of them either don&#x27;t make much of a difference or make my hair feel really sticky.  </li>
      <li>All of my old products could stock a garage sale:)))</li>
      <li>My hair still looked bouncy and fresh from after my shower this morning.</li>

    <li> My hair has never looked better ... you have a customer forever.</li>
    <li> A definite necessity for setting your hair! If you want lasting curls look no further. Try this as a setting lotion and your curls will last so much longer!</li>
    <li> This hair volumizer works very well with my hair type ( very straight, a bit course, permed and colored ).&lt;br /&gt;My concern is getting more and lasting volume. I apply after washing and towel drying. Then I set my hair with rollers and sit under a dryer. My hair is a little crunchy after removing rollers, but after brushing out, it&#x27;s perfect. Volume and curl usually last at least 2 days depending on weather ( humidity, wind, rain ).</li>
    <li> I love the hold, it really lasts all day! However it can feel crunchy on the roots when blown dry.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s on the market.  It&#x27;s magical in your hair.  Gives you great body and volume.  Helps hold your style better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. Quick delivery.  Packaged well.</li>

    <li> Excellent product, excellent price, excellent service!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love the  product, but one canister is not usable.  It does not foam.  Solution just runs out when I can get it to come out. Disappointed !</li>
    <li> Fast and correct.Who could ask for anything more?</li>
    <li> Love this product, love this price.  Delivered to my front door ----- even better!  Wow,  Hope I can find this good of a deal again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is a good mousse for your hair to give body and volume.</li>
    <li> I have quite a bit of soft, fine hair and this mousse is the best product I&#x27;ve ever added to my daily routine. It adds just enough texture to hold an updo, adds soft volume to a blow-out, and produces soft waves with my diffuser on humid days. I mix it with other gels, creams, or dry shampoos depending on what I&#x27;m going for that day. It leaves no grease, no flakes, and no crunch. The most amazing thing about this mousse is that I can re-dry my hair every day and the heat re-activates the mousse, giving me a freshly blown-out look whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> This gives your hair the volume it needs to look good.  It is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stiff.</li>
    <li> I  USED  THIS  FOR  YEARS  GREAT  STUFF</li>
    <li> It works the best on my hair giving it volume like no other product I have used.  I don&#x27;t know why but it is difficult to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> This product gives me, with very very fine and thinning hair, the extra volume it needs .. I now feel like I have a lot more hair. I apply it before I dry and the product gives me the body I need to do some curling, also.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and being a hairdresser I&#x27;ve tried soooo many hair products to keep my hair looking curly smooth and not frizz.  The ONLY thing that works in the most humid weather is this mouse!!  Brush hair after showering while it is still really damp but not dripping....no dry spots.  Saturate your hair with this mouse.  I have hair half way down my back that is regular to slighly thick so i use about 3 handful mouse balls to run throughout all my hair.  And let air dry til a little crunchy stiff feeling.  Then flip your hair over and gently scrunch the crunches every 20 minutes......Viola!!  curly smooth hair!!  Been using it for 20 years and there&#x27;s nothing better!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair mousse products but always come BACK to Matrix Vavoom.  Nothing works as well, on my hair!  I can condition my dry (colored) hair &amp; still use this, without having gooey or sticky hair.  It also provides some hold, after drying. Vavoom provides the best lift &amp; volume of any product I&#x27;ve used (and yes, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch)!  I cannot recommend it too highly.  My stylist got me started on it.  If you have short hair, use only a golf-ball amount - no more.</li>
    <li> Provides great volume with little extra weight. Perfect product for fine, thicker hair and works well even in more humid climate.</li>
    <li> I use this product over 15 years and I love it. It holds your hair in style without being sticky</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that I&#x27;ll use. Others smell awful or are too gooey and don&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft. My hair feels clean and looks better when I use this product. For me, the trick is to partially dry my hair, then rub some mousse through it before I finish drying and styling it with my combination dryer/brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years. It is the only product I have found that does the job and without a horrible fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my curls in place without weighing down my baby fine hair. I would absolutely recommend this mousse. Also, my stylist says she always uses it at the roots when doing blowouts.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I like my hair is not weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other mousse type products and found none works as well.</li>
    <li> I tried this product three months ago, and I am so satisfied with it that I have permanently switched from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> The product arrived broken. I was given a discount and told that the dispenser had been damaged and fixed so I opted  for the discount and accepted the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed because the broken dispenser does not work.</li>
    <li> I used to depend on this mousse to be a little &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; when it dried, before I brushed it out. Now it is creamy out of the can, does just OK and is just a generic drugstore any brand mousse.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and I knew that there was a voluminous difference when I left my house this morning for work. But the best part was at lunch after app. 5 hours in the office, a friend of mine commented on how nice my hair looked and asked me if I got a haircut. My hair still looked bouncy and fresh from after my shower this morning. I am really happy with the results and people are noticing the difference!</li>
    <li> Good product as far as a mousse is concerned. Arrived quickly and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Was just like I buy in the salon!</li>
    <li> I really like the job this does on volumizing my hair without weighing it down.  My hair is very thin, fine and straight and this foam gives it a lot of body.  I am able to go several day without washing my hair if I choose.  It stays dry; does not get oily nor does it start separating.  A great product for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine hair, and I have tried numerous hair products for volume. Most of them either don&#x27;t make much of a difference or make my hair feel really sticky.  This one is fantastic.  My hairdresser uses this on me whenever I go in for a haircut, and it always turns out wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This item does not work...it comes out as liquid..I m returning.it is supposed to foam up.i have bought several times. This is defective .</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more of this product!  It would be nice if the price were more competitive with licenced Beautician prices.</li>
    <li> Although I was not counting on having to apply this when my hair was damp, and when dry.. I&#x27;ve adjusted to the directions, and am pleased with the product.  I do recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Matrix Vavoom Height of Glam is a great product. I have thick hair that has natural wave.  Vavoom makes my hair easy to manage.  I just towel dry and work a little Vavoom foam into my hair and blow dry.  A little shaping with the curling iron and I&#x27;m ready to go. It smells good too! I ordered two through Amazon and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years...  Can&#x27;t find it in salons or shops.  Lifts and adds volume to fine hair without making it heavy, stiff or sticky.  Very light fragrance.  Helps hair hold its style---even on windy days!  Please keep carrying this product online.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, gives body to my hair without weighting it down.  Have used this Matrix product for years.</li>
    <li> I can purchase this from my hairdresser (when she has it in stock!), but it&#x27;s so easy--and cheaper--to buy from Amazon, that I&#x27;d rather buy a couple at a time so that I never run out. It&#x27;s a great product for giving volume to my very soft, thinning, white hair prior to blow-drying. It&#x27;s light and has a faint fragrance.</li>
    <li> nice volumizing action. i left off a star because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other mousses i&#x27;ve tried. it smells good too</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I ever buy.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I purchased because a friend uses this product and I love it on her hair. I haven&#x27;t figured exactly how to best use it yet, but my main concern was to eliminate frizz and it does that well!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mousse that I usually purchase from my hairdresser.  I highly recommend the product and the seller.  The transaction was perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I love it.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, and just creates a light volume.  Great overall purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Fantastic on my curly hair. Gives a medium hold and adds volume to my curls.</li>
