      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Plus the Menthol cooling is nice.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to find at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice to pack on trips since it&#x27;s not a foam in a can</li>
      <li>The shave is close and the nice menthol after shave feel is quite nice.  </li>

      <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t as good as the original men&#x27;s version.</li>
      <li>but I think he is more handsome.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>Way better than foam</li>
      <li>What I like about King of Shaves is that his anti microbial ingredients like Methylparaben which is used in many skin creams and lotions - for healthy skin and to fight bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>quite simply the best shave gel or foam on the market.</li>
      <li>Works OK for electric shaving in shower.</li>
      <li>Be sure that if you are using this to shave your head (like me) to not get any in your eyes (like me) it burns like the fire of a 1000 suns.</li>
      <li>Love this Produt</li>
      <li>This produce is better than most of the products I used.  </li>
      <li>Excellent overall.</li>
      <li>Most guys that review this are probably reviewing it having used it with a blade, and it works great with a manual razor, but it really shines if you have a wet/dry electric razor like the Norelco 8000 or Panasonic Arc IV.</li>
      <li>Works better than any gel cream, shaving cream or shaving gel</li>
      <li>Glad to get it online.</li>
      <li>I can see better where I am shaving.</li>
      <li>Simply the best.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Been using King Of shaves alphagel and oil for many years now and would never consider using anything else.</li>
      <li>Love the cooling menthol.</li>
      <li>My favorite gel for shaving with my Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>Love this Alpha Gel with Cooling menthol, you can see where through to your skin for more timely and accurate shaving</li>
      <li>Feels very smooth and fresh!</li>
      <li>I always find it best to use KOS Alpha Menthol cooling gel, coupled with other pre-shaving products to achieve the closest and maximum comfort during my shaves.</li>
      <li>I like the king of shaves line, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t prefer the strong menthol in this version.  </li>
      <li>This one is even better -- zero irritation and leaves the face feeling cool, even with an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>IT IS LIGHT ON THE FACE , NO PULLING NO STINGS</li>
      <li>My husband went to an shaving system and he loves the smooth glyde he gets from this gel.</li>
      <li>and it gives a really smooth finish.</li>
      <li>This line with menthol keeps your face tingly and baby- butt smooth.</li>
      <li>The RKS Alphagel makes shaving a comfortable and invigorating experience.</li>
      <li>Not this time -- and that was fortunate for me.</li>
      <li>Leaves my sensitive skin feeling good.</li>
      <li>It is especially good with Shick Quattro razor blades as that blade has small vertical wires across the 4 blades that, I think, prevents the blades from gouging your skin.  </li>
      <li>Have used more higher end stuff like clinique etc but always return to this.</li>
      <li>Methol adds a bonus, and I also don&#x27;t mind using the original.</li>
      <li>Good gel with minimal foaming and a refreshing feeling whenever I use this to shave.</li>
      <li>super smooth shave.</li>
      <li>All while it lets me see where I&#x27;m shaving around my sideburns and gotee for clean lines.</li>
      <li>But by no means is this the product&#x27;s fault, so I&#x27;m giving it a full five stars.</li>
      <li>and I get a full 5oz.</li>
      <li>takes a bit more product than most other gels, but it protects way better.</li>
      <li>This gel provides a nice quick and precise way to shave versus white foamy products.  </li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon, I&#x27;ll def be back when I need some more!!</li>
      <li>if you shave with a straight blade, electric, or disposable cartridge razor you won&#x27;t believe what a close shave you get, zero drag and absolutely a comfort perfect shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beyond cooling and refreshing and more burning, especially around the more sensitive spots.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that when I applied it, it wasn&#x27;t a foamy mess and yet works great.  </li>
      <li>Great quality without the messy foam...</li>
      <li>King of Shaves has always been my go-to shaving gel, and this one is just as good as the other.</li>
      <li>I find it to be vastly superior to any of the other shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I now buy mine through Amazon which is so convenient and economical if you buy a four pack which I guarantee you&#x27;ll want to after your first tube.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good because you can see exactly where you&#x27;re shaving due to</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and not only does it provide a close, cool, smooth shave</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough, love this gel.</li>
      <li>For many years I tried different products that all seemed to work</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t do anything better than it&#x27;s lesser priced, gel counterparts.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the blue version.  </li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s ridiculously slick which is what you really need with an electric, but it lacks cushion (aka lather) which is also great for an electric since with an electric</li>
      <li>As a die hard we shaving fan for over decade - I&#x27;ve tried most top shelf creams and gels.</li>
      <li>I have used many different blade, shaving cream combinations and I really like how this gel feels.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I&#x27;ve used the King of Shaves gel for shaving my legs as long as it&#x27;s been around.  I never nic myself shaving when I use it and it gives a really smooth finish. I tried the womans&#x27; version they released a few years ago but it just wasn&#x27;t as good as the original men&#x27;s version. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 5 years and I like it. I can see better where I am shaving. Love the cooling menthol. Will never change shave gels. Their based in Europe but as of today they ship to the U.S.  Don&#x27;t think it will be permanent though.</li>
    <li> I remember I could buy King of Shaves at Walgreens, not anymore. I went to CVS, Target, grocery stores, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, nobody carries the best shaving gel around. Glad to get it online. This line with menthol keeps your face tingly and baby- butt smooth.</li>
    <li> Best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Even my girlfriend uses it for her legs! Leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Good gel with minimal foaming and a refreshing feeling whenever I use this to shave. Shame I cannot find it in my local stores, but the 4 pack has lasted me about a year now.</li>
    <li> super smooth shave. very mentholy. makes your face feel very cold and refreshed. takes a bit more product than most other gels, but it protects way better.</li>
    <li> I always find it best to use KOS Alpha Menthol cooling gel, coupled with other pre-shaving products to achieve the closest and maximum comfort during my shaves. No razor burns, no irritations, and I have very sensitive skin. Sadly, they stopped carrying this product in my local stores, and I was relieved to find it and at such a good deal on Amazon. There&#x27;s a pack of 6, that sells at a marginally lower cost. (3 or 4 cents per tube). Thanks Amazon, I&#x27;ll def be back when I need some more!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! So slick, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re shaving. Leaves my sensitive skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a benefit to this over Gillette shave gel.</li>
    <li> I used to use the blue one (not exactly sure what the difference is, I think it&#x27;s just minus the menthol/cooling effect), and after I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore I decided to look online and came across this. King of Shaves has always been my go-to shaving gel, and this one is just as good as the other. It&#x27;s good because you can see exactly where you&#x27;re shaving due to it being clear, and it also leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft afterwards. There really is no need for an aftershave if you use this product. However, I would recommend this for facial shaving only, as applying it elsewhere (hint hint: sensitive areas) will make it feel as if you are on fire. But by no means is this the product&#x27;s fault, so I&#x27;m giving it a full five stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has a beard and only shaves part of his face to keep it in shape, He loves this gel and takes it when we travel.</li>
    <li> Been using King Of shaves alphagel and oil for many years now and would never consider using anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best shave gel ever for the money. Have used more higher end stuff like clinique etc but always return to this. They stopped carying it at my local target so I ordered 3 at a time.</li>
    <li> Love this Alpha Gel with Cooling menthol, you can see where through to your skin for more timely and accurate shaving</li>
    <li> My father gave me a tube of RKS Alphagel about two and a half years ago because he had purchased a four pack. Usually, I throw whatever he gives me in a drawer and forget about it. Not this time -- and that was fortunate for me. The RKS Alphagel makes shaving a comfortable and invigorating experience. I use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor and together with Alphagel, I look forward to my daily shave each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a shot at RKS Alphagel. In your life, very few items of such modest expense will bring you such pleasure!</li>
    <li> This gel provides a nice quick and precise way to shave versus white foamy products.  It makes your skin feel great!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ll use.  I find it to be vastly superior to any of the other shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  I get a good lathering of the gel and never have any pain or razor burn.  You would barely need lotion afterward.</li>
    <li> I have used many different blade, shaving cream combinations and I really like how this gel feels.  The other folks commenting on this NOT lathering are 100% correct, I had my doubts but do not get any irritation or burn from this.  Plus the Menthol cooling is nice.  Be sure that if you are using this to shave your head (like me) to not get any in your eyes (like me) it burns like the fire of a 1000 suns.</li>
    <li> This the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  I like the fact that when I applied it, it wasn&#x27;t a foamy mess and yet works great.  Again note that this does not get foamy like the others.  Try It.</li>
    <li> best shave gel ever.  If you have never tried it, do it, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and not only does it provide a close, cool, smooth shave but I think he is more handsome.</li>
    <li> THE BEST SHAVING GEL OR CREAM ON THE MARKER. IT IS LIGHT ON THE FACE , NO PULLING NO STINGS NO PAIN.</li>
    <li> Very cold. Otherwise perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I was wasting SO much shaving cream with the fat foamy stuff. This stuff goes on virtually clear (small amount of foam) and lasts way longer.</li>
    <li> It works great. Fifty cent piece size of gel in right hand, transfer half to left hand, rub into wet face and then shave it off. No nicks or rough patches. Works better than any gel cream, shaving cream or shaving gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I hate shaving, but this product makes it more bearable.</li>
    <li> By far the best shaving gel out there.  It has the perfect amout of lubrication without needing a scrub to take it off.</li>
    <li> This produce is better than most of the products I used.  I will be using all of the tubes I purchased.  Other shaving gels that I purchased I threw them after 2 to 3 usages.</li>
    <li> It works very well on my sensitive skin, plus no foam so I can see where I&#x27;m shaving.  Excellent overall.</li>
    <li> Works OK for electric shaving in shower. But, if you want the very best shave in the shower with an electric shaver, get this - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X4JUYA/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review: http://www.amazon.com/Tend-Skin-Air-Shave-Gel/product-reviews/B000X4JUYA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_synop?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0&amp;sortBy&#x3D;bySubmissionDateDescending#R2NWPANBCRKAQ8</li>
    <li> Great quality without the messy foam... I love the smell</li>
    <li> Shave on; this stuff is great</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the blue version.  This one is even better -- zero irritation and leaves the face feeling cool, even with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I like the king of shaves line, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t prefer the strong menthol in this version.  It&#x27;s beyond cooling and refreshing and more burning, especially around the more sensitive spots.</li>
    <li> I use a multi-blade manual razor and have tried all types of shaving foams and gels.  I am not a big fan of foams or foaming gels in general because they seem too bulky on my face.  I tried several very expensive non-foaming gels that were adequate -- including Jack Black and others -- but I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.  Then I found this Remington gel.  The scent is great, the gel is a nice consistency, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I order several packs at a time so I always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> quite simply the best shave gel or foam on the market. With this gel , I never get razor burn, razor bumps, or nicks. All while it lets me see where I&#x27;m shaving around my sideburns and gotee for clean lines.</li>
    <li> My husband went to an shaving system and he loves the smooth glyde he gets from this gel. It&#x27;s also nice to pack on trips since it&#x27;s not a foam in a can that you don&#x27;t know how long it will last!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before with a wet/dry electric shaver.  I shave in the shower and this product works very well as a lubricant.</li>
    <li> My son bought this product and I tried it. It is excellent for close shaves. No irritation. Very good product</li>
    <li> Simply the best. This is the best shave gel out there. it is sad that it has not been marketed properly. It makes for a close shave and prevents nicks and cuts. is very good at helping to prevent razor bumps.</li>
    <li> This shave gel does not foam, so if you want lather this is not for you.  It is a gel that coats your skin that allows the razor to glide over your face. I think it is the best man&#x27;s shaving product on the market.  It is especially good with Shick Quattro razor blades as that blade has small vertical wires across the 4 blades that, I think, prevents the blades from gouging your skin.  The two products together are superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New comment: Recently had to switch to an electric razor.  Now using the new Norelco 3D Head Wet/Dry Electric Razor.  This gel, since it doesn&#x27;t foam, really works well with the electric wet/dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over a decade and this is the only shave gel that never gives me razor burn. Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I shave with a metal handled/Don Draper-era safety razor, since the blades are sooooo much cheaper than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; multi-bladed razors. But the handle gets slippery when wet, so I need a low-foaming gel that doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off constantly. This Remington gel fits the bill perfectly. A dollop of the gel on a wet face gives a smooth, close shave with no irritation and no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product!</li>
    <li> I like this for shaving the sensitive areas.  I really like the cooling of the menthol.  They used to have a spray, but I guess it has been long ago discontinued :(  It&#x27;s good stuff and a good value.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend KofS anyway, but I really like this shave cream. No foam. Cooling really helps with the whole shaving process. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> My son prefers this shave gel over others, but it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores.  It was easy and convenient to order it online, and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> Shaving has always been uncomfortable for me. For many years I tried different products that all seemed to work the same.&lt;br /&gt;King of Shaves, Alphagel with Menthol changed everything. finally I had a gel that both softened my hair and lubricated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough, love this gel.</li>
    <li> Great product! Also you can&#x27;t beat the price.continue with the product and the price! Feels very smooth and fresh! Love this Produt</li>
    <li> I use this with a wet/dry electric shaver, with very good results.  The shave is close and the nice menthol after shave feel is quite nice.  Discontinued by my local CVS drug store so it&#x27;s nice to find at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving a lot easier with a good razor.  You can feel the menthol when the shave is done.  A dime to a nickel size is all you need with this stuff.  I have using this gel for a few months now and I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Take my recommendation with a grain of salt, however, as I do not have a thick beard.  In fact, I only have to shave 2x/week.  But when I do. I use the King of Shaves.  This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s smooth...smoother than Derek Zoolander.  (OK, bad comparison, but you know what I mean)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a menthol fan.  I&#x27;ve long used King of Shaves/Alphagel but was unable to find it without the menthol.  Hands-down, King of Shaves/Alphagel is THE BEST--and frankly, I&#x27;ve tried almost all brands of shaving creams/gels/etc.  Nothing comes close!  Hopefully Remington/King of Shaves will bring back the non-menthol version--and soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about five years.  IF you can find it in a retail store it sells for about $6, so this bundle is a bargain.  You don&#x27;t use much of this at a time, so I figure this bundle should last nearly a year!!!</li>
    <li> SO hard to find in the store but excited that I found this for my husband online through Amazon! He loves this shave gel and was bummed when he thought that it was discontinued!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very slick. I seem to be getting a closer shave with less irritation, although the menthol does burn my eyes a little bit.</li>
    <li> Most guys that review this are probably reviewing it having used it with a blade, and it works great with a manual razor, but it really shines if you have a wet/dry electric razor like the Norelco 8000 or Panasonic Arc IV. First, it&#x27;s ridiculously slick which is what you really need with an electric, but it lacks cushion (aka lather) which is also great for an electric since with an electric the blades are already shielded behind a screen so lather actually makes the electric less efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best quality though is that the gel likes to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to your skin, used with a blade it simply gets squeegeed off, but an electric just kinda spreads it around so when you rinse your shaver your just adding more water and making it slicker, this means you only need one application for an entire electric shave. Conventional aerosol creams and gels have to be reapplied for every pass with an electric, making you go through them quickly, this product solves that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the menthol feels gooooooooood when you rinse your face with cold water at the end, leaves your skin soft to.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product some years back and refuse to use anything else since then. Backed by Remington Company this product is superb. If shaving has ever been uncomfortable for you, light beards and thin beards alike this this product will have your skin feeling like you never used a razor. I like the menthol but they have a few different types including a sensitive skin formula. Only problem is it&#x27;s not easy to find getting lost in the plethora of dozens of shave gels and foams. I&#x27;ve seen it at CVS, Walgreens and a few places. I now buy mine through Amazon which is so convenient and economical if you buy a four pack which I guarantee you&#x27;ll want to after your first tube.</li>
    <li> As a die hard we shaving fan for over decade - I&#x27;ve tried most top shelf creams and gels. What I like about King of Shaves is that his anti microbial ingredients like Methylparaben which is used in many skin creams and lotions - for healthy skin and to fight bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the reason I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane which uses a micro silicon in its formula the two deliver an almost equally close shave - be it blade or electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To you guys who have a wet/dry razor you probably already know creams and foams clog up the works. KOS doesn&#x27;t. If you consider the cost of a small tube of Hydroplane is around $20 and you can get this four pack of KOS for the price of a single tube - it&#x27;s a no brainier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a shaving brush with KOS regardless if you shave with a straight blade, electric, or disposable cartridge razor you won&#x27;t believe what a close shave you get, zero drag and absolutely a comfort perfect shave. This is because the bristles along with the shave gel or cream force every whisker to stand up - which allows for an incredibly close barber shop quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King Of Shaves also softens the whiskers which are made of Keratin, the softer the keratin the easier for you razor to mow it down. Simply an excellent product, with just the right touch of menthol and a great bargain to boot.</li>
    <li> My favorite gel for shaving with my Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver.  Methol adds a bonus, and I also don&#x27;t mind using the original.</li>
    <li> This gel gives a really close shave with little irritation. My husband uses it with a Mach3 razor. It also makes shaving around sideburns and goatees easier. He also likes the menthol which is not as common anymore in US shaving products. This has been difficult to find at the store, so we have to order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff a few yrs ago . It works great and I love it ! Way better than foam and I get a full 5oz. when I buy this in the squeeze tube as compared to a spray can .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s anything particularly wrong with the King of Shaves Alphagel...it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t do anything better than it&#x27;s lesser priced, gel counterparts. Which - for very sensitive skin - equates to painful shaving with a 3-4 blade manual, and not much in the moisturizing arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost conscious, Nivea&#x27;s sensitive skin offerings do an equivalent job for a bit less money, applies well (albeit not as even). If you&#x27;re willing to kick it up a bit, Neutrogena and Ahava blow the King of Shaves out of the shaving Game of Thrones. They also require a lot less product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this being said, I chalk up some of these sentiments to shaving with a manual, multiple blade device. These devices are  no where near as sharp as a single edge (safety razor), and tend to pull versus simply cut. Based on its thicker texture, I would presume the King of Shaves would fare better with a wet/dry electric and/or a single edge offering.</li>
    <li> Same as alpa sensitive... Dropped a star because the menthol is so mild as to not be worthy of the designation. Otherwise this is awesome stuff</li>
