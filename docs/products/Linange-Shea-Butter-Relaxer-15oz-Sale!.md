      <li>It was strong and straightened well.</li>
      <li>I really liked this relaxer at first and now, I feel like all they are doing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but what I like most is that the product is very gentle on hair</li>

      <li>My hair is fine</li>

      <li>First time using this product &amp; I was pleased.</li>
      <li>Good for your hair, but does not hold the relaxer in my hair for more than a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>If you are trying to get a bone straight look, it&#x27;s not going to happen with this relaxer, because it is very mild.</li>
      <li>I recommend the leave in conditioner does very well in latinas hair!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still giving this relaxer 3 stars because although I had to rinse quickly my hair was super straight.</li>
      <li>Left hair dry and incredibly underprocessed leading to breakage.</li>
      <li>Very little hair shedding, the process was easy to apply, my hair came out feeling very strong and not over processed...would strongly recommend this relaxer and will used again in the future...very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>After the relaxer my hair felt strong and soft.</li>
      <li>I did not have to worry about any hair damage; because it is so gentle and mild.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, it doesn&#x27;t itch during the application, it doesn&#x27;t burn either and leaves the hair so soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I actually checked the jar to make sure it didn&#x27;t say texturizer on it.</li>
      <li>I first used this relaxer at a Dominican hair salon, it&#x27;s been a staple since then.</li>
      <li>, if you get what I mean...Try it &amp; see for yourself ;)</li>
      <li>This made my hair have so much body!</li>
      <li>straight so still leaves enough body to move love it....</li>
      <li>If you obey the rules, you should not have any problems, it&#x27;s actually really gentle</li>
      <li>I was really worried my hair was gonna</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it still allows me to have the option of wearing my hair curly or straight and not just bone straight.</li>
      <li>its doesn&#x60;t make your hair straight 100% when i done</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Gently relaxed my hair.</li>
      <li>be careful and don&#x27;t leave on for more than 10 min.</li>
      <li>I thought this relaxer would be gentle</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for offering this relaxer through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really want bone straight results</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair very shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>Packaging was done nicely and my hair came out soft, thick &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been relaxing my hair for a short time, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but I really liked the Linange relaxer.</li>
      <li>Instantly I liked that the relaxer did not have a harsh chemical-type smell.  </li>
      <li>Linange was my third relaxer (so far, I&#x27;ve been touching up every 8 or 9 weeks)</li>
      <li>Better than the other products that i used</li>
      <li>The second relaxer I used was Revlon super and that worked well.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and straight but doesn&#x27;t look over-processed.  </li>
      <li>it was hard to make any style it might be good for female but</li>
      <li>Also, the Mizani didn&#x27;t leave my hair very straight (the stylist left it in about 15 minutes).</li>
      <li>Not harsh!</li>
      <li>My first relaxer was the regular strength Mizani and after 5 minutes it started to burn my scalp, even though I based it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally at 4a texture and this just loosened my ringlets and smoothed my roots.</li>
      <li>and so I had to revive it with my old faithful Mizani conditoner.</li>
      <li>It only started to burn at the end of the 30 minutes, and by that time I was ready to wash it out anyway.</li>
      <li>My hair is never limp or lifeless as I use it every 3-4 months.  </li>
      <li>It was soft and didnt look nor feel overprocessed.</li>

    <li> Amazing!! Gently relaxed my hair. I&#x27;m naturally at 4a texture and this just loosened my ringlets and smoothed my roots. My hair is so manageable now and doesn&#x27;t feel dry, weak or chemically processed!</li>
    <li> I have more hair products than a hair salon lol, but I have long think hair, I am ethnic and I must say all the Alter Ego line is fantastic, this relaxer I loved and  the only other relaxer on the same realm is the Salerm relaxer.  This one however, doesn&#x27;t make your hair bone straight so still leaves enough body to move love it....the deep conditioner when used with heat is great as well.  the fact that you use neutralizing conditioner and not shampoo was different but worked well.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Will tame those roots!</li>
    <li> i&#x60;m 26 years old male ...let me start with the good side for this relaxer, it does make your hair shiny , it has mild odor, doesn&#x60;t make your hair rough ,doesn&#x60;t full your hair with dandruff .the bad side its doesn&#x60;t make your hair straight 100% when i done i felt like i straighten my hair with Straightener not with a relaxer it was hard to make any style it might be good for female but not all of them also it start to burn my scalp after 10 minute of applying .</li>
    <li> I cut my hair after growing for the last one and half years and I cut my hair super short about 2 months ago. I typically wash my hair one to two times a week just to change up my hair style from curly to straight or vice versa. (I am african american with a splash of american indian, white  and german which makes my hair type sort of wierd.) In the past, relaxers do no last. I have used Just for Me, Olive Oil and Dr. Miracles. All have worked but only for a little while esepcially when I wear my hair short. I have been looking for a way to maintain my curly, wavy and thick at the root hair without damaging it allowing me to either wear my hair sraight or right my curls without any frizz. This product does just that. I tried it on Saturday was impressed with the products gentleness. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and it did not burn during application. I like the fact that it still allows me to have the option of wearing my hair curly or straight and not just bone straight. Great product for anyone with my hair type... Worth having in supply of beauty products!!! Will definitely buy again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this relaxer. It&#x27;s gentle, it doesn&#x27;t itch during the application, it doesn&#x27;t burn either and leaves the hair so soft and healthy. I have been using it for like 4 years now, and never had a problem with it, I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I tried this relaxer along with the neutralizer and mask. It was just okay for me. The smell of the relaxer cream was much milder than others I have used in the past. The cream is pretty thick. It did start to burn towards the last 5 minutes and I left it on for 18 minutes. (I base my scalp well every relaxer and I hadn&#x27;t scratched) My hair was not bone straight when I got done, it was straight, but with a little texture. So ladies wanting that texlaxed look may like this relaxer. After a few days, the newly relaxed hair felt kinda dry and so I had to revive it with my old faithful Mizani conditoner. The mask that comes with this did nothing for my hair. I think I will go back to Mizani after this one.</li>
    <li> if i buy this, what else will i have to but that is not included?</li>
    <li> I am highly disappointed with UglyNBeauty as I placed an order for an item on February 15th and here it is the 22nd and I had to contact THEM to find out the status of my order.  It wasn&#x27;t until I contacted them (1 week after I placed my order) that I was informed that the item that I ordered was out of stock and that my order was in the process of being canceled.  You couldn&#x27;t pay me to do business with such an unprofessional \\&quot;business/seller\\&quot; ever again.</li>
    <li> Instantly I liked that the relaxer did not have a harsh chemical-type smell.  My scalp did not start to tingle until about 20 or so minutes after application.  I use my relaxers just to loosen my curl a little bit, so I really do not smooth my hair I only apply the relaxer, wait a little bit, and rinse it out.  The relaxer gave the manageability I was looking for!  My hair was extremely soft and very healthy after I did protein conditioner, neutralize, moisturizing shampoo, deep condition, and a few other things I use to get my finished style for relaxer day.  I am glad to say that this will be my relaxer from now on!</li>
    <li> I know that this is a great relaxer, having had it applied in the salon. I wanted to do my own hair this time, and ordered it on Amazon. Amazon is reliable; however these 3rd party sellers they use are often unprofessional, and offer no customer service, as in this case. I ordered this 4 weeks ago, and still have not received it yet. Order from this company at your own risk. But, just to be clear, the product is awesome, just not the seller.</li>
    <li> I am blavk/American and my hair is 3b and using this perm leaves my hair silky and doesn&#x27;t remove my curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I went to a hairdresser one day and she used this product in my hair...and I swear until I find something better I will never, ever use another perm product other than Linange Shea Butter Relaxer... I love it, I love it, I love it..Thee End</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I think next time I will order with the mask and conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Is awesome hair  products</li>
    <li> I have been using this relaxer for the last 6 months after visiting my Dominican sisters. This product is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn and it leaves your hair soft.</li>
    <li> I was trying to choose between the relaxer and Mizani ButterBlends to texlax (texturize) my hair. It left my hair very underprocessed even though I did a lot of smoothing and left it on for like 30 minutes (I have type 4a hair). However, that was the look I was going for. If you are trying to get a bone straight look, it&#x27;s not going to happen with this relaxer, because it is very mild. After the relaxer my hair felt strong and soft. It didn&#x27;t have the limp, &amp;#34;just relaxed&amp;#34; look. I relaxed 12 weeks ago, and I still haven&#x27;t had any breakage. I didn&#x27;t use the Linange neutralizing conditioner (I just used my normal neutralizing shampoo), but I will next time so I can see if the results are any different. I seriously had very little burning with this relaxer. It only started to burn at the end of the 30 minutes, and by that time I was ready to wash it out anyway. I recommend this relaxer for anyone trying to texlax (or texturize) their hair.</li>
    <li> Product did not burn my scalp; it completely staightened my hair and the smell was pleasant. My hair was soft and bouncy. Will definaty purchase again!</li>
    <li> Left hair dry and incredibly underprocessed leading to breakage. Wanted something that would texturize but add moisture. This seemed to remove moisture. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I like it. Better than the other products that i used</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to eliminate a lot of chemicals in my hair. It straightend my hair a little, but the results didn&#x27;t last. This is not a product for black people unless they have thin/fine hair.</li>
    <li> I must say that I am very pleased with the results of this relaxer.  I purchased the relaxer online and I took it with me to the salon.  I did not have to worry about any hair damage; because it is so gentle and mild.  There was no burning or tingling at all; and my hair was not in the least bit overprocessed.  My hair is beautiful, shiny, healthy, and stronger after the use of this relaxer.  I have received several compliments; and I plan to re-order in a couple of days as a matter of fact.  I am even thinking about looking into the texturizer version of it.  Angela</li>
    <li> Did not work for my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I read about this on a relaxed hair blog and decided to try it out. I used it last week, just about 6 months after my last relaxer. I burn very easily, but I didn&#x27;t think about putting anything on my scalp till about 3/4 of the way through. I only burned along my hairline, which the last couple of stylists I went to say was because my scalp is dry in those areas. So I did burn even through the restructuring mask, but, I didn&#x27;t have ANY scabs, which is amazing to me. It smells great, and, I was worried seeing I still had some waves with the neutralizing conditioner, but once I started to wash the restructuring mask out, my hair was pretty much bone straight, and I&#x27;m very happy. I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> First time using this product &amp; I was pleased. Packaging was done nicely and my hair came out soft, thick &amp; smooth. I believe I have 4b-c type hair. I relaxed after a 6month stretch. No shedding or burns like Olive Oil Lye Relaxer would do to me. I did experience burning but it was more of a little tingling sensation, nothing serious &amp; I had no burns. I am please to use this as my 1 &amp; only relaxer choice. I went to the salon with this relaxer &amp; had my hair blow dried, pressed &amp; flat iron. My hair has body, no thinning &amp; I am really pleased. Hope my review helps anyone who&#x27;s contemplating on buying it. Oh &amp; the smell was bleh it wasn&#x27;t peaches &amp; roses to me but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical scent compared to Olive Oil Lye Relaxer, if you get what I mean...Try it &amp; see for yourself ;)</li>
    <li> Used this after an 11 1/2 wk. stretch..let me tell you that this was the best relaxer that I have ever used. Very little hair shedding, the process was easy to apply, my hair came out feeling very strong and not over processed...would strongly recommend this relaxer and will used again in the future...very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong.........very very strong.  I would only use this on extremely coarse hair.  Otherwise, you might end up bald.  SERIOUSLY!!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent I love the product it really work, good job to does who make the excellen product.</li>
    <li> true to reviews this is a no problems relaxer,I think I may have left the product on too long but I did a few Amla conditioners,after a few days my hair is lovely and soft,still is-would buy again</li>
    <li> This made my hair have so much body! It was soft and didnt look nor feel overprocessed. This is my new perm that I will only use now! It also gave me some thickness. My hair usually gets bone straight with a perm and its very thin. But with one use of this it has my hair thicker</li>
    <li> I usually use this relaxer but decided to work out the day before getting a touch up although I knew not to. I never had issues with Linange&#x27;s Relaxer but this time my scalped burned quite a bit although my hair turned out great. I guess I thought I could handle the irritation. If you obey the rules, you should not have any problems, it&#x27;s actually really gentle and you should not experience breakage or anything. As a side note, I do not use the accompanying Neutralizing Conditoner, I use another neutralizing shampoo and Alfaparf&#x27;s Midollo di Bamboo line for maintenance. I have extremely fine hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Not harsh!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t even smell like relaxer can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old &amp; have used several types of relaxers.  My hair is thin &amp; has been breaking off, so I knew it was time to try something new.  This Shea Butter Relaxer has to be the very best I have ever tried.  Although it is a bit pricey, the 15 oz jar will last for at least 3 touch-ups.  It leaves my hair soft &amp; the best part is, my hair is not breaking off.  To me with thinning hair, this is unbelievable.  I am telling all my friends &amp; family about this product.  I only wish I had known about it sooner.  Thank you so much for offering this relaxer through Amazon.  I would have never known about it.</li>
    <li> I just tried this relaxer for the first time and it is WONDERFUL! I had been scratching my head the night before which is a great big no no when you are getting a touch up the next day, but this relaxer didn&#x27;t even burn my scalp.  My hair is soft and straight but doesn&#x27;t look over-processed.  This product can be used as a texturizer as well, just don&#x27;t leave it on as long as you would a perm.  I strongly urge everyone to try this product...it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I loved this lineage  texturizer.My hair is less painful, and it is full. My hair even grew longer.This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Good for your hair, but does not hold the relaxer in my hair for more than a few weeks.  Very gentle on hair, good for those with fine color treated hair.  Help me grow my hair and keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> The good:  It takes a long time before you burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  I only found out the above after having to leave in on for almost an HOUR, while doing a corrective to re-process my hair 5 wks after it failed to straighten it. Still, after leaving it on for so long, I became concerned and washed it out, only to find my barely still very poofy and unstraightened.  I actually checked the jar to make sure it didn&#x27;t say texturizer on it. But, even then it would have been too weak to even qualify as a texturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed. I really liked this relaxer at first and now, I feel like all they are doing is selling cream mixed with petroleum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been relaxing my hair for a short time, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but I really liked the Linange relaxer. My hair is very thick and coarse, probably 4c, kind of wiry. My first relaxer was the regular strength Mizani and after 5 minutes it started to burn my scalp, even though I based it. Also, the Mizani didn&#x27;t leave my hair very straight (the stylist left it in about 15 minutes). It was more like a texturizer. The second relaxer I used was Revlon super and that worked well. It was strong and straightened well. (I left it on about 15 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Linange was my third relaxer (so far, I&#x27;ve been touching up every 8 or 9 weeks) and I like that one the best so far. It didn&#x27;t smell bad and it didn&#x27;t burn at all for a long time. My stylist left it on pretty long - maybe 25 minutes, which was actually too long, but because it didn&#x27;t burn, I lost track of time. Leaving it in that long probably damaged my hair - I have some breakage, but my hair is short and I can just trim it. I would use it again, just for less time.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this relaxer after reading all the great reviews it got but I was deceived! I wanted to try it because my scalp always burns with perms then I have to hurry in rinse it out which causes my hair to not be straightened. I thought this relaxer would be gentle but it burned 5 min after I started the smoothing process. I was really worried my hair was gonna&lt;br /&gt;Come out in clumps! Thank God it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m still giving this relaxer 3 stars because although I had to rinse quickly my hair was super straight. My hair is fine so I didn&#x27;t really want bone straight results but that&#x27;s what I got. I feel this relaxer probably works best on thicker hair if you have fine hair like me be careful and don&#x27;t leave on for more than 10 min.</li>
    <li> Dislike that the last vendor did was careless packaging and when arrived to me was all spilled. I pay twenty dollars for half of the product. I did complain to the vendor and I did not heard not even a I am sorry!!! Never again. This product is amazing!! I recommend the leave in conditioner does very well in latinas hair!! God bless!!</li>
    <li> I first used this relaxer at a Dominican hair salon, it&#x27;s been a staple since then. Can&#x27;t go back. It doesn&#x27;t burn, relaxes fast even with my coarse African hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also grows my hair too.</li>
    <li> i love it it leaves my hair very shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> Made my hair real most during processing. I will be using it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but what I like most is that the product is very gentle on hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this relaxer for 10 years since I stopped fully relaxing my hair. It&#x27;s not too harsh and minimally relaxes my texture. My hair is never limp or lifeless as I use it every 3-4 months.  It&#x27;s gentle and sodium hydoxide is listed behind shea butter as the ingredients so If you&#x27;re looking for a bone-straight relaxer then this would likely disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil Petrolatum, Ceteraryl Alcohol, Propylene Glyco, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysobate 60, Laneth-15, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG (150) Stearate, Steareth 20, PEG (60), Lanolin, Hydroxypropy Itrimonium, Vegetable Protein, Fragrance)</li>
