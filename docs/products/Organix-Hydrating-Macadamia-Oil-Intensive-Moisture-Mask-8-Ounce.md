      <li>maybe a tad too sweet for my preference, but good.</li>
      <li>I heard such awesome things about the hair mask that I had to try it out.</li>

      <li>Its okay, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>After just one use, I was able to see and feel the difference.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my hair very soft and when I curl it, the curls are defined beautifully, and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>It is nice to use before you have a special event and want your hair to be in better shape.</li>
      <li>I love it, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
      <li>I use other products, but OGX has proven to be an excellent intensive moisture mask for the hair, which has now become my favorite treatment.</li>
      <li>After I washed it out, my hair was so soft, so shiny, smelled so amazing that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
      <li>The smell is neither strong nor flowery; two additional benefits.</li>
      <li>My hair has NEVER felt this amazing before and for anyone who wants silky smooth hair..</li>
      <li>I have a smooth hair but</li>
      <li>Not sleek and smooth at all,</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t smooth it out at all.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair smooth and manageable even in humid weather</li>
      <li>Smoothed hair and helped the frizzies, but it didn&#x27;t leave that really smooth, tangle free feeling when washing out.</li>
      <li>In general I think it&#x27;s a good product and is defiantly worth your money!</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft and so amazing.</li>
      <li>I really thought this was better.</li>
      <li>As you age, hair texture changes, particularly in the rougher sense if you&#x27;ve been coloring your hair for many years.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take me an hour to straighten my hair any more and even if I blow dry it (which I can avoid most of the time, but sometimes....</li>
      <li>My hair was soft as a cotton ball &amp; all those little gray hairs were laying as perfectly as the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>but it was definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I have bleached my hair so many times I&#x27;m surprised I still have any.</li>
      <li>THIS MADE MY HAIR SO HEALTHY AND SOFT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the only one that really makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive scalp &amp; can break out easily from products but this mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
      <li>I wish it smelled a bit better though, because Organix usually has such great smelling products.</li>
      <li>so I only need to leave it for 3-5 mins if I leave it more</li>
      <li>It did exactly what I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>exactly what my damaged hair needed.</li>
      <li>I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize any more than my daily conditioner.</li>
      <li>I just finished my last hair mask and decided to try this one instead to see if it would work better.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make it super soft (that&#x27;d be a miracle)</li>
      <li>Within a week you can tell such a huge difference in your hair.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t really deliver.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the 6 bucks as much.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Made my hair very rubbery and I couldn&#x27;t get it through my ends at all.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works..</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing at all.  </li>
      <li>But It does not seem to condition as much as I would like, I still had some split ends even after weeks of using it about 1-2 times a week.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in hair health</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a conditioner to undo tangles and what not, but really just to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; out your hair and make it feel hydrated.</li>
      <li>you have to use so much of it to get through hair.</li>
      <li>I used this twice in one day- once for 25 minutes, the next time for about 35-and my hair was much more manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian and have long straight, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have salt &amp; pepper dark brown hair where the &#x27;salt&#x27; seems to not want to lay with the rest of my hair, but rather; it  tends to stick up, making it more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest buying OGX.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice mask, not overly heavy, but definitely made my hair much softer after my last highlights sort of stripped my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very damaged hair &amp; it makes it feel SO soft.</li>
      <li>i normally am a fan of the shea butter</li>
      <li>if you have long hair like I do, you&#x27;ll go through it quickly.</li>
      <li>and I live in arizona which doesnt help.</li>
      <li>my very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Once washed out it made my hair very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I used a bit for a deep condition while I sat under a hooded dryer, it came out okay, but I had to mix it with other products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture of the product is nice: very thick, like a pudding.</li>
      <li>better off just getting the regular conditioner and leaving it in for a little longer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works amazing I love what it&#x27;s done to my hair!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do miracles, but it did the job. I assumed the jar would be much bigger, but it was pretty small.</li>
    <li> Smoothed hair and helped the frizzies, but it didn&#x27;t leave that really smooth, tangle free feeling when washing out. Its okay, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have dry damage hair and since using this product, my  hair has become so much softer and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s just a typical hair mask. Didn&#x27;t even made my hair silky after use.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what I was hoping it would. If you have dry hair this product mosturizes your hair.</li>
    <li> Product is very thick, similar to butter which is left out on the counter. The smell is neither strong nor flowery; two additional benefits. I have salt &amp; pepper dark brown hair where the &#x27;salt&#x27; seems to not want to lay with the rest of my hair, but rather; it  tends to stick up, making it more noticeable. After receiving product, I washed my hair &amp; applied a dollop of this mask to my hair. I left it in while eating my supper &amp; then rinsed it out. My hair was soft as a cotton ball &amp; all those little gray hairs were laying as perfectly as the rest of my hair. I have a sensitive scalp &amp; can break out easily from products but this mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have bleached my hair so many times I&#x27;m surprised I still have any. I bought this to hopefully soften my straw hair before I dye it again. I used this twice in one day- once for 25 minutes, the next time for about 35-and my hair was much more manageable and soft. It was a remarkable improvement. It didn&#x27;t make it super soft (that&#x27;d be a miracle) but it was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I just finished my last hair mask and decided to try this one instead to see if it would work better. I use the keratin shampoo, coconut oil conditioner and keratin shimmer oil in conjunction with this mask and now my once frizzy, uncontrollable and unhealthy hair has been completely transformed. It doesn&#x27;t take me an hour to straighten my hair any more and even if I blow dry it (which I can avoid most of the time, but sometimes....a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do) my hair is manageable. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with thin but frizzy hair that has untold damage!</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry hair and I live in arizona which doesnt help. I put it on and left it 20 minutes under a shower cap and after the washing it out, I could already feel that it was a bit softer, like it didn&#x27;t just flap against my back and feel like needles like split ended wet hair usually does. After I blow dried it with cold air, my hair was so soft. I loved it. I wish it smelled a bit better though, because Organix usually has such great smelling products. It doesnt really smell like anything, but it&#x27;s still wonderful.</li>
    <li> just received this today, and it smells wonderful. i normally am a fan of the shea butter one but i think i will be buying this one on a regular basis as well. this conditioner smells even sweeter than the shea butter one, and hopefully it does as good of job moisturizing my hair. i love the semi-thick texture of the product because i know that my hair will be getting all the nutrients it needs.</li>
    <li> The best hair mask. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the only one that really makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like it but can&#x27;t say I love it.Left my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I use this once or twice a week, depending on if I need an extra boost of moisture for my hair or not. The smell is amazing, as with al OGX products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this.  I don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing at all.  I&#x27;ve tried using this several ways.... have kept it on hair under shower cap, wrapped in warm towel for about 25 minutes.  This STILL didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;moisture mask&amp;#34; left my hair tangled and with some knots in hair.  Not sleek and smooth at all, and I even left some product in during the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t work with my hair - not helpful, not effective at all.</li>
    <li> I love how it kept my hair conditioned for days and the smell is really nice. Only down side is if you have long hair like I do, you&#x27;ll go through it quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this deep conditioning mask. It works very nicely. I have really long hair and used 1/2 the container. It is nice to use before you have a special event and want your hair to be in better shape.</li>
    <li> Gives me a nice smooth condition without making my hair oily or sticky. I feel like it has helped my hair feel softer at the tips and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels nice in my hair. But It does not seem to condition as much as I would like, I still had some split ends even after weeks of using it about 1-2 times a week.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair with a dry sensation, and it tangles a lot. I really thought this was better.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mask, not overly heavy, but definitely made my hair much softer after my last highlights sort of stripped my hair. The best part of this product is the smell! It smells like warm, delicious cookies!! And makes your hands softer after applying it.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair feeling healthy. It&#x27;s not a conditioner to undo tangles and what not, but really just to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; out your hair and make it feel hydrated.</li>
    <li> I heard such awesome things about the hair mask that I had to try it out. Instead of leaving it in for a few minutes like directed, I had the product in for over 30 minutes. After I washed it out, my hair was so soft, so shiny, smelled so amazing that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
    <li> After just one use, I was able to see and feel the difference. I will continue to use and tell everyone about it</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair (it&#x27;s curly) and I wanted to try something to give it some moisture. I saw this on pinterest and they were raving about it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It definitely did not add extra moisture to my hair... It added less that my regular conditioner in fact. It did smell good though.. haha. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product left My hair feeling silky and sleek without a&#x27;build-up&#x27; feel. I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this for the price but I lucked out and found it for 2bucks at my local dollar store. Now, that I know it works for me I wouldn&#x27;t mind the 6 bucks as much. Smells good...maybe a tad too sweet for my preference, but good. 5 stars for a smaller price tag and a calmer sweetness. Note: my hair is on the thicker side of thin, long, light brown and straight/slight wave.</li>
    <li> Compared to the moisture mask I used before (from Syoss), this one is just so-so. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad but it didn&#x27;t impress me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing effect is just so-so. My hairs tend to be dry so I will explore more moisturizing products.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I score it usually when its on sale for around 5 dollars. I have really long hair, so it doesn&#x27;t last me a super long time, but I only apply it once a week or so. It makes my hair very soft and when I curl it, the curls are defined beautifully, and not frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh the hair down or make it oily.</li>
    <li> I like the OGX argon oil mask better, but this still works. The consistency is a little thicker  than the other OGX masks I have tried.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference smells bad</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.. My hair is frizzy and has a lot of split ends.. After one use, my hair looked totally different.</li>
    <li> I have followed the directions, and also exceeded the time and left it in my hair for a couple of hours.  I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize any more than my daily conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have a curly and dry hair, I brought this products because I read a lot of reviews. But I am  disappointed this is not watch it.... Disappointed I will never buy the same product again.</li>
    <li> I have a curly, frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products from the OGX line and this has got to be my least favourite of all. Opening the product the scent was strange - almost like a men&#x27;s cologne. The texture of the product is nice: very thick, like a pudding. I applied it as a deep conditioner (20 mins. with my hair in a deep conditioning cap). Immedialtely after I rinsed it out my hair felt frizzy and strawlike. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells really good and it makes my hair smooth and shiny! Just make sure you understand your hair fist,  I have a smooth hair but Lil bit dry so I only need to leave it for 3-5 mins if I leave it more it makes my hair greasy! In general I think it&#x27;s a good product and is defiantly worth your money!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel amazing. I have very damaged hair &amp; it makes it feel SO soft.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft. I definitely recommend leaving it in for about 10 minutes so it can really moisturize your hair.</li>
    <li> I have super long, thick, frizzy hair, and when I tried this line of products out I had hope! I always leave it on way longer than it says, at least 15-20 minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think i will buy again.  better off just getting the regular conditioner and leaving it in for a little longer.  the consistency is like regular conditioners. didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in hair health and i used consistently once a week for a few months.  you have to use so much of it to get through hair. waste of money</li>
    <li> THIS MADE MY HAIR SO HEALTHY AND SOFT</li>
    <li> exactly what my damaged hair needed. I swear by moisture masks, and this one smells amazing and works amazing! must buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird. When I put it on my hair, it feels so silky, moist, it seperates my curls, and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;A few minutes later, when it&#x27;s time to rinse out, my hair like soaks it up and it dry and back to phase one.&lt;br /&gt;This happened the three times I&#x27;ve used it. I used a bit for a deep condition while I sat under a hooded dryer, it came out okay, but I had to mix it with other products.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is natural 4a-b hair, which could be part of the problem. I need really deep thick penetrating conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even like it for a rinse out or co-wash conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product will change your life and your hair! I use this about every other time I shower and WOW! The instant difference in my hair is unbelievable! Not only does this make your hair smell like heaven but it is like silk. I also use this product with the OGX Keratin Shampoo. My hair has NEVER felt this amazing before and for anyone who wants silky smooth hair.. I highly suggest buying OGX. Within a week you can tell such a huge difference in your hair. DEF will be rebuying this product!</li>
    <li> As you age, hair texture changes, particularly in the rougher sense if you&#x27;ve been coloring your hair for many years. I use other products, but OGX has proven to be an excellent intensive moisture mask for the hair, which has now become my favorite treatment. It is also a bonus that this company does not test on animals - which satisfies the animal activists that we all are in this household.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and have long straight, fine hair.  I had high hopes for this product but unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t even use it.  It is leathery making my hair stiff and unmanageable.  Right after I put it on in the shower my hair felt stiff and tangled, feeling like a big chunk of leather. it didn&#x27;t smooth it out at all.  I had to wash it out and use my Purology conditioner to get my hair conditioned. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged, frizzy or hard to manage naturally, so I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work.  I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Made my hair my very soft and silky. My hair is naturally curly and dry and frizzy so it&#x27;s hard to find products that actually work well for it. When I found this I was kinda worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work cause I have tried other products in the OGX line and they didn&#x27;t work. When I got this product I immediately put it in my hair and noticed even while rubbing it in my hair was softer. Once washed out it made my hair very soft and silky. I could run my fingers through my hair. My only complaint with this product is that it was kinda watered down. It wasn&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be. Otherwise this product is wonderful and will be buying again. Would recommend for dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very rubbery and I couldn&#x27;t get it through my ends at all. Not too good, wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and use this often on my ends when they seem too dry. Works wonders and leaves my hair looking healthy :)</li>
    <li> I use this product on my transitioning 3c/4a hair. I love it, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells great. But the jar is very small!! I only get about 2 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> This is not about the seller it&#x27;s about the product. I have been using this for 2 weeks and my ends look more horrible now than they did when I started. I had to go to the drug store to get something else to try.</li>
    <li> Great hair mask. Makes hair smooth and manageable even in humid weather</li>
    <li> Omg! I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I have relaxed African American hair and I have been struggling to find a deep conditioner that will do the trick! Well this is it! I simply wet my hair a little and generously apply the DC to my hair. Then I put a shower cap on my head and a towel. I left in the DC overnight (I also just gone under the dryer for 20 mins) then washed it out. My hair was so soft and so amazing. And this product smells so good!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped on the ogx bandwagon after a friend recommended it and I haven&#x27;t looked back. I also have the biotin&amp;collgen, coconut milik, moraccan argan oil and  and the keratin oil conditioners. Love this brand.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this. I have very dry, curly hair and I was hoping that this hair mask would help maintain my unruly curls but it didn&#x27;t really deliver. It does smell good though!</li>
