### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best cream I had ever used for hand eczema.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try it because it was rated as one of the best products for eczema and because of reviews that said it was a miracle cream and that redness disappeared overnight.</li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>I bought some Aveeno eczema cream instead and saw great improvement.</li>
      <li>This cream may be great if you don&#x27;t have this sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I even used it on myself and good lord my alligator looking</li>
      <li>I would say I gave it a fair run.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>good product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>This cream is not itchy, is odorless and leaves a really nice barrier to contain the moisture.</li>
      <li>She said she liked how it feels on her skin,</li>
      <li>kind of a no-brainer between the two when you think about it.  </li>
      <li>very good it very moisturing.</li>
      <li>So far it is the best non prescription cream we&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>It helps exzama and is worthwhile buying.</li>
      <li>Both of these products gave me better relief than Exzaderm.</li>
      <li>However, I am glad that it does help some people.</li>
      <li>But keeping it on spreads it more and more.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend anyone who have problems with eczema:)</li>
      <li>It is in most shampoos/conditioners, some baby wipes and most liquid soaps.</li>
      <li>I found that the aquaphor multi purpose ointment worked better on my infant at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>There is no one product that works the best for everyone and you have to try various products to find what works for you.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have ordered this product more than once and will continue to order it for the relief it brings for the ecxema.</li>
      <li>Have tried everything from the most potent steroid cream to the mildest over the counter steroid cream along with all the over the counter skin lotions.  </li>
      <li>Better than Cetaphil &amp; Eucerin.</li>
      <li>but once I appled the cream she slept much better.</li>
      <li>greatest over-the-counter eczema remedy, nothing could be further from the truth.  </li>
      <li>so I have tried many things.</li>
      <li>great product for babies , a must have for those new rashes that appear safe and non scented alway check with your doctor</li>
      <li>I get vesicles with my eczema so letting it dry out has been the best thing for me since diagnosed 15 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I have found out though that Eucerin intensive care lotion does it better, and the Eucerin is quite inexpensive and available at Kroger&#x27;s store.</li>
      <li>It will mitigate the situation and very mild.</li>
      <li>I strongly encourage those seeking relief to try...</li>
      <li>5 days strong and no peep of the eczema returning, and no redness anywhere.</li>
      <li>so if you are looking for something to clear up eczema breakouts, save your money, if you want a good gentle lotion it works pretty good for that.</li>
      <li>the best i&#x27;ve found so far is Walgreen&#x27;s generic brand of &amp;#34;Maximum Strength Hydrocortisone Cream USP 1% with Aloe&amp;#34; at a quarter of the cost.  </li>
      <li>It surprisingly works better that other &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; products I have tried.</li>
      <li>with Aveeno or Eucerin moisturizing soap helps.&lt;br /&gt;Applying moisturizing lotion right after showering helps.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing gloves at night is a must!  </li>
      <li>It is a better product, but I need so much of it for the skin area I need to cover that the price becomes exorbinate.</li>
      <li>This was our last attempt at treating the exzema on our own before having her see a Dr.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth trying.  </li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s well worth the price as it works and helps heal the skin.  </li>
      <li>The product works very well, when my eczema flairs up, I apply the cream as directed, it clears fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>We put it on hot spots and after bathing for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It takes a little longer to heal but way better than a steroid cream without the thinning of skin which makes eczeMA come back more easily.</li>
      <li>Using less potent steroid creams  (over the counter 1% hydrocortisone) more frequently is a healthier and cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The over the counter moisturizing lotions</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and started using pure coconut oil and covered it with aquaphor</li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving this a try it really helped us out!</li>
      <li>My son, who is 12, is VERY picky and usually doesn&#x27;t like anything I put on his skin, but he liked this cream.</li>
      <li>Suggest applying early at first signs of Eczema.</li>
      <li>Eczema was very severe on a large area of leg, this is improved but will take some time to clear up which is why 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I would say the main issue with Exzaderm is 1/4 the size for 3x</li>
      <li>I Tried many other remedies to help my 3 year old with her eczema.</li>
      <li>I have bought (wasted money on) many products to help my daughter and granddaughter fight ecxema.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It may not solve your problem right away (I doubt if there are any given I have tried and paid so much on different types of skin products).</li>
      <li>I have used Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream in the past with reasonable results, but wanted to use a more natural solution.....</li>
      <li>so glad i did, after finishing the first few treatments i noticed a big difference.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m about to try the the new Eucerin &#x27;Profressional Repair&#x27;.)</li>
      <li>I can only tell you if you are buying this product because you think it may be more natural than other over the counter products, think again.  </li>
      <li>This is not a bad product, but I have gotten similar results from other products that are much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>It helped, but it didn&#x27;t clear it up by any means.  </li>
      <li>helping clear up my eczema rash</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my baby who has sensitive skin and baby eczema.</li>
      <li>You would think that it is an all natural product by going to the product website or by reading reviews on line.  </li>
      <li>Worked very well on moderately severe area on arm within a week it was gone.</li>
      <li>My 5 month old son has been having bouts with eczema since he was born.  </li>
      <li>My 3 year old daughter has eczema on her face</li>
      <li>I bought this product directly from the Exzaderm Web site.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for changing the ingredients unless this is another company using the same name and the same label!</li>
      <li>The only thing that would clear it up was using hydrocortisone ointment.  </li>
      <li>first mistake I made was applying very potent steroid creams that made my skin thin and delicate with repeated use.  </li>
      <li>When I started using this product twice a day, after about 2 weeks,  it completely healed her skin and helped prevent it from coming back.</li>
      <li>My hands are the worse and also the most visible.  </li>
      <li>She will always have issues with her skin especially in the fall/winter season but this will definitely help it, naturally!</li>
      <li>I used this cream a few times the first day on all of the spots that have been inflammed.</li>
      <li>The cause is unknown and what clears it up for one child may not work on another, but it is worth it to try anything until you figure it out for your little one.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t clear up the bumps and rough spots.</li>

<li> The ingredients in the past helped my daughter&#x27;s skin but they have changed all ingredients and added Emu Oil which she is HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO!</li>
<li> Goes on nice &amp; if the breakout is not too bad, it can alleviate some of the dryness.  </li>
<li> My daughter said she wouldn&#x27;t care what it cost as long as it worked.  </li>

<li> It does not get rid of the excema, just helps her feel less dry.  </li>
<li> The extreme eczema itch was relieved but a physician&#x27;s RX creme healed the eczema caused from a wool sweater.</li>
<li> winter dry skin looked 16 again!!!</li>
<li> It seemed to work at first, but within 2 days of use my daughters skin was worse with the red itchy skin behind her knees and backs of her legs.  </li>
<li> My son has really bad scabby, red eczema on his ankles and inner elbows and with the use of this cream and using velcro ace bandages over the cream every night his eczema cleared up almost completely within 2 months.</li>
<li> The cream has a bit of a weird texture but it does lock in moisture which really helps with eczema.</li>
<li> It made his skin soft and didn&#x27;t seem to make it any worse...</li>
<li> most annoying.  </li>
<li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product to at least give it a try!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried raw, organic shea cream and butter, every other conventional cream and ointment on the market, vaseline (reluctantly) and</li>
<li> I could literally see a difference in less then a day.  </li>
<li> But not as much as changing my diet and cutting out gluten and other suspect ingredients....</li>
<li> and it seems to be working at least as well if not better than the commercial hand lotions.  </li>
<li> We&#x27;ve tried all the over the counter rememdies we can think of with little to no results.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quite expensive, but the jar is almost empty, so I would advise you to try one, as I did!</li>
    <li> did not to nothing for me</li>
    <li> I have eczema (dermatologist diagnosed).  Have tried everything from the most potent steroid cream to the mildest over the counter steroid cream along with all the over the counter skin lotions.  My hands are the worse and also the most visible.  There is no one product that works the best for everyone and you have to try various products to find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;The first mistake I made was applying very potent steroid creams that made my skin thin and delicate with repeated use.  Using less potent steroid creams  (over the counter 1% hydrocortisone) more frequently is a healthier and cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The over the counter moisturizing lotions all seem about the same to me but recently I pulled out a jar of Emurex (made from Emu oil) and it seems to be working at least as well if not better than the commercial hand lotions.  It also seems like switching lotion brands every couple months makes a diffierence (maybe a placebo effect but as long as it works I&#x27;ll take it!).&lt;br /&gt;Showering with Aveeno or Eucerin moisturizing soap helps.&lt;br /&gt;Applying moisturizing lotion right after showering helps.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing gloves at night is a must!  Scratching for 5-10 seconds nullifies weeks of healing for me.</li>
    <li> The cream has a bit of a weird texture but it does lock in moisture which really helps with eczema. Good product!</li>
    <li> I have reoccurring skin rashes caused by my allergies. Out of curiosity I gave this a try. It surprisingly works better that other &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; products I have tried. The trick is to not apply it generously. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This product will make your skin retain moisture, and so lessen the eczema itchy red bumps from forming on your skin.  I have found out though that Eucerin intensive care lotion does it better, and the Eucerin is quite inexpensive and available at Kroger&#x27;s store.</li>
    <li> too thick and sticky feeling</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t help my son&#x27;s skin like I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I bought this product directly from the Exzaderm Web site. I decided to try it because it was rated as one of the best products for eczema and because of reviews that said it was a miracle cream and that redness disappeared overnight. I have had eczema on my hands since I was a teenager so I have tried many things. I used 1 1/2 jars of this and it did nothing for my eczema. I found it to be very thick and hard to massage into my hands. If you have severe eczema, don&#x27;t expect miracles. I am going to continue using the steroid cream that my dermatologist prescribed. I also like Neutrogena Hand Cream and Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturing Cream. Both of these products gave me better relief than Exzaderm. However, I am glad that it does help some people.</li>
    <li> Just an expensive lotion. Offered no real eczema relief</li>
    <li> Exzaderm was not helpful in the treatment of my eczema.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Please be cautious. This product contains methylisothiazolinone, a preservative known to trigger eczema in allergic individuals. This preservative is what caused my eczema. It is in most shampoos/conditioners, some baby wipes and most liquid soaps. This cream may be great if you don&#x27;t have this sensitivity. An allergist can do a patch test to determine if this is your eczema trigger.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my baby who has sensitive skin and baby eczema. I used it on him for a few weeks everyday, and I couldn&#x27;t tell that it made a difference. It made his skin soft and didn&#x27;t seem to make it any worse... but it didn&#x27;t clear up the bumps and rough spots. I stopped using it and started using pure coconut oil and covered it with aquaphor and it cleared up in a few days! so if you are looking for something to clear up eczema breakouts, save your money, if you want a good gentle lotion it works pretty good for that.</li>
    <li> So far it is the best non prescription cream we&#x27;ve found. It is not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> I have bought (wasted money on) many products to help my daughter and granddaughter fight ecxema.&lt;br /&gt;This product works and is non prescription.  We put it on hot spots and after bathing for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s well worth the price as it works and helps heal the skin.  My daughter said she wouldn&#x27;t care what it cost as long as it worked.  She is 31 and her daughter is two.  Somehow this cream helps the itching that keeps the baby uncomfortable.  I have ordered this product more than once and will continue to order it for the relief it brings for the ecxema.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very bad excema. She said she liked how it feels on her skin, an said it feels the same as cereve. This is very expensive lotion and you get a small amout. It does not get rid of the excema, just helps her feel less dry.  Because of the price of this lotion I will stick to cereve sence she prefers that.</li>
    <li> The product works very well, when my eczema flairs up, I apply the cream as directed, it clears fairly quickly.  I have tried others.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best I have ever used.  Would recommend anyone who have problems with eczema:)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did not help my husbands Eczema.</li>
    <li> helping clear up my eczema rash</li>
    <li> good product.  It is a little greasy but does penetrate into the skin after a while.  It helps exzama and is worthwhile buying.</li>
    <li> It seemed to work at first, but within 2 days of use my daughters skin was worse with the red itchy skin behind her knees and backs of her legs.  This was our last attempt at treating the exzema on our own before having her see a Dr.  We&#x27;ve tried all the over the counter rememdies we can think of with little to no results.</li>
    <li> I went on line before purchasing Exzaderm to find a list of the ingredients in this product.  You would think that it is an all natural product by going to the product website or by reading reviews on line.  I can only tell you if you are buying this product because you think it may be more natural than other over the counter products, think again.  Looking at the long list of ingredients including mineral oil, water, glycerin, lanolin, and petrolatum totally made me regret this purchase especially considering the price.  I have used Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream in the past with reasonable results, but wanted to use a more natural solution.....Exzaderm was not it.  I think the advertisement for this product approaches fraud.</li>
    <li> I used this twice a day for 2 weeks and saw no improvement with my eczema. I bought some Aveeno eczema cream instead and saw great improvement. I do not recommend this cream at all.</li>
    <li> The extreme eczema itch was relieved but a physician&#x27;s RX creme healed the eczema caused from a wool sweater. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it once a day for my eczema ! It works faster than the prescription stuff i was given by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I would say I gave it a fair run. I must have used 3/4 of the product and still had not seen any results. May work for others but not my daughter.</li>
    <li> Best cream I had ever used for hand eczema.</li>
    <li> I Tried many other remedies to help my 3 year old with her eczema. i checked out some web pages that recommended this product. i was skeptical because of the high price tag but trying everything left me desperate and i pulled the trigger on this. Im so glad i did, after finishing the first few treatments i noticed a big difference. I highly recommend giving this a try it really helped us out!</li>
    <li> great product for babies , a must have for those new rashes that appear safe and non scented alway check with your doctor</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has eczema on her face and I was scared to use anything harsh on her face. When I started using this product twice a day, after about 2 weeks,  it completely healed her skin and helped prevent it from coming back. She will always have issues with her skin especially in the fall/winter season but this will definitely help it, naturally! It takes a little longer to heal but way better than a steroid cream without the thinning of skin which makes eczeMA come back more easily.</li>
    <li> it did not work for my son</li>
    <li> This product did no more for the eczema on my hands than anything over the counter I have tried in the past and at substantialy more money.  I will not be reordering. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked very well on moderately severe area on arm within a week it was gone. Eczema was very severe on a large area of leg, this is improved but will take some time to clear up which is why 4 stars. Suggest applying early at first signs of Eczema.</li>
    <li> 2 years ago the ingredients of this product were COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!!!  BEWARE!! CHECK LABELS!!!  The ingredients in the past helped my daughter&#x27;s skin but they have changed all ingredients and added Emu Oil which she is HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO! I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for changing the ingredients unless this is another company using the same name and the same label!</li>
    <li> It helped. But not as much as changing my diet and cutting out gluten and other suspect ingredients....</li>
    <li> My son has really bad scabby, red eczema on his ankles and inner elbows and with the use of this cream and using velcro ace bandages over the cream every night his eczema cleared up almost completely within 2 months. I&#x27;ve tried raw, organic shea cream and butter, every other conventional cream and ointment on the market, vaseline (reluctantly) and nothing was working. This cream is not itchy, is odorless and leaves a really nice barrier to contain the moisture. My son, who is 12, is VERY picky and usually doesn&#x27;t like anything I put on his skin, but he liked this cream.</li>
    <li> most annoying.  while it&#x27;s rated as the number one greatest over-the-counter eczema remedy, nothing could be further from the truth.  i&#x27;m 61 and i&#x27;ve tried them all, so i know.  the best i&#x27;ve found so far is Walgreen&#x27;s generic brand of &amp;#34;Maximum Strength Hydrocortisone Cream USP 1% with Aloe&amp;#34; at a quarter of the cost.  kind of a no-brainer between the two when you think about it.  i see Exzaderm is nothing but a placebo.  it just flat out drop dead doesn&#x27;t work.  not even close.  nuff said.</li>
    <li> This cream works well to moisturizer and reduce itching.</li>
    <li> This product is WAY too expensive!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I found that the aquaphor multi purpose ointment worked better on my infant at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It is a bit pricy but it works. I ordered this cream for my daughter and I could see results the next morning. The product was not greasy but a thick cream that coats the skin. She usually scratches all night from itching, the redness and rash but once I appled the cream she slept much better. I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else but this cream works for her.</li>
    <li> My 5 month old son has been having bouts with eczema since he was born.  The only thing that would clear it up was using hydrocortisone ointment.  Having been a nurse for 13+ years, I felt this was just a temporary band aid and began my search for anything Over the counter that I could use on a daily basis for maintenance.  I have wasted over $100+ on creams and ointments that say they are for &amp;#34;baby eczema&amp;#34; that only seemed to make it worse.  I was leery of this product and didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up, but my fears have been laid to rest!!! I used this cream a few times the first day on all of the spots that have been inflammed. I could literally see a difference in less then a day.  5 days strong and no peep of the eczema returning, and no redness anywhere. I even used it on myself and good lord my alligator looking winter dry skin looked 16 again!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to at least give it a try!!</li>
    <li> Better than Cetaphil &amp; Eucerin. (I&#x27;m about to try the the new Eucerin &#x27;Profressional Repair&#x27;.) I would say the main issue with Exzaderm is 1/4 the size for 3x the price of the others. It is a better product, but I need so much of it for the skin area I need to cover that the price becomes exorbinate. If it weren&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of those products that people often with some skin problems should stock up at home. It may not solve your problem right away (I doubt if there are any given I have tried and paid so much on different types of skin products). It will mitigate the situation and very mild.</li>
    <li> I get vesicles with my eczema so letting it dry out has been the best thing for me since diagnosed 15 years ago.  The problem is drying it out also makes my skin crack and bleed.  I use Exzaderm and it minimizes the cracking but spreads the vesicles making my hands look like hamburger.  Since it spreads, the cracking and bleeding is worse than before if I dont keep this cream on. But keeping it on spreads it more and more.  Double-edged sword I guess.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a worse rash than the area I was treating</li>
    <li> This cream is soothing.  Goes on nice &amp; if the breakout is not too bad, it can alleviate some of the dryness.  It is definitely worth trying.  To date, there is no product that I&#x27;ve discovered that provides a long-term solution for excema/psoriasis ~ only temporary relief.</li>
    <li> The product worked wonders for my daughter&#x27;s itch and skin tone!! I strongly encourage those seeking relief to try...it works!</li>
    <li> Product irritated eczema and skin around area. Consistency of product not soothing. Feel like I wasted my money on this. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Did not help my eczema... P</li>
    <li> very good it very moisturing.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product, but I have gotten similar results from other products that are much cheaper.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and will use it all, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> My son had baby excema and this was the 3rd topical ointment we tried.  It helped, but it didn&#x27;t clear it up by any means.  That&#x27;s the problem with excema.  The cause is unknown and what clears it up for one child may not work on another, but it is worth it to try anything until you figure it out for your little one.</li>
