<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I started using this facewash when I found out I was pregnant with my second child. My first prenancy I broke out with the worst acne I had ever experienced in my life. I was looking for something new. Not only did it keep my face clear, but it is the clearest my face has ever been. Even experiencing crazy hormone imbalance, this cleanser seems to be able to fight the toughest battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to note that the front of the bottle says it is foaming. I would say that is incorrect. After I got over that I was hooked.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he refuses to put lotion on his face even though it&#x27;s so dry, his skin constantly flakes off. This cleanser solved the problem. No more flakes and no more nagging him to put lotion on.</li>
    <li> Bioelements is by far the best skin care line I have come across. I use a few of the products. Shipping was pretty quick from this seller.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! High Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have (or rather \\&quot;had\\&quot;) red, sensitive skin nothing helped. But a few years back I got a facial and the cosmetologist used Bioelements Sensitive Skin, I have been converted ever since. I LOVE my face. Two of my sisters remarked on the change in my skin and after trying my cleanser just once they noticed a difference and have change over to this as well.  One of my sisters sadly had very bad acne as a teen; she says she can now go out of the house without putting on foundation!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 51.  I love my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I use this with Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15 - a match made in heaven. ;)</li>
    <li> I really like the texture and quality of this product. I have a dry T-zone and I find the oils in this cleanser help repair some of the damage that happens during the day. It&#x27;s great with my Shiseido face brush - the two products compliment each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s extremely runny. It doesn&#x27;t lather, so I have to apply it and then start scrubbing REALLY fast or else it will drip down my neck. Some of it goes to waste just because I can&#x27;t start scrubbing quick enough. Additionally, I have to use a lot of it before it starts to feel effective. If I don&#x27;t use at least five pumps it&#x27;s not worth it - it&#x27;s almost ineffective unless you really get a big amount. Combine that with how quickly it runs down your face and you really end up wasting a lot of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the natural oils and it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated, it&#x27;s hard to reconcile with the fact that it feels like so much of it goes down the drain without being used.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, so I was pleasantly surprised when this cleanser was gentle and also worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> You get a nice foam with this oil when mixed with water. It&#x27;s very gentle yet definitely cleanses well. I highly recommend this and all Bioelements products.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase my skin care products online, especially after reading about fraudulent products.  I have no complaints!!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin (also combination) and once I found this cleanser I could stop torturing myself looking for the cleanser that works!  It&#x27;s a gentle oil based cleanser which you may worry about with oily skin but for me it works.  I use it once a day in the evening. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It&#x27;s absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that my face does not breakout to or get a reddish irritation from after use.  I have been using Bioelement products for over ten years and the products are fantastic and not expensive to use like a lot of products out on the market.  Amazon has very good prices on all the products.</li>
    <li> This is more like an oil, it is fabulous for my dry sensitive and prone retina-a skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry, I rub into my skin with no water and then use a wet clairsonic and my skin has never looked better. I follow up with the really rich moisturizer and my skin is happy. The great thing about it is it rinses away nicely with a bit of water. 3 weeks in, I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have aging skin. Too dry and this stuff keeps it looking great. I just wash at night and moisturize, wash in the morning and moisturize again and skin looks good</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  It Smells great and it works awesome. Even on sensitive skin. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my sensitive skin.  It even takes off your eye makeup very gently.  I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> At 21Ii was diagnosed with Rosacea and have since tried to find cleansers and moisturuzers that keep my skin balanced. This is by far the best cleanser that overall hasn&#x27;t left my skin uneven. It hasn&#x27;t worsened my moderate acne and actually has helped clear that up. I have been working with dermatologists for a few years and trying many quality products for reactive skin. This has become my favorite cleanser that I use with a variety of clinique moisturizers and la roche posay sunscreens. I&#x27;m finally seeing my skin be more comfortable throughout hot weather and other triggers. This may not be a product for everyone but should be an option. I never thought my skin would do well with oil since it reacts to anything. It takes off face makeup very well. I still use specific eye makeup remover before hand.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. I have been oil cleansing for years because my skin is prone to breakouts and oil cleansing really helps to minimize blemishes. Because I have sensitive skin, I have to avoid a lot of products, but not this stuff! I also use the sensitive skin moisturizer and equally love it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.  Absolutely love Bioelements products.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have used recently.  An oil-based cleanser, very gentle, smells good and make my face look cleaner and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product in Beauty school…needless to say, no matter what the price…I&#x27;m hooked!!!! It&#x27;s non greasy but leaves the skin soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> I love Bioelements. My skin is sensitive and these products are the only ones that have ever worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for sensitive skin.  Leaves skin feeling moisturized instead of dry after most cleansers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered since I was a kid from dry and irritated red skin around the bridge of my nose, under my eyes on my cheeks, and between my eyes on the forehead area.  I also deal with really dry flaky skin around my mustache and goatee areas when I shave, and the opposite with itchy, red irritated skin if I let my facial hair grow out in the slightest.  So, I&#x27;ve been between a rock and a hard place for many years because of it.  Even though I&#x27;m a guy and not really self conscious about it, it does drive me crazy and can be very annoying to have your skin in a constant state of irritation.  My grandmother has probably bought me every Avon lotion that has ever existed to try and none of that ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife works as a cosmetologist and a manager for a national chain, so she can get access to professional product samples and buy them in larger sizes than what&#x27;s offered to the public at discounted rates.  Well, she brought me home a small sample of this Bioelements Sensitive Skin Cleanser.  It gave me enough to work into my cheeks and forehead and the effects were immediate.  It left my skin feeling soothed, had a slight cooling sensation(sort of like a mild Icy Hot), and my skin felt dry(not flaky) as well as super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my wife to go ahead and buy me a bottle, so she bought me 16oz bottle and I began washing my face everyday with the product.  I just keep it in the shower, pump a few squirts of the oil, massage into my face and rinse.  After the first two days, there was a dramatic reduction in the redness in my face that was noticeable by everyone.  My skin is no longer irritated, and there is no more dry flaky skin all over my facial hair areas of my face.  If your a guy and have suffered like I have with these same symptoms, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best cleanser I have ever used. Period. Love the smell. Love the way it goes on. Love how well it removes makeup. Love the way it makes my skin feel when I&#x27;m done cleansing. Clean, but not dry. This product is excellent.</li>
    <li> my wifes an esthetician with sensitive skin...this product was too weak and left makeup on after cleaning and did not foam at all while washing...but on the upside it didnt irritate her skin....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Got breakouts and stopped using right away.</li>
    <li> BEST cleanser out there for us Rosacea sufferers!!!! GOOD price, well packaged will order again DEFINITELY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This has a strange oily texture and does not rinse clean. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin but it felt unclean and oily after use.  This product  may be good for very dry skin....</li>
    <li> This cleanser seems to leave a film on my skin after washing.</li>
    <li> I was impressed. I have mild rosacea. This product cleaned well, did not strip my skin of moisture, and did not irritate my skin. This is a good cleanser and I recommend it.</li>
