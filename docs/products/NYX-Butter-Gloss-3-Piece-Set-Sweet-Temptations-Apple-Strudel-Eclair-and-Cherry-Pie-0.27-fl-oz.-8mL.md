      <li>but over all fun colors cute and compact.</li>
      <li>Butter Gloss feels like butter going on your lips smooth.</li>
      <li>But, this product will give you a nice, fresh look with just the right pop of color to highlight the smoothness of your lips.</li>
      <li>They are really pretty on, I love them.</li>
      <li>Love it so much!</li>

      <li>I love this product, all of the lip glosses are very pigmented and go on very smoothly and are very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>a pretty red gloss that isn&#x27;t to bright making it perfect for daytime,  éclair: a pretty medium pink color, and finally,  apple strudel: a peachy nude gloss that would go nicely with a smokey eye.</li>
      <li>i love the texture, color and pretty much everything about it</li>
      <li>I decided to go for this collection of three different shades, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
      <li>and I have been asked several times where I bought it what gloss am I wearing :-) !</li>
      <li>Every single one of the colors are very cute.</li>
      <li>They last for a couple hours and then have to be reapplied like most lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>Why do the Usps have to send a note that i did not pay the exact amount?</li>
      <li>I love all the colors in the kit, it contains a color that would go with any look, such as; cherry pie</li>
      <li>I like the colors, the red is adorable</li>
      <li>Ok, so let me start off by saying i ordered this feb 7th at like 3am and received shipping confirmation and a tracking number when i woke up  later on the 7th</li>
      <li>Not really suited for warm skin tone</li>
      <li>Pretty colors.</li>
      <li>good for green hand</li>
      <li>The actual lip product is really nice too, very light and creamy not sticky and no funny smell.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this set to anyone and since the holidays are near this makes a nice gift or stocking stuffer.</li>
      <li>Vibrant and pretty and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I thought the colors are bright, but its hard to define which one is which</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The texture was very creamy and moist.</li>
      <li>I really like these</li>
      <li>I really like these glosses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quick shipping, amazing quality! Love the butter glosses!</li>
    <li> Granddaughters loved them. Nice product</li>
    <li> Got my product in 3 days! Good packaging. Love the product, not sticky and subtle  colors.</li>
    <li> i love the texture, color and pretty much everything about it</li>
    <li> I love these colors ! Especially eclair it really compliments my skin compaction. I think they were packaged nicely. Will be buying more from this company</li>
    <li> too slimy for my taste and doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> I thought the colors are bright, but its hard to define which one is which</li>
    <li> If you are considering trying NYX Butter glosses, this is a great way to try some pretty colors. These are my favorite lip gloss. I use them alone and over other lipsticks etc. Very smooth and moisturizing, with good color payoff.</li>
    <li> I love buttler glosses, doesnt give you that line on your lips like some do. Will be ordering more colors soon.</li>
    <li> Love these. A slight vanilla scent and a bit of color. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this 3 pack of colors.  They feel great on and look amazing!  Don&#x27;t have anything else to say.</li>
    <li> I love these lip glosses! I had been hearing how wonderful they were &amp; wanted to give them a try. I love all the colors in the kit, it contains a color that would go with any look, such as; cherry pie a pretty red gloss that isn&#x27;t to bright making it perfect for daytime,  éclair: a pretty medium pink color, and finally,  apple strudel: a peachy nude gloss that would go nicely with a smokey eye. These glosses are not shimmery ,and do not have glitter in them. They glide on smoothly &amp; last a decent amount of time (w/o eating or drinking.). I would say if you wanted to try these glosses, but weren&#x27;t sure which colors to get than this would be a good option.</li>
    <li> I liked the product! The texture was very creamy and moist. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants cheap, but great results.</li>
    <li> These glosses are so awesome! They are creamy &amp; give off such a good color!! I want them in every color!!!</li>
    <li> I love this gloss but if you dont like sticky glosses this one may not be the one for you.</li>
    <li> I love these butter glosses! They came well packaged. They go on fairly sheer which I like because I can build the color, wear them over lipstick or mix two glosses together. The middle pink color is my favorite of the three. The orange one is subtle/nude and the red is not overwhelming. They are not sticky and they smell slightly like vanilla frosting. They last for a couple hours and then have to be reapplied like most lip glosses.  I wish I could afford an entire collection but these three are a great start.</li>
    <li> Love it so much! Need to re order! Highly recommend! Women gave me tons of complement and I have been asked several times where I bought it what gloss am I wearing :-) ! Note: I use a lip liner to accentuate the gloss :-) makes my lips kissable soft and smooth! :-)</li>
    <li> Love NYX colors and staying power. Couple that with the price point and they&#x27;re the best glosses on the market, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like that the NYX Butter Gloss go on sheer, but can also build up to medium coverage! They are light-weight, shiny, but not sticky. I love that they also go on smooth and provide my lips with a ton of moisture. Plus the NYX Butter Gloss are pretty pigmented, and look great on your lips making them look healthy, and feel supple. I love this set! I definitely recommend this set to anyone and since the holidays are near this makes a nice gift or stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I really like the NYX cosmetics that I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve been hearing great things about their Butter Gloss. I decided to go for this collection of three different shades, and I am so glad that I did! They go on like a dream, feel very creamy and the colors are subtle but divine! If you are looking for ultra-color saturation, go for an actual lipstick. But, this product will give you a nice, fresh look with just the right pop of color to highlight the smoothness of your lips. Since it&#x27;s a gloss, it&#x27;s not tremendously long-lasting, but I find that to be expected so certainly not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for a little cosmetics-fun!</li>
    <li> I love this product, all of the lip glosses are very pigmented and go on very smoothly and are very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the colors. I&#x27;m a lip gloss junkie and these definitely rank in my top 3 brands. Found a beauty supply store near me that sells singles and all of their other products :) I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> VERY STICKY HORRIBLE AND THE COLORS ARE NOT VISIBLE VERY BAD BUY :(((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very sticky horrible and the colors are not visible&lt;br /&gt;  very bad buy</li>
    <li> Why do the Usps have to send a note that i did not pay the exact amount? My hubby needs to go to office just to pay 1.90$ thats so wasting of time.</li>
    <li> Got this in my Ipsy bag for June and I was hooked! Had to buy more! Love it! It&#x27;s as smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> These are on the sheer side which I like. Very moisturizing. Pretty colors. Do not last very long.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about these butter glosses! They are extremely pigmented and feel like butter! They stay on very nicely and just make any style look amazing! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Would most definitely buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Ok, so let me start off by saying i ordered this feb 7th at like 3am and received shipping confirmation and a tracking number when i woke up  later on the 7th and i received it on the 10th, keep in mind that it was a weekend! The actual lip product is really nice too, very light and creamy not sticky and no funny smell. all in all im pretty happy i got these lip butters.</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss. It&#x27;s smooth with a fruity smell, delicious! And it conditions lips. Really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and smell delish. Awesome deal.</li>
    <li> Love these nyx butter lip glosses. They aren&#x27;t sticky and the colors are great.</li>
    <li> These colors are all wonderfully pigmented. They look great on me and I have dark skin and lips. I ended up buying to other colors also.</li>
    <li> I had received one of these as a gift. Once I tried it, I had to get more. These have a great feel and great color. I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
    <li> I really like these, they smell good, they go on smooth and aren&#x27;t sticky and the colors and very nice.</li>
    <li> I love these glosses, so I was really excited to get all 3 flavors. They are really pretty on, I love them.</li>
    <li> beautiful color! good for green hand</li>
    <li> I really like these glosses. Every single one of the colors are very cute. The red one is the absolute killer! Super sexy! My only complain is, that the color doesn&#x27;t stay for too long. I will buy it again anyway. All the pro&#x27;s completely overrule this one flaw.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but the glosses are kinda sticky.</li>
    <li> Love how buttery this feels on your lips!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy for this - It&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste... pardon the pun!</li>
    <li> Gift for my almost teen. She loves these.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Vibrant and pretty and moisturizing. I would repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really say anything negative about them. Great set.</li>
    <li> Really fun colors and looks great on lips. Formula is kinda sticky but it&#x27;s tolerable. Is not long wearing at all but just reapply.</li>
    <li> i love the colors they appear just how they look on here..my only complaint is they are a little to sticky for me and the packaging is not as its shown. but over all fun colors cute and compact. i like them.</li>
    <li> I like the colors, the red is adorable</li>
    <li> Love these colors!!! Very pretty on &amp; not over powering!</li>
    <li> Yummy, they&#x27;re all the same scent though if you were looking a multipack.&lt;br /&gt;I like to wear these by themselves or over a lip-stain.</li>
    <li> Love the color&#x27;s and the fell of them on my lips. Butter Gloss feels like butter going on your lips smooth.</li>
    <li> The pigment it perfect!!! Shows up great and stays on forever!!</li>
    <li> Got these in a subscription box and got addicted. So inexpensive and great colors. Love this line. Buy them all the time (I have a habit of losing lip glosses or sending them through the wash). Not sticky, just glossy enough but still professional.</li>
    <li> Not really suited for warm skin tone</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved them.</li>
