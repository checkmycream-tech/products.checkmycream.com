      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit crunchy, but I&#x27;ve yet to find an intense-hold hairspray that isn&#x27;t.   </li>
      <li>If you love all these things, get yourself some Shaper Fierce.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I received a defect, and that shouldn&#x27;t take away from Sebastian product itself.</li>

      <li>I love when my style holds well for longer than 8 hours</li>

      <li>and as I have very fine hair, it is fantastic for that</li>
      <li>I LOVE Sebastian hairspray, but this particular one had so many issues spaying!</li>
      <li>Some light and strategic fluffing and you&#x27;ll be good as new.   </li>
      <li>Take off the top part of the nozzle and run it or soak it in hot water for 1 minute and wipe it off with a paper towel.</li>

      <li>I have two full cans of hairspray that I cannot use.  </li>

      <li>but I feel the curl you get is worth it....</li>
      <li>This hair spray is excellent for my hair -- thick, straight, with body.</li>
      <li>Great product for stubborn hair like mine - grey and coarse or at times fine and limb - seems to work in any weather condition for control</li>
      <li>So much so that my mom and sister are now loyal users as well.  </li>
      <li>If you want a still strong hold with natural look, get a Sebastian Shaper Fierce.</li>
      <li>It has a light hold and if you don&#x27;t fuss with your hair, it looks very natural and well placed.</li>
      <li>After the first spray I took my finger off the nozzle and it kept spraying out.</li>
      <li>I love big hair.</li>
      <li>After 2 uses on the first can it stopped working.  </li>
      <li>Tried cleaning it with hot water to ensure it was not plugged up with product.&lt;br /&gt;  2.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many cheaper hair spray products, but this one seem to last all day.</li>
      <li>My first spray was in the car.</li>
      <li>Please be aware of it.sing hair spray</li>
      <li>If you want a super super hold that will seem to last forever, get a Bed Head.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money if you are looking for a super hold</li>
      <li>WILL NOT SPRAY no matter how much pressure I put on it.  </li>
      <li>was slow getting it, and didn&#x27;t have track on it but good product....</li>
      <li>I know it is a good product, but it is no good to anyone if you can&#x27;t get it out of the can.</li>
      <li>Once I get the shape I need, I use this particular hairspray to set it in.</li>
      <li>product I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I live in San Francisco and it&#x27;s always windy out here.</li>
      <li>live and learn.</li>
      <li>Also make sure you wash the hairspray nozzle (the actual nozzle that is attached to the inside of the bottle) and use a needle or toothpick to pierce through the closed hole.</li>
      <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted, based solely on the fact that Shaper Fierce only has 2 reviews, and they&#x27;re both 2 star reviews.  </li>
      <li>I have not been a fan of Sebastian&#x27;s other hairspray formulas because the hold isn&#x27;t enough for my hair texture, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>For me, although having a super hold is a huge factor for me, but I just prefer Shaper Fierce a little more because Bed Head just makes your hair too fake.</li>
      <li>was my product old?</li>
      <li>When we could get it to spray, it did the job, but most of the time it came out in thick foam.</li>
      <li>and this was exactly the same as purchased locally</li>
      <li>not sure, as i was sure i&#x27;d see the same problem all over the reviews.</li>
      <li>Strong spray for hard to hold.  </li>
      <li>Shaper Fierce has major defect in its design.</li>
      <li>Go over your hair at least twice before going out and your hair will still look at least 80% as good as it did the night before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was reccomended to me by my hair stylist. I haven&#x27;t gone back. It has a light hold and if you don&#x27;t fuss with your hair, it looks very natural and well placed. It&#x27;s not for show choir hair, its for daily styling.</li>
    <li> Worst hairspray ever!  Does not hold for more than two minutes after spraying it on. Do not waste your money if you are looking for a super hold</li>
    <li> Shaper Fierce has major defect in its design. The nozzle fails too often resulting in ability to use it.. Please be aware of it.sing hair spray is that it&#x27;s nozzle fails and a spray doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with Bed Head, but it happened with Shaper Fierce a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;- If you want a super super hold that will seem to last forever, get a Bed Head. If you want a still strong hold with natural look, get a Sebastian Shaper Fierce. For me, although having a super hold is a huge factor for me, but I just prefer Shaper Fierce a little more because Bed Head just makes your hair too fake. Everybody knows that you have hairspray on all over when you use Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip&lt;br /&gt;- When your nozzle fails, do not throw your spray away. Take off the top part of the nozzle and run it or soak it in hot water for 1 minute and wipe it off with a paper towel. Also make sure you wash the hairspray nozzle (the actual nozzle that is attached to the inside of the bottle) and use a needle or toothpick to pierce through the closed hole. If you do this, your hairspray will last until it runs out.</li>
    <li> The sprayer is constantly is plugged - very annoying</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this spary so I bought it here - it is a great hold.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The last time I used Sebastian Shaper, it was in a plastic spray bottle. This hair spray is excellent for my hair -- thick, straight, with body. I am so glad I was able to find a suitable substitute!</li>
    <li> This hair spray is for those that wish a semi firm hold.  It not only does the job but allows the hair to keep its shine.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair sprays on the market. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and as I have very fine hair, it is fantastic for that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian male with coarse hair and a short comb-over (deep side part). This hairspray works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I use pomade with my hair a little damp, then blow dry while combing. Once I get the shape I need, I use this particular hairspray to set it in. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t have that runny and sticky feel to it. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but nothing really seemed like they could tame my hair from wanting to spike out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my knowledge, Amazon has this at the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cheaper hair spray products, but this one seem to last all day. It is more expensive, but price is not everything. I would recommend to all.​</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this hairspray twice. Both times the can stopped spraying after just one use. Can&#x27;t do anything to make it keep spraying. These bottles appear to be defective...I do not recommend buying unless you want to get stuck with a can of expensive hairspray that you can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews before buying.  Cans will not spray.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I bought two cans and the sprayer is defective on both.  I have two full cans of hairspray that I cannot use.  I have contacted the seller and I am awaiting a response.  My hairdresser recommended this spray and I have used it in the past.  I know it is a good product, but it is no good to anyone if you can&#x27;t get it out of the can.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray holds very well and it held through humitity</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted, based solely on the fact that Shaper Fierce only has 2 reviews, and they&#x27;re both 2 star reviews.  HOLD THE PHONE, ladies and germs. This hairspray is like a religion to me. When I see these low star reviews, I&#x27;m both confused and insulted.  I&#x27;ve always thought of Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Fierce as the definitive \\&quot;Walk of Shame\\&quot; Hairspray. If you&#x27;re going out and think there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll wake up at someone else&#x27;s house, USE THIS HAIRSPRAY. Go over your hair at least twice before going out and your hair will still look at least 80% as good as it did the night before. Some light and strategic fluffing and you&#x27;ll be good as new.   I love me some intense hairspray and this is my favourite. Sure, it&#x27;s a bit crunchy, but I&#x27;ve yet to find an intense-hold hairspray that isn&#x27;t.   I love hairspray. I love big hair. I love when my style holds well for longer than 8 hours (let&#x27;s face it; sometimes you need 24-36 hour hold).  If you love all these things, get yourself some Shaper Fierce.</li>
    <li> A conflicted review on this one. I LOVE Sebastian hairspray, but this particular one had so many issues spaying! When we could get it to spray, it did the job, but most of the time it came out in thick foam. We would wash the tip and that would sometimes work, but I have never seen this with any other product so was disappointed. I&#x27;m sure I received a defect, and that shouldn&#x27;t take away from Sebastian product itself.</li>
    <li> was slow getting it, and didn&#x27;t have track on it but good product....</li>
    <li> I have not been a fan of Sebastian&#x27;s other hairspray formulas because the hold isn&#x27;t enough for my hair texture, but this one is my favorite.  So much so that my mom and sister are now loyal users as well.  I don&#x27;t find it as drying as most sprays can be with  a couple of days use and the hold is wonderful on windy days without &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; appearance.</li>
    <li> i wanted to love it, i loved the super hold... but i had nothing but trouble with the cans clogging. was my product old? not sure, as i was sure i&#x27;d see the same problem all over the reviews. i ordered 2 cans in preparation of loving it.. and cant get it to work. oh, well. live and learn.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 cans of this hair spray.  After 2 uses on the first can it stopped working.  Nothing would come out of the can.  I tried the 2nd and 3rd and it was the same thing.  total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have bought this hairspray for years, and have also returned it for years. If it wasn&#x27;t for the good quality product INSIDE the can, I would stop. I can&#x27;t tell you how many I have returned this because of a defective nozzle that won&#x27;t spray. I think I have finally learned my lesson. At least now, I will stop buying this from Amazon and buy it from a salon - easier return since Amazon won&#x27;t take it back in the mail.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very easy to work with and has great holding power.&lt;br /&gt;This product I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this in glossybox and i must say if you have curly hair it does wonders for volume and shaping curls..it does smell but I feel the curl you get is worth it....very volumtuous so for a fine haired girl like me perfect...hold is not so great I will spray a mist of stronger hold ..I love it!</li>
    <li> I need a hairspray that will hold up in the elements, yet won&#x27;t damage my already dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I get great hold with this product and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or brittle like other sprays&lt;br /&gt;I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product for stubborn hair like mine - grey and coarse or at times fine and limb - seems to work in any weather condition for control</li>
    <li> My first spray was in the car. After the first spray I took my finger off the nozzle and it kept spraying out. It stopped when I pressed it down again. Probably will have issues in the future and I did not purchase it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Strong spray for hard to hold.  Great for high humidity or rain.  It has become the spray of choice for me.</li>
    <li> Pro:  Hair spray holds style in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1. The aerosol spray stopped working after only 3 uses!  WILL NOT SPRAY no matter how much pressure I put on it.  Tried cleaning it with hot water to ensure it was not plugged up with product.&lt;br /&gt;  2.  Unable to RETURN for exchange/ credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the product is improved, I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wife says great product and great price. Has used it before and loved it and this was exactly the same as purchased locally</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever! I live in San Francisco and it&#x27;s always windy out here. This keeps my hair good almost all day! Look as fierce as you want with this product.</li>
