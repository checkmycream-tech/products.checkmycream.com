      <li>Thanks for a great product!!</li>
      <li>And I love the way my skin feels -</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of this products for many years.</li>
      <li>Will not be able to use them .</li>
      <li>I know better.</li>
      <li>I love these brush heads.</li>
      <li>They are nothing more than a cheap knock off.</li>
      <li>Normally I am leery of ordering generic replacement parts for items but these fit great and are as good of quality as the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
      <li>I will not buy this cheap version again.</li>
      <li>I want to ensure there are plenty of brush heads available for me.</li>
      <li>These brushes look and feel like the genuine Sonicare brushes, however they don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to fit flush with my clarisonic unless I sort of force it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit to the machine</li>
      <li>These look like a great deal, but they are not real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
      <li>I will never spend so much time away from my Clarisonic again. :)</li>
      <li>The real deal replacement brush at most costs $25.</li>
      <li>These arrived quickly which did not matter.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the package I thought the brush wouldn&#x27;t fit my machine</li>
      <li>These brushes are much cheaper than ordering the Clarisonic replacement brushes and they work just as well!!  </li>
      <li>My face is worth $.27 a day.</li>
      <li>The clarisonic brand is soft and so much better..</li>
      <li>I love when a generic product works just as well as the original.</li>
      <li>I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work as well, or wouldn&#x27;t fit my classic Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>Such a great generic version of the clarasonic brush heads.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk hurting Mia.</li>
      <li>I found these brush heads to be a much cheaper alternative for my Clarisonic brush!</li>
      <li>First thought - cost.</li>
      <li>This was such a cost-effective purchase and I am so glad I found these.  </li>
      <li>I really do.</li>
      <li>My clarisonic seems much gentler.</li>
      <li>But I returned them as I thought they were a bit too gentle but very well made.</li>
      <li>It looks like it may be manufactured in the same factory as the original ones because of a marking on it.  </li>
      <li>Not the same as the original brush.</li>
      <li>A much cheaper alternative to the normal Clarisonic brushes.</li>
      <li>My face isn&#x27;t very sensitive, so it didn&#x27;t bother my skin all that much.</li>
      <li>They are exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same in every respect, and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>Felt too soft.  </li>
      <li>I got these for my 13 year old son to use on My Clarisonic to hopefully prevent breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely continue to buy these because they are so much cheaper than the $25 replacement heads with clarisonic.</li>
      <li>For those with sensitive skin it might be something to consider.</li>
      <li>Plus this will make good stocking suffers  next year</li>
      <li>They look the same, feel the same, and as far as I am concerned, they work the same.</li>

<li> The bristles actually resemble the acne head (green and white), not black and white</li>
<li> The clear cap that it comes with doesn&#x27;t fit after the head is on the clarisonic which is all bad because the brush needs to be covered when not in use.</li>

<li> This generic bush is too harsh, my skin is not sensitive and I have hard time to use this brush because I feel like burn my skin.</li>
<li> Just less cost.</li>
<li> And in the process I started to think why I&#x27;ve been less than diligent about replacing my brush every 3 months.</li>
<li> this brand seems to be very stiff and rough.</li>
<li> but alas, these were definitely not them.</li>
<li> These did not fit my Clarasonic Mia.  </li>
<li> What mattered is that they did not fit on my Mia 2.</li>
<li> I ran out of heads a few months back, and havne&#x27;t used it in a while (crazy, yes!).</li>
<li> I, like everyone else, was thinking that it wouldnt be THAT bad to try the cheaper product.</li>
<li> Unfortunetly they are worthless.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit to the machine and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I found these brush heads to be a much cheaper alternative for my Clarisonic brush! They work well and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them shedding/falling apart or anything of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason for giving only 4 stars is I found them to be a little &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; namebrand brushes. My face isn&#x27;t very sensitive, so it didn&#x27;t bother my skin all that much. For those with sensitive skin it might be something to consider.</li>
    <li> I have had my Clarisonic for a few years now, and it really is a saving grace for your complexion. I ran out of heads a few months back, and havne&#x27;t used it in a while (crazy, yes!). When I went to purchase replacement heads and remembered they&#x27;re $20 a piece, I was intrigued b this generic at $15.00 for TWO! I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work as well, or wouldn&#x27;t fit my classic Clarisonic. It&#x27;s exactly the same in every respect, and works like a charm. I am delighted. And I love the way my skin feels - I will never spend so much time away from my Clarisonic again. :)</li>
    <li> Such a great generic version of the clarasonic brush heads. These fit perfectly on my Clarasonic and they work just as well as the original!</li>
    <li> These look like a great deal, but they are not real Clarisonic brush heads. They do NOT rotate. They are nothing more than a cheap knock off.</li>
    <li> Have had these before and like them a lot.  I have been a fan of this products for many years.</li>
    <li> I was hoping I could find clarisonic heads that were cheaper than the name brand ones but alas, these were definitely not them. They don&#x27;t seem to fit flush with my clarisonic unless I sort of force it. The clear cap that it comes with doesn&#x27;t fit after the head is on the clarisonic which is all bad because the brush needs to be covered when not in use. Ended up wasting money instead of saving it.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased a generic head so I thought I&#x27;d try it. My clarisonic seems much gentler. this brand seems to be very stiff and rough. The bristles actually resemble the acne head (green and white), not black and white like i had thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I have had my Clarisonic Mia for 3+ years and LUV it. Normally I am leery of ordering generic replacement parts for items but these fit great and are as good of quality as the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find these. They are exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference using them. I will be buying these in the future.</li>
    <li> These brushes are much cheaper than ordering the Clarisonic replacement brushes and they work just as well!!  Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> A much cheaper alternative to the normal Clarisonic brushes. They work just ask well. Just less cost. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I, like everyone else, was thinking that it wouldnt be THAT bad to try the cheaper product. How different could it possible be? VERY DIFFERENT.</li>
    <li> These did not fit my Clarasonic Mia.  I returned them.  Would not recommend buying from a place that calls itself Knockoff Bargains.</li>
    <li> This generic bush is too harsh, my skin is not sensitive and I have hard time to use this brush because I feel like burn my skin. The clarisonic brand is soft and so much better.. I will not buy this cheap version again.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled that this fits and works perfectly with my Clarisonic!  What a great savings!!</li>
    <li> These brushes look and feel like the genuine Sonicare brushes, however they don&#x27;t work. You can force them onto the unit but they don&#x27;t vibrate properly and they don&#x27;t activate the face wash timing cycles. Unfortunetly they are worthless.</li>
    <li> Put them on my Mia and it was a no go.  They do look identical to the name brand, but don&#x27;t know what else to say, but they don&#x27;t work at all.  Returning item.</li>
    <li> Replacement brush head for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes were not compatible with my Clarisonic. Will not be able to use them .</li>
    <li> Felt too soft.  I got these for my 13 year old son to use on My Clarisonic to hopefully prevent breakouts.  But I returned them as I thought they were a bit too gentle but very well made.</li>
    <li> I love these brush heads. I love when a generic product works just as well as the original. They look the same, feel the same, and as far as I am concerned, they work the same. I will definitely continue to buy these because they are so much cheaper than the $25 replacement heads with clarisonic.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package I thought the brush wouldn&#x27;t fit my machine but it did...They work GREAT I would recommend this product to anyone with this kind of machine and you save a lot of money...Thank You</li>
    <li> These brush heads are just like the originals!  AMAZING!!  This was such a cost-effective purchase and I am so glad I found these.  I want to tell others, but then again I don&#x27;t.  I want to ensure there are plenty of brush heads available for me.</li>
    <li> It was what I expect it to be.</li>
    <li> I know better. I really do. But come on, who among us doesn&#x27;t want to try and save some money? These arrived quickly which did not matter. What mattered is that they did not fit on my Mia 2. I suppose I could have jammed them on somehow but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk hurting Mia. She has become my twice a day faithful, beloved friend since receiving as a Christmas gift in 2012. I returned them. And in the process I started to think why I&#x27;ve been less than diligent about replacing my brush every 3 months. First thought - cost. Then I did the math. The real deal replacement brush at most costs $25. Twice a day for ninety days &#x3D; 13.8 cents per use. My face is worth $.27 a day. Isn&#x27;t yours????</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and am totally happy with everything about it.  It looks like it may be manufactured in the same factory as the original ones because of a marking on it.  Just saying...</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original brush.</li>
    <li> Oh yes, I will buy again I have used the Clairasonic  brush for years and have purchased the brushes but such a bargain I have spread the word among my friends.  Plus this will make good stocking suffers  next year</li>
    <li> They are the same as the Clarisonic brand. Just cheaper.</li>
