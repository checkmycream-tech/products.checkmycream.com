      <li>I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s anything about the scent that says &amp;#34;lavender jasmine&amp;#34; to me, but I did find this to have a pleasant, floral</li>
      <li>If you like the scent, this will probably be a good choice for you (can always smell it in a store before ordering, just to see).  </li>
      <li>I loved the scent (gave it a star for that)</li>
      <li>It smells good and feels good.</li>
      <li>I am going out of my way to write a review for this product because it is that good.</li>
      <li>However, I felt that it provided good coverage (not always visible, but I could feel it if I ran my hand over my leg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Most moisturizing shave cream ever - you won&#x27;t need cream afterwards!</li>

      <li>Love Prime membership!</li>

      <li>It works great and feels smooth and silky when going on legs.</li>
      <li>Nice scent.</li>

      <li>It was a great deal, but it doesn&#x27;t really work that good.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>

      <li>Glad to buy from Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I love being able to just apply it, shave, and go -</li>
      <li>Makes shaving easy and enjoyable.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely shaving cream that is soft on the skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Love this product; however its not as foamy as the original creams.</li>
      <li>I got a 3 pack such a good value !</li>
      <li>Does not dissolve easily.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t gave a strong scent which I like.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my skin soft, but it just clogs up my razor and even if I clean the razor between each stroke, I still never get a close shave.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>It works great and leaves skin super soft.</li>
      <li>I only have to shave 2-3 times a week now; I am very pleased with this product!</li>

      <li>I plan to order more right away</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite shave lotion!</li>
      <li>It made shaving my legs fun!</li>
      <li>One 7 oz bottle lasts a surprisingly long time, and the packaging is sleek and attractive.     </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this shaving cream when I first purchased it.</li>
      <li>I have to use three times more than recommended to lightly cover my whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>This nozzle stays clean.</li>
      <li>so I am hoping in the long run it will be more cost effective than the foams.</li>
      <li>The pump only gives one good pump, then I have to pull up on it</li>
      <li>My husband also loves to use this to shave with, it leaves his face nice and soft.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m definitely loving it so far.</li>
      <li>This is great for me because its mostly natural, and leaves my legs soft.</li>
      <li>The shaver tends to clog, but that is a quick rinse.</li>
      <li>It smells good, allows for a smooth shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
      <li>The lavender jasmine is a very soft yet yummy scent and applies very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time today, and I will never buy another brand of shaving cream again!  </li>
      <li>It causes a very close shave, leaving legs super smooth and moisturized for hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love EOS but this cream was old. I had to add water and shake it so it would come out of the pump.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shave lotion! It is very thick and moisturizing and I find if I am in a hurry I don&#x27;t  have to put an additional lotion on my legs afterward.  I find my legs don&#x27;t itch after shaving anymore.  Great choice!</li>
    <li> Aveeno seems to have discontinued my favorite shaving gel (low-scent, worked beautifully), so I decided to try this, since it was on sale.  Tossed it after one shave: WAY too much artificial scent (no, I don&#x27;t need THIS many chemicals on my legs, thank you), plus, you need a lot of cream to create the same lubrican effect a little bit of gel will provide, and it clogged up the drain on top of it .... where&#x27;s a decent low-scent gel when you need it?</li>
    <li> Buy this!!! Makes shaving easy and enjoyable. Very moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t gave a strong scent which I like.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizing shave cream ever - you won&#x27;t need cream afterwards! It effectively prevents red bumps, and its very gentle.     The formula, even scented, does not irritate sensitive skin, and its creamy texture is a nice change from excessive foams and gels, which tend to clog up my razor very quickly.     The lavender jasmine scent is light and luckily not overwhelming - pleasantly floral.     One 7 oz bottle lasts a surprisingly long time, and the packaging is sleek and attractive.     A key selling point is the &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; aspect - it happens to work either way, although you get a much closer shave when wet     Bottom-line: this shaving cream literally changed shower-time for me. It made shaving my legs fun! Definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is more lotion like than a typical shaving cream, but I like it. It&#x27;s easy to control when pumping and not messy at all. It smells good and feels good. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a must try it to believe it ! Love, love, love it! Your shaving experience will be the best you ever had!</li>
    <li> It was a great deal, but it doesn&#x27;t really work that good. I used it as after shave instead. It smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a shaving cream that prevents bumps especially in the bikini area. This, doesn&#x27;t do it. Yes, it smells great and it keeps the promise of no rust ring around the bottle, but this shaving cream is mediocre in my opinion. Now, I&#x27;ve only tried shaving wet and the product says you can do it wet or dry....I&#x27;ll try shaving dry and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> As someone who has literally never had anything work for me to help with razor bumps and sensitive skin, this really helps! For both my legs and other parts, had virtually no redness and my skin was very soft, would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream exclusively since first purchase. It causes a very close shave, leaving legs super smooth and moisturized for hours. Don&#x27;t have to shave as often. The pump is annoying but the quality of the product outweighs everything else.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but wanted to see for myself the difference.  I must say I am a hooked.  This is a cream not a foam in a pump like a lotion and in a hard plastic bottle with a pump (no rust stains!) I was able to get a super close shave and my legs were super soft and the softness is long lasting too. I also like that a little goes a long way so I am hoping in the long run it will be more cost effective than the foams. Definitely a good investment!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and creaminess of this! It works great and leaves skin super soft. I love being able to just apply it, shave, and go - no water needed!</li>
    <li> This is not as easy to spread as most other shaving creams. It is not mousse like in the least, and in fact, spreads more like a lotion than anything else. While it does moisturize as advertised, it doesn&#x27;t do so great of a job as to warrant me to prefer this over some other product that produces similar results. I had previously been using [[ASIN:B0032ANCUA Edge Shave Gel, Extra Moisturizing, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] but had wanted to switch because I&#x27;m female and I felt weird using a man&#x27;s shaving gel, despite the fact that it produced the same results as any feminine shaving cream would. I think I&#x27;ll be switching back. The one I used before was much easier to use and I liked the results better.</li>
    <li> First of all, I hate the scent. I generally don&#x27;t like lavender scented things anyway, but it was on sale so I tried it.  I like the bottle, and the fact that it is plastic so there is no \\&quot;rust ring\\&quot; like with some shaving gels.  But, the cream feels very thin, I feel like I use so much more of this product. I also have the EOS Shave Cream Vanilla Bliss scent and it is much better, it is thicker and the scent is pleasant.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is smooth and smells great. I&#x27;ve never had another shaving cream feel so smooth. It shaves nicely, but it is a little thick, necessitating rinsing your razor frequently. Still, it keeps feeling great for hours afterwards. I can&#x27;t imagine switching to another cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin sooooooo soft after shaving. Love it!</li>
    <li> Usually I make my own shaving cream (because it works so much better than ANYTHING on the market), but I went to my in-laws and forgot it so I just ran to the store and bought some EOS shaving cream. It was awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has no coverage. I have to use three times more than recommended to lightly cover my whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;2. It DESTROYS my razors. No amount of rinsing or wiping can get the globs of shaving cream out from between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t allow for a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;4. It clogs my drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are great and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a rust ring in my shower, but the product itself just isn&#x27;t for me. Which sucks, because I love most EOS products.</li>
    <li> This is unlike any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used! It definitely cuts down on irritation and raises the bar on hydration and smoothness! This will be my new shaving companion from here on!</li>
    <li> I will not ever go back to any other shaving cream! Leaves you smooth and never have to worry if you forget to put lotion afterwards!</li>
    <li> I like this shaving cream with my razor it leaves me with a perfect shave as if i just got a fresh wax., I wish Amazon didn&#x27;t stop offering this as a Sub&amp;Save option now i have to pay more for this at the drugstore. But the shaving cream can be a bit heavy so i suggest to go easy on the pumping so it doesn&#x27;t mess up your razor if you do not have a very durable razor.</li>
    <li> I really do not know why fragrance matters to me as I am not able to smell it very well and see very few people. I just hope those clerks at the grocery stores can smell it. What is different is there is no cream left behind on the nozzle as there is with Skintimate and similar shaving creams. I would always have to rinse it off before I used it again but not with this product. This nozzle stays clean. I don&#x27;t seem to need as much to get a smooth shave but note that I am past the age of shaving legs and armpits but do have to deal with facial hair. I like how the product works and glad I had ended up buying three bottles of it so I will not need to reorder soon. When I am getting low on my third bottle, I hope I can re-order.</li>
    <li> I became addicted to this shaving cream a few years ago now.  It&#x27;s so smooth and moisturizing, I could never go back to using foaming shaving creams again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great deal too.  Bargain buy.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this shaving cream when I first purchased it. But I&#x27;m definitely loving it so far. Really great for legs!</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else to shave my legs. This stuff is thick but easy to apply and it makes my legs feel moisturized. I&#x27;ve gone back to regular shaving cream before, but always end up back to this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely shaving cream that is soft on the skin and has a pleasant smell. A little bit goes a long way and the bottle is made out of a nice material so no mold or rust from a can. Really enjoyed this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often go out of my way to write a review about shave cream, but here goes.  This one was pretty unusual for me, and I pondered for a while whether I actually like the EOS lavender jasmine shave cream...  For me, there were pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;I agree with a one-star reviewer who said this shave cream is very aromatic.  However, I liked the scent.  Several four- and five- star reviewers had very close shaves and thought their legs felt smoother than when they use other similarly priced brands.  I agree on this point, too.  If you can keep it from clogging your razor blades too badly, it&#x27;ll be a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and pump&#x27;s design just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I don&#x27;t know if the product somehow solidified or what, but the shave cream was about the consistency of toothpaste and just wouldn&#x27;t come out of the pump after 50 or 60 pumps sometimes.  I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time when I shave my legs!  I ended up removing the pump and squirting it out of the bottle into my hand.  I would much prefer and aluminum can with a nozzle, just like a regular shave cream or shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers noted that this shave cream doesn&#x27;t lather, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to.  Some feel that shave cream (and shampoos and cleansers) MUST lather, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s necessary.  I&#x27;ve read before that manufacturers often add lathering agents into their products because people prefer them, but lathering isn&#x27;t always essential to cleansing and shaving.  This product definitely doesn&#x27;t lather.  Just be aware of your preference before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love the way the shaving lotion feels on my skin, and I definitely prefer it over shaving cream.  However, I ordered a 3- pack of these, and every single bottle had a problematic pump.  The pumps take 15-20 pushes to get anything out (and this is even after I tried cleaning them to make sure they weren&#x27;t clogged!).  I eventually gave up with the pumps and just squeezed it out of the bottle which was annoying, but doable.  Again, love the actual shaving lotion (it prevents razor bumps on my sensitive skin), but the bottle/pumps just don&#x27;t work well.  I probably won&#x27;t buy anymore until they change the design of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product; however its not as foamy as the original creams. I love the its natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the the nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love the thick creaminess and the hand pump. My new indulgence!  Scent is lovely. I got a 3 pack such a good value !</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and amazon sells it for a great price. Its the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used, very moisturizing and a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts forever. It also smells heavenly. Definitely try it!</li>
    <li> It smells good, allows for a smooth shave with minimal irritation.  What more could a person want?  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaving cream. I&#x27;ve used the vanilla and the lavender and both scents are lovely. My legs are always incredibly silky smooth after every shave, and I no longer need to moisturize. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This costs a little more than comparable products from other brands.  While I do feel that eos products are good, I also feel like a little bit of the cost is simply paying extra for fancy packaging.  So keep that in mind if economy is your main goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I felt like this was a decent shave cream.  It was non-irritating and I got a good, close shave.  I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s anything about the scent that says &amp;#34;lavender jasmine&amp;#34; to me, but I did find this to have a pleasant, floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not foam as some shave gels and creams do.  However, I felt that it provided good coverage (not always visible, but I could feel it if I ran my hand over my leg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, since they&#x27;re not currently listed on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Stearyl Alcohol, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Petrolatum, Laureth 23, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Gluconolactone, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Oat Kernel Extract, Shea Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ext.

However, the ingredients are similar to those in other products of this general type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is a decent shave gel but there is nothing that really stands out about it.  If you like the scent, this will probably be a good choice for you (can always smell it in a store before ordering, just to see).  3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this cream can use it with wet or dry legs.  My husband also loves to use this to shave with, it leaves his face nice and soft.</li>
    <li> My skin drys out quickly and I was looking for a new shave cream that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my legs. I gave EOS a try and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product. The packaging can be a little annoying, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> The pump stopped working pretty quickly, I&#x27;ve cleaned it out and still doesn&#x27;t work. It smells great and leaves my skin soft, but it just clogs up my razor and even if I clean the razor between each stroke, I still never get a close shave. It&#x27;s not my razor, because it works fine with other types of shaving cream. This comes out just like lotion. I want to like it, it just is too problematic.</li>
    <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Really works</li>
    <li> This was a recommendation from a coworker. I used to get a lot of razor burn or bumps die to dryness by the end of the same day after shaving.  Now, my skin is sof n smootht. A little goes a long way too! no need toy use a lot of product like other foamy shave creams.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled a real deal lavender. I&#x27;ve smelled a real deal jasmine. I&#x27;ve also smelled EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream, Lavender Jasmine. These experiences are widely dissonant, if not entirely unrelated. Namely because - and I&#x27;m being straight up, here - EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream, Lavender Jasmine smells like straight up chemical doodoo. The bottle is a pleasant shade of lavender purple, yeah, but don&#x27;t be fricken&#x27; fooled, this is not a botanically scented bath product. It was made in a test tube, and probably injected into the eyes of some poor friggen&#x27; rats or bunnies somewhere down the line. I wouldn&#x27;t get so salty over it, but I paid like 4 bucks for this, and at that price, I&#x27;d like some fragrance accountability.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s shaving cream. Works fine. But I&#x27;d rather just soap up my gams with Yardley English Lavender Soap and save myself an extra bottle in the shower.</li>
    <li> Most shave creams leave my skin dry and irritated. This is great for me because its mostly natural, and leaves my legs soft. I slather alot on, probably about 4 pumps per leg, which is why i decided to get the 3 pack! I wish this formula came in a squeeze tube, but oh well, this is less expensive then using fancy mens shaving cream from sephora which costs around 20!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love this stuff.  The pump only gives one good pump, then I have to pull up on it or I won&#x27;t get much out on the next one.  Plus, I was looking for foam, this did not meet my expectations.  But is right for some people.</li>
    <li> I do not like it;  I gave away two brand new units.  It builds up very heavy in a multiple blade razor.</li>
    <li> What girl doesn&#x27;t like smooth, baby soft skin? EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream is a girl&#x27;s best friend. I came across this product just browsing on Amazon and being a big fan of the EOS lip balm, I figured I had to give this a try and I am so happy I did! The lavender jasmine is a very soft yet yummy scent and applies very smoothly. I also really enjoy the bottle due to it being plastic rather than metal that leaves that gross rusty ring in the shower. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is I find myself rinsing my razor more often than usual but with the end result, it&#x27;s well worth it! This shave cream works very well not only on legs but on underarms and the bikini area. Great buy and a must have summer product.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product, and I can&#x27;t say how disappointed I was once I did get it.  It produces the&lt;br /&gt;most appallingly poor lather I have ever seen. Also, for some reason, it is hard to dispense the stuff out&lt;br /&gt;of the bottle.  Needless to say, I returned it asap.  Aveeno puts out a shave gel that is just as cheap,&lt;br /&gt;but the lather is incredible. Almost anything else I have used also  puts this EOS stuff to shame.</li>
    <li> Provides a very smooth shave. Nice scent. Helped protect my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream in Lavender Jasmine actually delivers on its promise to moisturize. Bottle is made perfectly to hold onto in the shower (there are indentations to grip the bottle.) The fragrance is light, I wish it would last a little longer. Definitely will be using again.</li>
    <li> I have used all different scents of this shaving cream brand and by far the lavender is my favorite. The scent is fresh and very soothing especially while taking a bath.</li>
    <li> Packaging grabs the buyer. I was looking for something more natural than just foam. I loved the scent (gave it a star for that) and of course the packaging screamed natural goodness to me. Not a huge price difference so I purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It does a wonderful job moisturizing. Like a thick cream/lotion. (Star)&lt;br /&gt;-It smells good. Soft, subtle, not fake fruity or over powering (Star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-First use, pump his horrible. Like the lotion is too thick for the pump. Just to get a quater sized amount I had to pump........waiiiiiit........pump..........waaaaaiiit.... pump...you get the idea. I finally forced the top off and shook/squeezed it out. This was my biggest irritation so if they found a new way to bottle/pump/squeeze it out, I would throw another star on there.&lt;br /&gt;-Like  a thick cream/lotion. ALthough this was a pro, it was a con as well. Clogged up my razor and stuck to the tub, drain, etc. Does not dissolve easily. Had to knock the razor on the side of the tub. Great for legs, bad for razors/tubs.&lt;br /&gt;-Seemed to dull my razors quicker. I don&#x27;t know if this was coincidence or what, but my razors don&#x27;t seem to last as long. As razor are a small college tuition in cost these days, conspiracy hit my thoughts....sigh...perhaps not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I won&#x27;t purchase again in this form. If they re-bottle it and I can verify it didn&#x27;t conspire with my razor to escalate dullness, then perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> Wish I could have bought this as a single pack, but a 3-pack was okay to purchase at a single time. Glad to buy from Amazon.com. This product does what it is suppose to! I recommend this product. -@eplusq</li>
    <li> I am going out of my way to write a review for this product because it is that good. I have never used a better shaving cream product. It left my legs silky smooth. Afterwards, my skin felt so hydrated that I forgot to put lotion. I only have to shave 2-3 times a week now; I am very pleased with this product! I would recommend it to any woman out there looking for the best thing in shaving cream. Evolution of Smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream that I can use while dry.  I prefer to use it when wet, however once it dries I don&#x27;t have to re-wet my legs.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate shaving my legs because my skin is very dry and I always nick myself, and afterwards my legs always itch and burn regardless of putting lotion on them.  I tried this product for the first time today, and I will never buy another brand of shaving cream again!  First, it pumps out like a lotion and feels like a dream on your skin.  Second, the razor just glided over my skin and I didn&#x27;t nick myself once.  Third, afterwards my legs felt so smooth I almost didn&#x27;t need to use lotion on them.  My skin didn&#x27;t itch and burn afterwards. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent to it.  I have tried all kinds of shaving creams in the past, and nothing has even come close to this product.  I plan to order more right away so I never run out!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works great! No complaints</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream. It stays put without running. The shaver tends to clog, but that is a quick rinse. Good for face and body.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores and especially at this great price. Now we can also receive it on a subscription at a lower cost! Amazon you just keep getting better and better at what you do! Love Prime membership!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading some good reviews. I am not happy with it. It smells like Nair hair removal lotion (gross). It doesn&#x27;t foam so you have to use a lot. My legs feel so rough and dry and I have to use a ton of lotion to make up for the shave cream. I do not recommend this product. Aveeno is so much better and a little goes a long way because it&#x27;s so creamy and foams nicely.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower and sometimes in the sink when I am short on time and my legs need some attention.  The smell is wonderful and leaves my skin very soft.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> it does keep your skin moisturized but made my legs break out in a few pimples (so weird that hasn&#x27;t ever happened to me) and created razor bumps in underarms.</li>
    <li> Smells SO good and the lotion is super nice on the skin, but it&#x27;s very thick and hard to pump because of this. I watered it down, which made it nicer, but it is hard to get the right ratio of water to cream. I love the company and wanted to like the product more, but the lack of ease to pump made the product more frustrating than it was worth.</li>
    <li> I really love this shave cream. It&#x27;s nearly the only shaving cream/gel/foam I&#x27;ve used that helps prevent razor burn. I have super sensitive skin, and often had problems before EOS. My ONLY problem is the pump. The first one I got, I thought was defective because you have to pump...waiiiitt.....pump...waaaiiitt. Now, I&#x27;m in to double digits on the amount of these I&#x27;ve bought, and pumping it is never easy. I long for the day when EOS realizes this heartbreak and switches to a tube!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews about this shave cream not lathering.  It works great and feels smooth and silky when going on legs.</li>
    <li> i agree with the others, it is very thick however i love the organic concept. its very smoothing and still does the trick and no cuts.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, and seems to prevent razor nicks well.  Only problem is that the cream is so thick, I could not get it to pump, so I had to add water and shake well.  If this came in a squeeze tube, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
