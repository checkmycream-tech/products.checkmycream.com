### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great used as a lotion and a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I’ve used it too and it works great.</li>
      <li>All in all a great product.</li>
      <li>I think this is really great for guys.  </li>
      <li>However, I do use it when I mow the grass to keep from getting sunburned and it is very effective as a sun block.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good quality and works well.</li>
      <li>If this was a &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; lotion and it was once a day then it would be good.</li>
      <li>So the fact that after thirty days it hasn&#x27;t happened yet is a good sign to me.  </li>
      <li>This Cetaphil men lotion is as good as any brand.  </li>
      <li>product is great because it is a scent free sunscreen.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really nice to find quality products that are gender neutral and can be used by men and/or women.</li>
      <li>Light but pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels nice and smooth and looks good after use</li>
      <li>So, this is a good value and a product I can easily recommend.</li>
      <li>But, for what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially good for those with sensitive skin (which I have),</li>
      <li>It also goes on very light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy after application and has a very light scent that is not feminine or too flowery.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels more soothing but it also feels &amp;#34;louder&amp;#34; on the skin than the Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased</li>
      <li>As I also shave my head and really want to avoid the shiny dome state, I’m happy to report the lotion works well as a moisturizer without worries of a gleam.</li>
      <li>And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t cause a skin rash or pimples the next day.</li>
      <li>Nice light cream, doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or oily, no scent.</li>
      <li>But this has been nice and light and not an issue.</li>
      <li>I’ve had good success with Dove for Men and Axe post-shaving products,</li>
      <li>The packaging of the 4 oz bottle is convenient, as well, as the head of the squeeze top can turn to a locked position and prevent inadvertent moisturizing of the insides of your travel bags.</li>
      <li>This may be the perfect daily lotion for men.  </li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>He was satisfied with the benefits of using this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>He has been able to use this lotion without causing any breakouts.</li>
      <li>would recommend this product as a nice moisturizer that also provides  some basic protection from the sun (and great to put on after being in the sun).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I haven’t noticed any rejuvenating effects yet, it’s been fine for sun protection, which is probably one of its better strengths.</li>
      <li>This is a very good basic face lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, non oily, has an ok smell and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Really, I originally had this grand plan of doing an ingredient comparison of this Cetaphil Men’s Face Lotion with the Cetaphil &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; Men’s lotion, Dove Face Lotion, Dove</li>
      <li>The lotion provides nice sun protection for being out and about, but going to the beach I also use a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and spreads easily.  </li>
      <li>Works fine as a replacement for an aftershave lotion.</li>
      <li>The Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is unscented (or fragrance free, as someone else pointed out is the synonymous description used for women&#x27;s products), which is great, since I don&#x27;t want my face smelling like perfume all day.</li>
      <li>It goes on and absorbs smoothly.</li>
      <li>like that this is scent free, and I like the consistency.</li>
      <li>My primary reason for getting this lotion was to use it to protect my face from sunburn while mowing the grass around my house.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product to help your face avoid sun damage.</li>
      <li>This is great for daily use.</li>
      <li>For me, occasional breakouts aren&#x27;t uncommon no matter what lotion I use so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that there is a competitor now, and that it comes in a larger pump.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
      <li>, this Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a great, easy, unoffensive, option to quickly moisturize your face and protect it from the sun.</li>
      <li>I don’t have a clue about most of the alphabetically challenging ingredients in all of them, plus in the main, I don’t care.</li>
      <li>live in a fairly sunny climate, so rubbing on some sort of sun protection daily, after a close shave, is fairly routine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d reapply in afternoon for more sun exposure if your first application was in the morning.</li>
      <li>pretty sure I’m still going to use something that significantly kicks up the amps on the SPF factor.</li>
      <li>Then I realized that’s a lot more effort than I would ever be willing to take on for a review and let’s face it (no, not intended, just coincidental)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put it after shaving with a blade and it definitely makes skins feel good.  </li>
      <li>Quite honestly, that surprised me.</li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s not all nice and scented like an aftershave, but it does help the sensitive skin after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Healthy and gentle for skin, does not leave skin feeling greasy, did not cause any breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I can’t really comment if my face feel more hydrated, but I haven’t gotten any uglier…</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is the most important part of the lotion as we live in Texas and keeping the sun off our skin is a chore.</li>
      <li>In general use though its useful if most of your day consists of going to the office or being indoors most of the day.  </li>
      <li>The addition of SPF 15 just makes it that much nicer and more useful.</li>
      <li>This is a mild and unassuming lotion.</li>
      <li>This Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a light weight, non-offensively smelling, lotion that goes on very easy without an oily residue.</li>
      <li>Although it is SPF 15, this is a pretty low level  of sun protection - you still would want to protect your skin with a hat or stronger sun product if you would going to have sustained exposure to bright sun (say the beach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The pump is very convenient and makes it easy to dispense and use each day.</li>
      <li>do get light razor bumps on my neck after shaving occasionally, and this just really sooth&#x27;s that nicely.</li>
      <li>if that’s worth anything.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She likes it better than her moisturizing lotion because it is absorbed into her skin better - same reason as I prefer it.turizing lotion because it is absorbed into her skin better - same reason as I prefer it.</li>
      <li>Light lotion that goes on clear and smooth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, I haven’t had any reactions after a couple weeks of use, and that’s a very positive thing.</li>
      <li>This is a good skin lotion  for men, in that it is not greasy, has little in any odor(no perfume!), and really does does make skin feel smoother and more hydrated.  </li>
      <li>The pump delivers just the right amount of lotion and has an on/off valve</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s soothing, even right after shaving.  </li>
      <li>The 2-pack arrives with two Cetaphils in their own packages, with the two packages sealed together, so you know you are the first one to open it after it was packaged.</li>
      <li>I also put it on after getting about getting mild sunburn and it definitely made my skin much better.  </li>
      <li>Compared to a Nivea and a Dove, this was the most mild of the group as a daily face</li>
      <li>This handy little pump bottle contains a light lotion that is SPF</li>
      <li>A good product with little ingredients.</li>
      <li>so I expect to get several more months from this bottle.  </li>
      <li>We use Cetaphil lotion in our house for hands and  body so when this came up to try I was interested in giving it a try.</li>
      <li>As far as sunscreen protection, it works for commutes in the car and light sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a facial lotion, mostly because I&#x27;ve never thought I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a first for me.</li>
      <li>Fumy timing with this product because recently Consumer Reports recommend this exact product and had it in their top 10.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll just switch the dispenser heads when I use up the first bottle.</li>
      <li>I could tell that the moisture of this product worked exactly how it was advertised.  </li>
      <li>I use two squirts and that seems more than enough to generously cover my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a light, non-greasy moisturizer that quickly absorbs into your skin.</li>
      <li>In daily use the lotion is very light weight and spreads fast and evenly.</li>
      <li>Another notable and positive feature of the Cetaphil for me is the absence of any scent because I do have a tendency to wear a fragrance from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I take an extra minute to make sure it is rubbed in fine, I don&#x27;t have a greasy feel or extra &#x27;shine&#x27; to my face.</li>
      <li>The SPF is only 15, but that is still a 93% block for UVB and it&#x27;s broad spectrum, which means that it&#x27;s also effective against UVA radiation.  </li>
      <li>Wow, it&#x27;s silky smooth going on, no icky fragrance, no shiny face, no greasy residue, plus it protects you from the sun.  </li>
      <li>The dispenser is easy to use with a simple lock out to prevent accidental use.  </li>
      <li>Cetaphil has a long standing good name in skin care, and this product is the same.  </li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s skin breaks out easily on his neck after shaving so he rarely puts anything on his face unless it is very dry.</li>
      <li>I usually never apply any lotion to my face because of that - most especially after shaving.  </li>
      <li>The Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is light weight, non-greasy and in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t make it a habit to carry bottles around with me during the day and because of that I really don&#x27;t see the use in this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the face lotion I currently use. Cetaphil is good for dry sensitive skin and is not oily like some other face lotions I tried. I like that it includes sun screen too.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this face lotion out and while it does in fact work to soften the skin and protect you from the sun the one thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is you have to per directions reapply it every 2 hours. I don&#x27;t make it a habit to carry bottles around with me during the day and because of that I really don&#x27;t see the use in this. If this was a &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; lotion and it was once a day then it would be good. But the fact that it&#x27;s a every 2 hour lotion, not for me.</li>
    <li> My primary reason for getting this lotion was to use it to protect my face from sunburn while mowing the grass around my house. I&#x27;ve used several different sunblock lotions found in the grocery store for the past two years and just hate to use them because they are so very greasy don&#x27;t get absorbed into my skin - plus they often cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses Cetaphil moisturizing lotion regularly, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get absorbed into my skin anywhere near as well as Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion. So I haven&#x27;t been using Cetaphil for that reason.  I was even skeptical about getting this Cetaphin Men Daily lotion because of my prior experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Cetaphil Daily Face Lotion for a couple of weeks now but not every day. However, I do use it when I mow the grass to keep from getting sunburned and it is very effective as a sun block.  And when I apply it to my facial skin, it actually  feels like it gets fully absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is just stuck on the surface. And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t cause a skin rash or pimples the next day. Quite honestly, that surprised me. I usually never apply any lotion to my face because of that - most especially after shaving.  After shaving, my skin is rather sensitive and putting ordinary lotions on my face causes lots of pimples and often a skin rash as well, especially under my chin and upper neck, but also even on the sides of my face to a lesser degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m really pleased this Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation problems for me. That&#x27;s a first for me. So it appears the formulation is definitely different than the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion. Thankfully I received two plastic bottles of this lotion, because the plunger is jammed on one of them. So I&#x27;ll just switch the dispenser heads when I use up the first bottle. I may need to hide this because my wife wants to try it on her face as well.  She likes it better than her moisturizing lotion because it is absorbed into her skin better - same reason as I prefer it.turizing lotion because it is absorbed into her skin better - same reason as I prefer it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial lotion, mostly because I&#x27;ve never thought I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;My wife who is a cosmetologist and concerned about the negative effects of the sun, was thrilled that as I&#x27;m getting older, that I&#x27;d consider trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Works fine as a replacement for an aftershave lotion. Yeah, it&#x27;s not all nice and scented like an aftershave, but it does help the sensitive skin after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As a runner I&#x27;m in the sun often and often without sunblock. Getting in the habit of using this daily will help add some protection to my face, ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If I take an extra minute to make sure it is rubbed in fine, I don&#x27;t have a greasy feel or extra &#x27;shine&#x27; to my face. It is absorbed well with proper application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I use two squirts and that seems more than enough to generously cover my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Bottles are small enough that they can fit in one&#x27;s travel pack, though when security is high at the airport a 3.4oz would be better at carry on limits than a 4oz bottle. This is my only gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Moisturizes. Sunblock. Goes on well. A good product with little ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like this for immediately after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy after application and has a very light scent that is not feminine or too flowery.&lt;br /&gt;While it feels dry on my face after a minute, it feels hydrated to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as concerned about the SPF protection but that&#x27;s an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I do get light razor bumps on my neck after shaving occasionally, and this just really sooth&#x27;s that nicely.</li>
    <li> I am not one to slap on a lot of facial products, but this product has been fine so far. No real complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a fairly sunny climate, so rubbing on some sort of sun protection daily, after a close shave, is fairly routine. A big concern that I had when ordering is that I’m fairly sensitive to artificial scents, but so far that hasn’t been an issue with daily use. There is definitely a slight smell… but it’s not overwhelming and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what might be a strange observation – I notice that with other lotions/sunscreens, halfway throughout the day, if I lick my lips, I can get a very bitter taste… this is not the case with this particular brand and that counts for something in my book.&lt;br /&gt;A two-pack seems like overkill and will last a long time, but I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven’t noticed any rejuvenating effects yet, it’s been fine for sun protection, which is probably one of its better strengths. I can’t really comment if my face feel more hydrated, but I haven’t gotten any uglier… if that’s worth anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I haven’t had any reactions after a couple weeks of use, and that’s a very positive thing. I see myself continuing to use this for a while and replacing at least a couple of other lotions in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is light weight, non-greasy and in a convenient pump bottle. My husband used it after he shaved and as a daily moisturizer. He was satisfied with the benefits of using this moisturizer. My teenage sons use it daily and said that it is non-irritating and leaves their skin feeling smooth and soft. I’ve used it too and it works great. So while marketed for men, women can use it. Cetaphil is a brand that I have used in the past and trust. For about $33 dollars you get two convenient pump bottles, which in a household of 4 is reasonable and will last a while. I give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a mild and unassuming lotion. It has no fragrance. The only time I can smell it is if I put it right under my nose and it is a lotion smell, not a fragrance smell. It goes on and absorbs smoothly. Compared to a Nivea and a Dove, this was the most mild of the group as a daily face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works as an after shave as well, but personally, I still prefer the Nivea Post Shave balm. It feels more soothing but it also feels &amp;#34;louder&amp;#34; on the skin than the Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is economical, you can get as little as you want out, you can&#x27;t accidentally squeeze out too much - which is a plus considering the premium price. The 2-pack arrives with two Cetaphils in their own packages, with the two packages sealed together, so you know you are the first one to open it after it was packaged.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil has a long standing good name in skin care, and this product is the same.  Healthy and gentle for skin, does not leave skin feeling greasy, did not cause any breakouts.  All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Men&#x27;s Daily Face Lotion with SPF 15 is a product that surprised me.  Specially formulated for a man, this lotion promises that it will protect from sun exposure, leave skin feeling soft, and possibly erasing the effects of aging.  While I haven&#x27;t seen the finality of anti-aging, I have seen and even felt the results of sun exposure and softness.  My husband was my guinea pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the lotion on his face before working outside, I was pleasantly surprised to find that his face did not get as red as it does when it isn&#x27;t protected by SPF 15 and not to mention the lotion wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling on the skin or when applying.  After showering, my husband&#x27;s face was soft and I like how it felt. I could tell that the moisture of this product worked exactly how it was advertised.  It also seemed to dry up irritating blackheads after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product when our sample runs out.  It is just that awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> My son loves this men&#x27;s face lotion with sunscreen.  He has sensitive skin, that&#x27;s dry, so it soaks this up quickly without leaving a shine.  It&#x27;s light and spreads easily.  There is a faint sunscreen smell.  As far as sunscreen protection, it works for commutes in the car and light sun exposure.  It is not for swimming or water sports days.  I&#x27;d reapply in afternoon for more sun exposure if your first application was in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have a beard and only shave my neck.  Applying this lotion to my neck felt OK, but it&#x27;s messy when applied to my whole face and as the application, which is first thing in the morning, offers minimal protection from the sun at a time such protection is least needed - protection is SPF 15 and is said to last only two hours-  the protection seems a bit superfluous.  I&#x27;ll use it but see no reason to buy it.</li>
    <li> Light but pleasant smell.  No skin irritation thus far even when applying after shaving.  Protects from sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a slight oily layer on the skin but you get used to it.  Pump can be annoying as I have had a few time where it reverts back to its shipping state.  Maybe I didnt turn it hard enough initially.</li>
    <li> i have dry sensitive skin and tried multiple products.  This Cetaphil men lotion is as good as any brand.  What I like about it particularly is that it is absorbed quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind, is almost scentless, and provides UV protection.</li>
    <li> Nice light cream, doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or oily, no scent. This is a very good basic face lotion. The addition of SPF 15 just makes it that much nicer and more useful. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is labeled for men but can be for anyone. There is no scent. I use this every morning to moisturize while giving my face and neck necessary SPF protection. This is not heavy or greasy. I have sensitive skin and this has given me no trouble. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Wow, it&#x27;s silky smooth going on, no icky fragrance, no shiny face, no greasy residue, plus it protects you from the sun.  It&#x27;s really on pricey side if you intend to smear it on at the beach, or on your kids, however for day to day use on your face, hands and arms it&#x27;s quite nice. Men will like it because it really doesn&#x27;t have an intense smell.</li>
    <li> Really, I originally had this grand plan of doing an ingredient comparison of this Cetaphil Men’s Face Lotion with the Cetaphil &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; Men’s lotion, Dove Face Lotion, Dove After Shave lotion, Curel Body Lotion, generic pharmacy Body lotion and the Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm I’ve used for years. Then I realized that’s a lot more effort than I would ever be willing to take on for a review and let’s face it (no, not intended, just coincidental) I don’t have a clue about most of the alphabetically challenging ingredients in all of them, plus in the main, I don’t care. And, I&#x27;m not going to ignore the reality one way or another with the exception of the generic pharmacy lotion, I got all of them for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the facial lotions claim to relieve irritation and leave the skin hydrated with fast absorption in a non-greasy formula and they all do, including this one but I probably would use Crisco if that was my only alternative.  I don’t have any allergies of any nature and even formulas including alcohol (the Cetaphil does include Benzyl Alcohol) don’t bother me. As I also shave my head and really want to avoid the shiny dome state, I’m happy to report the lotion works well as a moisturizer without worries of a gleam. Another notable and positive feature of the Cetaphil for me is the absence of any scent because I do have a tendency to wear a fragrance from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the SPF 15 broad spectrum sunscreen protection, if I’m walking from my  door to the neighborhood mail kiosk and back I suppose that’s good enough but If I’m lying on a chaise lounge chair in the Caribbean I’m pretty sure I’m still going to use something that significantly kicks up the amps on the SPF factor.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, who was using an eczema body cream on his face for his overly dry spots. He quite likes it, as you can see from his perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a light, non-greasy moisturizer that quickly absorbs into your skin. Well, unless you cover your face with the stuff. A small amount, however, seems to hydrate my skin without clogging up my pores, which I&#x27;m happy about, as it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out or feel slimy like some other moisturizers. I have dry skin on my face that can peel and flake, especially during the winter when the air is cold and dry, and this lotion has hydrated my skin enough in a few days to remove any visible trace of that dryness. Of course, the dryness is still there, but applying this lotion once a day is all that I&#x27;ve needed to improve both the look and feel of my skin. The Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is unscented (or fragrance free, as someone else pointed out is the synonymous description used for women&#x27;s products), which is great, since I don&#x27;t want my face smelling like perfume all day. The packaging of the 4 oz bottle is convenient, as well, as the head of the squeeze top can turn to a locked position and prevent inadvertent moisturizing of the insides of your travel bags. Overall, this is a good product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great used as a lotion and a sunscreen.  I use the cetaphil mens daily facial wash before I shave and then the cetaphil daily facial lotion with sunscreen every morning.  The lotion rubs in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue or leave your face feeling greasy.  The pump delivers just the right amount of lotion and has an on/off valve so I can take it with me to the gym.</li>
    <li> As I have matured, I’ve learned that a little skin care goes a long way. I’m not really into gels and creams and exfoliating and moisturizing (although I use and do all that occasionally), but I recognize the advantages of using a good shave cream or gel and conditioning the skin afterwards. I’ve had good success with Dove for Men and Axe post-shaving products, one or two of which have some SPF built in, but for the summer I was looking for something with decent SPF that was also light enough to not get greasy if I sweat a little. Plus, I’m always willing to try something new, so I decided to try this Cetaphil product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is scent free, and I like the consistency. It is a little oily when it comes out of the bottle, but one squirt is enough to cover my whole face and it is quickly and cleanly absorbed into the skin. I did notice after a few uses that if I went a few days between applications, some of the liquid in the nozzle dried out and created a little lump of cream that took a bit to get reliquified and absorbed, but it was still quite easy to just smooth it into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t say much about the sun protection other than I didn’t notice my face getting noticeably burned or tanned during the time I was using this product. You have to be careful relying on this as a sunblock, too, because the label says to use a different sunblock if you are swimming or sweating (which is pretty much what happens all summer long, isn’t it?). At least once I put Cetaphil on in the morning after a run and with my pores wide open, I had a bit of a burning sensation when I applied this, even on the less sensitive and thicker skin of my hands. Thankfully, the burn subsided quickly and it didn’t make my skin red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I prefer some of my other shave products over this Cetaphil product, but I feel like this performed well enough to find a spot in my regular regimen, especially during the sunnier summer months here in the southern U.S. I rate it just a bit above average, at three and a half stars.months here in the southern U.S. I rate it just a bit above average, at three and a half stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been remiss about using a daily face lotion, and during the summer I find that I pay when I forget to use a sunscreen. This Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a light weight, non-offensively smelling, lotion that goes on very easy without an oily residue. The bottle&#x27;s pump is great for dispensing a small amount, which is key because a little goes a long way. The lotion provides nice sun protection for being out and about, but going to the beach I also use a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a guy who doesn&#x27;t tend to fuss with a lot of lotions and stuff, this Cetaphil Men Daily Face Lotion is a great, easy, unoffensive, option to quickly moisturize your face and protect it from the sun.</li>
    <li> This is a good skin lotion  for men, in that it is not greasy, has little in any odor(no perfume!), and really does does make skin feel smoother and more hydrated.  I&#x27;ve put it after shaving with a blade and it definitely makes skins feel good.  I also put it on after getting about getting mild sunburn and it definitely made my skin much better.  Although it is SPF 15, this is a pretty low level  of sun protection - you still would want to protect your skin with a hat or stronger sun product if you would going to have sustained exposure to bright sun (say the beach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as a nice moisturizer that also provides  some basic protection from the sun (and great to put on after being in the sun).</li>
    <li> Light lotion that goes on clear and smooth.  I like it. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s scent less though, it does have a bit of a scent I&#x27;m  not really a fan of.  But I do like the lotion overall.  It&#x27;s good quality and works well.</li>
    <li> For lotion like this I usually defer to the store brands as I have seen very little difference between them over the years.  In this case I expected a similar experience despite the well known name brand.  After using it daily for over a month now my experience has been similar to that from any of several similar products. That isn&#x27;t to say its bad just that this is somewhat of a commodity type product and all of them are pretty good. So, at this price point its hard to stand out.  In daily use the lotion is very light weight and spreads fast and evenly. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin, in other words it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like sweating immediately after you put it on.  That&#x27;s important in humid conditions as I have stopped using products because they are too thick for the humidity here in Florida.  But this has been nice and light and not an issue. It has a very neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t linger long. You can smell the SPF in it but that is the extent of its odor.  The dispenser is easy to use with a simple lock out to prevent accidental use.  I have found about a pump and a half is all I need to cover my face and neck.  After a month of daily use I&#x27;ve only used about a quarter to a third of the bottle so I expect to get several more months from this bottle.  My skin feels nice and smooth and looks good after use and it does provide a soothing feel after a shave.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts since using it. For me, occasional breakouts aren&#x27;t uncommon no matter what lotion I use so if it happens in the future I wouldn&#x27;t throw it out.  So the fact that after thirty days it hasn&#x27;t happened yet is a good sign to me.  Its difficulty to judge the effectiveness of the SPF in any of these products.  First off SPF 15 is pretty low so any intense sun exposure would blow through that level.  In general use though its useful if most of your day consists of going to the office or being indoors most of the day.  Overall, I am pleased with this lotion and have no complaints or concerns about using it daily. The price is competitive with the grocery/drug store brands so that really isn&#x27;t much of a decision factor either, especially considering a bottle lasts several months. So, this is a good value and a product I can easily recommend.</li>
    <li> This may be the perfect daily lotion for men.  It soothes your face post-shave and absorbs easier than other moisturizers having a comparable SBF, all without leaving your face looking white or feeling greasy.  This is an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime fan of Cetaphil products.  This handy little pump bottle contains a light lotion that is SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is not the least bit greasy and soaks in quickly.  There is no scent at all to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle has a small footprint, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Another trusted Cetaphil product that can sit side by side with the face wash and be used by both of us in the master bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nice to find quality products that are gender neutral and can be used by men and/or women.</li>
    <li> Being in my late 30s I am always on the lookout for face creams and other products that can help keep my skin healthier and younger looking. The biggest factor in skin damage and aging is the sun. Therefore, anything that keeps the sun at bay will help the face look younger and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great because it is a scent free sunscreen. It also goes on very light. After a minute or two, you can barely tell it is on your face. It isn&#x27;t greasy or visible. And, it truly doesn&#x27;t have a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is just sunscreen. I feel like they could&#x27;ve at least added a few other ingredients to help with facial rejuvenation (like Vitamin A, etc.). But, for what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s a great product. As far as I can tell, the whole &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; thing is just marketing. Anyone can use this. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product to help your face avoid sun damage.</li>
    <li> We use Cetaphil lotion in our house for hands and  body so when this came up to try I was interested in giving it a try. My husband&#x27;s skin breaks out easily on his neck after shaving so he rarely puts anything on his face unless it is very dry. He has been able to use this lotion without causing any breakouts. The sunscreen is the most important part of the lotion as we live in Texas and keeping the sun off our skin is a chore. The sunscreen is not really  noticalble and has not caused any issues or break outs. The pump is very convenient and makes it easy to dispense and use each day.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. Fumy timing with this product because recently Consumer Reports recommend this exact product and had it in their top 10. I have to agree. It&#x27;s smooth, non oily, has an ok smell and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s especially good for those with sensitive skin (which I have),</li>
    <li> For a long time there was only one aftershave lotion that Walmart sold that had sunscreen in it--the Neutrogena Men, Triple Protect Face Lotion with Sunscreen. This is sold in a 1.7 oz (50ml--i.e. very small) tube. I think the price per ounce, as currently listed on Amazon is quite close, perhaps slightly cheaper for the Cetaphil. It&#x27;s great that there is a competitor now, and that it comes in a larger pump. This is a product I use fairly frequently, mainly for the daily facial sun protection, living in a very sunny climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cetaphil is SPF 15, compared to Neutrogena SPF 20, and they use different active sunscreen ingredients, but both wear very similarly. I found the Cetaphil absorbs well and goes on lightly, without a heavy sunscreen feel at all--though my face ends up being slightly shiny with any lotion applied. However, it doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or sticky. It soothes razor burn and re-moisturizes. I like the product, my only suggestion would perhaps be to offer a option of higher SPF. This is great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have issues with most other sun screens because I hate the greasy feel and the way they cause my glasses to slip around.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave your face all greasy and it&#x27;s soothing, even right after shaving.  It&#x27;s certainly not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth it to avoid the usual problems with sun screens.  The SPF is only 15, but that is still a 93% block for UVB and it&#x27;s broad spectrum, which means that it&#x27;s also effective against UVA radiation.  I suppose it would be better if it were at least SPF 30 (97% UVB block) but, if that makes it greasy, smelly, or irritating, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the ladies use the regular stuff.  I think this is really great for guys.  Highly recommended.</li>
