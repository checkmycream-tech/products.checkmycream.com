### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am a very happy camper and thank you for offering them!</li>
      <li>This is great for your skin!</li>
      <li>Great feeling on my skin!</li>
      <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.</li>
      <li>This seller is great!!</li>
      <li>Lumene products are wonderful!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product.</li>
      <li>Excellent brand, great product</li>
      <li>This is really a win, win and again win situation.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I use this Bright Skin Nectar along with the 24 hour lotion  and my day cream</li>
      <li>Good price too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately, I chose to make my own serum using food-grade vitamin C (and will continue to make it every week).</li>
      <li>Kind of looked like it had already been used when I got it.</li>
      <li>Have been using is - and loving it - ever since.</li>
      <li>Very attentive to customers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now &amp; this is super good on your skin, helps diminish lines &amp; wrinkles with continuous use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE plus that it is inexpensive!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time to do that.</li>
      <li>Also, my pores have shrunk and I noticed that my makeup has been setting on my skin much better.</li>
      <li>and I am in love.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE.  </li>
      <li>My skin is brighter, more even toned, smoother texture and almost invisible pores.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love that it is visibly brighter.</li>
      <li>Then tried it on top of my acne cream, then in the morning before my Lumene Radiance day cream.</li>
      <li>Smells good, it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
      <li>For now...I like how it feels on the skin and the citrus smell is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now been using it over a month, but I noticed that after about a couple weeks of usage my skin looked more even and brighter.</li>
      <li>I still use another moisturizer on top of it.</li>
      <li>Seems to be helpful in keeping aging skin in better condition.</li>
      <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t find a better product.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to buy the Lumene beauty drops, which are amazing, but they weren&#x27;t available</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>so I tried this after reading good things about it and it really does work well.</li>
      <li>Bought the samples hoping it would not make me break out as it happens every time i use a new cream, but used them in Miami, loved them, bought some more.</li>
      <li>before I get into bed to avoid getting itchy eyes from the perfume and/or strong ingredients.  </li>
      <li>At their prices, I honestly recommend (especially fair skinned people) to at least try them!  </li>
      <li>I like the way it keeps my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Will enjoy using it until I can no longer buy it anywhere.  </li>
      <li>So far, CVS has best prices for Lumene products (they give you \\&quot;buy one, get one free\\&quot; deals and are always offering extra beauty coupons as members).</li>
      <li>I question whether the vitamin C in this is active - since most vitamin C serums are incredibly unstable that is accelerated by light and air, why is this in a clear bottle?</li>
      <li>I threw away the entire bottle as the contents of it looked kinda murky and not the bright orange</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, really brightens our complexion with continued use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna give it a full month.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am allergic to many skin products</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
      <li>Lumene Vit C Nectar adds moisture to my skin making other products glide on my skin better - love this product.</li>
      <li>Now looking for the 24h lotion as I found out that the radiance cream may be too rich a cream for the hot and humid climate I live in.</li>
      <li>I definitely have more of a glow to my skin.</li>
      <li>This was an inexpensive enough experiment that I was able to try out and judge for myself.</li>
      <li>I received it, I tried it and at first it made me break out.</li>
      <li>Have to admit that I like the Lumene BB serum better on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>I have occasional mild acne, but have always suffered large pores that are easily clogged.</li>
      <li>It feels nice on my skin...seems to have improved the texture slightly.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin (acne during certain times of the month)</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for any skin type as it&#x27;s gentle and not oily at all.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>But  I  think there are also other good products out there that will do the same thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Even Better Dark Spot Remover but that didn&#x27;t work for me even after 3-mos. application.  </li>
      <li>Now looking to stock up on more, can&#x27;t discontinue use of that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend, and it works on African American skin as well.</li>
      <li>Walgreens of course stopped selling this particular item.</li>
      <li>Maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only like $20, so I figured it would be worth the try.</li>
      <li>The only thing I changed was to use it at night right after cleansing with face cleanser and jojoba oil.</li>
      <li>I use this twice a day on my VERY sensitive skin and still no problems.  </li>
      <li>general, I really like Lumene products.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it loves this!</li>
      <li>As far as brightening....</li>
      <li>I was feeing that my face was looking warn, and old looking (from stress and lack of sleep)</li>
      <li>I bought this along with the Radiance Day Cream for my wife as she was not able to find either easily.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight a few pumps for my whole face!</li>
      <li>it takes very little and goes on smooth and it seems to have helped my face alot</li>
      <li>and since I used it with the same regimen I normally used before the nectar, I knew it was that.</li>
      <li>The challenge for me is that I can&#x27;t find it where I live (in the Southern hemisphere)</li>
      <li>It helps to put it on every night, or at least as many nights possible.</li>
      <li>since I&#x27;ve been using this no other time.  </li>
      <li>Very good moisturiser, especially if you have bad skin ( dry ).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much on facials trying to achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I did notice a difference not long after.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve spent so much on facials trying to achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
<li> and I did notice a difference not long after.</li>
<li> My skin is clearer, no more breakouts except the occasional ones after eating something I shouldn&#x27;t, all the acne black spots are almost entirely faded, my skin does look radiant, smoother, clearer, and more youthful, less oily (I have combination skin).</li>
<li> So over all it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, it controls my acne, my face is brighter and my hyperpigmentation scars are less noticeable.  </li>
<li> It arrived on time; maybe a little early.</li>
<li> It seems to leave a film on my hands if I use it there, but I don&#x27;t notice that on my face, so really not sure if it isn&#x27;t soaking into my hands as well, or what, but my hands are definitely starting to lose that old lady wrinkly look already.  </li>
<li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> :-/. It was also a little sticky when first applying.</li>
<li> So I recommend it if you have dry skin</li>
<li> I used the dry skin version.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin.</li>
<li> have samples of other products to try</li>
<li> This goes on well enough, and I broke out a little in the few days after applying.</li>
<li> And gives a litlle tan especially in the winter if you are very pale.</li>
<li> the stuff came out green.</li>
<li> A lot thicker, and hmmmm NECTAR like than I had expected (or, well, I didn&#x27;t think about it until I saw how thick it was and realized I hadn&#x27;t planned for that.)  </li>
<li> The make-up lady at Walgreens told me about this a few years ago.  </li>
<li> I am curious, though, if all batches of this product were so thick, or if mine has oxidized?</li>
<li> and you tend to look pale.</li>
<li> I try to use a small amount because a little seems to go</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff it just unfortunate they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore. You can&#x27;t beat this price either!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It truly improves the skins texture. I would buy this again. Good price too.</li>
    <li> This pairs well with the Lumene Vitaminc C+ Radiant Beauty Drops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. Walgreens of course stopped selling this particular item. I get it on Amazon now. It helps with skin elasticity. I like the way it keeps my skin smooth and hydrated. I still use another moisturizer on top of it. I have very dry skin. It definitely brightens my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I use this Bright Skin Nectar along with the 24 hour lotion  and my day cream and I must say, I didn&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;d have brighter skin but boy was I wrong. I actually see a noticeable difference. My skin almost seems to glow. I love that it is visibly brighter. I&#x27;ve spent so much on facials trying to achieve the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have samples of other products to try but I can&#x27;t bring myself to stop using this product. It looks like honey when you put it on and it turns into lotion. I try to use a small amount because a little seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product only during the day but the 24 hour lotion I use 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I think it&#x27;s well worth the price and I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I started using this product, because of a beauty article in Parents magazine. It&#x27;s only like $20, so I figured it would be worth the try. I&#x27;ve now been using it over a month, but I noticed that after about a couple weeks of usage my skin looked more even and brighter. Also, my pores have shrunk and I noticed that my makeup has been setting on my skin much better. I definitely have more of a glow to my skin. I would recommend it for any skin type as it&#x27;s gentle and not oily at all. You can also apply it once or twice a day, depending on your preference. I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day in the mornings.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this skin tonic. It&#x27;s like nothing else on the market. I used the dry skin version. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (acne during certain times of the month) since I&#x27;ve been using this no other time.  Basically, I rec&#x27;d this as a sample item from my local drugstore, I tried it and was immediately amazed.  My skin was instantely brighter.  So I went back and bought the regular size.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months and it does wonders, in fact; when I forget to us it and I have acne just under the skin and break out I start this nectar back and it goes away.  I use this twice a day on my VERY sensitive skin and still no problems.  So over all it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, it controls my acne, my face is brighter and my hyperpigmentation scars are less noticeable.  This is really a win, win and again win situation.  I&#x27;m about to start the vitamin c+ beauty drops (that I just rec&#x27;d via amazon)today.  I&#x27;ll write a review on that one in about 30 days.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight a few pumps for my whole face!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, really brightens our complexion with continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now &amp; this is super good on your skin, helps diminish lines &amp; wrinkles with continuous use. But will not buy from this seller again, this thing is a little darker than what I usually bought at Walmart, just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Radiance Day Cream for my wife as she was not able to find either easily. She loves them both and uses them daily.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. it takes very little and goes on smooth and it seems to have helped my face alot</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference. Kind of looked like it had already been used when I got it. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time; maybe a little early. Item as described. Gives your skin aglow.</li>
    <li> I like the product.. But  I  think there are also other good products out there that will do the same thing</li>
    <li> Ditto to all Lumene Products!  At their prices, I honestly recommend (especially fair skinned people) to at least try them!  I am a very happy camper and thank you for offering them!</li>
    <li> I have combination/sensitive/acne-prone skin. I have occasional mild acne, but have always suffered large pores that are easily clogged. I started this product almost a month ago and I am in love. My skin is brighter, more even toned, smoother texture and almost invisible pores. It has also helped unclog some of my already clogged pores! For the price, you can&#x27;t find a better product. I will definitely repurchase again and again. This has earned a permanent place in my skincare routine. I no longer need foundation!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to buy the Lumene beauty drops, which are amazing, but they weren&#x27;t available so I decided to give this product a try...no comparison. I&#x27;ve used it for weeks and never saw a difference. I&#x27;d pass on this one.</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin! I was feeing that my face was looking warn, and old looking (from stress and lack of sleep) so I tried this after reading good things about it and it really does work well. I put it on at night before bed and I did notice a difference not long after. It helps to put it on every night, or at least as many nights possible.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality and looked like they all are expired!!! Don&#x27;t order it people!!!! I&#x27;m not happy with it at all....very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Lumene Vit C Nectar adds moisture to my skin making other products glide on my skin better - love this product.</li>
    <li> I started using Lumene products 2 years ago, on a fluke.  They were a bogo and I am a Finlander (2nd generation) so figured; give Lumene a try.  Since then I have only used Lumene products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and after having open it for a month I did not use it for about a week when I do decide to use it the stuff came out green. I threw away the entire bottle as the contents of it looked kinda murky and not the bright orange it was.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helpful in keeping aging skin in better condition.</li>
    <li> A lot thicker, and hmmmm NECTAR like than I had expected (or, well, I didn&#x27;t think about it until I saw how thick it was and realized I hadn&#x27;t planned for that.)  It seems to leave a film on my hands if I use it there, but I don&#x27;t notice that on my face, so really not sure if it isn&#x27;t soaking into my hands as well, or what, but my hands are definitely starting to lose that old lady wrinkly look already.  My face, though, seems to not be getting any benefit from the product... YET.  It&#x27;s only been a week.  I am hopeful.  I am curious, though, if all batches of this product were so thick, or if mine has oxidized?</li>
    <li> Have to admit that I like the Lumene BB serum better on a daily basis. This product is thicker and does not absorb (at least on my skin) as well. BUT...that being said, I like to use it in the cold weather before going to bed. .In general, I really like Lumene products. I have sensitive skin and am allergic to many skin products but I have never had a bad reaction to anything I have tried in the Lumene line.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on my skin...seems to have improved the texture slightly. As far as brightening....I&#x27;ll give it more time to do that. I will edit my review at a later date. For now...I like how it feels on the skin and the citrus smell is refreshing.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference after using day and night for two weeks. Maybe my expectations were too high. :-/. It was also a little sticky when first applying.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without it. Lumene products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent brand, great product</li>
    <li> This seller is great!! Very attentive to customers. I will definitely buy again!&lt;br /&gt;The product is terrific. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It has truly helped me lighten my acne scars. It&#x27;s a HUGE plus that it is inexpensive!</li>
    <li> The make-up lady at Walgreens told me about this a few years ago.  Have been using is - and loving it - ever since. Now it seems as thought Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. Had to buy it thru Amazon.  Will enjoy using it until I can no longer buy it anywhere.  Great feeling on my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any big changes.  I&#x27;m gonna give it a full month.  It does have 15% Vitamin C in it which is why I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I question whether the vitamin C in this is active - since most vitamin C serums are incredibly unstable that is accelerated by light and air, why is this in a clear bottle? This goes on well enough, and I broke out a little in the few days after applying. Whether that&#x27;s a function of the ingredients in this products or a weird correlation with the weather, it&#x27;s up to the reader to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I chose to make my own serum using food-grade vitamin C (and will continue to make it every week). This was an inexpensive enough experiment that I was able to try out and judge for myself.</li>
    <li> LOVE.  I have sensitive skin and it loves this!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and anything that is thick will clog my pores and make me break out. This is really thick and made me break out. So do not buy if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Last summer, I stumbled upon this Lumene brand when I was looking for a travel size face cream. Bought the samples hoping it would not make me break out as it happens every time i use a new cream, but used them in Miami, loved them, bought some more. Then I decided to check out the entire brand, and after reading about this nectar, decided to get one. The challenge for me is that I can&#x27;t find it where I live (in the Southern hemisphere) so had to order off Amazon and wait a while to have it brought to me.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I tried it and at first it made me break out. Not a lot but I did break out and since I used it with the same regimen I normally used before the nectar, I knew it was that. But then, since it had travel for miles to get to me, I decided I would continue use of it and see if the breakouts worsen, then I would discontinue. Well, I&#x27;m glad I did. The only thing I changed was to use it at night right after cleansing with face cleanser and jojoba oil. Then tried it on top of my acne cream, then in the morning before my Lumene Radiance day cream. Anyway, now I can say this product does the job!! My skin is clearer, no more breakouts except the occasional ones after eating something I shouldn&#x27;t, all the acne black spots are almost entirely faded, my skin does look radiant, smoother, clearer, and more youthful, less oily (I have combination skin). And my make up lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;So it does work. Now looking to stock up on more, can&#x27;t discontinue use of that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend, and it works on African American skin as well. Now looking for the 24h lotion as I found out that the radiance cream may be too rich a cream for the hot and humid climate I live in.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturiser, especially if you have bad skin ( dry ). Smells good, it&#x27;s fresh. And gives a litlle tan especially in the winter if you are very pale. So I recommend it if you have dry skin and you tend to look pale.</li>
    <li> My face is finally one color although not all of my freckles or spots have disappeared.  It definitely took time to get there (I&#x27;m almost at the end of the bottle with 1/3 inch left) and I can see a difference.  I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Even Better Dark Spot Remover but that didn&#x27;t work for me even after 3-mos. application.  Lancome irritated my eyes as did other expensive creams but I&#x27;ve since learned to apply night creams 10-15 mins. before I get into bed to avoid getting itchy eyes from the perfume and/or strong ingredients.  So far, CVS has best prices for Lumene products (they give you \\&quot;buy one, get one free\\&quot; deals and are always offering extra beauty coupons as members).</li>
