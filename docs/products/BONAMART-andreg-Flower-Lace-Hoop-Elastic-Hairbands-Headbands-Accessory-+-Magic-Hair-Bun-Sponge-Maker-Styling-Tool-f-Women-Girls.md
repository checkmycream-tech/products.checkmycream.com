<li> So if you have a small head it will be loose.</li>
<li> but the pearls are less shiny in actuality.</li>
<li> A little tight.</li>
<li> Love the headband, but hated that it took over three weeks to get to me from China.</li>
<li> You can always tie a small knot in the band.</li>
<li> I wear at least once a week.</li>
<li> I am disappointed in this headband.</li>

    <li> Very pretty, Great condition :) Only thing is, it&#x27;s a little loose. So if you have a small head it will be loose. You can always tie a small knot in the band. That&#x27;s what I had to do.</li>

    <li> Got these for my wife, but she doesn&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very lovely and arrived early. It fits well for me. I have a small head and there is a bit more room, so I can barely feel this while wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t move around a lot though because it&#x27;s fabric.</li>

    <li> I am disappointed in this headband. It is beautiful and looks fantastic on, but after wearing it twice it completely stretched out and is now useless. Save your money.</li>
    <li> For the price it works perfect to keep my hair off my face and stylish</li>
    <li> The shipping time was pretty long, but I was aware of that because it ships from Asia. The headband looks just like the picture and I love mine! I was a little concerned about buying it because the reviews were kind of mixed. Some people said that it broke the day they got it, but others said that theirs hasn&#x27;t broke and that they have had it for months. So far , I love this headband, I am satisfied with this product!</li>

    <li> Beautiful headband that classes up any outfit.  It is large, but you can easily add a slip know to make it smaller.  Just lovely.</li>
    <li> This needs several hair pins to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> Love the headband, but hated that it took over three weeks to get to me from China. Will be more careful and buy from a place in the US next time.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty pearls are cute looks great shipping is fast on this one</li>
    <li> Pretty. A little tight. S</li>
    <li> It looks pretty and is comfortable to wear. It had a few stray threads that were easily snipped off from the edges.</li>

    <li> I receive compliments when I wear it.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  It goes well when I wear pearls or other dressy jewelry.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful headband for those occasions where pearls would be appropriate.  I do not wear a lot of jewelry.  So, wearing a headband like this in my long dark hair is striking.  I have gotten a lot of compliments on this one.  I love the way it fits -- it is comfortable and stretchy.  The pearls are hand sewn onto the mesh.  It&#x27;s just lovely and feminine.</li>
    <li> Very attractive, comfortable</li>
    <li> So cute. I wear at least once a week.</li>
    <li> This headband lasted longer than any other of this type Ive bought on amazon.  It actually had time to stretch out and did not break.  Can&#x27;t use it anymore but got a lot of use for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, broke first time I put it on.</li>
