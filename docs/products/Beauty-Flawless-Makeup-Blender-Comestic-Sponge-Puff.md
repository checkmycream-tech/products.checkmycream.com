      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more products, love it!</li>
      <li>PRETTY GOOD FOR A KNOCK OFF BEAUTY BLENDER!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of these from amazon, and this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>On the good side tho, it&#x27;s cheap cause</li>
      <li>This shape is very easy to hold and it makes applying makeup faster and more even.  </li>
      <li>you dampen the sponge with water beforehand, it will become much softer, and it applies the makeup beautifully.</li>
      <li>I love putting on make up and fixing my make up with this sponge.</li>
      <li>im glad for that.</li>
      <li>ordered yellow but got purple lol but its ok good sponge</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much better than using disposable sponges all the time.</li>
      <li>Cheap too!</li>
      <li>,  product is OK,  it does the job</li>
      <li>This is my favorite tool for putting on makeup.</li>
      <li>Also it does get softer and better overtime.</li>
      <li>I love this sponge.</li>
      <li>Search for better knock offs...</li>
      <li>I have purchased many beauty blender knock offs</li>
      <li>Sure can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I ordered this to just test out, it is okay, its rather ruff.</li>
      <li>I felt I ended up using more foundation with it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable sponge that blended well without leaving smear marks.</li>
      <li>and I really am glad I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>I have another imitations of beauty blender and beauty blender too, but this one is most alike of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rubbery more than sponge-y.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Not too happy about this sponge, it&#x27;s a small sponge and not to happy.</li>
      <li>I think its better to get the ones available at Marshalls/T J Maxx than this sponge blender.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I love the original beauty blender and thought if I could find something that was close and could save me some money why not.</li>
      <li>I like the fine point that helps get under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the sponge is absolutely phenomenal and it is totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>All in all this sponge is great for the price but definitely not a dupe for the beauty blender-</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean (although it stains, but don&#x27;t all sponges?).  </li>
      <li>I got mine in the mail this morning, and i was happy to open it.</li>
      <li>This was dirt cheap, that&#x27;s why I bought it.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap and the build is cheap as well.  </li>
      <li>Does the job and as I said it was a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>Got free shipping on it as well</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a more affordable alternative to the Beauty Blender.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking with the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>It does not have the bouncy, softer feel that the original has.</li>
      <li>Even when i try to clean it nothing comes out.</li>
      <li>And super cheap</li>
      <li>Just make sure you really blend or work the product in.</li>
      <li>In fact I&#x27;d say this sponge is a tad better than the miracle sponge because it&#x27;s very durable and hasn&#x27;t suffered any tears or rips unlike my miracle sponge.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it, but compared to other sponges I have tried, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best sponge dupe for the beauty blender.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> NICE MAKEUP SPONGES. HARD TO CLEAN THOUGH. GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> This is a horrible dupe, i used it once and threw it away. It soaks up all your product if your using a liquid concealer that is. i wouldnt but this again if it was on sale for a penny with no shipping and handling fees.</li>
    <li> This arrived EXACTLY one month after I ordered it. (Ordered Oct 19th, arrived November 19th.) So make sure you order this with plenty of time to spare if you need it for any particular event to do your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is hard, and when I applied the makeup when the sponge was dry, the sponge just sucked it up and sort of sat on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;If you dampen the sponge with water beforehand, it will become much softer, and it applies the makeup beautifully. I really like it, because it does not leave behind any streaks, and I can dab on to the nooks and crannies around my nose, and it is easy to build on for fuller coverage if you need it. I can also feel good about not touching my face with my fingers when they might have bacteria. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking that a lot of brushes leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one huge downside I see with any blending sponge in general (even the Beauty Blender) is that you end up using a LOT more foundation than you would when applying with a makeup brush or your fingers. I felt guilty seeing so much unused product that had gotten sucked up into the sponge going down my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product could be great if you are looking to have full coverage for a wedding or some other special event, but I don&#x27;t recommend this for daily use.</li>
    <li> Not like the Beauty Blender- harder. But still gets the job done for a FRACTION of the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the more expensive original beauty blender. It applies make up nicely and is soft and expends when wet as well. It really helps to blend foundation with skin. Would deff repurchase</li>
    <li> I like it for my first beauty blender I didn&#x27;t want to get an expensive one</li>
    <li> sucks up a lot of the foundation.</li>
    <li> I usually use a foundation brush, but thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I really didn&#x27;t see any difference between the two methods.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem any different from using those disposable sponges, though this will hold up a lot longer with regular washes.  I think this product is probably an improvement over using fingers alone, and for a few bucks it&#x27;s not bad, but I definitely would not pay the $20-$30 some companies ask for their makeup sponges.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to just test out, it is okay, its rather ruff. i used it about the first 3 weeks and since it has just sat in my vanity. I do like the tip of it for blending in hard to reach places, i just ordered new brush sets and they work just as well. This is something that would be great to keep in your purse or car to have handy when you need a quick blend!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason why these sponges are inexpensive, they&#x27;re hard and absorb the makeup. I&#x27;m sticking with the original beauty blender.</li>
    <li> PRETTY GOOD FOR A KNOCK OFF BEAUTY BLENDER! DECENTLY PLEASED WITH IT!</li>
    <li> Exactly like the beauty blender. Gets double in size when wet. Worth buying before u spend 20bucks for the blender.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy in my opinion.  It is soft and works really well to smooth out foundation, bb cream, concealer... I don&#x27;t add water,I just use it as is and I really like the results.  It is easy to clean (although it stains, but don&#x27;t all sponges?).  I would buy this again and probably will once this one wears out.  I like the fine point that helps get under my eyes.  This shape is very easy to hold and it makes applying makeup faster and more even.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, it is so incredibly hard that water cant even penetrate through it. This makes it far to difficult to blend</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand how this sponge will get many good reviews with such poor quality, or at least the one shipped to me. It&#x27;s a very hard rubbery sponge (even after soaking in the water) and BOTH points has extra rubber material hanging out that poke my fingers when I touch it. Then I noticed there is a small circle shape stamp of extra under the point at the large bottom. So I had to use scrissor to cut out the extra but left uneven surface on both ends. I will never use this hard rubber, uneven thing onto my face.  If they&#x27;ve ever made good ones like the good reviews said, then they have quality issue as mine is totally unusable. Plus it never gets softer or larger after soaking in the water. Very very disappointed for this bad sponge.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 and only got 1. I wonder if i were have to order one would it have came.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected, but about the size of my authentic Beauty Blender sponge, so it&#x27;s great for travel. Holds up well, cleans well, and I&#x27;ve had no complaints about it. Overall, the quality is fine. Sure can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
    <li> great at blending concealer and foundation, but i dont use foundation anymor,e so i use it just for concealer. It grew when i washed it and im glad for that. I took a while to come but i didnt mind.</li>
    <li> To small and texture is a little rough</li>
    <li> Love these makeup sponges! Great price too. I bought 2 of them and can get a a few months use out of them (with regular cleanings)</li>
    <li> This sponge is a little bit softer than the bottle gourd but it works really well to i love it because it great working around the eyes since it has that point.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this makeup sponge. Starting off with it is a lot smaller then the average sponge. It is also very hard even when damp it didn&#x27;t get bigger nor softened up. But then again i did pay $1.17 so i shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
    <li> I love this! Cheap too! It blends out my makeup perfectly! So glad I found this! I definitely didn&#x27;t have an extra $30 laying around to buy a beauty blender! Best dupe!</li>
    <li> Nothing like the Beauty Blender but does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again though. I may just save up and buy the actual thing. Mine doesn&#x27;t swell up and my foundation gets stuck inside the product. Even when i try to clean it nothing comes out. It&#x27;s meh..</li>
    <li> This sponge is a little bit more orange than yellow. Compared to the pink sponge at Target, this sponge is waaay better! It&#x27;s not stiff, very flexible. I love it!! :)</li>
    <li> I revived it weeks before it said which I was very happy with since it comes from china packaging was good the sponge is amazing I thought it would be just a tad bit bigger but I still really like it I&#x27;ll prob but more in the future</li>
    <li> This sponge is really hard and is no where near as soft as the original beauty blender. However, it did get softer after multiple uses. I wet it and use it to apply my liquid foundation.  It gives the same results as my miracle complexion sponge by Samantha Chapman. In fact I&#x27;d say this sponge is a tad better than the miracle sponge because it&#x27;s very durable and hasn&#x27;t suffered any tears or rips unlike my miracle sponge. This one doesn&#x27;t increase in size like the beauty blender. All in all this sponge is great for the price but definitely not a dupe for the beauty blender- if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I have another imitations of beauty blender and beauty blender too, but this one is most alike of it. I like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to try and say this the best way possible,&lt;br /&gt;I DONT LIKE IT.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a few thing wrong with this product. First shipping took forever what was suspected so I&#x27;m just going to let it fly. It has a nerf ball texture and doesn&#x27;t expand, it&#x27;s rough, hard to blend with, and overall too small. On the good side tho, it&#x27;s cheap cause no body wants to pay $20 for a sponge. Also it does get softer and better overtime. But first impression, IT SUCKS</li>
    <li> 1 great, 2 great, 3 great, 4 great, 5 great,  6 great, 7 great, 8 great, 9 great,  10 great, 11 great, 12 great sponge !!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first sponge I&#x27;ve bought so I have nothing to compare it too but it works well for me. Just make sure you really blend or work the product in. I have no complaints and I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times for concealer under my eyes.</li>
    <li> tough, doesnt expand like other make up sponges. i am glad i only paid like a dollar for this. although it wasnt even worth that. DO NOT BUY THIS if you are looking for something similar to the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to follow the hype of the expensive beauty blender sponge.  I settled for this one and I have to say that I like it.  It does the job.  Just dampen the sponge a little bit and dab, dab, dab.  I like the results of my concealer when I use this sponge.</li>
    <li> Not too happy about this sponge, it&#x27;s a small sponge and not to happy. Nothing much I could say. ehhh</li>
    <li> Even if it is just a few bucks, it&#x27;s not work it. I ending up throwing it away after trying to use it a few time. It is so stiff it won&#x27;t do the job, even when I soaked it in water. I found one at Ulta from Stila for $12 that works perfect.</li>
    <li> This was not worth my money or time, it took forever to get to me and it wastes precious makeup. I would just buy the name brand beauty blender. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth what you pay for because this wastes makeup.</li>
    <li> I wear makeup on a daily basis and I don&#x27;t use this sponge on a daily basis. People make it seem like this sponge is the holly grail but I still think foundation brushes are much easier to use than these sponges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable sponge that blended well without leaving smear marks. This sponge works well on different types of foundation. I&#x27;ve tried BB cream by Maybeline, and I&#x27;ve also tried Dream Liquid Mousse by Maybeline, which is quite a bit thicker, still no smear lines. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this sponge transferring a previously used foundation to my face and trying to blend with the foundation I&#x27;m currently trying to use. This sponge is also durable. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it still hasn&#x27;t crumbled or fallen apart. Very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a more affordable alternative to the Beauty Blender.</li>
    <li> I ordered it.. It came in the mail... Then after using it once.. I ripped... I didn&#x27;t even put force on it.. Plus there really small! Disappointed</li>
    <li> Way too small and hard</li>
    <li> Even though the picture shows a greenish sponge, the real thing is pure yellow.  It&#x27;s not as squishy as the beauty blender, but it blends flawlessly and isn&#x27;t as hard as some other dupes.  The sponge is about as long as my index finger when it&#x27;s damp, and a little smaller when dry.  The only con I can think of is that it&#x27;s impossible to get the color of foundation out of it, but that&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great little sponge, worth the money c:</li>
    <li> This sponge didn&#x27;t work well, it absorbs 90% of the foundation and is really dense. Its so dense it feels like yu&#x27;re punching your face.</li>
    <li> Not impressed, sponge is not even near a dupe for the beauty blender.  Its very small, does not expand when wet and is very hard.  It just looks cute, but its so small I have no clue what I could use it for-its too hard to use for undereye concealor- the texture will be too rough on that tender skin.  Just decorates my make up stand- no other use for it, not even worth the $$ paid.  It was cheap and the build is cheap as well.  In this case you definately get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Still using it and it&#x27;s almost been a year!</li>
    <li> The sponge was too small and way too hard</li>
    <li> This was dirt cheap, that&#x27;s why I bought it.  Compared to store prices, this was worth a try.  It&#x27;s very solid, if you want a more supple one, this is not it.  Does the job and as I said it was a cheap price.  So no complaints.</li>
    <li> it is really smaller than I expected. I&#x27;m a little disappointed .So You get exactly what you pay for here.</li>
    <li> The sponge did not expand and it soaked up all of my product. I have purchased many beauty blender knock offs and this is not a good one. I was so frustrated that I just went ahead and bought the real beauty blender. Search for better knock offs...</li>
    <li> Bought this because i kept hearing the beauty blender was a must have for anyone who uses makeup. But i wasn&#x27;t willing to buy the beauty blender at $20 so i went for this one. Let me tell you it gets the job done and its a great dupe for the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I did not like this. It didn&#x27;t bounce on my face and it completely fell apart. Not worth buying. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> ordered yellow but got purple lol but its ok good sponge</li>
    <li> I refuse to believe that anyone who has actually owned and used a real beauty blender can think this product comes anywhere close to the same type of quality. It&#x27;s not even close besides the shape. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on what the material reminded me of until I walked into my sons room and saw it&#x27;s twin on his floor. A nerf ball. Those foam balls that you can shoot out of an air pumped shooter. This blender is the twin to a nerf ball. I have taken side by side comparison shots of this next to my authentic beauty blender. It&#x27;s not even close. The texture, thickness, quality. Nope. I don&#x27;t care that it cost me a dollar if I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s so hard even when wet. It does get a tiny bit bigger but that doesn&#x27;t help. So like I said, not worth it. I love the original beauty blender and thought if I could find something that was close and could save me some money why not. I guess you get what you pay for. And if I can figure how to attach my images to this product I will.</li>
    <li> This sponge blender is nothing I expected. It is hard and rough on the face...it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re punching yourself every time you press the foundation on your face. I was hoping it would be similar to the beauty blender. I tried this &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34; about 10 times and it soaked up so much product and didn&#x27;t distribute much on my face. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the beauty blender</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t expand under water like it should,  Hard as a rock. SOOOO SMALL. don&#x27;t waste your couple dollars. Took forever to get to me as well</li>
    <li> Loved it! And super cheap</li>
    <li> This is the best dupe for the name brand sponge I&#x27;ve found. Not hard or the wrong shape like some of them, and expands when you run it under water like it should. Flawless airbrush coverage, LOVE. Got free shipping on it as well and it arrived pretty quickly, within a week.</li>
    <li> Way to small and hard as a rock, even if you dip in water.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Do not buy product.</li>
    <li> love this sponge! its cheaper than the BB and works just as well! love how my foundation looks super natural after using this! will be purchasing more! if you want the BB but dont want to spend the $$$ just get this! its also easy to wash with soap and water.. very happy with my purshase.</li>
    <li> Was delivered fast &amp; it works great !</li>
    <li> Works Great. Just Don&#x27;t Press on The Sponge As you Blend It, Or You&#x27;ll Get Som Spots. clean Regularly too</li>
    <li> i would buy again but not as good as the beauty blender. n i noticed that it wouldnt swell up the same after a few weeks of usage bt still usable they are pretty nice to have on hand thou.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tool for putting on makeup. I love it. It&#x27;s so much better than using disposable sponges all the time. No, I have no idea what a dupe is or even care. It&#x27;s just a sponge.</li>
    <li> This blender is the BOMB!! It blends my makeup so effortlessly!!! The quality of the sponge is absolutely phenomenal and it is totally worth the price. All I do is wet it and the rest is history. The key to this sponge when applying  makeup is to use a patting motion.</li>
    <li> I might as well have bought a bag of those nasty little rubber wedges at the drug store.  I use a sheer makeup, and this just pushes around what it doesn&#x27;t absorb.  As for soft--I was thinking squeezably soft.  This thing has the texture of the balls I get for my Chihuahuas to play with.  As a matter of fact, I just gave it to the dogs.  I am really disappointed, and this was a very expensive dog toy!</li>
    <li> Ii guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention on asking the size,  Price and shipping where great,  product is OK,  it does the job but it fits small on my hand</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I will purchase more as it makes your makeup blend well!</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture i&#x27;ll give it props that it&#x27;s the same color but not it&#x27;s size. It&#x27;s very small and round i would have thought that it would be a little slimmer like it does in the pic but it is just misleading. It actually apply my foundation pretty well but overall i think it&#x27;s okay but i&#x27;m a little disappointed. :/</li>
    <li> Seriously the best sponge dupe for the beauty blender. It&#x27;s super soft expands really well when wet and applies concealers flawlessly. And the color is just so pretty. Totally different form others ive seen. I&#x27;m very impressed. Shipping wasn&#x27;t terrible and the packaging was nicely put away in its original packaging. I&#x27;m totally purchasing more of these. I just cant complain. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I have not tried the beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare it, but compared to other sponges I have tried, this is a great product. It is very soft and absorbs water quickly. Well worth the money and quick shipping. A must have in your beauty kit.</li>
    <li> I love this little sponge. I love putting on make up and fixing my make up with this sponge. I could be like a make up artist, too by using this.</li>
    <li> why pay so much money for the beauty blender when this sponge is a wonderful dupe for the beauty blender! the only con i would have is that it is smaller then the beauty blender but that did not effect its performance in the slightest! very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail this morning, and i was happy to open it. However, when i did, i found that the sponge inside was much smaller than i had thought it was going to be (eh thats okay i guess, just takes longer) and the product was a lime green color instead of the yellow. The sponge was hard, even when run under water for a good twenty minutes.</li>
    <li> The sponge was good I don&#x27;t tend to reach for it as much I felt I ended up using more foundation with it as well it was alright</li>
    <li> This works so well for applying foundation! Especially when a blended and natural look is desired. The only down side to this sponge is that it&#x27;s a bit too small for all over face application. It takes a while to fully cover the entire face. Other than that it&#x27;s great! Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> the sponge is SUPER small, i was actually expecting it to be a decent size, like any other sponge you see at the store, but it was really small. still will do the work, just disappointed in how small it is.</li>
    <li> Rubber.....stinks....don&#x27;t order</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a dupe for the higher end pink bb sponge. I&#x27;m sad to say this isn&#x27;t a dupe. I have the original sponge, and although it is much more expensive it works much better. This sponge is shaped similarly, but it is much, much denser. It does not have the bouncy, softer feel that the original has. This is important because this sponge simply stamps your foundation onto your face instead of blending it out. It will maybe replace your regular white, triangle makeup sponges, but it can&#x27;t replace the bb sponge.</li>
    <li> Simple as that.  If you bought the $20 one at Sephora, this is nothing like it.  It&#x27;s rubbery more than sponge-y.  Doesn&#x27;t feel good on your skin.  Would work in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I got this item today and I&#x27;m very disappointed .The size is about as small as a lime probably smaller.And it&#x27;s not even the color in the pic.Its teal .</li>
    <li> It was late &amp; extremely tiny!</li>
    <li> Flawlesssssss!!!  my foundation is more easy to apply , I wear nars sheer matte foundation and blending with this is super natural finish</li>
    <li> this product is a waste of your money. just spend the extra money and get a real beauty blender. big difference</li>
    <li> I got one of the dupes of beauty blender from T J Maxx and it works great. One of my friends wanted one, so I got ordered this from amazon. I was a little disappointed coz this sponge blender is really small in size. I know that it should expand in size when wet but still its size is much smaller than the dupe I got from Maxx which cost me $4. I think its better to get the ones available at Marshalls/T J Maxx than this sponge blender.</li>
    <li> simply cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of these from amazon, and this is by far the best! It gives a perfect finish to my foundation!</li>
    <li> The product is awesome and I really am glad I purchased it.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more products, love it!</li>
    <li> great cheaper version of the beauty blender....use wet or dry. very durable and doesn&#x27;t have any scent like some cheap ones do. great deal!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this sponge! It looks real small when you first get it, but once you put it under water, it expands to 3x the size it was. It applys makeup so flawlessly! I love it! I just dab foundation on my face, then pat pat pat the sponge all over for a perfect coverage! Get this sponge! you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> So good! I realy think it&#x27;s good quality and is nice to apply foundation, primer, bb or cc cream. I did two repurchases.</li>
    <li> When i first got the dupe beauty blender i was scared to try it because the material wasnt&#x27;t the same from the original. But i was wrong once you wet the sponge it leaves your foundation flawless. I would so recomend it.</li>
