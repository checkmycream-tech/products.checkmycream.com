      <li>these are the only kind I use anymore, they don&#x27;t give me a headache</li>
      <li>One good thing that I did notice is that wearing it all day did not give me a headache as some other clips have,</li>
      <li>Overall I love this even if I just use it for a ponytail.</li>
      <li>I bought it because several reviewers said that it works great with their long hair.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it lies relatively flat against my head, not sticking out getting caught on the headrest in my car.</li>
      <li>Big and Strong....</li>
      <li>I have had one that looks just like this and the clip was much stronger</li>

      <li>Which works well with my long, very straight hair!</li>
      <li>I found it on line, can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised!</li>
      <li>This shape can go higher on my head and lays fairly flat.  </li>
      <li>My problem is that my hair is thin and fine and tends to just slide right out.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely a 5 star clip at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Sometimes my hair will slide right out the circle in the center of the clip.  </li>
      <li>I have long thick hair,this clip holds it all up nicely.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding clips that will easily hold ALL of my long, thick, wild, curly hair and this does :)</li>
      <li>no other clip works as well.</li>
      <li>Broad &amp; sturdier.  </li>
      <li>It does come loose if I make too much movement</li>
      <li>I have thick, fine hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered all I could find because apparently goody has discontinued them.</li>
      <li>Great clip for long, thick hair, but it broke after only a few uses.</li>
      <li>I love these clips for my long thick hair but this one with in a month.</li>
      <li>My hair goes down to my elbows, and I purchased this clip because it specifies it&#x27;s good for long, thick hair.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had long hair since the 80s and this clip is new to me.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it failed spectacularly at a party last night and a piece flew off and almost poked someone&#x27;s eye</li>
      <li>and I have to frequently readjust this clip since it won&#x27;t stay in place for long.</li>
      <li>This is the only type of clip I&#x27;ve found that securely holds my long, thick hair up without hurting or falling out.</li>

<li> /&gt;That being said, even though it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;m thinking of buying another because it&#x27;s not any worse than other hair clips, and it&#x27;s far more comfortable than the standard claw clips.</li>
<li> She can lay in bed flat on her back with it and it won&#x27;t hurt the back of her head.</li>
<li> I have very long (almost reaches my hips), thick, heavy hair and have not been able to find any clips that will keep it up.  </li>
<li> I am really lame when it comes to styling my hair so this clip is a favorite because it slips in from the side so you can hold your hair in place with one hand as the other hand slides this clip in and lets it close.</li>
<li> This clip feel sturdy, but it&#x27;s not as big as I expected.  </li>
<li> I have thick, straight hair, and I cannot get all of it in this clip.  </li>
<li> As wide as my hand~about 4 inches</li>
<li> They are also really sharp.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> My hair never falls out and I never get a head ache associated with other claw type hair clips.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if our definitions of &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; are different, but my hair goes down to about my waistline</li>
<li> This clip holds all my hair, however is not as tight to hold my hair as expected.</li>
<li> you don&#x27;t even feel the clip in your hair when lying down.</li>
<li> The clip is not very strong.</li>
<li> and it holds a bun in my active all day job!</li>
<li> I have long, wavy, thick hair</li>
<li> I have long thick hair</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hair and this shape of claw clip holds my hair well, without giving me a headache.  </li>
<li> I have a hard time finding a clip that will hold all of my long thick hair up in a knot.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a few inches past her shoulders</li>
<li> I bought her some of the usual &amp;#34;claw&amp;#34;</li>
<li> and I hit the brakes really hard.</li>
<li> I purchased this hairclip for my wife who has incredibly thick, wavy hair.</li>
<li> and I do not have thick, thick hair.</li>
<li> Holds thick hair well, but the color is lighter in person than what is pictured.</li>
<li> The claws are made way too thin and do not stand up against very thick hair.</li>
<li> WTF</li>

    <li> My favorite. As most people state, these clips are no longer available in stores (I don&#x27;t know know why). They hold my hair perfectly all day and I do not have thick, thick hair.</li>
    <li> This clip is perfect! Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> great for long full hair</li>
    <li> I bought it because several reviewers said that it works great with their long hair. Not so with mine! I&#x27;m not sure if our definitions of &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; are different, but my hair goes down to about my waistline and I have to frequently readjust this clip since it won&#x27;t stay in place for long. One good thing that I did notice is that wearing it all day did not give me a headache as some other clips have,</li>
    <li> Clip doesnt hold hair well at all.</li>
    <li> The clip is very easy to place in your hair.  My problem is that my hair is thin and fine and tends to just slide right out.  Sometimes my hair will slide right out the circle in the center of the clip.  I think this clip would work great for someone who has long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great larger clip, and really pretty!  I can lounge at the pool in total comfort - you don&#x27;t even feel the clip in your hair when lying down. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only type of clip I&#x27;ve found that securely holds my long, thick hair up without hurting or falling out.</li>
    <li> This does hold a LOT of hair! I was actually surprised! I have a hard time finding clips that will easily hold ALL of my long, thick, wild, curly hair and this does :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had long hair since the 80s and this clip is new to me. I love it. It is very comfortable, looks good and holds extremely well.</li>
    <li> I really like this clip. I have very long (almost reaches my hips), thick, heavy hair and have not been able to find any clips that will keep it up.  This one has worked the best so far. It does come loose if I make too much movement (I couldn&#x27;t use it at the gym) but it does the job everywhere else. I would like to find one just a tab bit bigger but I don&#x27;t think they make one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairclip for my wife who has incredibly thick, wavy hair. It&#x27;s a few inches past her shoulders and she always has it up in an elastic band. I bought her some of the usual &amp;#34;claw&amp;#34; clips and she wore them until one day we were in the car and I hit the brakes really hard. She said when I hit the brakes, her head hit the head rest, and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the clip dug into the back of her head a bit and hurt. Back to the elastic bands. I found this and thought it would be perfect. And it was! She can lay in bed flat on her back with it and it won&#x27;t hurt the back of her head. It won&#x27;t evenly hold up all of her hair, but it holds up most. She says she loves the way it looks as well. Unfortunately I only gave this hair clip a 3 out of 5 because 5 days after she got it one of the claws broke off. The claws are made way too thin and do not stand up against very thick hair. They are also really sharp. Back to the elastic bands.</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair. My hair goes down to my elbows, and I purchased this clip because it specifies it&#x27;s good for long, thick hair. It can hold some of my hair. It&#x27;s a good clip and better than what I had, so I learned ways to use it that would hold my hair even though not all my hair fit in it. Unfortunately, it failed spectacularly at a party last night and a piece flew off and almost poked someone&#x27;s eye out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, even though it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;m thinking of buying another because it&#x27;s not any worse than other hair clips, and it&#x27;s far more comfortable than the standard claw clips.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding a clip that will hold all of my long thick hair up in a knot.  This works great!</li>
    <li> Love it!! works great!</li>
    <li> Big and Strong....just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this is the only devise I have ever found that will hold my hair all day with out causing a headache or fatigue.  I ordered all I could find because apparently goody has discontinued them.</li>
    <li> This is a large clip!!! Which works well with my long, very straight hair!</li>
    <li> This clip holds all my hair, however is not as tight to hold my hair as expected. This is definitely for &amp;#34;lots n lots of hair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This clip is so easy to put in your hair that you are pretty much guaranteed great results every time. I am really lame when it comes to styling my hair so this clip is a favorite because it slips in from the side so you can hold your hair in place with one hand as the other hand slides this clip in and lets it close. It is also lightweight and smooth. The Brunette clip is not tortoise shell but sort of a coppery color with darker brown splotches. It looks great in my auburn hair. This is definitely a 5 star clip at a reasonable price. I think I may just need to buy another one for backup. I would feel lost without this item. I love the fact that it lies relatively flat against my head, not sticking out getting caught on the headrest in my car.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clip on the market for longish hair.  My hair never falls out and I never get a head ache associated with other claw type hair clips.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair,this clip holds it all up nicely.This hair clip used to be available in certain stores for about 5 bucks but cant find anymore so grateful that amazon carries it.Have to pay more but no other clip works as well.I just love it!</li>
    <li> Holds all my hair~quick and easy~much more stylish than a ponytail. As wide as my hand~about 4 inches</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t buy this clip in stores anymore, don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s the best hair clip EVER  Thank goodness I found it on line, can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> It was absolutely perfect for my needs.  Already owned one and was having no luck finding it in local stores.</li>
    <li> This clip feel sturdy, but it&#x27;s not as big as I expected.  I have thick, straight hair, and I cannot get all of it in this clip.  Kind of limits how I can wear it.</li>
    <li> Yay....so glad that I found this clip.  I had another one just like it that I&#x27;ve had for years and I kept using it until there were on 2 internal teeth left.  Every clip I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t hold my waist length hair EXCEPT this one.  I twist my hair into a rope and then let it twist back on itself and using just one of these clips and it holds perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get another one just to have on hand for the future.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments when wearing it.  Broad &amp; sturdier.  Hair goes up in a flash.</li>
    <li> Holds hair all day and is very comfortable</li>
    <li> Holds thick hair well, but the color is lighter in person than what is pictured.</li>
    <li> I love it. I can wear this all day without my hair falling out. It&#x27;s one of the best clips I&#x27;ve ever used. Defiantly would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This clip is great for my thick, coarse, curly hair. It all fits nicely when I use it for a ponytail holder. I haven&#x27;t quite mastered using this to hold my hair in an &amp;#34;undo&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get it secure and straight. Overall I love this even if I just use it for a ponytail.</li>
    <li> these are the only kind I use anymore, they don&#x27;t give me a headache &amp; I can lean my head back without getting poked in the back of my head.</li>
    <li> This clip is perfect for all day wear. I have long, wavy, thick hair and it holds a bun in my active all day job!</li>
    <li> Great clip for long, thick hair, but it broke after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> The clip is not very strong. I have had one that looks just like this and the clip was much stronger</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair and this shape of claw clip holds my hair well, without giving me a headache.  The &amp;#34;banana&amp;#34; shaped claw clips don&#x27;t hold my hair and they bang against the back of chairs, as well as the headrest in my car.  This shape can go higher on my head and lays fairly flat.  No bumping!</li>
    <li> Not big enough if you have  a lot of hair.  Other than that, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I love these clips for my long thick hair but this one with in a month. WTF Why do they not make these to buy instore any more. This the only one that holds up my hair and is low profile for hitting the back of my headrest in the care.</li>
