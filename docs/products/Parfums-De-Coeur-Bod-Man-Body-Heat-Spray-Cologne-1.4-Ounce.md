    <li> Favorite Cologne to buy for my boyfriend &amp; it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> this product is great, my boyfriend loves it!&lt;br /&gt;but the packaging sucked. this is a glass bottle and i would of expected it to be in a box with paper or bubble wrap, but it wasn&#x27;t it was in a bag, which allowed the box that held the cologne to move around and the box got beat up, which cause the product to be lose in the bag and the lid wasn&#x27;t on. i don&#x27;t believe it leak at all, but i was very dissatisfied with the shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought bod mans \\&quot;really ripped abs on steroids\\&quot; and boy did I like it! I 100% recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Bod Mans \\&quot;Body heat\\&quot; however takes it to a whole different level.&lt;br /&gt;Body heat&#x27;s smell is very hard to describe but its a very good/attracting smell. The smell has a sweet smell in it, its not a candyish smell ( don&#x27;t assume it has a candy smell in it). The sweet smell is more like a calming sweet smell, the smell is not excited (if you know what I mean). Not trying to sound weird but Once you smell it your going to want to smell for the rest of you life. I 110% recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love the way I smell. She says she don&#x27;t like it though, because other women notice it also. :)</li>
    <li> Best Perfumes ever used in my life. Cant switch.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
    <li> too strong to be subtle and forgotten. keepaway</li>
    <li> Now this dont get you girls is what you wear when you already have a woman/wifey to enhance your swag PM fragrance only!  Recommend Stack&#x3D;New Musk AM&#x3D;Blue Musk&#x3D;NOON&#x3D;Bod Man&#x3D;PM, use AM&amp;NOON getting a girl &amp; use PM taking her out on a date *note this s*** does not work on black women, cool water &amp; old spice for them!</li>
    <li> I kinda don&#x27;t want to write a review cuz I don&#x27;t want folks smelling like me. But lately I&#x27;ve been into trying out new colognes. I had never even heard of this and just decided to buy it. EVERYONE that smelled it either liked it or LOVED IT. this right how is my number 1 choice. Keep in mind it&#x27;ll smell different on other people based off how it mixes with their body chemistry(that&#x27;s what I learned in my cologne research. Lol), but I was not disappointed. Well, wait. I thought the scent was just OK when I sprayed it on. But other people literally stopped me to say I smelled good. 2 people actually followed me. 1 girl said she just wanted to smell the cologne cuz it smelled so good(I knew her). The other followed me to ask what I was wearing cuz she really liked it. Sooooo, yeah. That&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> Stays on long.smells great</li>
    <li> My (as of 9 months ago) boyfriend wears this and I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I use this more like a body spray after I get out of the shower.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to wear to classy places.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne on my husband and so does he.  This has become his favorite and I buy it in 3&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love this scent so much. I also receive so many compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a light powdery vanilla scent that dries to a somewhat mocha smell</li>
    <li> My husband was really happy</li>
    <li> I have received so many compliments after spraying this on. Better than Axe for attracting women!!!</li>
    <li> Product, was delivered on time, good condition, Im very satisfied, would order again</li>
    <li> My husband loves this!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Cologne stains your clothing.</li>
