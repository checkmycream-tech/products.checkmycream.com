      <li>Brought the cleanser back into my routine thinking once or twice a week would be fine and the spot came back, as did a second one on another part of my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
      <li>I completely missed that it contains microbeads, which meant I couldn&#x27;t use it on my eyes.</li>

<li> This blemish was actually a small really rough, sore patch of skin, and it would improve, then come back.</li>
<li> Please do not use this - or any other - product that contains microbeads.</li>
<li> It hung around for a few months with me occasionally using it and forgetting about it again, before I dug it out and used it for my everyday cleanser in the shower.</li>
<li> it works without irritating sensitive skin</li>
<li> I did feel the micro-beads though, but other than that it was just a waste of money.</li>
<li> the micro-beads would remove dull, dry skin, so you can renew skin&#x27;s surface and cleanse thoroughly.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s creamy and generally my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with creamy face washes so it made me break out badly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love it. Use it with a Neutrogena Wave rotating thingee with either exfoliating or regular foaming pads, in addition to the foaming stuff that comes on the pads. Feels smooth &amp; more luscious, and improves the feeling of the clean I get. Use it by itself sometimes too. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cleanser to use and I bought this at Ulta for $5.99. This cleanser says it has micro-beads and the micro-beads would remove dull, dry skin, so you can renew skin&#x27;s surface and cleanse thoroughly. I personally didn&#x27;t really like it. I felt like it did nothing to my face. I didn&#x27;t even see any changes at all. I did feel the micro-beads though, but other than that it was just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> love this refreshing face wash</li>
    <li> This face cleanser is perfect for the shower!  The nice pump is easy to use without having to open a container to get it out.  I use it with my electronic face brush.  It is smooth and does the job!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Please do not use this - or any other - product that contains microbeads. They are an environmental disaster!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It seems to work well!</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser they make. Read the label and you will see why</li>

    <li> .... not the right stuff for me.....</li>
    <li> I like the face wash and used to buy it at Walmart but now they lock all their Olay products and finding the key holder is time consuming.  If I had realized this was not a prime purchase I would have skipped it: shipping was about as much as the product.</li>
    <li> Good productos, and good service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy and generally my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with creamy face washes so it made me break out badly.</li>
    <li> very nice. I love it and it feels good on my body. Who doesn&#x27;t love good lotion????. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> it works without irritating sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Replaced soap with this product many years ago.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This is a really good cleanser. You only need to use a tiny bit and water to wash your face. Feels so clean after using.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser last year for occasional use to remove makeup when getting home after a night out. I completely missed that it contains microbeads, which meant I couldn&#x27;t use it on my eyes. (Some people do, I just prefer not to.) It hung around for a few months with me occasionally using it and forgetting about it again, before I dug it out and used it for my everyday cleanser in the shower. For the first few days, I was pleased. Nice cleansing, rinsed well, nice smell, and you didn&#x27;t have to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the third day I noticed what looked like a strange blemish on my cheek. I didn&#x27;t connect it with this cleanser until I started alternating this with two other cleansers in the shower (some of the more popular skin care blogs suggest not using the same cleanser every day). This blemish was actually a small really rough, sore patch of skin, and it would improve, then come back. I took the Olay out of my routine all together, and it went away. Brought the cleanser back into my routine thinking once or twice a week would be fine and the spot came back, as did a second one on another part of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think the beads plus salicylic acid is just too much for my skin, and it might be for yours, too. This is honestly the only problem I&#x27;ve ever had with an Olay product, but ultimately, I just can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> The only product I have been able to use for my sensitive eyes for make-up removal.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for several years.  Very nice product.  Cleans nicely and never dried my skin.</li>
    <li> Best results are achieved when one uses one product at a time except OLAY SP 15 sunscreen to protect the skin. Just been using the product for over a week at night and the results have been amazing - supple, smoother skin and gradual disappearance of age marks. I am a man just turned 62 and from now on OLAY is my product and my life. I have received positive feedback from my work colleagues that my skin is lighter, smooth.</li>
    <li> works great  after using this my face felt so clean and works great on sensative skin</li>
    <li> Been using it for over 20 years and it still feels awesome on my skin!</li>
