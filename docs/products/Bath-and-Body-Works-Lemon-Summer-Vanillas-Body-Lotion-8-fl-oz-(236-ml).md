      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light and refreshing smell.  </li>
      <li>You have to really like lemon to like this lotion, but if you do, then I think you will be happy.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of lemon and vanilla separately</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommending it to everyone, get more</li>
      <li>I love lemon sugar cookies and this smells just like one.</li>
      <li>Loved it when it first came out.</li>

      <li>Was excited to be able to buy it again.</li>
      <li>Not invasive, and easy to wear anywhere.</li>
      <li>My new favorite scent !</li>
      <li>They go on smooth and absorb quick.</li>
      <li>A special shout out to \\&quot;something</li>
      <li>The scent is mild yet calming.</li>
      <li>But while available, I will continue to buy both the shower gel and lotion because I simply love the smell and soft skin feel after using these products</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite summer smell.</li>
      <li>it is so cool and soothing and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>First smelled it on someone else and didn&#x27;t think it was a lotion at all, but just that she had opened up a bag of fruit loops.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend is a fan ;)</li>
      <li>Smells so pretty.  </li>
      <li>Love this specific lotion ant find anywhere else so 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
      <li>Will buy more later for additional gifts.</li>
      <li>Good price, haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for a long time and completely met my expectations.</li>
      <li>The Lemon Summer Vanillas Body Lotion is my new favorite scent, combining velvety vanilla with a soft, lemony-luscious scent.  </li>
      <li>They are all positive, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY moisturizing , it leaves the skin soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I plain love this scent!</li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance so don&#x27;t expect it to last all day.</li>
      <li>Glad this was still available on line, I was heart broken not to find it in stores this year.</li>
      <li>I really hate to write a great review for this product, since it seems many of these end up in short supply or the company stops producing them after a while.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is addictive, and even lasts a little longer than many citrus scents.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and am picky about scents.  </li>
      <li>I have to apply this lotion about twice a day to keep my skin soft.</li>
      <li>This is the only scented lotion I use (most scents usually irritate my sensitive skin), but this lotion doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin at all.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
      <li>Its tightly sealed so that none of it spills out, and it smells absolutely divine!</li>

<li> it&#x27;s sad that BBW discontinued this scent, but hopefully they will bring it back.</li>

<li> at least 24-hours...</li>
<li> How disappointing...</li>
<li> they discontinued it :(  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a shame it was discontinued though. :(</li>
<li> I know, sounds crazy, but they do!!</li>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion!!  The smell is WONDERFUL and it will leave your skin feeling amazing. I love lemon sugar cookies and this smells just like one. The smell lasts all day. If I could only choose one lotion to use from now on, I would definitely choose this one. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I really hate to write a great review for this product, since it seems many of these end up in short supply or the company stops producing them after a while.

    <li> My fav of Bath &amp; Body Works lotions. It delivers a wonderful aroma, hydrates the skin and leaves it with an all-over glow.</li>
    <li> I looove this lotion. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and am picky about scents.  For me this lotion is perfect.  It&#x27;s not greasy, nor is it overbearing or overpowering, and the scent lasts... at least 24-hours... that&#x27;s when it comes off in the shower for me.    The smell also is SO good!  First smelled it on someone else and didn&#x27;t think it was a lotion at all, but just that she had opened up a bag of fruit loops.  I still think it smells like that now that I&#x27;ve started using it, but also like lemon &amp; cream cookies.  It&#x27;s a nice light and refreshing smell.  I was told by a Bath &amp; Body works rep. they discontinued it :(  Bring it back B&amp;B!</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as bath and body usually is.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and keeps bugs away</li>
    <li> I love this fragance. Bath and Body Works discontinued  this item and it was only seasonal anyway. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com. Love Amazon.com mostly always get what I&#x27;m looking for the price I want. On this item it was not the price but the availability. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this specific lotion ant find anywhere else so 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite summer smell. It smells like lemon cookies and stays with you all day. It does fade throughout the day but that is to be expected. I love the smell of lemon and vanilla separately so together it&#x27;s a wonderful sweet, fresh fragrance. The lotion gives a nice light moisture without being greasy at all. This is the only scented lotion I use (most scents usually irritate my sensitive skin), but this lotion doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin at all. it&#x27;s sad that BBW discontinued this scent, but hopefully they will bring it back. Until then, I will continue to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bath and Body Works makes some of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. They go on smooth and absorb quick. There&#x27;s no residue left behind. This fragrance is wonderful! It smells like lemon cookies. This is a perfect citrus fragrance for summer time. I love everything about this lotion. It has a light fragrance so don&#x27;t expect it to last all day. When the wintry weather has my skin exceptionally dry I have to apply this lotion about twice a day to keep my skin soft. It works and smells so good I look forward to slathering it on.</li>
    <li> I plain love this scent! It&#x27;s perfect-not too overbearing and the scent lasts quite a while. I like to use it during the winter to cheer myself up because winter makes me feel blue. Like the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s not greasy and it smells like cookies. It&#x27;s a shame it was discontinued though. :(</li>
    <li> Great smell, get tons of complainants , fresh scent in lemon vanilla is very clean.  I&#x27;d recommending it to everyone, get more</li>
    <li> i bought this with the Lemon Summer Vanillas Fragrance Mist and i love it! Its tightly sealed so that none of it spills out, and it smells absolutely divine! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the product pictured. Nice lotion, though.</li>
    <li> You have to really like lemon to like this lotion, but if you do, then I think you will be happy. I get so many compliments when I wear this lotion. They are all positive, too. The perfume that I wear is Ralph Lauren Romance, and for some reason, these two scents go together. I know, sounds crazy, but they do!! I wish that B&amp;BW would have this fragrance all the time, but they don&#x27;t. How disappointing...</li>
    <li> This fragrance is addictive, and even lasts a little longer than many citrus scents.  I would have given it 5 stars, if it had a different consistency----it&#x27;s a little sticky and takes awhile to sink into the skin.  That said, a good product which is summer in a bottle, but can be worn anytime.  Not invasive, and easy to wear anywhere.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last. I can hardly smell it after I put it on.</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon cookies!!! My boyfriend is a fan ;)</li>
    <li> The lemon vanilla lotion smells so good it reminds me of lemon drops:-)  I get compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> The Lemon Summer Vanillas Body Lotion is my new favorite scent, combining velvety vanilla with a soft, lemony-luscious scent.  The two \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; complement each other and tease the senses into a summer evening escape.  My only regret is that Bath &amp; Body Works no longer carries the scent--unforgivable!  I was fortunate to be able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is something my daughter requests every Christmas, so glad I could come through this year! Great job Amazon, you did great!</li>
    <li> I looooove this lotion!! Searched every Bath and Body Works store in my area after Christmas and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Once again Amazon saves the day! The scent is mild yet calming. I wish I had purchased several of them during the 75% clearance blowout.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend dumped me after i bought her this. May not have been the lotions fault. I blame the lotion.</li>
    <li> Loved it when it first came out. Always bought more when it was in the stores. Was excited to be able to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and when promised.  The product is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Good price, haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for a long time and completely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am sooo glad i was able to find this product on Amazon.  I have been checking BBW&#x27;s website since last year but could not find it.  I love this scent...it is so cool and soothing and I highly recommend it.  A special shout out to \\&quot;something nice 4u\\&quot;  Thank you Thank you</li>
    <li> It has a light and sweet vanilla scent that goes wonderfully with the lemon. It&#x27;s VERY moisturizing , it leaves the skin soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Glad this was still available on line, I was heart broken not to find it in stores this year. Thank-you!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! Smells so pretty.  My new favorite scent ! Lemon, with slight vanilla added.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Receiver loved the fresh lemon smell of the product.  Will buy more later for additional gifts.</li>

    <li> Great price, and the scent is a perfect pick-me-up for summer! They are out of stock of this itme at my mall, so I was more than happy to buy it from Amazon.com</li>
