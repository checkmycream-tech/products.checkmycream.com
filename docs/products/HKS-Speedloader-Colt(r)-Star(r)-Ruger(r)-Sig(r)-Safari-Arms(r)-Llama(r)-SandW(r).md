      <li>An excellent time saving product.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It is a great product!</li>
      <li>This Speed loader works great with my 1911 clips and is even easier to use than the speed loader provided with my XD40!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>What a great concept.</li>
      <li>This speedloader is great.  </li>
      <li>Very handy and saves the wear and tear on my hands.</li>
      <li>Good exercise...</li>
      <li>We are both very pleased.</li>
      <li>Thanks you for this product and the wonderful service you</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This device sure saves your fingers and thumbs when loading my clips.</li>
      <li>overall design is awesome because you can use it with more than one caliber of ammunition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not realy happy with this, it&#x27;s very diffacult to use</li>
      <li>Found LULA to work a lot easier and better.</li>
      <li>This speed loader is very easy and quick.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to see the mechanism of the loader when it arrived, but when I tried to load a clip, it would not fit into the loader.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, for clips that would fit, I like the device.</li>
      <li>The speed loader didn&#x27;t fit my gun&#x27;s magazine.</li>
      <li>this speed loader is OK but not near as good as the LuLa speed loader for .40, .45, etc.</li>
      <li>If I had to give any criticism it would be that I wish it was a little sturdier but with that being said it is still a great magazine loader.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth the money it doesn&#x27;t work like shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Another great speed loader&#x27; no more sore fingers or bruises.</li>
      <li>I could insert maybe 4-5 rounds and then the tension was great enough that I could go now further.  </li>
      <li>One more thing, The HKS loader has a cam on one side to adjust for different width Mags, it&#x27;s not listed but it also works on my Taurus 709 slim with that cam adjustment.</li>
      <li>Picture shows a different model, there are 2 parts to this that would fit around the top of the clip, but in the picture there is only one part that would handle a fatter mag.</li>
      <li>Someone really did their homework when they designed the HKS loader.  </li>
      <li>these speedloaders make life sooooo much easier.  </li>
      <li>This makes loading so much easier and faster.</li>
      <li>Really does save the thumb if you&#x27;re going to be loading a couple hundred rounds at the range.  </li>
      <li>A real finger saver if you do any target shooting</li>
      <li>I can now load a full clip in about the same time I was taking to load 4-5 rounds without.  </li>
      <li>I use it for my Ruger and High Point 9mm.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this speedloaded and this seller.</li>
      <li>The clips of my 3 S&amp;W pistols are too wide to fit in this loader.</li>
      <li>Product works well with plain single stack mags, but mags with extensions, not so good unless you can remove the extension.</li>
      <li>Even this one I had to slightly modify it to fit, but it works... now.</li>
      <li>Works well and have loaded 1,000 rounds so far.</li>

<li> Works well and have loaded 1,000 rounds so far.</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s just a female thing, but that spring is hard to depress after the first few rounds are loaded and this makes it so much easier and simpler to accomplish.  </li>
<li> I bought this loader for a recently acquired S&amp;W M&amp;P Shield pistol that has single loading clips.</li>
<li> did not clear up the discrepancy...</li>
<li> So I got it in about a week and half after I order a similar product</li>
<li> /&gt;The return policy would mean that I would pay nearly the cost of the device in return and restocking fees.</li>
<li> There is very little effort required to push down the bullet inserted into the magazine even if its the last one in against the heaviest spring pressure.</li>
<li> and it requires you to put a lot of pressure up on the mag in order to push the bullet down, the HKS loader has an adjustable stop that the Mag sits on and holds it in place.</li>
<li> but if it were made a little sturdier and tighter it would be a definate five star.</li>
<li> for ordering this junk it would not fit any gun mag.</li>
<li> I ordered it thinking that it could be used for a 12-15 round magazine.</li>
<li> I had trouble loading the 5th and 6th bullets into the magazine.  </li>
<li> works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; on 5 round magzines.</li>
<li> this doesn&#x27;t work at all on 7 round magazines.</li>
<li> This product does not fit a S&amp;W Sigma 9mm clip.  </li>
<li> This would not fit my .40 cal mag.</li>
<li> you will go home with raw finger tips.</li>
<li> For some reason it&#x27;s hard to find a speed loader for my mag.</li>
<li> This thing isn&#x27;t hard to figure out</li>
<li> If you have broken a nail, cut a cuticle or even your finger while loading a mag...</li>
<li> Misunderstood the dialogue in the advertisement and purchased the wrong speed loader.</li>
<li> This device was very poorly described.</li>
<li> I bought this tool to ease the loading of the clips, which were are very difficult to load by hand.</li>
<li> and it was making it almost impossible to load my 9 mm.  </li>
<li> so I would not be so mad!!</li>

    <li> This device sure saves your fingers and thumbs when loading my clips. Saves time at the shooting range. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excelent product for the price. A real finger saver if you do any target shooting and you don&#x27;t have one of these you will go home with raw finger tips.</li>
    <li> This Speed loader works great with my 1911 clips and is even easier to use than the speed loader provided with my XD40!&lt;br /&gt;The overall design is awesome because you can use it with more than one caliber of ammunition.</li>
    <li> Another great speed loader&#x27; no more sore fingers or bruises. Well made&#x27; should last for a while since its well comstructed.</li>
    <li> THIS LOADER  MEETS ALL MY EXPECTATIONS.  There is very little effort required to push down the bullet inserted into the magazine even if its the last one in against the heaviest spring pressure. Also I have a loader from my S/W 904 and it requires you to put a lot of pressure up on the mag in order to push the bullet down, the HKS loader has an adjustable stop that the Mag sits on and holds it in place. One more thing, The HKS loader has a cam on one side to adjust for different width Mags, it&#x27;s not listed but it also works on my Taurus 709 slim with that cam adjustment. Someone really did their homework when they designed the HKS loader.  Dave P.</li>
    <li> The clips of my 3 S&amp;W pistols are too wide to fit in this loader. I bought this loader for a recently acquired S&amp;W M&amp;P Shield pistol that has single loading clips. I bought this tool to ease the loading of the clips, which were are very difficult to load by hand. I was very happy to see the mechanism of the loader when it arrived, but when I tried to load a clip, it would not fit into the loader.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, for clips that would fit, I like the device.</li>
    <li> I received this item on time. I&#x27;m not realy happy with this, it&#x27;s very diffacult to use and it does not work with my Ruger 40cal.</li>
    <li> For some reason it&#x27;s hard to find a speed loader for my mag. Even this one I had to slightly modify it to fit, but it works... now.</li>
    <li> Product works well with plain single stack mags, but mags with extensions, not so good unless you can remove the extension.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all I gave it away so I would not be so mad!! for ordering this junk it would not fit any gun mag. 40- 357- 9- nothing so I just gave it to a friend he wanted to play with it! I would not tell anyone to buy this product it will not work at all!!!!</li>
    <li> I had trouble loading the 5th and 6th bullets into the magazine.  This speedloader makes it simple to get those last two rounds in!  Maybe it&#x27;s just a female thing, but that spring is hard to depress after the first few rounds are loaded and this makes it so much easier and simpler to accomplish.  I highly recommend this speedloaded and this seller.</li>
    <li> So I got it in about a week and half after I order a similar product both was ordered the same day. This thing isn&#x27;t hard to figure out but it isn&#x27;t worth the money it doesn&#x27;t work like shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> this speed loader is OK but not near as good as the LuLa speed loader for .40, .45, etc. Found LULA to work a lot easier and better.</li>
    <li> An excellent time saving product. It works perfectly as advertised. This product will save you a lot of time and strain.</li>
    <li> works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; on 5 round magzines. not close to the smoothness of my double stack loaders......this doesn&#x27;t work at all on 7 round magazines. I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> The item I received was not what was pictured.  Similar but not the same.  I couldn&#x27;t use it.  This would not fit my .40 cal mag.</li>
    <li> This speedloader is great.  I use it for my Ruger and High Point 9mm.  Very handy and saves the wear and tear on my hands.</li>
    <li> Really does save the thumb if you&#x27;re going to be loading a couple hundred rounds at the range.  Glad a bought it.</li>
    <li> This device was very poorly described. I ordered it thinking that it could be used for a 12-15 round magazine. It turns out that it can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Re-reading the description did not clear up the discrepancy...&lt;br /&gt;The return policy would mean that I would pay nearly the cost of the device in return and restocking fees. This company does not appear to meet Amazon&#x27;s liberal return policy.&lt;br /&gt;Resorted to my thumb for loading. Good exercise...</li>
    <li> This product does not fit a S&amp;W Sigma 9mm clip.  Picture shows a different model, there are 2 parts to this that would fit around the top of the clip, but in the picture there is only one part that would handle a fatter mag.</li>
    <li> The rating says it all</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Glock 17 9 mm pistol.  I have numbness in my hands and also arthritis in the joints and it was making it almost impossible to load my 9 mm.  I could insert maybe 4-5 rounds and then the tension was great enough that I could go now further.  This HKS Speedloader changed all of that!  I can now load a full clip in about the same time I was taking to load 4-5 rounds without.  It is a great product! I will recommend it to my friends who are in the same situation as I am in.  Thanks you for this product and the wonderful service you provide!&lt;br /&gt;Bill Sampson</li>
    <li> I like the theroy of the tool but if it were made a little sturdier and tighter it would be a definate five star.</li>
    <li> What a great concept. This makes loading so much easier and faster. If I had to give any criticism it would be that I wish it was a little sturdier but with that being said it is still a great magazine loader.</li>
    <li> The speed loader didn&#x27;t fit my gun&#x27;s magazine. I tried to force it but i ended up breaking the loader.</li>
    <li> If you have broken a nail, cut a cuticle or even your finger while loading a mag...these speedloaders make life sooooo much easier.  Works well and have loaded 1,000 rounds so far.</li>
    <li> Misunderstood the dialogue in the advertisement and purchased the wrong speed loader. Will have to keep it hoping to sell&lt;br /&gt;or give it to someone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to help her load her 380. We are both very pleased. This speed loader is very easy and quick. I now need to order one for myself.</li>
