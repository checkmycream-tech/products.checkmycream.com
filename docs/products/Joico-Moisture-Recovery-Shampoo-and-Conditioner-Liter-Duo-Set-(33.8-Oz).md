<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it! It is very good for my hair!</li>
    <li> Loves this product, fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> It was nice not having to spend money on shampoo and conditioner for like 6 months I&#x27;d say this was worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Can&#x27;t get it anywhere but Amazon!</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in the first use. Hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years!</li>
    <li> The hair for which this was purchased is very bleached and heat-styled. The hair owner says this product makes a very positive difference in feel and appearance.  THe item was easy to order and arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> My hair used to tangle so badly every time I&#x27;d wash it no matter what conditioner I&#x27;d use on it...that is until it met Joico Moisture Recovery.  Even the Joico K-Pak didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the Moisture Recovery did!  This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist, after she spent over an hour brushing out my long thick hair - at my next visit she used this product and it worked like a miracle - no more tangles!!!!!!  I&#x27;m hooked...Thanks, Joico!  You saved me so much time and pain with this product - not to mention my hair smells amazing and looks and feels 100% more healthy!  If you have color treated, dry or easily tangled hair - GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft, clean and healthy. I was having problems with my hair breaking, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that since I started using this shampoo and conditioner. On top of that, it smells wonderful. I finally found the shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a store in the local mall and it surprisingly did not help my hair. My hair actually seems more frizzy after using it. The Herbal Essences shampoo and conditioner I was using before this was actually better. I guess these top brands don&#x27;t always work for everyone!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for natural hair.</li>
    <li> the title says it all!! This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner! I have tried a lot of salon products (moroccan oil, healthy sexy hair, chi, biolage, nioxin, matrix, kenra, john frieda, fekkai, etc) and this set is by far the best i have used! for my hair -fine and dry- it does not weigh down the hair, and leaves it SO soft. i like to use this with the recovery treatment balm. normally i need a detangler after washing my hair but when i use this shampoo/conditioner/treatment balm the brush easily glides through my hair!!</li>
    <li> I have long, dry, coarse hair.  The moisture recovery shampoo &amp; condition make it feel soft.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The low 4.5 - 5.5 Ph rating is most excellent. Somewhat more pricy than competition but Amazon.com has a great deal.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this shampoo &amp; conditioner at a salon. I purchased, at Christmas their Christmas deal, two bottles about half this size for $22.00. I was told you can not get it any where else except the salon and that I must come back to that salon to get it. Of course I didnt like that too much so I went on Amazon. I found these for $28.00. Same product. Feels the same &amp; smells the same. Leaves my hair soft, clean &amp; not weighted down.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and I really like the smell. I love that I can buy it from Amazon and pay a lot less than buying it through my distributor.</li>
    <li> Joico has always been my go-to for intense hair repair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I had a gift card to TJMaxx and desperately needed new (high quality) shampoo; I&#x27;m definitely glad I wound up with this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Catwalk&#x27;s Curl formula for years thinking it was giving me great results, but this formula leaves my hair so soft and shiny! It&#x27;s definitely a lightweight formula, and even when I use my styling tools, my hair looks fantastic and shiny as ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude coming from using head and shoulders 2 in 1.  I never thought it mattered to use a quality shampoo/conditioner set (just use what will get me out of the shower in 5 minutes) but I was wrong, this stuff is great.  I have thick hair and this helps add moisture and weighs my hair down (if you have a slick back hair style this works well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf was taking a shower at my place and she used it, she fell in love with it immediately.  She asked &amp;#34;can we share?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad these come in 33oz</li>
    <li> always works the best on my very long, medium colored/fried hair. add kpak once a week for super duper results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is difficult to find in this area (Spokane/Coeur d&#x27;Alene).  Price here beats price when/if found in beauty supply store and if/when on sale; plus, no gas expense in driving all over especially with possible free shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have really fragile, fine hair that tends to dry out easily. After a month of using this shampoo/conditioner, I don&#x27;t recognize my hair anymore! I can let it air dry, and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz. My hair isn&#x27;t very oily, but even when I go a few days without washing, this shampoo cleans so well! I thought since it was a moisturizing product, it wouldn&#x27;t get rid of buildup and oil, but it gently does both. I highly reccommend this if your hair needs a drink!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s The Best Shampoo And Conditioner. I Have No Complaints. This Will Be The Brand I Recommend To Friends &amp; Family. The Price Is Definitely A Deal Verses Buying It In The Store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice and the shampoo leaked out of the bottle and was all over the inside of the box twice. Always the shampoo? I don&#x27;t know why! Make your own conclusion.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite shampoo...it is good for fine thick or thin hair, the conditioner detangles and moisturizes without feeling heavy or sticky.  I stray every once in a while but always go back.</li>
    <li> This is one the best shampoos i have ever used. It makes my hair really soft and manageable. I have wavy/frizzy hair and i can actually let my hair air dry and it looks ok.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shampoo &amp; conditioner! It smells fantastic &amp; always leaves my hair feeling amazing - smooth, silky, bouncy!! I would recommend this to anyone! I just bought the volumizing/body enhancing formula (whatever it was called ;p) and it, too, is amazing!! I really love this brand!</li>
    <li> LOVE it. I noticed a difference in the texture of my hair after the first wash and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on how smooth my hair looks!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Shampoo and Conditioner and I&#x27;m picky , being I&#x27;m a former Hairstylist! I have blonde highlights in my hair from bleach and this stuff makes my hair like I never used bleach on my hair. It has a scent that I so love and look forward to shower time and the scent stays with you even after you rinse the product out. Almost reminds me of honeysuckle and lilacs. All I can say is don&#x27;t hesitate to try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love the product. Item was spilled when I opened the package though.</li>
    <li> i recieved my product on time..the problem is that after a few days both bottle&#x27;s exploded...product was all over the place....i had to clean up the mess..i dont know if it was because it  was hot in the warehouse where stuff is kept or what..i haven&#x27;t had that happen before....it was coming out from the pump&#x27;s....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  My hair is super dry and recovering from some damage from pregnancy and this product is amazing.  My hair comes out soft and tangle free.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner.  I like the smell of it too.  But I&#x27;ve used almost half the bottles now and do not see anything great happening with my hair.  I have very long straight hair.  It used to be very soft and silky.  I got it colored a couple months ago to hide greys and it has been wrecked ever since.  Something happened with coloring it.  It&#x27;s a giant tangled mess when washed or wet.  I thought this shampoo conditioner would help.  I got the leave in detangler too.  It hasn&#x27;t helped the condition of my hair yet.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner !</li>
    <li> This product works miracles! I would shower and my hair would get so tangled where it is damaged from, with this shampoo and conditioner my hair de tangles so nicely.</li>
    <li> My hair feels incredible with this stuff! Even after full foils done!</li>
    <li> I have been using these two products for months and have noticed an improvement in my hair-it&#x27;s not as dry as it was before the use!  Would highly recommend trying the shampoo and Conditioner!</li>
    <li> This product keeps your hair soft and nice! I would recommend people with thick or dry hair to try this product</li>
    <li> Love this product, totally brought my hair back to life. Great for repairing dry damaged hair, highly recommended by hairdressers</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of shampoo for my fly away hair, my friend told me about Joico products and how it makes your hair feel soft and manageable. I have now been using for a couple of weeks and could tell a huge difference within 2 days. My hair does not feel frizzy anymore and shines. My husband even noticed the difference..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will continue to use and would hight recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Sherry</li>
    <li> I first tried Joico after my sister-in-law, who is a hair stylist gave me a gift set for Christmas.  I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It makes my hair soft and smooth like no other shampoo/conditioner ever has.</li>
    <li> I love Joico products!!!.  A stylist and friend said I should try this.  I have thick permed hair that is also colored.  It was dry and hard to manage.  I would use hand fulls of conditioner and even more styling products to try to tame it.  I have used this for a week and I will never use another product.  My hair is soft and managabl.  I wash, toss a little gel in and go!! No more crunchy stick curls &amp; frizzy hair. Throw out your other products and try Joico!! it works :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell &amp; makes your hair feel really soft.  Looks shinier too.  My hair is coarse &amp; it really worked well on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and have always been pleased with how my hair feels. I love the extra large bottles so I don&#x27;t have to order so often.</li>
    <li> After using shampoo and conditioners available at the drugstore like Pantene and Treseme I decided to treat my hair to salon grade products. I have fine super curly hair that sometimes tends to frizz up and lose it&#x27;s life. After using this combo for about of month, it has made a world of difference for my hair. After washing I add a pump of two of conditioner to my hair and leave it in over night and when I wake up, my hair is super moisturized. I think the biggest difference has been when I blow dry and then flat iron my hair. It comes out so smooth, soft, and shiny. Just as a note, I have also been using the Viviscal hair treatment and I am noticing less fall out and less breakage altogether. (I shed a lot of hair when stressed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m so please with this line and I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely Joico&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner that I have tried so far! This is great for dry hair and really makes it smooth and soft. I prefer this to Redken All Soft and Joico K-Pak.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Made my hair so hard and dry - &amp; quite a bit was coming out when I rinsed. I had to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; my hair by putting on some Keracare leave-in conditioner afterwards. I&#x27;m calling Joico headquarters today to see if I can get a refund or at least exchange it for another product.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo - adds moisture and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love this for the price</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. It helps even the more coarse white hair manageable--and the rest as well!</li>
    <li> Neither moisturized nor recovered my color treated hair. Caused MAJOR itchy dandruff,  Weighed down my locks and left my ends super crisp and susceptible to brush fire.</li>
    <li> Works great,  needs extra moisture for my hair though.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best. I have straight fine hair and have tried several moisturizing shampoos. They all left my hair dry and dull. I had used Joico conditioning shampoo in the past and loved it, but it&#x27;s now so hard to find. I decided to try the moisturizing shampoo and so glad I did. It leaves my hair soft and shiny without being weighed down. I now love my hair again.</li>
    <li> The Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo and conditioner is the best I have found for dry hair. I use a flat iron on my hair and live in a dry climate which makes for harsh conditions on skin and hair. Joico products keep my hair soft and supple, and I rarely see a split end.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I needed, and great price.</li>
    <li> Results are great. Moistened hair and makes it much softer. It also smells pretty good. I would recommend to others</li>
    <li> I have made some bad hair decisions in the last year or so. Basically, too much hair dying, not enough recovery time. Add to that daily straightening and my hair was fried. I found this product after relentless searching. After reading the dozens of good reviews for this shampoo and conditioner, I was sold. The price was a little spendy for me but it was definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, washing and conditioning my hair every other day. So far it&#x27;s made my hair super soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle and dead. It&#x27;s finally starting to feel HEALTHY again and I am so pleased. The one downside I can think of is that on the off day I don&#x27;t wash and condition it, my roots get greasy really easy. I usually just give it a good rinse in the shower and call it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair softer and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;smells good, not like chemicals&lt;br /&gt;BIG bottles (a little goes a long way, 2 pumps per wash and you&#x27;re good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;not cheap (Amazon did offer a great price tho!)&lt;br /&gt;hair gets greasy quickly (especially when using products like gel or mousse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Great buy! Worth it, Go for it :)</li>
    <li> I have used Joico Kpak color therapy for almost 2 years and wanted to try something new, so I bought the moisture recovery line. I absolutely love it! I almost think I like it better than the KPak line *GASP.* Fantastic product that doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or weighed down and the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> I had always used cheap shampoos until my husband surprised me with some Joico shampoo and conditioner as a treat one day. I had no idea that there was such a difference in good quality shampoo! My hair is softer and shinier with this product and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as greasy between washes. And it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love Joico products, but maybe not this one!  I find that with my coarse dry hair, I need sulfate free and this is not.  Passed it on to my daughter when I couldn&#x27;t use it.  She loves that it leaves her hair shiny and healthy!  Seems to work great for her thick, processed hair!</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve exclusively used TIGI and Biolage shampoos/ conditioners. Now I&#x27;ve found a new brand to add to the mix. It makes my hair feel soft and silky while still giving it body.</li>
    <li> I have placed a second order and just received. Never again. The packaging, although in a box this time, was not protected and the bottle broke open. The postal service had to place the box in a plastic bag because the product was leaking through the box. So disappointed and mad that my money is wasted.  ------------------------ I read about this shampoo in an article about curly hair and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The smell is nice and I do notice a difference between this shampoo/conditioner vs. others.  I think it&#x27;ll be healthy for my long, curly hair and I don&#x27;t mind paying more for quality stuff that works. I was afraid I&#x27;d get it and not like it, then end up with 1 liter of shampoo and conditioner to get rid of.  I was so disappointed with the packaging though.  The bottles came in a tyvek envelope, it wasn&#x27;t protected.  The tops were dented in which would be fine except one of the pumps is completely broken. I have to unscrew the top every morning to get the conditioner out which is awkward in a tiny shower with a big heavy bottle and wet hands.  Now I&#x27;m stuck trying to find replacement pumps that fit this tall bottle.  I&#x27;m hesitant to buy in the future because of this.  I don&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t ship in a box.</li>
    <li> Not very good shampoo or conditioner. Save your money, there are better products in the drug store. Also my shampoo came with a broken pump and spilt all over the package.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal for two liter sized products. When I ordered this, the deal included pumps which was really handy, but it did not include the extra heat set lotion sample, but that&#x27;s ok. This moisture recovery formula helps keep my daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair tamed and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product ! My hair is so manageable now and softer I love the smell of it and the way it cleans</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner are awesome, i have curly hair so this product works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  But, this time it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as I have used in the past.  Just wondering if I actually got the legitimate stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair was in really poor condition from stress. The ends were especially dry. A client told me about joico, and she has beautiful hair, in spite of numerous health issues. After only a few uses, my hair is glossy and the ends are no longer dry. It even holds its style beautifully!! Love this!</li>
    <li> Both products were good and did their job.  I will buy them again.  Used together the products were very good</li>
    <li> I have found these on sale for $19.99 at my local beauty salon several times. This time I happened to not have any backups when I ran out. At $28.99 it&#x27;s a decent price but only when I can&#x27;t find a local sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fair haired with baby fine ringlet curls. This is the best stuff for me! It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but is moisturizing enough to help prevent dry scalp. I do use a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; treatment on my ends, however. But this is the pair I use for my scalp and my hair to below my ears.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Great price as well. Definitely will order again</li>
    <li> Very happy with these products as well as the price! I will order from this source again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I borrowed my friend&#x27;s joico conditioner when I stayed over, and BOY was my hair all soft and smooth w/out straightening. I had natural curl so hair tends to be frizzy easily unless I spend the time to fix it after washing them. After I blew dry my hair, the hair was soft and flowy, but not the static kind. My natural curl was moist and had a great curl look. I usually don&#x27;t like the way my hair curl, but I loved it. I bought one smaller conditioner at CVS, finished it, and found this good deal on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo was okay. Does the job and have the same smell. Conditioner is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I love the smell. :)</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this shampoo and conditioner to me so I tried it. She said she doesn&#x27;t use any other shampoo/conditioner anymore. After using this for a few weeks, I definitely noticed a difference. My hair is damaged from using a straightener all the time and this made it soft and shiny; I got many compliments! Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is my faaaavorite shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!  I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair for years, and it needs a little moisture boost.  This shampoo &amp; conditioner is exactly what it needs.  I use it and add a tiny bit of argon oil to my hair right before I blow dry, and it&#x27;s all I need to have healthy looking hair &amp; ends.  Try it &amp; after a bottle of each, you will notice a difference in they way your hair feels.  It made mine much softer &amp; whenever I switch to something else, I find myself switching back to Joico Moisture Recovery because it makes my hair feel better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  Plus, it smells great (it has a light, clean, beautiful smell).</li>
    <li> I have used these together once before, I stupidly get bored and try other hair lines and well I wish I hadnt ! my hair when I use these two together is amazing! I have fine, blonde highlighted hair, shoulder blade length hair, after using these both for just a few days I feel my hair is already  getting back to good  condition :) I also have Used the K-pak treatments they are good but do not over load on them, they are good for limited use, as I learned you can get too much protein build up and it can really play havoc on your hair! this I just recently learned I had no idea I was actually causing damage myself with treatment over load..just a friendly warning ladies (and gents too) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is lacking moister &amp; shine give these a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps&lt;br /&gt;I  should also say I am also using L&#x27;oreal  Evercreme  nourishing leave in Spray and this is amazing stuff combined with this  Shampoo combo, I know  people are going to have different results all you can do is give them a try  , Good luck :)</li>
    <li> My hair got damaged from bleaching, having an incorrect color put in and re-bleaching to get that color out.  My hair felt dry and straw-like leaving the beauty school and I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  The beauty school used to use Joico products and I wondered if I could find it myself on Amazon.  Lo and behold, Amazon had it!!&lt;br /&gt;I just washed my hair and the difference between how it was leaving the school and now is like night and day.  My hair is a lot more supple and is super shiny and I&#x27;m confident after a few uses it will be a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did was to leave the conditioner on for 5 minutes rather than the 1 minute as directed.&lt;br /&gt;One thing you can&#x27;t tell from the photo is how heavenly the scent is...AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - definitely give this shampoo/conditioner a try.  You will be amazed!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and it was shipped fast! I can def tell a difference between good shampoo vs store...worth the extra pennies.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but this time I didn&#x27;t like it at all. My hair is very fine &amp; this is NOT moisturizing enough. Do not like it at all.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer..even my stylist was impressed..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered (kind, size, brand and price).  Quick delivery and ease of ordering will bring me back when I run out!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair over the summer. And needed a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. my hair feels a lot softer now. I use it on my 2 year old little girl, with very curly hair, and it make&#x27;s her hair so soft.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shampoo.  I have frizzy hair, but I don&#x27;t even have to use any other product but a little hair spray with this shampoo.  Makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair colored with Joico&#x27;s Age Defy colorant. I liked the dye so well decided to try this. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I had made the right decision. The longer I used the products the better my hair felt. Now it&#x27;s curling the way it should be and not as frizzy as it once was. The trick with the conditioner is not rinse it out completely. I rinse ONLY the few seconds it takes for the water to become clear and not milky. This literally means seconds depending on how thick and long your hair is. I also use a spray on leave in conditioner when styling.</li>
    <li> My stylist informed me that I needed to change shampoos because my hair was getting severely dry.  She recommended several to me, this being one of them.  Overwhelmed with my choices, I took a chance on a Joico sample.  Wow, what a difference I&#x27;ve seen in my hair.  I highly recommend it to anyone that may be suffering from aging hair.  My hair has gotten it&#x27;s bounce back and the breaking has stopped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo and conditioner I use anymore. Went from drugstore brand to this and it has given me all new hair. I use this a few times a week with jojoba oil and my hair is healthy, shinny and I rarely get split ends.</li>
    <li> A coworker suggested I try joico. I have naturally curly hair that got severely damaged last year. Joico leaves my hair soft and clean. It doesn&#x27;t look out feel dried out. It is a little pricey but no worse than other salon products. Very much with the price.</li>
    <li> At first I was worried about spillage from a couple reviews I had read but it Came quick and in great packaging with pump for both. Love the shampoo and conditioner. Love Joico. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico Moisture Recovery for several years and love the way it calms my dry, curly hair. I recommend it to anyone who feels like their hair could use some TLC as an everyday shampoo/conditioner or part of a rotation. The shampoo is velvety and a little goes a long way, and the condition is very rich and coats the hair well. I sometimes use a little bit as a leave-in after the shower before blow drying.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is a MUST! I got my hair done at the salon and they washed my hair with this shampoo. After a few days going back to my old regular shampoo I noticed how dry and brittle it became. Every time I brushed my hair I was loosing a LOT of hair. I went back to the salon and they told me this was the shampoo they used. I switched over and have been using this shampoo &amp; conditioner for over a year and the difference it makes is incredible. Between running out of this shampoo and using my old brand for a week, you really notice how much of a difference it maKes in shine and smoothness. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say but that Joico makes a great product.  I live in a small town and cannot get this in stores here, but the gal who does my hair recommended it.  Once I tried it I was hooked.  I live in a very dry climate at elevation and my hair gets abused in the lake and on the ski slopes, but this stuff moisturizes so well it keeps my hair soft and shiny without all the waxy buildup of inferior shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner.  Believe the best I have ever purchased.  If there is a problem, I believe it is the fact you want to use more than the recommended amount.  For the average man or short hair lady, one push (about a dimes worth) is all you need to wash or condition your hair.  Your hair feels great afterward too.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended that I give Joico products a try, as my hair is very fine and the ends tend to get very dry. I&#x27;ve used this for a month and so far I really like it. It cleans and moisturizes without weighing my hair down, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this deal, but I suggest keeping your older, smaller bottles and refilling them using these, as the bottles are a little too big to manage in the shower.</li>
    <li> I will update this later, but for now I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as the other joico shampoo I have used.  good price tho.</li>
    <li> I have thin, very dry, ethnic hair. I choose to go natural 1 year ago and have struggled with the right moisture balance when straightening my hair. These products make my hair extremely soft and manageable and eliminate the need for any type of oil afterward.</li>
    <li> This is such excellent quality shampoo and conditioner...the only conditioner I use for my super damaged hair. I can&#x27;t believe what a steal it is here! I am a repeat purchaser and always buy my Joico on Amazon now. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got tired of buying the smaller bottles, I had to jump on this deal, will last us for quite a while... I have to do 4 heads in this house..</li>
    <li> Joico used to be my &amp;#34;old reliable&amp;#34; hair care products.  Unfortunately, all of their shampoos and conditioners have been reformulated in the last year.  They all leave a heavy residue, even more so than a few drugstore brands that I like.  I just cannot understand why these companies continue change/revise their highly rated products.  In my view, Joico is no more than a drugstore brand - just compare the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My hair is not as soft as I would like but it definitely looks really shiny and healthy. I like it and probably would buy again</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. It did leak a little in the bag it came in so it maybe should be packaged a little better.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo/Conditioner set. It does leave a little residue, but most do.</li>
    <li> we bought a few for a few of us from work, we were all really happy with them, great prive and good quaility.</li>
    <li> I actually very much regret buying these. This shampoo has been doing nothing good for my hair type and here I am with two huge bottles to use or move to the guest bath...I have normal hair  but my scalp has been dry in the wintertime and for this reason I bought the moisture recovery shampoo.  My scalp has never been itchier. My hair is flat and lifeless and I have to wash a lot more often than what I normally use to with other shampoos. This one is going to the guest bath soon...</li>
    <li> ALWAYS LOVE THIS BRAND.</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery! unfortunetly i hate the smell of my conditioner :(. Way to floral. But it does help with moisture.. Besides the smell, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought this looking for a Wen alternative. The shampoo is more stripping than I&#x27;d like for my kinky/curly hair and from a moisturizing shampoo. The conditioner works well; I like to use it as a leave-in. I would buy the conditioner again. I would give this 5 stars if I liked the shampoo as much as the conditioner in this set.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner i love it!!! made my hair feels soft and smooth when use together</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It makes my hair super soft and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> It smells great and my hair looks beautiful--great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair moisturized, Thick and clean it gets three stars instead of 5 because the packaging could have been better it comes wrapped in a FedEx bag but this product should be Boxed</li>
    <li> This hair gel is great for those who want a good hold but your hair won&#x27;t feel hard like the cheap ones. You could easily use this in the morning then not have to shower at night which is nice to do on late nights.</li>
    <li> Joico Daily Moisturizer Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is a helpful, must-use product for the thick, coarse hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for five years and it has made a huge difference over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment has revived and tamed my hair, making it silky, tamed, moisturized and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey for shampoo and conditioner, but my hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since... In a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the Joico Daily Moisturizer Balm Treatment to accompany the shampoo and condition or even as a substitute for the conditioner, or even with any cheaper shampoo and conditioner brand. You only need one pump for this to make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Hands, down my favorite shampoo...... (for men)</li>
    <li> I live in Saudi Arabia and the dust and sun was drying my hair terrible.  Joico products recover my hair almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo! Nice volume, no frizz.  Gives a little shine too. Scent is okay and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was also super fast.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars is the pumps that were provided are awful!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product I absolutely love it. The size of the bottles was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The product seemed very watered down. For a conditioner to be effective, the product needs to be thick and rich. I had to use a ridiculous amount for it to work and then I had to leave it on my hair for a very long time. It didn&#x27;t impress me any more than the Suave products found at Walmart. I did not find this to be salon quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair and wash it everyday. Yes, everyday. After one wash my hair was already softer. I had to work a little bit to get the conditioner out but I don&#x27;t mind. I have used it for about a week and still pleased. It smells excellent. I normally use Sleek Look but I always like a change. I will update review if I change my feelings over time.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper on here than at a salon. My hair feels so amazing &amp; hydrated, this is my favorite shampoo and conditioner ever! It is a MUST HAVE!!</li>
    <li> good shampoo/conditioner, but too floral smelling for my taste (lilac?)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Joico shampoo and conditioner for 2 years now and nothing leaves my very dry hair looking better or feeling softer than this!</li>
    <li> My Hair stylist recommended this product and I am so glad that I bought it.  I actually use less than my normal shampoo and conditioner.My hair is heathier than it has ever been.</li>
    <li> Makes  my hair so soft and shine!</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the smell and love how healthy my hair is now.  This was recommended by my hair stylist, so glad she did.</li>
    <li> Buy it and it will leave your hair softer than ever!! I have experienced great results with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as Dove products. It still leaves my hair hard to comb out, and then unmanageable somethimes</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and until I started using Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo and conditioner, I would spend minium 20 minutes trying to comb my hair out.  Now it&#x27;s done in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these two products for quite some time now and loves them.  These products seem to be identical to those my wife usually buys at the beauty shop.  The prices at this site are better.  My wife likes it, so I like it.</li>
    <li> Has a nice clean scent that kind of reminds me of fresh apples. Not very strong at all,  which was kind of a bummer since I love a stronger scent in my hair products since I&#x27;m a smoker.  I hate for my hair to smell like smoke and prefer a nice smelling shampoo to keep it smelling good throughout the day. It does have a nice scent,  though,  and is working really well on my color treated hair,  which I had been worried about.  I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but it&#x27;s a carrot top red that I dye to a darker shade of auburn. Reds are notorious for fading fast, and most moisture rich shampoos and conditioners will fade it out even faster. Thankfully this one doesn&#x27;t,  even though it is not sulfate free. It is still very gentle and low lather so it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair at all. With most moisturizing shampoo and conditioner sets, after using the shampoo your hair will still feel very coarse and tangled until you use the conditioner. I noticed with this that even just after I rinse the shampoo out its detangled and pretty smooth. After the conditioner its super soft and frizz free. Mine also came with a sample of some blow out creme that is really amazing. Cut my drying time in half and left my hair very silky, which is amazing to me because normally after blow drying I have massive frizz and its very puffy until I slather on more thermal protectant serums and flat iron. I still need to flat iron it of course since my hair is naturally curly,  but I don&#x27;t need to use near as much product and it&#x27;s much faster to do. Overall I&#x27;m really impressed with this set and will keep using it as long as I keep getting these results</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo..after the $120.00 salon garbage fried my hair..this shampoo brought back the softness and shine. No more *unite garbage</li>
    <li> Great price... Joico has awesome products! One of my favorites:)  The detangler is great ,too!!  Smells so clean!!</li>
    <li> Horrible it made my hair even dryer then it already was even worst ! I wish I could get a refund ;( wasted my money&lt;br /&gt;!  I&#x27;ll stick to my matrix sleek look!</li>
    <li> This was just the same grade of shampoo and conditioner that I purchased from my salon. I love this stuff and for the price and quantity it was well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I used to always like to &#x27;experiment&#x27; with different shampoos and conditioners. I always buy my hair stuff at Marshalls and they usually have quite an interesting selection. They have several higher quality products to choose from than a grocery store such as Meijer for example. I think the products at Meijer were always watered down and overpriced so i quit buying them there and i started caring more about the health of my hair since i wanted to grow it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I&#x27;d run out of a hair product I&#x27;d run back to Marshalls and try something new. Well not any more. Ever since my purchase of the Joico Moisture Recovery i will never go back to anything else. I remember having tried other versions of the Joico but Moisture Recovery is by far my fav and here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an understanding of my hair type: I have really, really long hair. Its thick and almost down to my butt. I have become obsessed with keeping it healthy. I used to use a straightener everyday but now i rarely ever use one. I use it a touch here and there not even once a week. It has been over 2 years since i used it everyday. I now also only blow dry halfway and only about once a week. I have a lot of hair but the hairs themselves are pretty thin... and slightly wavy. My hair gets colored about every 3-4 months all over with caramel and a very light blonde. The blonde strands take a hard hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Joico moisture recovery because it seriously smells AHH-MAZZZINNNG. I love it so much i kinda wanna pour it all over my body or swim in it or something. It def isn&#x27;t a fruity smell...not a cologne-y smell....but rather a fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers up like crazy. It&#x27;s quite concentrated - not runny at all. I&#x27;m very pleased with the thick consistency. With all the hair i have, i feel like i don&#x27;t have to use tons of it. I usually put all over my head and then i work it to the ends. I don&#x27;t apply directly to the length or ends. Like i said, it lathers up good and plenty unlike lots of other products i have used. I hate it when you can&#x27;t get that lather effect because then you feel like you have to use more than you want in order to achieve &#x27;optimal lather&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition.....BY GOD the conditioner!!!! My favorite of the two. It somehow smells even more heavenly!!! Once again... the consistency is thick and not runny. Just wait till you get your hair in this stuff. I like to go heavy in the length and ends and use less on my head near the roots. It makes your hair sooooooooooooooooooooooo soft and silky. I normally don&#x27;t recommend combing your hair while it&#x27;s wet, but this conditioner allows you to do so. I always brush it before entering shower just to help with the manageability and then when it comes time to condition, i start combing with a wide tooth comb from the ends and i work my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this product and i think i finally found something i can stick to. I have been using it religiously for the past 9 months. I get lots of compliments on my hair so i think I&#x27;ve got a winner here. Amazon has the best price. It&#x27;s a runner up to Marshalls but i like not having to pay tax by purchasing online! :-P</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set, the smell itself is sooooo amazing, and it leaves my hair silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> what a wonderful product. Joice rocks. cant go wrong with it</li>
    <li> I love this brand!! I have used there other products so I knew I would like it. I have very thick long hair. It leaves my hair moisturized and minimizes the frizz related to humidity. I def. Recommend this product#</li>
    <li> great buy for a quality product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on my hair. The pump on the conditioner also came broken.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair feel moisturized..</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it does seem to make my hair softer but I still have some hair breakage and loss although not significant I am thinking of switching to a different shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have thick, course hair and Joico Moisture&lt;br /&gt;Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner make it feel silky, like no other I&#x27;ve tried.  Love these two!!!</li>
    <li> Product did not show the results I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner. I use them and Instacure together, awesome combo! I can not find them at any local stores near me. Thank God for Amazon!! I worry that they might stop making it. That would SUCK because this stuff makes my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I don&#x27;t like any other product by Joico but this stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dora</li>
    <li> Ok so usually I don&#x27;t write reviews but this is amazing. My hair is naturally thick dry curly and i get it colored so I have a lot of frizz. I can only use certain shampoos since my roots get oily easily and a lot of shampoos leave build up behind. I tried the shampoo and conditioner and I love it! Usually when I blow dry my hair I look like I have an afro but the first time i used it there was no frizz and my hair is so much softer and no buildup! On top of that it shortened the blow dry and straightening time. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Joico products including the Kpak line, but this is by far the best. I have naturally curly and super thick hair....so naturally very dry. This duo is awesome! I often blow dry and flat iron my hair and this helps with frizz too!! def recommend to anybody who needs to quench their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! And shipping was extremely fast! Thank you</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best.  The product was recommended by a friend who&#x27;s hair looked great, after looking dry (really fried) for years.  I live in the desert, where it&#x27;s a struggle to keep hair looking healthy and I suffered with split ends no matter what I did.  This shampoo and conditioner saved the day and my hair now looks super smooth and silky with no split ends, even after four months.  I get my hair cut about three times a year and my hair cutter commented on how good it looks.  Also, the ends are not as bleached out from the sun as they used to be.  My hair is auburn, very fine and long and tends to be dry but no more.  I have been using the product for a couple of years and my boyfriend uses it too and is very happy with the quality.  The ingredients are good and  I really like the pump dispenser.  It only takes a small amount of the product, compared to other brands I have used in the past.  The water in this area is really hard and it is usually necessary to use a lot of shampoo and conditioner, so I was surprised to be able to dispense two little pumps of the product and have a small amount of product work really well.  The bottles last a long time and I think it&#x27;s a very good value and quality.</li>
    <li> The best product I ever used on my curly fine hair. Even the haidresser is paying compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair care! I had platinum blonde hair and this stuff kept it in commission. Smells good, works well. Is old school full of phosphates so if youre looking for all natural than I wouldnt order it.</li>
    <li> Love this set! It makes my hair feel so smooth and I love how the shampoo and conditioner come out as a light blue sparkly color! love it!</li>
    <li> Love Joico! Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent shipping and service!</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised and pictured. Came quickly.  I Love the product it really does a great job with my hair. The conditioner is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hair can be really odd and sometimes it&#x27;s dry other time it can be oily. This stuff does a good balancing act. Lives my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed these products!  Very smooth transaction with Amazon</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly, but broken.</li>
    <li> The pump tops don&#x27;t work on either bottle. Sucks to have to unscrew these pump tops and pour this out into my hands. The bottles are large and difficult to do this with wet hands. Won&#x27;t buy this size again.</li>
    <li> I used this every 2 days and my hair is nice and shinny.. and hair fall is lot less as well..</li>
    <li> Every time I go to a new hair stylist, they tell me I have the thickest, curliest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen. Of course I am one of those people who has always wanted straight hair. I have tried almost every product, tool, treatment and haircut on the market to tame my dry, frizzy mop. I&#x27;ve done the Brazilian Keratin and Japanese Straightening treatments, gotten the Ouidad cut for curly hair, tried a permanent salon relaxer, burned through three Chi flat irons (+all their products), and tried a plethora of Moroccan oils, deep conditioners and repairing treatments. Enter Joico. I usually don&#x27;t take the time to review products, but Joico is a true winner. After the first use of the moisture recovery conditioner, my hair was left so silky smooth I could actually run my fingers through it (which never happens for me). Best of all, the product works just as well three months later as it did the first day I tried it. This product has restored moisture, shine and bounce to my hair, which has finally starting to grow longer and healthier. After a decade of searching for the magic bullet, I finally found it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My new favorite shampoo/conditioner.  Had over processed my hair and Joico products gave completely restored the life of my hair.  I have brittle dry hair and this works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner because they keep my hair moisturized and my curls nicely shaped. It makes my hair look healthier without weighing it down. Great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! I had very fragile hair due to dying it recently so bought this as a treat and to good quality and makes hair fresh for days</li>
    <li> Reliable shampoo set and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Would&#x27;ve been five stars if the little free heat set was included. This shampoo smells great and left my hair which is thick and full moisturized and light. I was skeptical because it isn&#x27;t sulfate free but my hair was more soft with this shampoo than with any sulfate free one. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Better products out there.</li>
    <li> A lot less breakage with this shampoo and conditioner....my hair was breaking by the handful and since I starded using this product you rarely see any hair broken off</li>
    <li> I have very staticy hair during the winter.  I was hoping this duo was my answer since I use and like another Joico product.  I had more static in my hair than when I use Nexus Humectress.  I am pretty disappointed in these products.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smells and I really like the way this set smells. It is great for the hair without being stinky!</li>
    <li> Product is what I expected. Decent shampoo and conditioner. I paid for 2 day shipping and it took far longer for it to show up. Poor customer service.</li>
    <li> Received the package on time and the product is amazing! Definitely recommend! The bottles were even bigger than expected! Such a great deal!</li>
    <li> I really like they way this makes my hair feel, not to greasy or weighted down.  It does make my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now. I have really fine thin hair that gets greasy super easily. This leaves my hair soft and completely tangle free without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy. My hair is a tiny bit oily by the end of the day but nothing noticeable. It makes it incredibly soft too. The smell is alright. Defiantly mild. I also combine it with FX Silk Drops (couple dollars at Walmart) and It&#x27;s A 10 leave in spray (17.99 target) which are both a must. Iv also noticed my hair never gets staticky since using this since it is the dry winter.</li>
    <li> Packaging was lessentially than desirable for both my shampoos had leaked creating a bug mess</li>
    <li> I use daily and they recover and moisture my hair. I really liked this brand and the product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow. So far have not seen a difference in my hair, but my hair is color processed so it may take a few months to see any results. Thick shampoo and conditioner not watery at all.</li>
    <li> I love, left my hair very soft</li>
    <li> my hair loves this!  quite a dramatic difference from my old hair products.  I have very curly, long, fine, blond/white (old) hair and after using joico shampoo and conditioner my hair is smooth and untangled but still curly in a lovely,softer way.</li>
    <li> So this stuff is the real deal. I read a ton of the reviews before I ordered and I was hopeful. But you always think &amp;#34;yeah it worked for their hair, but mine is super damaged/dry/icky&amp;#34;. So I got it in the mail, washed my hair last night and then hopped out of the shower. I was going to put leave-in conditioner/detangler in my wet hair (because it&#x27;s always tangled after washing), but I forgot and just started brushing out my hair. I was so surprised at how easy it was to brush through my hair! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it is amazing!! I let me hair air-dry, and usually that would leave my hair a frizzy mess, but it was soft and manageable. And this is after ONE WASH. This shampoo/conditioner duo is amazing. So stop reading reviews and go order it!!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo and Condtioner!  Moisture is great and leaves hair shiny!</li>
    <li> During my last few years in the hair business, I used this product on my clients before a service. Very mild and leaves the hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Great product for restoring moisture to dry hair!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the conditioner is so hydrating. The shampoo is to be desired.  Doesnt wash hair as clean as I would like.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product. I usually use Crome but I seem to be enjoying the way my hair feels. No frizzies, soft yet maintainable.</li>
    <li> Wa really disappointed that the pump on the shampoo arrived broken and all I could get was a partial refund, that won&#x27;t even cover reordering the shampoo separately. I was hoping for a new pump so I could use the product. Packaging wad not the norm for prime.  This was my first mishap though.  I&#x27;ll see if i can get some other kind of bottle to transfer it in to.</li>
    <li> Love this combo!!! It helps with my dry ends and feels like you just left the salon after a shower!</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is quite fine in texture, but I have lots of it. The combination of these two products is perfect for my hair. The shampoo is gentle, and the conditioner is rich but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I shampoo and then work the conditioner through my hair. I twirl it up on top of my head, and leave it there while I complete the rest of my shower to give the conditioner plenty of time to work it&#x27;s magic. When all is said and done, my hair is silky soft and it smells fantastic!  Even my husband commented on how nice it made me smell. :-)</li>
    <li> Okay people shampoo will not fix your hair it just a treatment that makes it look &amp; feel  better. So don&#x27;t expect to have burn hair and for this shampoo to make the miracle to make it healthy. You really got to do research the best way to have a healthy hair is by cutting the split ends. (Or take a cosmetology class). I been using this shampoo for more than 5 years I love it and find it cheaper online. I recommend this shampoo especially if you feel like you have a &amp;#34;dry hair (damage)&amp;#34; it will be a great treatment in your hair. My hair is always moisture and looking healthy and I get plenty of complements for my hait and they ask what shampoo I use and again  it&#x27;s a great treatment but doesn&#x27;t make miracles.</li>
    <li> didnt really work for me... my hair felt kinda gross afterwards. I have naturally blonde hair that is wavy and frizzy; fekkai products smoothed much better</li>
    <li> The packaging was not satisfactory.  The picture showed a cap and then the pumps additionally, but they come with the pumps already on.  If they get tossed around in travel or too hot, as I imagine mine did, they leak from the packaging and can be messy.  Have not tested the product yet, recommend buying but beware of the packaging.</li>
    <li> Really helps detangle hard to manage hair -- nice smell also.  Daughter likes the pump aspect and how it helps to manage her naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly... Good product</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my dry/frizzy hair soft and shiny and smells good. One of my favorites and will continue to use. I also use their deep conditioner about once a week. Can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called, but it is also great.</li>
    <li> My hair is unthinkably soft, shiny, and manageable with this Conditioner. The shampoo is great, but the conditioner really does the trick. As long as they still make it, I&#x27;ll be buying it.</li>
    <li> If you are in need of a shampoo and conditioner that last forever buy this duo set! worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It smells good...clean but, not too&lt;br /&gt;perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;I think it does help with replenishing moisture that having hard water strips.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner. I felt like it made my hair greasier than normal by day two but it felt great so I kept using it. Now my hair has adjusted  so I don&#x27;t have that problem &amp; have softer and  healthier hair than ever.</li>
    <li> i BOUGHT THIS SET OF JOICO SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER AND ALSO THE TREATMENT OF THE SAME BRAND FOR MY EXTREMELY DAMAGED AND OVER PROCESSED HAIR, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS NOW AND IT&#x27;S DOING THE TRICK BUT SLOWLY, DON&#x27;T EXPECT A MIRACLE OVERNIGHT.</li>
    <li> Seriously love this shampoo. Leaves hair so thrillingly (maybe not a word?) soft! I seriously love it. Also lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Bottles are pump style and a joke to open. Shampoo top broke. Seem very stale or old. Not as I had hoped. Leaves my hair feeling unclean.</li>
    <li> I come from a &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; family - my sister is a Redken Elite salon owner, and many other family members are in the industry as well so I have grown up using a variety of high-end hair products.  Since my family is in another city, I ran out of shampoo and conditioner and decided to give Joico a try.  Overall, the size and price makes it worth the purchase, but there are many superior products out there that don&#x27;t cost much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was not good because the pump on the conditioner was broken when I received my package.  The pump that I have on the shampoo definitely works, but 1 pump barely distributes any product, so I have to pump about 8-10 times to get enough shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this combo because another review stated that while it is a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat.  I appreciated that it did not leave my hair flat, but it also didn&#x27;t moisturize hardly at all.  After using this shampoo for about 2-3 months, I forgot it was even named as a moisturizing shampoo until sitting down to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the product smells good and cleanses hair pretty well, so other than the broken pump and non-moisturizing, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price.  I will probably not buy again, but it has lasted for a really long time and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the purchase.</li>
    <li> I will keep coming back to buy this!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair clean, soft, shiny, and silky. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> this made my damaged hair SO soft!!</li>
    <li> Amazing price for the big bottles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely thought I was going to love these.  They are okay, but not up to the standard that I expect from Joico.  There are much better moisture recovery sets around.  And the smell is good, but way too much!  It&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> works well.  smells nice, not overpowering</li>
    <li> My hair feels light and soft and amazing. The scent Is very nice too!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner. I love the size of the bottle &amp; how long it lasts. I got roped into ordering Shampoo &amp; conditioner from a company called Monat that claimed that it would &amp;#34;change your life &amp; hair&amp;#34; but it was complete garbage &amp; they charged WAY too much for it. So for the price &amp; size of this I really love it &amp; it does make my hair very soft. I have very curly hair too so I do not have to use a detangler or leave in conditioner after I shower &amp; can just comb right through it. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> I have dry, damaged hair from dyeing it several times over the past year.  I&#x27;m letting my natural color grow out but no other shampoo or conditioner I tried was as effective as this for damage control.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best deal ever!! Love joico products. I have bleached/dry hair and this stuff makes my hair feel more manageable and soft!</li>
    <li> Great product, super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair soft but still has volume. I have fine thin hair but this makes it feel thicker. I usually wash my hair every day because I can&#x27;t stand how it feels if I don&#x27;t but I can go a day without washing with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for moisturizing gray hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! My hair is long, straight, dry and with a lot of frizz. I had to use a straightener and a spray or a styling gel for my hair to stay in place that I really did not like because the gels would make my hair feel sticky. I started using joico shampoo and conditioner for three weeks now and I cannot believe the change. My hair is smooth, soft and without any tangles. I do not use a straightener at all anymore but my hair looks great.No frizz at all. Dryness gone. I used the conditioner in the beginning but that was making my hair go limp by the next day, so I use only the shampoo now and my hair still looks really great.</li>
    <li> Great it really transformed my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s helping my dry hair be smooth and not as dry and damaged.</li>
    <li> Great product. Amazon price and shipping, what else can I say.</li>
    <li> The first few times I washed my hair with this set it felt great, soft and silky.  Now after a few weeks of use, my hair feels really gross when I&#x27;m trying to blowdry it.  It almost feels like all of the product didn&#x27;t wash out, leaving my hair feeling kinda waxy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price and shipped very well.  Worth every penny</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner combo ever. It makes my hair feel like silk. I ran out of it a few weeks ago and started using Dove conditioner, which sucks so much and took a toll on my hair in no time flat. Finally got my new shipment of this product (and the dry shampoo- also amazing!) and my hair feels like it&#x27;s normal soft and silky self.</li>
