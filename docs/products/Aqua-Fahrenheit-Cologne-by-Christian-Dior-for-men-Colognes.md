      <li>I love this stuff on my hubs and I sometimes spray some on me.</li>
      <li>Equally nice smell as the original ....</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will go back to the original and the best, and</li>
      <li>I think this is most sweet and elegant perfume for men.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about 15 years since I&#x27;ve worn the original Fahrenheit and decided to get the aqua after watching a video review.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>This is the perfume of my husband ever since and he really loved the scents of this Christian Dior .</li>
      <li>A young person would enjoy it the most, teens - 20&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super picky about smells.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this one, with a better price point and a generous bottle</li>
      <li>My favorite fragrance is m7 oud, I was looking for a fresh scent with some depth and character, this missed the mark by far.</li>
      <li>12 hours and still going strong with still a decent amount of projection.</li>
      <li>The original Fahrenheit is still a classic in every sense, and still sells at a premium like it just came into Macy&#x27;s yesterday.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume so I can totally tell if it&#x27;s or not</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of Dior, even though his prices tend to be over inflated, which keeps many of their items priced out of reach at times.  </li>
      <li>The longevity is absolutely stellar.</li>
      <li>Its a nice sweat fruity tuty floral scent that is very common like so many others.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>first you will smell a bit of the old magic, but that quickly dissipates into one very harsh note that I do not like at all, and that is a very over powering grapefruit note.  </li>
      <li>This might just be my new number</li>
      <li>Opening has citrus, some fresh &amp;#34;cucumberish&amp;#34; faint scent &amp;#34;smells clean and masculine&amp;#34; with a hint if the original DNA.</li>
      <li>So harsh, I could not believe what I was smelling and checked to make sure I did not have a slight gas leak somewhere, then I realized it was coming from</li>

    <li> I blind bought this Aqua F and was disappointed.  Its a nice sweat fruity tuty floral scent that is very common like so many others. I will give it away as a gift. A young person would enjoy it the most, teens - 20&#x27;s. My favorite fragrance is m7 oud, I was looking for a fresh scent with some depth and character, this missed the mark by far.</li>
    <li> This is the perfume of my husband ever since and he really loved the scents of this Christian Dior . Sofia</li>
    <li> I ordered this one by mistake, when I got it I noticed it was Aqua. I absolutely love this perfume so I can totally tell if it&#x27;s or not and i have no complains at all . Equally nice smell as the original ....</li>
    <li> This is a good masculant scent. Opening has citrus, some fresh &amp;#34;cucumberish&amp;#34; faint scent &amp;#34;smells clean and masculine&amp;#34; with a hint if the original DNA. versatile for many occassions and weather condotions. Quality juice!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Dior, even though his prices tend to be over inflated, which keeps many of their items priced out of reach at times.  The original Fahrenheit is still a classic in every sense, and still sells at a premium like it just came into Macy&#x27;s yesterday.  I had high hopes for this one, with a better price point and a generous bottle I was eager to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first you will smell a bit of the old magic, but that quickly dissipates into one very harsh note that I do not like at all, and that is a very over powering grapefruit note.  It buries all the other potential of this fragrance and just hangs there to the point that it is obnoxious.  It smells overly synthetic and there is not a hint of lingering sweetness to it at all. It is again, harsh. So harsh, I could not believe what I was smelling and checked to make sure I did not have a slight gas leak somewhere, then I realized it was coming from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is just my body chemistry that does not agree with it, but I have a nose like no ones business, and for a bottle with aqua on it, there is no aqua, not even close, nor a beach or body of water in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to the original and the best, and still the only one other then Miyaki Bleu that I have worn that made the ladies swoon upon smelling it. That is the magic you want. This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am putting it up for sale and will stick with Eternity aqua for now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff on my hubs and I sometimes spray some on me. I smelled it in a co worker and bought it that night. I&#x27;m super picky about smells. I&#x27;m glad I found another scent I love.</li>
    <li> Great product good price.</li>
    <li> Christian Dior Aqua Fahrenheit Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 2....good , nice, perfect . really good thing...i love it.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Fahrenheit and are wondering whether you should, just go for it~</li>
    <li> Compliments almost everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> Out of the bottle it is a little over powering to me, but my nose is a little on the sensitive side so FYI. After about an hour the petroleum sort of scent mellows and what&#x27;s left is a softer woodsy citrus type of fragrance. It&#x27;s been about 15 years since I&#x27;ve worn the original Fahrenheit and decided to get the aqua after watching a video review. Amazon&#x27;s price was great which was another plus. I bought this totally blind and I&#x27;m not disappointed. This might just be my new number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick update 4/9/14 - The longevity is absolutely stellar. 12 hours and still going strong with still a decent amount of projection. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I think this is most sweet and elegant perfume for men. Good for my father and my husband.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping to APO. 100%</li>
