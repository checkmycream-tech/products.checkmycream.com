      <li>performs great in every way.</li>
      <li>good hold; smells great.  </li>
      <li>Loved the product.</li>
      <li>Love the smell too!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>With that said, it&#x27;s still nice have something that doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and works into the hair leaving it softer than before.  </li>
      <li>THE MOLDING CREAM IS VERY EASY TO WORK WITH.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to be removed from hands and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They smell wonderful and make my hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>Moroccan Oil products in general are awesome.</li>
      <li>Great item, fast shipping</li>
      <li>I bought some and absolutely love it.    </li>
      <li>LOVE THE SCENT.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Works okay.</li>
      <li>I love my morroccan oil</li>
      <li>Best party is definitely the smell.</li>
      <li>love that stuff and my hair salon was out because they are redoing the formula or something.</li>
      <li>My favorite brand, my favorite product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It smells awesome but is neutral, not masculine or feminine smelling.  </li>
      <li>Very nice soft and buttery with a lovely smell.</li>
      <li>Smell is intense but good (reminds me of tony and guy product scent).</li>
      <li>It creates some nice texture and volume and can make ends have a nice piecy effect while leaving hair incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this stuff is easy to use in the hair and molds well.       </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Wish they made fragrance free</li>
      <li>I switched to sexy short hair quick change and love it!</li>
      <li>The paste is very soft, creamy-watery and very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Depending on the quantity one applies it gets a dry or wet look - and that is perfect.</li>
      <li>The hold is good, not super strong but it leaves my hair looking very natural.</li>
      <li>Plus, now that I&#x27;ve been reading more about the company and know it uses silicone in other products, I&#x27;m concerned about what might be in here (can&#x27;t easily find an ingredient list).</li>
      <li>I was previously using B&amp;B Sumotech which is good</li>
      <li>I love my hair the next day.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair controlled, smooth and with natural motion.  </li>
      <li>So i pour a little of the moroccan light oil in my hand and mix it with the molding cream to create a smooth styled finish.</li>
      <li>and I expected to love this just as much.</li>
      <li>and you have a real winner product.</li>
      <li>I really really like this stuff;</li>
      <li>But if you really need it to hold a style then you&#x27;ll need to use something else.  </li>
      <li>huge minus</li>
      <li>If I shower but don&#x27;t use shampoo, the next day my hair has do much volume without any product.</li>
      <li>Second, it does make my hair pretty sticky, but I actually like this.</li>
      <li>so I just stopped and it went back to normal.</li>
      <li>First off, I have no problem with white flakes in my hair like some other users.</li>
      <li>Product was old and left white chunks of cream in my hair that had to be washed out</li>
      <li>If you merely want some slight added texture on a loose flexible look then this can work great for beachy &#x27;do.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much or how little I use, this product makes my hair so sticky I can&#x27;t get my fingers through it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Give up hairspray and just use this product.  Leaves hair controlled, smooth and with natural motion.  Love it!</li>
    <li> performs great in every way. Son uses it for longish hair style. Wish they made fragrance free</li>
    <li> Product was old and left white chunks of cream in my hair that had to be washed out</li>
    <li> Been using this since I cut my hair short and my stylist used it on me - I was hooked! I have fine hair and I use a pea-sized amount, it holds well and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. One tub lasts me and my husband (we both use it) about 6 months. Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> The paste is very soft, creamy-watery and very easy to apply. Depending on the quantity one applies it gets a dry or wet look - and that is perfect. I believe it&#x27;s water based so it&#x27;s very easy to be removed from hands and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that I noticed the hair getting drier after every time I applied it so I just stopped and it went back to normal. Retried and another failure, that&#x27;s when I stopped and gave it to a friend that likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works well to control frizz and soften curls.</li>
    <li> I love my morroccan oil and I expected to love this just as much. Unfortunately this made my head itch really bad and I can&#x27;t stand to use it. Also it didn&#x27;t provide the separation or hold that I wanted for my short pixie hairstyle.  I switched to sexy short hair quick change and love it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER OF THE MOROCCAN OIL MOLDING CREAM. I ALSO PURCHASED THE SHAMPOO AND ONDITIONER FROM AMAZO. LOVE THE SCENT. THE MOLDING CREAM IS VERY EASY TO WORK WITH. START WITH A LITTLE AT A TIME.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much or how little I use, this product makes my hair so sticky I can&#x27;t get my fingers through it. Plus, now that I&#x27;ve been reading more about the company and know it uses silicone in other products, I&#x27;m concerned about what might be in here (can&#x27;t easily find an ingredient list).</li>
    <li> love that stuff and my hair salon was out because they are redoing the formula or something. Got the last one</li>
    <li> It creates some nice texture and volume and can make ends have a nice piecy effect while leaving hair incredibly soft. But the actual hold of this product is not long-lasting. With that said, it&#x27;s still nice have something that doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and works into the hair leaving it softer than before.  But if you really need it to hold a style then you&#x27;ll need to use something else.  If you merely want some slight added texture on a loose flexible look then this can work great for beachy &#x27;do.  Smell is intense but good (reminds me of tony and guy product scent).</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this!</li>
    <li> My wife uses some other moroccanoil products bit after I got my hair cut and styled my stylist used and recommended this molding cream for me. I bought some and absolutely love it.    First off, I have no problem with white flakes in my hair like some other users. Don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about. Second, it does make my hair pretty sticky, but I actually like this. If I shower but don&#x27;t use shampoo, the next day my hair has do much volume without any product. I love my hair the next day. Anyway, this stuff is easy to use in the hair and molds well.       Best party is definitely the smell. I wish they made a cologne or perfume of this smell. It smells awesome but is neutral, not masculine or feminine smelling.  I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works okay. The fragrance was too overpowering for my wife to handle (she said it smells like Cabbage Patch Doll hair), so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Holds  hair perfectly without looking greasy</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my friend who runs a salon. I was previously using B&amp;B Sumotech which is good but I found this molding cream to be lighter and easier to distribute. My thick hair can cause creams to clump in places if I&#x27;m not careful. The hold is good, not super strong but it leaves my hair looking very natural. It is also less expensive than what I was using.</li>
    <li> I have permed African American hair with a short pixie cut. I find that when i use it alone it can be too drying for my hair. So i pour a little of the moroccan light oil in my hand and mix it with the molding cream to create a smooth styled finish. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand, my favorite product. I use this on the daily and it does zero damage. Moroccan Oil products in general are awesome. They smell wonderful and make my hair feel soft. This is no different. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very nice soft and buttery with a lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I really really like this stuff; good hold; smells great.  One huge minus: when your rub your hands together to apply this product it leaves little white granules that could be misinterpreted as dandruff.  Moroccan Oil: fix this and you have a real winner product.</li>
    <li> goopy and sticky. ick.</li>
