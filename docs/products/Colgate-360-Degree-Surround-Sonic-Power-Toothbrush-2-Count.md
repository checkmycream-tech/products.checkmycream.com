### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>if  you use or need a toothbrush with a slender head, this might not be the best for you.</li>
      <li>very nice!!!!  </li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>My checkups have been great since I started to use these</li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>they work amazing and for 10 bucks you cant beat it !</li>
      <li>great price works good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice if you are looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I had used Colgate power toothbrushes before and loved them, but they don&#x27;t carry them anymore at the store.</li>
      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>The kids love using them!</li>
      <li>Love that it has replaceable batteries!  </li>
      <li>It does a nice job cleaning the surfaces of my teeth.</li>
      <li>It came with batteries which was nice.</li>
      <li>However, the toothbrush vibrates very lightly, so</li>
      <li>It does the job better than brushing alone.</li>
      <li>Yes I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Might be more appropriate for a child.</li>
      <li>I love these toothbrushes and for the price they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I really love this toothbrush</li>
      <li>I do like the more aggressive cleaning, however, that these sonic/mechanical brushes accomplish.  </li>
      <li>The product is okay.</li>
      <li>We keep these on a subscription as we love them.</li>
      <li>and my gums are better massaged, tongue cleaner,</li>
      <li>Good buy, the Colgate 360 power toothbrush is light, efficient and powerful.</li>
      <li>I love having the clean of an electronic toothbrush, but the ease of brushing my teeth by hand instead.</li>
      <li>I have tried many and so far this is by far the best for the price.</li>
      <li>bought one for me and the wife luckily it comes with two!</li>
      <li>Best toothbrush if the brush head was full bristle and was offered in medium and hard.</li>
      <li>I love these tooth brushes they make bridging so much easier and simpler.</li>
      <li>Me and my boyfriend use it as a normal toothbrush and it&#x27;s still okay.</li>
      <li>The first one kept running on the original battery for 6 months, and it still runs since I put it into my travel wet-pack.  </li>
      <li>Not as soft as I would like, but better than the oral b brushes I had been buying.</li>
      <li>But, the convenience with increased cleaning of this toothbrush is extremely compelling as the perfect compromise between a regular brush and the other sonic/powered types I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I also love the tongue brush on the opposite side</li>
      <li>They definitely feel better than just using a manual brush.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s going to be better because it is likely</li>
      <li>the Sonicare does have what seems to be, for lack of better explanation, a higher sonic frequency with a more pliable, albeit somewhat small, brush.  </li>
      <li>it really helps keep my mouth smelling fresh and getting the taste of food off my tongue</li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it, and I see a real difference over a normal toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They are soft and clean very well.  </li>
      <li>how much I paid for 2 of them.  </li>
      <li>He was really surprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, really get the plaque off your teeth before it becomes a problem.</li>
      <li>very inexpensive for a electric tooth brush</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them as they are strong and the battery last longer than the recommended use of a tooth brush.</li>
      <li>No recharger issues and a size that is truly close to a conventional toothbrush while adding the tremendous benefit of sonic aided cleaning eliminates most downsides to brushes such as the Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t stress how highly I recommend trying it.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to think about when it&#x27;s time for a new toothbrush</li>
      <li>With Subscribe and Save, I can just replace the old ones when the new ones are delivered.</li>
      <li>, I use the Sonicare unit and old heads to clean bathroom tile grout and other</li>
      <li>The head is smaller and for me this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the similar Colgate MaxWhite Adult Full Head Soft, Sonic Powered Toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress convenience enough, or a very well thought out compact size.  </li>
      <li>Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>so I was surprised when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>why pay $20-30 for an expensive sonic brand, just as much for replacement heads and too many replacement batteries, whenColgate makes these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I bet the battery will last the entire 6 months, and I can use it to replace my older wet-pack</li>
      <li>These do last a long time, but they are a bit large for petite mouths so</li>
      <li>This Colgate may have some shortcomings for some users such as possibly what some perceive as a smallish head with firmer brushes and integrated rubber rounded fingers, but the sum total effect is a very compact brush that adds the undeniable benefits of sonic cleaning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;He has asked me during my recent visit, after using the first Colgate brush for 6 months, if I was brushing more than 3-4 times a day since the plaque was hardly there!!!  </li>
      <li>It is very affordable compared to other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Someone finally got the self-contained small electric toothbrush right!  </li>

<li> Fussing with replacing batteries too often, dealing with the Sonicare brush head replacements, and a having to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; the head, opening it to remove water inside the thing where the magnet touches the bottom, and holding down button switch to get even 30 seconds of sonic action was frustrating....and the replacement heads can cost between $20-30.  </li>
<li> The pulsing action is not like that of a spin brush, it literally vibrates, but not very strongly.</li>
<li> Since I don&#x27;t like to keep the aforementioned devices charger on my limited space vanity I found them more inconvenient to keep charged and usable.  </li>
<li> I enjoy the sonic power with out needing an expensive toothbrush that must be plugged in to re-charge.</li>
<li> I got a pack of blue and pink though.</li>
<li> I can never keep track of how long we use our toothbrushes.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m not exactly a stranger to mechanical toothbrush devices.  </li>
<li> I told him no, I brush at least twice a day, maybe three times, but that it was \\&quot;just an inexpensive, simple Colgate sonic toothbrush with the plastic moving strips and the bumpy surfaces!\\&quot; and</li>
<li> Since I change my toothbrush at least every 6 months, I am using the second one now, and no problems....</li>
<li> Too bad, because at least you can replace the batteries easily in this one, and the battery lasts way longer than on the Oral B battery-powered toothbrush!</li>
<li> That said I found myself using them less and less due to the charging thing.  </li>
<li> The last time that I went to the dentist for a cleaning, he told me that that he hardly needed to give me the cleaning because he noticed that I hardly had any tartar in my mouth.</li>
<li> do other chores!!)</li>
<li> The brush is thick and bulky and feels very awkward in my adult male mouth.</li>
<li> Feels like it&#x27;s doing nothing - at least compared to a Philips Sonicare brush.</li>
<li> Also, the oscillation is of questionable value.</li>
<li> I got these two Colgate sonic brushes to replace my fancy, expensive Sonicare brush with batteries, which Sonicare had to send to me to replace their rechargeable version that died within 2 months.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this one has some rubbery flaps in the brush that feel awkward and squeaky when I brush my teeth.</li>
<li> Very difficult to brush with.</li>

    <li> Good buy. We like these toothbrushes. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush if the brush head was full bristle and was offered in medium and hard.</li>
    <li> These do last a long time, but they are a bit large for petite mouths so if  you use or need a toothbrush with a slender head, this might not be the best for you. The pulsing action is not like that of a spin brush, it literally vibrates, but not very strongly. It does a nice job cleaning the surfaces of my teeth. Try to keep in mind it is still a fully manual toothbrush and to use it as such, it is just supplemented with vibration.</li>
    <li> We keep these on a subscription as we love them. Highly recommend them as they are strong and the battery last longer than the recommended use of a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Yes I love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> great price works good</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this toothbrush.  I would totally recommend this toothbrush.  It is very affordable compared to other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love having the clean of an electronic toothbrush, but the ease of brushing my teeth by hand instead. They definitely feel better than just using a manual brush.</li>
    <li> They are soft and clean very well.  I have tried many and so far this is by far the best for the price. Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> The head is smaller and for me this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the similar Colgate MaxWhite Adult Full Head Soft, Sonic Powered Toothbrush. Might be more appropriate for a child. It is somewhat cheaper however.</li>
    <li> very nice!!!!  thks  pedro maina</li>
    <li> I got these two Colgate sonic brushes to replace my fancy, expensive Sonicare brush with batteries, which Sonicare had to send to me to replace their rechargeable version that died within 2 months. Fussing with replacing batteries too often, dealing with the Sonicare brush head replacements, and a having to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; the head, opening it to remove water inside the thing where the magnet touches the bottom, and holding down button switch to get even 30 seconds of sonic action was frustrating....and the replacement heads can cost between $20-30.  I was replacing drained batteries every 2 weeks. YIKES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got these Colgate sonic toothbrushes--no problems whatsoever!  The first one kept running on the original battery for 6 months, and it still runs since I put it into my travel wet-pack.  Since I change my toothbrush at least every 6 months, I am using the second one now, and no problems....and I bet the battery will last the entire 6 months, and I can use it to replace my older wet-pack brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bigger issue: Does this Colgate sonic brush work just as well as the fancy Sonicare? YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has seen the improvement in having less plaque this recent visit (I go every 6 months!) and my gums are better massaged, tongue cleaner, etc.  I had an Oral-B spin brush before the Sonicare brush but it scratched the enamel so he said I needed a sonic brush recommending Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has asked me during my recent visit, after using the first Colgate brush for 6 months, if I was brushing more than 3-4 times a day since the plaque was hardly there!!!  I told him no, I brush at least twice a day, maybe three times, but that it was \\&quot;just an inexpensive, simple Colgate sonic toothbrush with the plastic moving strips and the bumpy surfaces!\\&quot; and how much I paid for 2 of them.  He was really surprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why pay $20-30 for an expensive sonic brand, just as much for replacement heads and too many replacement batteries, whenColgate makes these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, I use the Sonicare unit and old heads to clean bathroom tile grout and other do other chores!!)</li>
    <li> I had used Colgate power toothbrushes before and loved them, but they don&#x27;t carry them anymore at the store. Unfortunately, this one has some rubbery flaps in the brush that feel awkward and squeaky when I brush my teeth. Don&#x27;t like it. Too bad, because at least you can replace the batteries easily in this one, and the battery lasts way longer than on the Oral B battery-powered toothbrush!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on thine and performed as promised. I enjoy the sonic power with out needing an expensive toothbrush that must be plugged in to re-charge.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. I actually didn&#x27;t know that it is an electric toothbrush so I was surprised when I opened the package. It came with batteries which was nice. However, the toothbrush vibrates very lightly, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice if you are looking for an electric toothbrush. Me and my boyfriend use it as a normal toothbrush and it&#x27;s still okay.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as I would like, but better than the oral b brushes I had been buying. I put them on subscription so I don&#x27;t have to think about when it&#x27;s time for a new toothbrush</li>
    <li> Have been using them for our kids for a month and haven&#x27;t had any issues. The kids love using them!</li>
    <li> bought one for me and the wife luckily it comes with two! they work amazing and for 10 bucks you cant beat it !</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. The last time that I went to the dentist for a cleaning, he told me that that he hardly needed to give me the cleaning because he noticed that I hardly had any tartar in my mouth. I was in and out of the dentist chair. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I need to reorder these!</li>
    <li> Love that it has replaceable batteries!  Doesn&#x27;t rattle around like some do--more of a vibration.</li>
    <li> very inexpensive for a electric tooth brush .. works well</li>
    <li> The brush is thick and bulky and feels very awkward in my adult male mouth. Very difficult to brush with. Also, the oscillation is of questionable value. Feels like it&#x27;s doing nothing - at least compared to a Philips Sonicare brush.</li>
    <li> I love these tooth brushes they make bridging so much easier and simpler. The batteries last a long time. I also love the tongue brush on the opposite side it really helps keep my mouth smelling fresh and getting the taste of food off my tongue</li>
    <li> I can never keep track of how long we use our toothbrushes.  With Subscribe and Save, I can just replace the old ones when the new ones are delivered.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush. It does the job better than brushing alone. I got a pack of blue and pink though. Not blue and gray like the picture.</li>
    <li> Being the owner of Sonicare as well as Oral B Spin model I&#x27;m not exactly a stranger to mechanical toothbrush devices.  Since I don&#x27;t like to keep the aforementioned devices charger on my limited space vanity I found them more inconvenient to keep charged and usable.  I do like the more aggressive cleaning, however, that these sonic/mechanical brushes accomplish.  They simply leave your teeth feeling noticeably cleaner feeling.  That said I found myself using them less and less due to the charging thing.  Enter the Colgate Surround Sonic brush.  Someone finally got the self-contained small electric toothbrush right!  This Colgate may have some shortcomings for some users such as possibly what some perceive as a smallish head with firmer brushes and integrated rubber rounded fingers, but the sum total effect is a very compact brush that adds the undeniable benefits of sonic cleaning.  I can&#x27;t stress convenience enough, or a very well thought out compact size.  No recharger issues and a size that is truly close to a conventional toothbrush while adding the tremendous benefit of sonic aided cleaning eliminates most downsides to brushes such as the Sonicare.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s going to be better because it is likely the Sonicare does have what seems to be, for lack of better explanation, a higher sonic frequency with a more pliable, albeit somewhat small, brush.  But, the convenience with increased cleaning of this toothbrush is extremely compelling as the perfect compromise between a regular brush and the other sonic/powered types I&#x27;ve tried.  I really love this toothbrush and I can&#x27;t stress how highly I recommend trying it.  The fact it&#x27;s a stone bargain seals the deal!</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes and for the price they can&#x27;t be beat. My teeth feel really clean after using it, and I see a real difference over a normal toothbrush. My checkups have been great since I started to use these, really get the plaque off your teeth before it becomes a problem.</li>
    <li> Good buy, the Colgate 360 power toothbrush is light, efficient and powerful. It is pleasing, too, to get a second toothbrush in the packet.</li>
    <li> my dentist likes this too</li>
