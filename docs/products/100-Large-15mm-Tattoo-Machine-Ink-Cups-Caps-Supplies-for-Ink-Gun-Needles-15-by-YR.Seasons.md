    <li> Ok, so this time I got the size right! Last time, I don&#x27;t even remember which size I got, but it was so damn tiny... only couple dips and the ink was gone, but this is perfect! I do a lot of one color, lots of ink tribals and stuff, so I don&#x27;t really need bunch of small cups around.</li>
    <li> Expected size, worked as ink cups should. Would and will buy again. I liked how they sent them in smaller more controllable bags.</li>
    <li> These are everything they say they are. Arrived promptly &amp; in good condition. Nice little ink caps! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> These are VERY large, the do not fit in the tattoo holder.. :(&lt;br /&gt;i dont use them!  Kind of a waste, unless you want HUGE ink caps</li>
    <li> They came in a generic ziplock bag god only knows how many hands have actually touched them I will not be buying ever again</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner... BUT.&lt;br /&gt;The count was not 100 it was 91. And they came in a ziplock brand sandwich bag. Who is to tell that the product is even sterilized.  They can not be used now.</li>
    <li> I like the size of these because they&#x27;re big enough if I had to mix colors, yeah I wish they came with some smaller cups but these seem to be working great with what I need to do.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I only recieved 50 i paid for a 100..not pleased</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than they actually came without a bunch of nasty stuff in them like the last ones I orders from another supplier ( moms)</li>
    <li> this is a really great deal... i purchase ink caps on a regular basis and never have i found a deal better then this one... i will return for more</li>
    <li> Way too expensive.the shippimg took for ever. Domt waste your money</li>
    <li> Done know what to say lol they work as they should</li>
    <li> These are good ink caps.  I don&#x27;t really see a difference in these and others I&#x27;ve bought from &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; companies</li>
    <li> these are clean and solid little pieces, they fit perfectly in any trays i want them in or i can stand them on their own without tipping easily. For the price these are absolutely perfect and i got them in four days.</li>
    <li> These caps are nice and deep however, the way they were molded or something cause them to cool with a little piece of plastic on the very bottom of the ink cap sticking out of the shape causing them to not sit flat.&lt;br /&gt;theyll do if you dont have anything else but with 6 years experience nothing has annoyed me more besides shallow ink caps and barbing those needles from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;THESE CAPS ARE FOR THE SCRATCHERS.</li>
    <li> was a good buy price wasn&#x27;t to high and will buy more when I&#x27;m in need plus shipped very fast</li>
