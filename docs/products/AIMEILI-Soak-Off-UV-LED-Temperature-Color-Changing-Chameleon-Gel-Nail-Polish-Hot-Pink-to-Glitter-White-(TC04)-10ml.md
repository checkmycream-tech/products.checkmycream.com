      <li>need more colors :</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this polish.</li>
      <li>Love love this polish.</li>
      <li>Really enjoying this polish.</li>
      <li>Love to watch the colors change.</li>
      <li>but i put two gelish sparkle colors on top and it looks better.</li>
      <li>The color change worked so good and the dark fuschia was beautiful.</li>
      <li>Must use with LED light and must put a finish gel coat on top or color will come off.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and stays on well.  </li>
      <li>This polish is clear with silver sparkles when warm, so I layered it on top of a nude polish for more coverage.</li>
      <li>looks cheap.  </li>
      <li>It dries smooth so there are no glitter edges to snare clothing or hair.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this gel nail polish - really changed colors!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>Fun color changing polish!</li>
      <li>The white is not as bright as the picture.</li>
      <li>Love the color changes - really works well.</li>
      <li>So far I have had it on for 2 weeks and still  looks nice.</li>
      <li>This gel polish is so cool.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That being said, If I had the 90-120 minutes in my schedule free to do my nails every 2-3 days, it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>It took a while to arrive to me but seeing as though it came from China and the product  continues to deliver great wear after  one week of chip free application that far out weighed  the cons, its also thick enough to really look excellent  on my nails.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived almost a week before estimated!</li>
      <li>I used the Gelaze top coat gel and so far, no chipping.</li>
      <li>But if done correctly it is so fun.</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>The photo and listing led me to believe that this polish would be opaque white glitter when warm.</li>
      <li>This one is my all time favorite color so far of this brand.</li>
      <li>It worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have so much fun with this.</li>
      <li>Have a lot of fun of the color changing.</li>
      <li>Still fun though and especially for the price! :)</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>actually you may be able to get away with one coat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this polish!!</li>
      <li>it really works!</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
      <li>I think it will be better in the winter when my hands are go from warm to cold more often than in the summer when my hands are mostly the same temp.</li>
      <li>So pretty, today is the first day I&#x27;ve worn it and everyone loves it.  </li>
      <li>Still pretty, just not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>The only problem is the overseas shipping takes forever, but it was free, so hey!</li>
      <li>I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>It is really pretty.</li>
      <li>This is my first bottle of color changing nail polish.</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>What can I say - the color contrast between the pink and the white is great -</li>
      <li>Its super sensitive to color change its winter time now</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>Took FOREVER to arrive and really stinky.</li>
      <li>much thicker than im used to but spreads opaque.</li>
      <li>has worn really well.</li>
      <li>In reality, it&#x27;s more clear with shimmery white glitter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is cool, however, it stays the lighter color when on nails, only goes the real color when hands are in cold water or cold air. Not what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Polish is thick and sticky...appears old</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Easy to apply and stays on well.  Love to watch the colors change.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this polish. It changes color from light pink when hot and dark pink when cold. It has a little glitter in it which makes it more teen like than my taste but I have been wearing this color for over three weeks. Must use with LED light and must put a finish gel coat on top or color will come off. But if done correctly it is so fun.</li>
    <li> I lovee this nail polish!! This is my first bottle of color changing nail polish. Its super sensitive to color change its winter time now and once i leave from inside to get in my car my nails turn from a icey white to frushia  pink. My nails are long, so all though out the day my nails are two toned half white and pink. It took a while to arrive to me but seeing as though it came from China and the product  continues to deliver great wear after  one week of chip free application that far out weighed  the cons, its also thick enough to really look excellent  on my nails. Definitely a 5 star  product now i must go do some requested manicures from my family.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this gel polish</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite gel nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People love when I pick up Somthing cold and my nails start to change to jot pink. It&#x27;s just to cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need more colors :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to every lady.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this brand, very happy with this purchase. I was a little nervous switching from gelish, but this product has proven itself! The color change worked so good and the dark fuschia was beautiful. I only needed two coats and achieved perfect color. I&#x27;m buying more after I finish this post!</li>
    <li> It looks fabulous!!!😍😍</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived almost a week before estimated!</li>
    <li> Brought it for my wife it is darker then she expected but she like it</li>
    <li> The white is not as bright as the picture. It turns a light pink white. The pink turns to the same pink as in the picture. Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as my other gel nail polishes from other sellers maybe because those were $15 a bottle. You get what you pay for. And this bottle is so small not even worth what they are asking for it.</li>
    <li> Took FOREVER to arrive and really stinky. Nice colors, though.</li>
    <li> The glitter is beautiful, the color change works flawlessly, and application was easy. I am super happy with the appearance of the polish and love the look of this manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the gel chipped very easily. I redid two fingernails after three days. Two days later and three more fingernails peeled off completely, one of which was the thumb I had already redone. I&#x27;m five days into my mani, have had to strip and redo some of my nails already, and am typing this with three fingers completely naked of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with both polish and gel sticking to me before, and know that I probably won&#x27;t get a 14-day mani out of gel polish because my weird mutant fingernails are somehow growing with teflon in them, but I have had much better luck with other gel polish brands that will at least give me a week or more before I have to start stripping and repainting my fingernails. Not sure why this polish is giving me such a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, If I had the 90-120 minutes in my schedule free to do my nails every 2-3 days, it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this temperature variant color nail polish.  It is FANTASTIC!  What can I say - the color contrast between the pink and the white is great - and I get the best comments!</li>
    <li> Love it! Stays on until you take it off!</li>
    <li> I have so much fun with this. It works amazing! Great relatively fast shipping. Good quality. Even working on acrylics and over other colors. Used CND shellac top coat and it stayed on for weeks</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful. The white has glitter and is a pale white/clear color when cold and the pink is a hot pink when cold. I get so many compliments on this polish. The ombre effect is neat when you are in between temps and the tips are only pink and the base stays white.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this polish. I have gotten several variations of color changing. See the photos. I used the Gelaze top coat gel and so far, no chipping.</li>
    <li> looks great lot of people asked about it</li>
    <li> The photo and listing led me to believe that this polish would be opaque white glitter when warm. In reality, it&#x27;s more clear with shimmery white glitter. Still pretty, just not what I was expecting. The formula is typical of a glitter gel polish, and the brush is rather wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is slow, it took a full month for my order to arrive. In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with the BMC polishes. Their bottles are larger and shipping is quicker at a similar price.</li>
    <li> love this!!! it&#x27;s a really pretty pink when my fingers get cold. it really works!</li>
    <li> Just painted on one layer over the base gel coat and then topped it off with a gel top coat and it works like magic! I love the color changing and the little sparkle sequins in the polish!</li>
    <li> This product is so cool!! When I first got it, I was constantly submerging my fingers into cold water to see the color change! It goes on a nice opaque white and when its cold, turns hot pink! I did a base coat, 2 thin coats, and a top coat and the polish has worn really well. Would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This gel polish is so cool.  It actually does change color, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do that. I knew it was suppose to change color but that doesn&#x27;t always mean its going to do what it says. It worth the price. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Nice nail polish. Applies easily, but the temperature needs change drastically for the color to change on its own. Still fun though and especially for the price! :)</li>
    <li> This one is my all time favorite color so far of this brand. Will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> ive tested it. i normally use gelish brand. have their top and base coats. used with that.  much thicker than im used to but spreads opaque. one thick coat needed. turns dark pink when cold white when warm. like a silver white. the only thing i domt like is the sparkles inside. looks cheap.  but i put two gelish sparkle colors on top and it looks better. did not affect the changing affect.</li>
    <li> love love love this color!! Its actually turn to a pretty pale natural pink with glitter when it&#x27;s hot, and pretty bright pink when its cold.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Long lasting. I ordered this color, a purple/pink color, a base coat and a top coat. I will be back for more. The only problem is the overseas shipping takes forever, but it was free, so hey! Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! So much fun....  if you are not comfortable with nail art this is the way to go .</li>
    <li> Really works! It&#x27;s just a little hard to work with but worth it. I&#x27;ve had mine on for 5 days so far and it still looks great!</li>
    <li> LOVE this gel nail polish - really changed colors!</li>
    <li> So pretty, today is the first day I&#x27;ve worn it and everyone loves it.  I gave it four stars only because it is pretty thick and kinda hard to apply.  But personally I like it enough I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail. Love the color!!!</li>
    <li> So far I love it. A little thick for polish but works great. So far I have had it on for 2 weeks and still  looks nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this product! I will be ordering more colors. It works really well and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Kind of on the fence about this color.  It looked better in the ad. It looks good, but not liking the way it looks on me.  I guess i am not a glitter person.  Great for a costume party or just on your feet. It is  thick enough to only use 2 coats....actually you may be able to get away with one coat. It dries smooth so there are no glitter edges to snare clothing or hair.  So I will take off one star for the color.</li>
    <li> Have a lot of fun of the color changing. Some of my friends ask about it and I got some compliments.</li>
    <li> Love this polish! Very sensitive to the cold and immediatly changes color. Quite durable, has lasted a week on my worker nails, which is good for a gel polish.</li>
    <li> Fun color changing polish!</li>
    <li> I will never buy doesn&#x27;t  work well</li>
    <li> It truly does change color based on temps!  I think it will be better in the winter when my hands are go from warm to cold more often than in the summer when my hands are mostly the same temp. This polish is clear with silver sparkles when warm, so I layered it on top of a nude polish for more coverage. It is really pretty. Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors.</li>
    <li> does not stay on well</li>
    <li> Love the color. It later over 2 wks! I received compliments from do many women. I highly recommend this polish!!</li>
    <li> Awesome polish!! Wish I could still buy it.</li>
    <li> Love love this polish. Just like the picture. Got alot of complaints. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is cool but it looks weird when ur hands are not cold/hot enough to make the full change.</li>
    <li> Love the color changes - really works well.</li>
    <li> The color is basically thick, glittery white. It only changed to pink when I washed my hands with cool water and immediately went back to white when I dried them.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but its kinda thick, but that only means I have to aply less.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel nail polish I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s amazing. I will be buying all of my bail polish through them in the future.</li>
    <li> Great color change polish. Long lasting. Works with the base and top coat I have. I&#x27;m normally not a &#x27;glitter&#x27; in my nail polish kinda gal, but I prefer it in color change polish. In my opinion, it softens color transitions. Simply a personal preference.</li>
