      <li>I cant say that I have seen amazing results but its not bad.</li>
      <li>Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all the more reason for me to really take good care of my skin in the ways that I can control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This floral water is not only pleasant when it comes to scent but is also very refreshing to the skin.</li>
      <li>this also helps diminish the signs of age by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet, and one of my favorite features</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> MY REVIEW..&lt;br /&gt;I saw that Doctor Oz recommended this so I had to try it.  I know that Hyaluronic Acid is one of the new fountain of youth ingredients do I wasn&#x27;t worried about it breaking my face out.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but my skin is starting to sag.  I&#x27;ve noticed since using this product my skin is firming up and the few wrinkles I do have has lessened.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is it stinks!!! I know beauty is pain but when did it start stinking lol.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last long but wow lol.</li>
    <li> petunia skincare feels gentle on my skin and hydrates really well. I only need a tiny bit of the product for it to cover my entire face. The product smells really pretty and natural and I feel like I am using a natural product as well. I will continue to use this product for a long time in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hyaluronic acid serums and most of them do the exact same thing, but have different ingredients and properties. Petunia Skincare&#x27;s Hyaluronic acid serum is non-greasy and drys quickly without any strong scents. After using it morning and night for a couple weeks, I noticed a difference in my skins moisture retention. As someone with severely dry skin, this is the most important property in any product. It also had a slight cooling sensation, which was a huge bonus I hadn&#x27;t experienced with other products. Since my skin can become dry and itchy, any cooling is a plus. I really enjoy this serum, it seems to be working better than some previous serums I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;ll definitely be on my must have list for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it along with the eye serum.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but really like it. Most of these products make my face red or blotchy but this one hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use. My moisturizer and make up go on smoothly over it. I will continue to use this with the results achieved so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
    <li> I am completely impressed with this product and Petunia Skincare&#x27;s customer service! When i opened the Hyaluronic Acid, the first thing that i noticed was the smell. It has a clove or floral like smell to it and it can be a little strong at first, but not to worry it goes away very quickly. The Hyaluronic Acid comes in an Amber colored glass bottle with a glass dropper. The serum has a gel like appearance and feel to it, which i really like and it&#x27;s not too thick or sticky either. You only need a very small amount, like the size of a pea, so it will last for a while. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and It soaks into your face very fast as well, i was pretty happy with that! I use it every night before bed after washing may face, then i use a toner and i follow with the Hyaluronic Acid and then a moisturizer. I have to say that my skin is so much better than two weeks ago when i started using this product. I currently have a little bit of Acne prone skin, so to see any kind of improvement in my skin is a miracle to me! My skin has already become more moisturized, brighter, and my skin tone is starting to even out. Even the fine lines under my eyes are begining to fade and my dark circles have gotten a little bit better as well. My skin is also rather sensive to new products, but since Petunia Skincare created this product as a vegan and cruelty free product, the all natural ingredients haven&#x27;t irritated my skin at all and no new acne flare ups since i started using it either. All of this improvement in just the two short weeks that i have been using this product. I really can&#x27;t wait to see what happens the longer i use it! I will absolutely buy another bottle when this one runs out!&lt;br /&gt; Great Job Petunia Skincare!</li>
    <li> It comes in nice size copper bottle. It&#x27;s easy to squeeze and get what you need out. Filling the vial all the way would be too much. I have a fat face and it was still too much for me. It smells like orange peels and feels really silky. I applied the serum after using the derma roller and I must say that the tingly feeling I felt after was refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 Stars  &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, but my opinion is my own!</li>
    <li> Product is great.  My only concern if that the quantity inside the bottle is too little.  Compared with the C Vitamin bottle, this runs out at speed light .</li>
    <li> Anti aging serums are really important in todays beauty routines. I have been using them for awhile and this one is a really good one.  It is really easy to apply to your face and a lot goes a long way. It absorbs nicely into your skin not leaving you with a greasy or oily residue on your skin. It leaves your skin soft and cleans up out breaks. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free product sample for review. I really like a lot of things about this moisturizing serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C. My skin loves a daily dose of Vitamin C serum, and the Petunia Skincare formula is one of the best I have tried. I like that it is not a sticky formula and absorbs very quickly. It has a unique, fresh scent that is hard to describe (plant-y?), but I like it. The serum is a little bit thicker than other Vitamin C serums I have used in the past, which makes it easier to apply. My skin looks brighter with a more even skin tone when I use this product. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a lot of different skincare products lately. Why? Because at just a year away from forty, my skin is really showing signs of aging! With three kids I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and there&#x27;s not a whole lot I can do about that at this stage in my life, even though I know it affects my appearance. That&#x27;s all the more reason for me to really take good care of my skin in the ways that I can control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard a lot about Hyaluornic Acid Serum and the wonderful effects it has on wrinkles. While the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; going on my face is a little unnerving, I know that there obviously wouldn&#x27;t be a product like this if it was at all dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used traditional serums that are kind of thick in texture so that&#x27;s what I expect anything with the word serum in the description to be like. However, with Hyaluronic Acid makes it a much thinner, watery substance. That makes me have doubts about it&#x27;s effectiveness because I expect something that moisturizes to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once I read up on it I realized I just wasn&#x27;t understanding what this was designed to do. Instead of providing the actual moisture, it helps your skin to maintain it&#x27;s moisture from moisturizer and water that your body takes in or a &amp;#34;water-reservoir&amp;#34; of sorts. You still do your regular skincare routine. This isn&#x27;t designed to replace your moisturizer but to assist it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regular skincare regimen is to wash my face and pat it dry before anything else. Next I spray on a toner I just started using. Next is where the Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes with a dropper to apply it. I just put it on my finger tips and rubbed all over my face and neck. I waited until it was dry as directed and then used my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a new softness to my skin and since this is the only thing I changed up, I think it&#x27;s safe to attribute it to the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It&#x27;s nothing drastic but enough for me to notice the difference and think it&#x27;s worth it to continue using. I&#x27;m curious to see the long term effects which remain to be seen!h for me to notice the difference and think it&#x27;s worth it to continue using. I&#x27;m curious to see the long term effects which remain to be seen!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use hyaluronic acid for some reason, no matter the brand. So, I let my mom use this, she loves the way it absorbs, and leaves her skin feeling soft and refreshed. The color of her skin has improved as well. Sample received for review,</li>
    <li> This Hyaluronic serum is a clear gel/liquid that has a slight odor that I am not particularly crazy about smelling.  It is not a horrible smell, I just don&#x27;t like the smell.  This absorbs into the skin quickly and unlike another brand I have tried, didn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.  This does seem to make my skin feel tighter and softer.  It has a cool refreshing feel when I apply it.  So far it seems to be doing what it is supposed to do.  I will update my review once I have some long term use with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Always arrives on time.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, I apply this on my face &amp; neck day and night. Paired with Vitamin C first then hyaluronic my skin looks and feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> It really makes skin look more youthful and smooth.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it a lot. Thank you sooo much</li>
    <li> I just got mine. It is really thick and sticky like honey.  But after few rubbing and patting, my skin absorbs it good enough. I will update my review a week later to let you know the result. I have dry skin and also redness on my cheek. Redness is due to heat or dehydration. Lets see if it is gonna hit the spot and vanish my redness.</li>
    <li> not sure if the product is effective or not was frozen solid when it arrived; this seemed to mess with the consistency etc  really feel a replacement is in order!</li>
    <li> great stuff....and a very thick serum.  Jar is dark to stop light i guess, but I can&#x27;t see how much I have left.  I want to purchase some more, too.&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;d be very happy wth this product..as I am.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Smells awful.</li>
    <li> This serum did work but I was turned off by the fragrance of it.</li>
    <li> I received this for a review.  It was a unique product as you rolled the serum on with a pokey type roller to help it get into the skin more.  I enjoyed using it and thought the stimulation to my skin made a difference.  It also forced me to slow down and take some time for me.  It was a bit pokey/owie at first but didn&#x27;t make me stop using it.  My skin seemed to swell a bit which worked at giving a more youthful appearance.  It didn&#x27;t take a lot of time to do either.  I think all in all it&#x27;s a good idea and something busy moms need to slow down and take some time for their self.</li>
    <li> Works okay. I cant say that I have seen amazing results but its not bad.</li>
    <li> I have bought many lotions and potions from vitamin c serum to chemical peels with a wide price range and decent results. I am 41 with sun damage from working as a lifeguard in high school and 20 years of indoor tanning. I used this after derma roller and I saw a small difference already. My star rating is because of the price point. The formula is thick and one ounce. It may last a couple weeks if used as recommended. For the $600 a year I would have to spend on this to use every day may as well go to the doctor and spend a little more to get a filler instead like botox or restalin.  Update:After few weeks I see no real difference. Was hoping to see something with my sun spots but no luck. Will continue until its gone to see if its time based but I am not hopeful.</li>
    <li> I like to use this after my toner and before my moisturizer. Honestly Im not noticing a huge difference but skin definitely looks great. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Petunia Skincare has a great idea...They have combined to of my favorite facial products together.  Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C.  I was using both of these products separately, making my daily and nightly routines a little longer.  After I wash my face, I use a vitamin c serum and wait for it to soak in and then I use a hyaluronic acid serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this nice little combo instead decreases the time it takes me to get ready in the morning.  Which defiantly helps since I am forever running late!  The serum goes on easy and absorbs pretty fast.  I use the product on my face and neck but even doing so, you don&#x27;t need to use too much!  After it absorbs fully I put additional moisturizer on which contains an SPF.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple weeks now and have defiantly noticed improvements as far as brightness my skin feels softer.  I rec&#x27;d this product to incorporate in my day to day life for my 100% honest opinion as to how it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Loved,loved,loved  this product used it every time I would use my derma roller ! This is  MUST GET!&lt;br /&gt;Check out my video review on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2wp0oWWxpy4</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle. Feels so good on my face and neck. I actually look forward to putting this on my face&lt;br /&gt;thanks again</li>
    <li> Terrible. Would never purchase again. Oily yet pulled any moisture out of my skin that I had.</li>
    <li> This skin serum contains neroli distillate, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and ferulic acid to protect and moisturize the skin and give it a healthy appearance.  It is moderately viscous, white, and has a delicious scent of citrus and spice.  It absorbs quickly and has an immediate firming effect.  Use over time will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a little goes a long way, it can be used not only on the face and neck, but on any area with problem skin, such as elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged in an amber glass jar with a pump cap that dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia Skincare provided Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Moisturizing Serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference. I have used it everyday for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> great stuff, really helpful</li>
    <li> I expected a bit more from this product after reading the reviews.  I really don&#x27;t like th he smell and the product is sticky until absorbed. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Reasonable on price too!</li>
    <li> Before using this serum my face would look all dry but since i had been using hyaluronic acid serum my skin has a smooth radiant appearance</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and remain on the fence.  I have researched hyaluronic acid, which despite having \\&quot;acid\\&quot; in the name is thought to improve skin structure and is not an exfoliate.  It seems to have some benefits but I found that when I exercised outdoors it seemed to make my skin dry and gritty.  I swapped to using it last thing at night and that seemed to resolve the problem.  I think it will take longer term use to be convinced that I am seeing a benefit.  It has a rather mild smell but I have to say not one I am find of, so I am wondering what lotion I light be able to mix it with so I am not smelling it when I am going to sleep. This review was based on a complimentary sample.</li>
    <li> I discovered hyaluronic acid serum several months ago and to be honest, have not found one yet I don&#x27;t like.  Each has unique blends of ingredients and various kinds of applicators.  This one, with vitamin C and ferulic acid, matches the qualities of the best I&#x27;ve found. It has a very good, albeit not my favorite kind of applicator (I like the eye dropper kind), and uniquely offers a wealth of information on the package about the ingredients.  The serum itself is excellent.  It softens and smooths my skin, minimizes wrinkles, and offers protection from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a gel - not too thick - that dissolves easily on skin.  There is a slight non-offensive odor to it, and is delivered by a small pump.  It is not at all messy and I found the rate of absorption into my skin to be the fastest of all the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried.  That means I save time when getting ready by not having to wait for several minutes for the serum to be absorbed to put on my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box that contains the serum has directions for use (also on the bottle) and interesting information about the ingredients.  I was unfamiliar with ferulic acid and read that it is an anti-oxidant that protects against UVA/UVB rays, stabilizes the vitamin C, and once absorbed, remains effective for a minimum of 72 hours.  The serum is alcohol and paraben free as well as oil free and is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a solid 5 stars out of 5 for me - a great product that saves me time and packaged with a wealth of information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided]</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t give a full review on whether I feel it does all the lovely things it is supposed to do.  I am 31 years old and thus starting to be concerned about preventing wrinkles.  I like the bottle and the pump on this product.  I can control how much comes out.  It is clear and not sticky.  It definitely improves the tone and texture of my skin.  I don&#x27;t like the labels on these products as they get sticky feeling when wet, but I&#x27;ve been told my the makers that they are working on it.  It seems silly but it is one of those feelings that is like &amp;#34;nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s great and the packaging is pretty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days. I have kept it in refrigerator to keep fresh. I must say I like the new pump style and the color of serum is new and improved.</li>
    <li> This serum has made such a difference in my skin.  I use it under my regular moisturizer, and even in this dry winter weather my skin is in better condition than ever.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moDVGQB7MMKEJW]]</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 2 month and really work I love it !!!! I can see notably that my expression lines are  disappears. .</li>
    <li> i find it wonderful on the skin, and smells nice!</li>
    <li> I received this for free as a promotional offer, along with the eye serum. I really love both products. The hyaluronic serum absorbs really well and feels light on my skin. It also has a pleasant scent. I was going to wait longer to review it, but yesterday my husband remarked that the new stuff I got for my face was really improving my skin. I asked him to elaborate and he said my skin looked fresher and brighter and that I looked more rested. I really like both of these products and will most likely reorder.</li>
    <li> tell me what is this??!! It is inside! Seems dirty!! I will not use it! So disgusting!!!</li>
    <li> This serum is very thick and almost gel-like in consistency. It did not feel sticky and was easy to apply, absorbing quickly into my skin. I generally like hyaluronic acid serums and this is no different. My skin looks brighter and has a better tone when using this serum daily. Sample provided for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> good product, not too greasy has a nice odor.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review a little early as I have only been using this product about 5 days.  I personally, have not noticed a difference, but today when I went to the grocery store, the cashier asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing to my skin because my complexion looks great!  At this point, I am giving the product five stars. I will continue to monitor my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been using this product for approximately 11 days now. I am 53 years old and have always considered my skin to be in great condition for my age.  However, my skin is now glowing. I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> When I started out, my main concern was that I wanted to help reverse the signs of aging.  I look older than my years from the stress of enduring chronic back pain on a daily basis.  I wanted to complete a full bottle before posting my review but this product lasts so long, I don&#x27;t know when that will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had enough positive results from it so far that I felt like I could go ahead and post my review.  While my face isn&#x27;t as firm as I know it can be, it is firmer than it was and any little bit is an improvement.  I used to have saggy baggy undereyes but even the puffiness is almost completely gone.  I&#x27;ve been using this as well as the Petunia Skincare Revitalize Eye Serum With Sea Kelp and either or, or both, are giving me the results I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some wrinkles that I&#x27;m hoping to be rid of one day but my skin is looking so much more youthful and if anything, I&#x27;m starting to look my age instead of 10  years older.  I&#x27;ll take that!</li>
    <li> loved this stuff. It really felt great on my skin and wasnt greasy or oily. I wore it under makeup and at night and my skin texture has improved. i have acne scar and it definitely helped a little. i think with continued use it will be even better.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Returned the serum might have made a mistake doing that</li>
    <li> nice light fragrance, makes my skin feel so soft</li>
    <li> I used this directly after i did my chemical peel and wow the day after my skin is still amazing soft glowing looks so fresh and young great product for a great price, i don&#x27;t think i have seen an equal that will ever match this, best part of it is after a chemical peel anything you use on your face soaks in completely 5 times faster so it is no surprise how great this product works! Now i am not saying it doesnt work without a peel but i&#x27;m the kind of person to go all the way, and with a orange juice allergy i am looking for products for people like me that wont cause a huge issue and leave us in the hospital or with a rash, this is another of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> i have been very pleased with theHyaluroic Acid Serum and the Vitamin C Serum that I have been using for this past week.  I cannot say to having noticed any difference in my skin but know that continuing to use this will be beneficial for my skin.  My face definitely feels soft and healthy. I also am very impressed with the folks at Petunia Skincae for their speedy delivery and the very professional followup - above the norm.!!!  Thank you...........</li>
    <li> I just received the Best Anti Aging Hyaluronic serum and I have no idea if it works, the bottom of the bottle was busted out and leaked all out.</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  I noticed a difference within 2 weeks. I have combination skin, normal to dry that really likes to have this product put on.  I went a few days without and really noticed the dryness returning.  I also feel, when in a daily regime my skin feels more taunt, almost like a mini-lift.  I would recommend this product.  I would also like to point out the superior customer service at Petunia Skin.  ​</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Smells bad, but only for a short time.  Once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin.  Really seeing a difference!!!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like this quite a bit.  Could be thicker, but I do like the way it makes your skin feel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old with generally good skin to begin with.  Very few lines and just one small light discoloration spot (maybe half the size of a dime).  I wanted to try this to minimize the small fine lines on my forehead and lighten the small spot before they got any worse or more noticeable.  I  have been using this 2x per day for 4 weeks.  No changes in my skin. The lines and small light discoloration on my face still there.  If this can&#x27;t change my skin (which really isn&#x27;t all that bad to begin with), I can&#x27;t imagine that this would do anything at all for someone in greater need.</li>
    <li> Of the multiple serums I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best. No Hyaluronic Acid Serum can be 100%, so be careful when ordering those that claim to be. I&#x27;m 30 years old, and I use Retinol and an AHA/BHA cream for old acne scaring and wrinkle prevention. However, these have ALWAYS dried my skin out to the point of peeling, no matter how little I use or how much moisturizer I apply after. Using this beforehand has eliminated that problem. It&#x27;s thicker than others I used, so I was a bit concerned at first. But it absorbs quickly and there&#x27;s no residue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, when I wash my face, I can still feel the aloe-like moisture in my skin. And you don&#x27;t need much, as a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sensitive to breakouts, and have not had one since using this product. I use a toner first, then apply this serum. After it dries, I apply my creams and then either my daytime or nighttime lotions. This regimen has worked perfectly for me and after only a few weeks my skin even had a glow to it! No more dryness!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this anyone who needs a good absorbent moisturizer while pursuing wrinkle prevention, especially if you&#x27;re using medicinal creams that dry you out! (Oh, and make sure you close it well or it can get a build-up around the rim!)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but maybe every other day or so. I have been dabbing some on areas of my face and then blending it. I really feel a firmness in my skin after using this. It is like getting a mini facial/face lift each time using it. I really like how this blends in and haven&#x27;t had any side effects at all from using. I would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I received product free to review but this is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> ****Disclaimer**** I received these products for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;Next I want to take briefly about the facial serum,i didn’t like the scent of it,it to me smelled very herbal and strong.But I did like the reduction in wrinkles and the nice way my complexion looks now.The serum is very thick,but its not greasy or anything and it absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> The Petunia Skincare Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C Moisturizing Serum gives you skin a cool feel that helps your skin feels soothed after using the Derma Roller.  Hyaluronic Acid works by helping the skin retains natural moisture from liquids you drink &amp; work as a &amp;#34;water-reservoir&amp;#34; for skin cells by binding water within the intercellular structure of the skin. The formulation in Petunia Skincare Serum stimulates the skin&#x27;s own production of hyaluronic acid, resulting in soft moist &amp; wrinkle-free supple skin.  I received them for free for review/ testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it! This is a weird serum. I put it on my hand first to test it, and it was weird. It made my skin tight which is completely expected for anti- aging serums. The only thing that was odd was the smell of the serum. I like it, though.</li>
    <li> The petunia skincare Hyaluronic acid serum is wonderful. It goes on smooth and not sticky and it is amazing for fading away sun spots and age spots, it also moisturizes your skin and helps to protect it from the free radicals that damage our skin everyday. I love this product.</li>
    <li> PETUNIA SKINCARE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM is a natural and organic formula with high quality ingredients for a nourturing , healthy, and youthful face. I have been using this serum for nearly 3 weeks and I am seeing postive results. My face had somewhat of a droopy look not much, but I could tell. Anyway this serum did not dry or make my skin itchy. as other serum in the past. What I noticed was an incredibly fuller face, smoother complexion and even the dark spots ln my face has disappeared with the one on my left cheek is very light and with continual use of this product I know for sure it won&#x27;t be long before it all disappears once and for all. The hyaluronic acid is responsible to retaining the skin water and moisture by trapping it more like a sealant so to spea, and as a result your skin will be more plump and have much elasticity creating a youthful and glamoroys appearance!     The vitamin c helps to prevent skin aging  by accelerating the renewal of cells. The ferulic acid protects your skin by neutraluzing the free radicals  from the UVA/UVB rays which would cause your skin to otherwise increase the aging process.    I highly recommend this product for women in their late thirties for many years of youthful skin!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C product has Hyaluronic Acid and a short ingredient list, which is always welcoming. Other features from this like kind products that differs from previous ones reviewed, is that this one comes with a nice pump top versus a dropper. This allows the serum to get zero light when in use and/or air to help the oxidation process along; causing the active ingredient to become inert. So far Petunia Skincare has thought ahead of other manufactures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia Skincare carries a line of beauty serums to Derma rollers. A small collection, however Petunia Skincare remains focused in providing serums that aid with anti-aging and provide a powerful punch of moisture that our skin needs as we age! That&#x27;s a punch I&#x27;ll take!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the ingredients differ from others I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neroli Water- A blossom originating from the Bitter Orange tree, which is usually used to create an oil. Due to the fragile like nature of the blossom, the oil is produced using a method called water distillation. This floral water is not only pleasant when it comes to scent but is also very refreshing to the skin. Usually used for it&#x27;s soothing and hydrating qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferulic Acid- A plant-based antioxidant, which helps neutralizes free radicals, may inhibit UV-induced skin discolorations, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Combining Ferulic Acid with L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), helps amplify the protecting effects these two ingredients have. Think of it as making it more powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Petunia Skincare&#x27;s Moisturizing Serum for a period of two weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One- Instant hydration and my one fine line (between my eye brows) continues to diminish and soften in appearance. I get a nice but even &amp;#34;plump look&amp;#34; that appears to last day after day. The effects are long lasting, as long as I continue use and my skin continues to repair by reflecting a more even tone (both in color and texture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Two- The aforementioned results continue and I find myself looking into BB and CC creams when it comes to future foundation purchases. I am that happy with my skin&#x27;s appearance and you can&#x27;t beat the glow you get from Vitamin C based serums of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Petunia Skincare. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.o- The aforementioned results continue and I find myself looking into BB and CC creams when it comes to future foundation purchases.

    <li> I Then Gently Applied Petunia&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum And All You Need Is Just A Few Drops On Your Finger Tips, Then Rub All Around Your Face Till It Absorb Into Your Skin. When I applied This Product, It Felt Very Cooling And Gave My Skin Freshness. It&#x27;s Not Sticky At All, And Dries Amazingly Fast, It Also Instantly Tightens Your Skin!&lt;br /&gt;This Serum Is Made With The Highest Quality Vegan-Free And Cruelly-Free Hyaluronic Acid, It Give You That Elastic, And Youthful Boost In Your Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I Also Liked The Glass Drip Nozzle It Makes It Easier To Dispense And Apply.</li>
    <li> Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  It began when I was in middle school, my sister four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m afraid to stop playing with all of these skincare products (haha), that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product AND there is a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  It sits on the counter in the bathroom and is used daily by my mother and myself.  It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  I do wish that there was a different &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a dropper, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  When I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, I get the under eye issues that plague a lot of us and those were not only gone within two days of using this stuff, but continued use has caused them to not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.

    <li> I&#x27;m pleasently surprised at how much I like this specific serum. I&#x27;ve tryed countless different moisturizers, and serums; and found a flaw with just about every last one, Come to find out I was missing a key beauty product in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hyaluronic acid serum by, Petunia Skincare is truly amazing, and gives amazing results. This product can rewind the clocks of time; when used as directed, I suggest purchasing this along side of there eye serum, ive seen first hand the benifits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula hydrates my dry skin while leaving a radiant glow; without the greasy feeling some other serums may have. This product is alcohol free, oil free, and paraben free. (WOW)... My skin has a smoother younger feel and look, I would be thrilled with just thoes results, but as I&#x27;ve said Petunia Skincare as out-done themselves (AGAIN) this also helps diminish the signs of age by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet, and one of my favorite features I&#x27;ve seen first hand; acne! After this product will never clog pores I&#x27;ve see less acne and a reduction in my acne scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views.</li>
    <li> I applied their Hyaluronic Acid serum, and was amazed at how quickly it was absorbed into my skin. Petunia&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum is cruelty free and only uses vegan and natural active ingredients, plus it&#x27;s made in the USA. I really like that this is a thicker consistency, as it allows me to have more control over where I spread it and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin. There was no real scent, maybe a slight one, but it was on the fresher side, and there was no leftover gunky feeling left, even when I applied my tinted moisturizer afterward. The Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid combination makes for a gentler combination on my skin and are full of great antioxidants and help protect from free radicals and UVA/UVB rays, so I know I&#x27;m protected even on days I forget to wear sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always touted the benefits of HA serums and I have tried many different brands. The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that Petunia Skincare tells exactly what hyaluronic acid is and exactly how it works right on the box. I love that because there isn&#x27;t any guesswork or searching to find out what it is, what it does, or how it works.    The back of the box reads:  \\&quot;Discover younger skin with out Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The secret is its sponge-like properties, which holds in moisture responsible for plumping skin and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.\\&quot;    The side of the box reads:  \\&quot;Hyaluronic acid works by helping the skin retain and pull in moisture from the liquids we drink to the products we put on our skin and works as a \\&quot;water-reservoir\\&quot; for skin cells by binding water within the inter-cellular structure of the skin.\\&quot;    This HA serum has your typical brown bottle with dropper. I really like the pretty blue and white label. I also really like that it has a sealed ring on the lid so you know when the seal has been broken. It&#x27;s helpful if you have a lot of products and don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve tried something yet. I haven&#x27;t seen this feature on any other HA serum.    The other thing that makes this serum pretty unique are the ingredients. On top of the 1.6% hyaluronic acid, it also contains 1.1% MAP (Vitamin C), and 0.5% ferulic acid. In case you&#x27;re unfamiliar with ferulic acid, its used to treat sun damage, fine lines, and wrinkles.  Petunia Skincare&#x27;s HA serum is also non-greasy, non-sticky, alcohol free, oil free, paraben free, and promises to not clog pores. It does have a slight scent that I&#x27;m not fond of, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overpowering.    I think this HA serum is the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used because it absorbs faster than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on easy and smoothly and it completely absorbs within seconds. My skin feels fresher and softer after using it. I tend to use this HA serum during the day because it is quick and easy to reapply throughout the day if my skin is feeling dry.      This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> Great product and not too expensive. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in a week. My skin is smoother. Thanks.</li>
    <li> love it ! i use the vitamine c product from petunia and this is a great addition. along with the moistuizer it makes my skin so soft. i have already noticed some age spots lightening and my complextion looks smoother.</li>
    <li> As with Petunia&#x27;s eye serum, I got this as a promotional offer to test the product. I&#x27;ve used this nightly under my regular moisturizer for about 2 weeks and it has made a difference in my overall skin tone and texture. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t speak about it&#x27;s efficacy for that, but it has helped make my skin move even toned. I have a few dark spots from previous acne outbreaks and I haven&#x27;t seen a change in the appearance of them after using this product, but I may have to use this longer to see a difference. I&#x27;ve used other serums before and some of them made my skin feel sticky or dry, but this product actually moisturizers my skin and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. Overall, this product has been useful and I&#x27;ll be continuously using it to see more results!</li>
    <li> This product smells a bit strange when you apply it - especially since it is right under your nose at that point.  My skin tingled a bit as I applied and and after for a few minutes - I used this with a Derma Roller and so the acid was sent deeper into my skin and maybe that is why my skin stung a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite red after the treatment with the Derma Roller and the acid, but this morning I look normal and my skin looks quite smooth in places it hasn&#x27;t been lately.  I used the acid again and it did not sting at all this time - without the Derma Roller this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  covered the acid with a moisturizer and then used the Petunia Eye Gel.  My skin does look younger a healthier today.  So this is worth the try - go get some today!!!  Watch the YouTube video below and see what this stuff is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this after I wash my face for over two weeks now and I think I do see a difference in the texture of my skin - it looks better and healthier currently.</li>
    <li> So I’m going to be honest here. When I received this package for review from Petunia Skincare I was stoked about the serums, but when I saw the derma-roller I was like, “What sorta medieval torture device is this?!”The serums worked great! As always I spot tested to see if my sensitive skin would react badly and it didn’t *phew!* So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days. My wrinkles were honest-to-God not affected. They are still there smiling at me &#x3D;) Now this derma-roller I did not attempt to use. I was far too intimidated by the needles. That said, I would go to a licensed esthetician or acupunturist and let them do it! The box has warnings about cleaning the needles thoroughly to avoid infection. Yeah, I was like, “All right… hell no I’m not using this thing.” But I was curious…here is a podcast by thebeautybrains.org discussing whether dermal rolling actually works. The question and answer begins at the 6:20 mark. The cons of derma-rolling at home start at 15:48 . The professional actually says,”If you’re not bleeding, it’s not working.” (18:18) I will let the professionals take it away and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
    <li> My daughter suggested I start using this product.  It&#x27;s awesome and I really feel it has made a if improvement to my face skin ...</li>
    <li> I along with my wife have been using Petunia skin care for several months.I as the husband, had all but decided to stop using, until yesterday when looking at photos ta taken a few months before we began treatment with Petuna Skincare.WOW ! what a difference in appearance ! I was totaly shocked and pleased. My face looked many years younger. I am about to order more from Amazon, TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing this very active medication !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice from day to day in the mirror , but the photos don&amp;#34;t  Lie !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
    <li> Have been using for little over a month. Noticed that a dark age spot is much lighter. Skin is more hydrated. Love the product. Will continue to use. Also use eye serum.</li>
    <li> This is pretty great stuff, my second purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It really works!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s like a 3-in-1 serum. It&#x27;s making my skin soft with less wrinkles plus it&#x27;s hydrating my skin because it has moisturizing properties and because it also has Vitamin C, my skin is more radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this serum is packaged. It has a nozzle rather than an eye drop applicator and the consistency of the serum is thicker compared to others. It&#x27;s more clear than other serums I have tried too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that slightly bothers me is the \\&quot;faint floral\\&quot; scent which I can&#x27;t make out if it&#x27;s floral or rubbing alcohol scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering but I just prefer my serum to be unscented. However, the scent does not affect the effectivity of this serum. I&#x27;d still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I learned a lot from this review. Me and Instagram are not good friends. I take good pics and they come up blurry on that site. The product is great, but my wife got tired of me trying to take pictures of her. This product scared my wife a little bit. What women is not scared when they told to put acid on their body? It isn&#x27;t really acid, but it sounds dangerous. My wife uses it on her neck and face. It tightens and softens her skin at the same time. It also leaves a soft scent. I like the scent because it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze like most perfumes you smell in your local mall. I&#x27;m not saying the stuff is a miracle worker because it is not. It puts those important nutrient back into your skin and helps your woman look pretty.</li>
    <li> I used this serum after using the derma roller from this same company. They are a great pair, and I like that this serum isnt greasy, absorbs quickly (even more so after using the roller), and has visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this roller free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own, and are not influenced by outside sources.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and have added hydronic acid serums in the last year as a drink for my aging skin. Always looking for one that is a good value. This is very nice and I love the hint of neroli. A good find!</li>
    <li> excellent serum that lightens and evens the skin. I use a facial scrub, then apply the serum at night. I have learned that it takes just a few drops to cover the face and ears. too much at it will be a waste including it will not help when one applies a facial sunscreen moisturizer over it. less with this product actually is better. One can also use it on the lips, followed by a lip balm. two drops on the back and two drops on the front of the forearm would do. then apply a sunscreen moisturizer. two drops on each hand would do. Again apply a sunscreen moisturizer. It will take about 3 to 4 weeks to show a noticeable lightening of the skin. If possible leave it on as long as possible the next day before washing it off for best effects.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it</li>
    <li> I love this one, worth paying for. Flakey and dry skin disappeared.  Definitely will order again. Finally found the one I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
