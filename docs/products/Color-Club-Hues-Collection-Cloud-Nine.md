      <li>Magic?  </li>
      <li>Best of all it came in the next 3 days</li>
      <li>Going to have to order more colors</li>
      <li>In natural sunlight I have never seen anything so beautiful.</li>
      <li>Just received this today and was so excited just looking at the color in the bottle; it&#x27;s so shimmery and prismatic!</li>
      <li>Do not look at your fresh manicure while driving!!</li>
      <li>I am an avid fan of Color Club nail polishes, and this lovely holographic takes the cake!</li>
      <li>I found the formula to be easy to work with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They always seem to be so strong even in indirect sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure you put a clear top coat on though because it would chip easily!</li>
      <li>The fact that the shipping was free was a great enticement to buy several!</li>
      <li>Overall, really happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Was opaque in two coats and application was streak free.  </li>
      <li>and i love it and think that it is definitely worth every penny</li>
      <li>The outcome is fabulous-</li>
      <li>This is single handedly the most amazing nail polish I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
      <li>I love the polish so much I bought another!</li>
      <li>I love this polish so much!</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best holographic nail polish I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, applying top coat to these type of lacquers dulls their effect.</li>
      <li>It goes on well, two to three coats are needed to reach full opacity.</li>
      <li>and this lovely color works by itself or as a top coat on top of other polishes.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and intact.</li>
      <li>This polish is very pretty</li>
      <li>The color you see in the bottle is exactly the color you get on your nails!</li>
      <li>just how pretty it is!</li>
      <li>, smooth application and opaque in the normal two coats!</li>
      <li>This is definitely the most mesmerizing nail color I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
      <li>Very opaque with just one coat and the halo graphic effect is outstanding!</li>
      <li>After studying the different swatches online, I decided to get this particular color, and I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>it very much is.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I bought the silver looking nail polish</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more lilac than a deep purple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an awesome color, it&#x27;s like several different shades in one whenever the sun/light hits them.</li>
      <li>Very neat nail polish!</li>
      <li>The color is pretty interesting, but you need several coats to have the effect.  </li>
      <li>and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This is what I would most definitely call a silver polish in low light condition however.</li>
      <li>it is a little spendy but the polish itself is amazing</li>
      <li>I have considered purchasing a second and third one since I love it so much!!</li>
      <li>In regular indoor light, it&#x27;s still quite shimmery and reflective.</li>
      <li>I really like the color</li>
      <li>This polish is REALLY holographic.</li>
      <li>and it wears really well without both.</li>
      <li>Bought one and was hooked on purchasing the whole Halo Hues</li>
      <li>I am going to spend so much time staring at my nails now.</li>
      <li>This nail polish really turns heads.</li>
      <li>I have Layla holo, and that one is a love-hate relationship because of very tricky application.</li>
      <li>Talk about fast.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other holographic polishes that get cakey and lift and streak inbetween coats, this color club polish goes on smooth with pretty much no streaking.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>It also goes on really nicely and stays on for at least 4/5 days.</li>
      <li>It goes nice and thick.</li>
      <li>First let me say that I placed my order on the 20th</li>
      <li>However, when it hits the sunlight, WOW!</li>
      <li>The color is so epic, it&#x27;s a huge disappointment that my nails only looked good overnight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This nail polish really turns heads. It&#x27;s the best holo that I have used, and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a pinkish holo :)</li>
    <li> First let me say that I placed my order on the 20th and it was delivered on the 24th...WOW!! Talk about fast. I ordered both the Cloud Nine shade and Halo and they both arrived together at the same time. Both are amazing...they are definitely holographic. I have considered purchasing a second and third one since I love it so much!! Definitely a MUST-GET item!!</li>
    <li> I love the color and the shine. In natural sunlight I have never seen anything so beautiful. This is what I would most definitely call a silver polish in low light condition however.</li>
    <li> This polish is so beautiful and a must see in the sunshine. I have fallen in love with color club holo polishes. I was looking for a lavender holo and I knew this would be perfect and it very much is. I prefer to wear my holo polishes in the spring and summer seasons when I am guaranteed sunshine to make the holo look its best. I found the formula to be easy to work with. I don&#x27;t apply base coat or top coat and it wears really well without both. I also own Miss Bliss and Eternal Beauty. I can&#x27;t wait to try more colors!</li>
    <li> I love this polish so much! Best of all it came in the next 3 days I didnt expect that. It came in perfect condition I love it!</li>
    <li> it is a little spendy but the polish itself is amazing and i love it and think that it is definitely worth every penny</li>
    <li> The price is perfect! The color is perfect! I love the polish so much I bought another! I will probably buy more!!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this collection of polishes while watching a nail polish collection video online. After studying the different swatches online, I decided to get this particular color, and I LOVE IT!  Was perfect to wear for Easter - a nice pastel rainbow-y look! I am still amazed every time I look at it just how pretty it is! Will probably be getting more colors!!</li>
    <li> Love this polish. I have Layla holo, and that one is a love-hate relationship because of very tricky application. Color Club is awesome! No streaking without any aqua base or buffing. Even one layer looks decent, two layers are perfect. The colour is very light lavender when not in &amp;#34;full bloom&amp;#34;. Holographic effect is very strong and beautiful. Highly recommend. Will buy other colours, too.</li>
    <li> I thought the color was more purple towards silver. It is a little too rosey for my taste. The holo is awesome, I ended up ordering Harp On It also from Color Club and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> In the sun this looks amazing!! In other lighting it looks like a shimmer polish, it dries quickly and you could get away with one coat.</li>
    <li> The color is pretty interesting, but you need several coats to have the effect.  The color wears off quickly; not chipping, but just thins out-hard to explain (similar to fading).  This can be annoying if you were hoping that a lighter color would have a more lasting look-I ended up using it for a day or 2, then adding another coat the following day (3rd or 4th coat).</li>
    <li> Very neat nail polish! Especially outside and in the sun it sparkles like crazy. Loved it. Make sure you put a clear top coat on though because it would chip easily!</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing to look at. A sort of lilac-y mauve base with mind-blowing rainbow hologram effect. I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at it. I used a no-chip topcoat and the next day my nails started chipping. The color is so epic, it&#x27;s a huge disappointment that my nails only looked good overnight. If you&#x27;re going to buy it though, this seller shipped it very quickly and well packaged!!</li>
    <li> How does Color Club get all the rainbows in the bottle?  Have they used ground up Unicorn horn?  Magic?  Other assorted Witchery?  I really don&#x27;t care.  This polish is REALLY holographic. It&#x27;s like an acid trip in a bottle.  I LOVE it!  The base color is a silvery lilac.  Was expecting something a little darker but the abundance of rainbow goodness totally made up for that.  Was able to use with a regular base coat and a top coat of Seche Vite without compromising the rainbowy-ness.  Was opaque in two coats and application was streak free.  Mani lasted about three days before it chipped.  Overall, really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The color is BEAUTIFUL. I am going to spend so much time staring at my nails now. It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This polish is very pretty but it&#x27;s purple it looks more silver in the picture. It&#x27;s a good thing I like purple or I&#x27;d be disappointed.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I bought the silver looking nail polish but then I noticed the color was called cloud nine and it was the pink one. I&#x27;m not disappointed though because this is a beautiful color</li>
    <li> Just received this today and was so excited just looking at the color in the bottle; it&#x27;s so shimmery and prismatic! The cloud nine color is a very very pale pink and just looks shimmery in normal light when on the nails. However, when it hits the sunlight, WOW! It&#x27;s like rainbows jumping off my nails! In regular indoor light, it&#x27;s still quite shimmery and reflective. This is definitely the most mesmerizing nail color I&#x27;ve ever seen! I can&#x27;t speak as to the length of the actual manicure but I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t experience bad chipping right away.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! It&#x27;s such an awesome color, it&#x27;s like several different shades in one whenever the sun/light hits them. It also goes on really nicely and stays on for at least 4/5 days.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best holographic nail polish I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, applying top coat to these type of lacquers dulls their effect. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the holographic effect is quite subdued indoors. Nope, not Cloud Nine!&lt;br /&gt;Outdoors, this is totally outta site!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you need this, NOW.</li>
    <li> so i was searching for an amazing holo-polish for a while, and i am so glad i found this one....</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most beautiful holographic nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used! The color you see in the bottle is exactly the color you get on your nails!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this nail polish. It was a little expensive for me, but completely worth it. It goes nice and thick. I looks just like it did in the picture. It arrived quickly and intact. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Best Rainbow Hologram Effect that I have ever seen in person.  Bought one and was hooked on purchasing the whole Halo Hues Collection.&lt;br /&gt;Caution! :  Can cause severe distraction when looking at your nails in the sunlight.  Wearer may fail to pay attention to anything other than the shiny rainbows that are her nails.  Do not look at your fresh manicure while driving!!</li>
    <li> I think Color Club is one of the best brands for holographic nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always seem to be so strong even in indirect sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, smooth application and opaque in the normal two coats! AND top coat doesn&#x27;t dull CC Holos at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is single handedly the most amazing nail polish I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Very opaque with just one coat and the halo graphic effect is outstanding!</li>
    <li> My niece was wearing the Angel Kiss shade of  this Halographic Hues series.  I knew my granddaughter would love it!  I bought three shades for her birthday and she was very pleased!  The colors are beautiful!  I&#x27;d encourage you to try the &#x27;Angel Kiss&#x27; and &#x27;Harp On It&#x27; too.  The fact that the shipping was free was a great enticement to buy several!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  It didn&#x27;t have quite the shimmer or oomph I was looking for.  You could see the hologram effect but just barely.</li>
    <li> I am an avid fan of Color Club nail polishes, and this lovely holographic takes the cake! It goes on well, two to three coats are needed to reach full opacity. Unlike other holographic polishes that get cakey and lift and streak inbetween coats, this color club polish goes on smooth with pretty much no streaking. The outcome is fabulous- and this lovely color works by itself or as a top coat on top of other polishes.</li>
    <li> I really like the color, it&#x27;s more lilac than a deep purple.  The halo is so incredible even after 2 top coats the halo is still WOW.  It doesn&#x27;t even show any wear after 2 days.</li>
    <li> My first holo (didn&#x27;t want to spend $15+ on polish), soooo very in love with the quality for the price! Going to have to order more colors</li>
