      <li>The cooling technology is very pleasant and soothing as well.</li>
      <li>This product is very good</li>
      <li>it was very good.</li>
      <li>This is a very good shaver.  </li>
      <li>and you can get a very good grip on it.  </li>
      <li>However, the shave is very good.  </li>
      <li>Excellent razor, great shaving performance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of plastic, but has an excellent weight to it and feels great in the hand.</li>
      <li>Impress your loved one!</li>
      <li>I have tried everything over the years, from Panasonic to Phillips to manual to Braun (including their Series 7) but struggled to find something that was great.  </li>
      <li>So that wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
      <li>A great razor with a great idea.</li>
      <li>While a great idea in theory, this electric razor neither gives you a close shave, nor stops irritation.</li>
      <li>The shave was great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with the shave, which says a lot considering</li>
      <li>This is a great razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said this, if you are happy with bar-type electric shavers, I would recommend this shaver.  </li>
      <li>It will feel great.</li>
      <li>So that was great.</li>
      <li>As the razor glides across your face, the cooling bar feels really great and prevents irritation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will happily return to using a razor and shaving cream rather than continue to use this shaver.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you don&#x27;t have curly hair it will work great for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it is still a great product.</li>
      <li>It honestly is one of the best razors i&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The cooling effect is a great bonus.</li>
      <li>I even let my hair grow for a couple of days and it worked great their as well.  </li>
      <li>The battery is great.</li>
      <li>bottom line is that the Cooltec works great in the shower without any foam or gel.</li>
      <li>The box design and packaging is great</li>
      <li>Great handling and maneuverability.  </li>
      <li>it is very nice to have the cooling bar.</li>
      <li>The build quality is very nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very nice shaver and does what it says.</li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great build quality, though plastic, it has a great heft, and good feel in the hand.</li>
      <li>imagine an ice cube in a plastic bag touching your skin (if the bar touched the skin with shaving honestly best shaving ever 0%  irritation )</li>
      <li>and I agree with most of the reviewers here that it&#x27;s not the greatest for the neck area.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be a rather pleasant experience.  </li>
      <li>The shaver cut my beard close to the skin but the good thing is it won&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well built razor that shaves good.</li>
      <li>It does a good job cooling it too.  </li>
      <li>It gets a good close shave and with its setup, it works well with side burns and goatee.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>the whole,it is good</li>
      <li>I received this razor in a promotion run by Braun and was fairly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>razor performs well and gives a fairly close shave.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be a really good razor.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as good as a lade</li>
      <li>As soon as you get a good feel for it, it&#x27;s not that noticeable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about as good as shaving with a blade - with the grain.</li>
      <li>It was nice to have a razor that would work great on all parts of my face, and wouldn&#x27;t pull hair as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the shaver really is good, I like it and will be trying to go this route instead of manual.</li>
      <li>Holds a good charge, even when using the cooling bar</li>
      <li>/&gt;The quality of the shave is good.  </li>
      <li>A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
      <li>I found that the Braun series 7-790cc Pulsonic shaver system offered me a noticeably superior shave to any Norelco shaver that I had used previously.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shave has good weight to it and seems well made.</li>
      <li>The best shaver I have found in keeping a close comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>good news is two fold.</li>
      <li>I has a really good \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> high quality shaver, quiet,solid,easy to hold</li>
    <li> Braun : Where to start ?&lt;br /&gt;OK the cooltec is cool imagine an ice cube in a plastic bag touching your skin (if the bar touched the skin with shaving honestly best shaving ever 0%  irritation ) but it&#x27;s not a shaver (seriously Braun!!!)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier for it to peel the neck skin than shave it&lt;br /&gt;Multiple rounds to shave the area (uncountable) and at the end it will leave multiple hairs (like a witch)in the cheek but in the neck don&#x27;t bather it&#x27;s like a Jersy team even after near 1 hour of shaving&lt;br /&gt;Get multiple wounds in the neck how the hill it did it  still don&#x27;t Know ????&lt;br /&gt;took long time to shave.... the device get over heated and almost burn my skin (hot like a lighter milliseconds after turning it off )&lt;br /&gt;Side trimmer has a poor function : longer hair than the shaver + pulled a hair and it was painful&lt;br /&gt;5 mins &#x3D; 1 shave is fiction you need the full battery to finsh just to leave things like what it&#x27;s (unshaven hair)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately sending it back will cost me more than it&#x27;s price ( 126 USD )&lt;br /&gt;____________&lt;br /&gt;Update: few hours later&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service fixed the shipping issue.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for Amazon customer care</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine shaver and more than I expected!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awesome in your face.</li>
    <li> Noise is larger,&lt;br /&gt;On the whole,it is good</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. The cooling mechanism does make the shaving experience more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Great razor, comfortable shave, cooling is a big plus</li>
    <li> Great smooth shaver and the battery stays charged for over a week.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: A novel twist on a shaver: a cooling bar that does feel cool against your face. But, while this has the customary excellent Braun build quality and ergonomics, it falls short when it comes to closeness and can even be a bit harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review: I&#x27;m a big Braun fan - have their 3, 5 and 7 series. I also have razors from pretty much every manufacturer, but a Braun Series 7 is my all-time favorite. This Braun brings a couple of interesting features to bear, but doesn&#x27;t come close (pun sort of intended) to unseating the Series 7 or, for that matter, any other Braun I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like shavers, so this is a long review. Sorry - you can jump to the end if you just want the conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality&lt;br /&gt;Excellent. This is made in Germany, and it feels solid and substantial. The shape is comfortable to hold securely with wet or dry hands due to the inclusion of non-slip pads on key grip points. It&#x27;s plastic, as expected, but avoids the cheap feel that you can get with some razors (including the Braun Series 3). Hold this in hand, and the first word that comes to mind is \\&quot;solid.\\&quot; The only place where the build quality is less than perfect is the bottom end, with noticeable seams in the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a stand that is nicely made. I like that it makes a soft audible beep when the razor is properly positioned for charging. Note that the stand MUST be used for charging - the plug goes into only the stand, and can&#x27;t be directly connected to the razor. Something to keep in mind if you plan on using this on an extended trip - you have to take the stand along if you want to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;Excellent. Easy to grip and there&#x27;s a thumb pad that it perfectly positioned. My only quibble is that the bottom of the razor is angled a bit too much. I would have preferred a more rounded, softer design approach. But, that&#x27;s just a matter of taste rather than function. The ergonmics of the stand are also excellent since you don&#x27;t have to position it just so -- just plop it in, and it seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor sound&lt;br /&gt;Not great - more on the tinny side than I expected. Granted this is again an aesthetic issue, but I found the sound of the motor to be more annoying than other Brauns, and not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: face&lt;br /&gt;Decent, but not spectacular. It takes multiple passes to get it as close to what I can get with a Series 7 in just a pass or two. It gets there, but it does take longer. It also pulls at the hairs far more than any other Braun I&#x27;ve used. Not \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; bad, but the pulling can be felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: jawline&lt;br /&gt;Again, decent. I did get some minor irritation, but it got my face smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: neck&lt;br /&gt;Not good. Despite multiple passes, it could not get as close as a Series 7 nor a Series 5. More significantly, it did irritate my skin after these multiple passes. That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had a Braun redden my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent. Love the push-up trimmer format (same as the 3 and 5 series) rather than the flip-out as found on the 7. Works well and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling:&lt;br /&gt;It does work. I did feel a coolness from the aluminum bar, but did it help with the shave? Not for me. Fun and interesting, but adds little to the end result. It also drains the battery far more than just shaving. The feature can be turned on or off with a button on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave:&lt;br /&gt;This can be used as a wet shaver, but Braun is inconsistent as to what that means. On their web site, they say that \\&quot;...it is important that you do not use any shaving foams, gels or lotions which may act as a thermal insulator, and are not compatible with the alcohol based cleaning solution (and may potentially also damage the device).\\&quot; But, at the same time, they say you can use the razor in the shower. I guess when they say \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; they mean water only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with water and it didn&#x27;t add any benefits to the shave quality. For real wet shaving (with actual shave gel) I much prefer my Series 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;I do not have the model with the cleaning station, nor do I think it is needed for this design. While I love the cleaning station for my 5 and 7, the head design on this is super simple to clean under running water. Braun recommends oiling the heads once a week if you manually clean it. I&#x27;ve found using Remington Shaver Saver spray (or the analogous product from Norelco) works very well for lubrication, plus it has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;My three stars may seem to be a harsh rating. But when I look at the price of this compared with the 3, 5 and 7 Braun series, I was expecting something that performs nearly as well as a 7. This does not. It compares most closely with a 3 series in terms of shave quality and comfort, but lacks the true wet shave capabilities as some 3 series models have, plus it&#x27;s more irritating on the neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the build quality is excellent and the cooling bar is a novel addition, but for the price, this falls short and I can&#x27;t give it more than a 3 star recommendation.&#x27;t add any benefits to the shave quality.

    <li> Heavy and doesn&#x27;t shave near as close as the Pulsonic, however, much quiter. See no point in the Cool Tec, more of a gimic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to try out many Braun shavers in the past, from standard shavers to shavers with cleaning mechanisms.  I tried the Braun Cool Tec Solo Shaver on this occasion, the one without the cleaning mechanism.  I&#x27;ve also used other brands, but I&#x27;m mostly going to do some comparisons against other Braun experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Tec provides a close shave.  I haven&#x27;t experienced many Braun shavers in this price range that don&#x27;t, and Cool Tec delivers in that arena as well.  As for the cool aspect, I was initially thought it was a gimmick.  However, I was impressed by the \\&quot;tech\\&quot; in this shaver.  It really did feel like a comfortable shave, although you should always use an electric shaver for about a month before making a full judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit also had great power and was relatively quiet.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s more quiet than others, but certainly on par.  As for not having the base for cleaning and charging, I&#x27;m torn.  On one side, I do like the cleaning aspect, but I hate having one more thing on the counter.  I think that manual cleaning is more than sufficient though.  So unless a deep cleaning is something that concerns you, it might be an option to skip the extra cost and room on the counter and just get the shaver without the base station.</li>
    <li> Braun is a very reliable electric shaver company and in this price range you get a shaver that is well built and shaves well. But what about the \\&quot;cool tec\\&quot; aspect of this shaver? Does it really work? The short answer is yes. It provides cool feel on the razor end that feels very comforting to your skin. Is it necessary? Probably not. You&#x27;ll live without it. But if want a little luxury then go for it. This is a solid shaver that in my opinion is worth the money. Hope this review helps a little in making your decision!</li>
    <li> Ok here are my first thoughts after using the Braun &amp;#34;cool Tec&amp;#34; for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say I am a Safety Razor user so this was going to be a new experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my electric shaver that was provided via a program run by Braun and charged overnight. I waited until this morning (11/15) so that I would have a few days growth. Per the instructions shaved prior to my shower and typically I shave after my shower so this was an interesting change, but did make sense being this is more of a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I powered &amp;#34;her&amp;#34; up and activated the Cool Tec feature. I gave it a few second so that it would be nice and activated and must say it was an interesting experience. The coolness was very noticeable and must say provided a comfortable shave. I did not experience any irritation and overall enjoyed the shave. Compared to my typical &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave the process is a lot simpler, quicker but first shave was not as close as I would hope. I am hoping that it might just be a “rookie” shave and hope to report after my second shave this weekend. So far even with the not as close as expected shave I still give the razor an 8 out of 10 for comfort and &amp;#34;cool Tec&amp;#34; feature! I would recommend this to friends and family members but want to experience it more so I can move from &amp;#34;rookie&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo shaver through a program being run by Braun.  I have to say, I am greatly impressed.  This is only the second Braun shaver I have used in my (approaching middle-age) adult life; I have usually used Norelco products.  After hearing about the cooling aluminum bar, I was instantly intrigued.  I am one of those sensitive skinned guys who has some difficulty getting through an entire morning shave, so it definitely has not been my favorite part of the daily morning routine!  My neck areas are the most sensitive, and of course, the most difficult areas to get a close buzz without having to use the circular motion over, and over, and over….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a three head shaver that gives me a great shave compared to most products that I have had the opportunity to use, but those heads heat up during my use. Not something I really paid much attention to, until trial of this product.  Now, I feel that the heat being generated was contributing significantly to the minor discomforts I would feel during shaving, including the red blotches that would stick around for a couple hours.  With the Braun CoolTec Solo, I have a button I can push that cools down to a  44 degree mark while I am running the shaver over my skin.  I can use the cooling technology all over my face, or simply over the areas that I have most difficulty with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can turn the cooling bar on, or turn it off with the simple push of a button.  And the cooling takes place immediately after pushing the button.  This cooling technology has appeared to work very well on my sensitive neck areas in particular.  And above all, the shave is great.  No shaver is absolutely perfect in this regard, but the SensoBlade cuts my facial hair down very close and leaves my skin feeling smooth to the touch.  Again, I was impressed due to my lack of experience with Braun and foil headed shavers.  Best of all, my irritation is almost null and void, and no red blotches after I have completed my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar does not get TOO cold, either.  When I read that it reaches the &amp;#34;chilling&amp;#34; 44 degree mark and was as cold as a beverage can straight out of a cold fridge, I didn&#x27;t think that sounded overly soothing.  But, it is, in fact, soothing.  The entire head of the shaver does not cool down, just a bar in between the two foils, and it really is just enough.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone who has trouble with skin irritation or the after effects of reddness during their shave with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that, hands down, the Braun CoolTec Solo is the coolest shaver I have ever used - no pun intended!ve completed my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar does not get TOO cold, either.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1NWSG80Z14PN4]]Braun has introduced a razor with a cooling bar intended to reduce the irritation from shaving.  It is a cordless shaver with a three stage cutting system.  Overall, it works well, feels good in your hand, and has a nice list of features.  I am not entirely sold on the cooling technology, especially since it cuts your battery life by 66%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Decent shave&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used in the shower and cleaned under running water&lt;br /&gt;-Travel lock to keep the shaver from starting in your suitcase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-cooling feature cuts down battery life&lt;br /&gt;-a bit heavy&lt;br /&gt;-takes about 45 seconds for cooling feature to get to temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was provided to me through a program run by Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very fortunate to try out a new shaver from Braun.  They selected me to test out their newest shaver and give my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s a bit of a departure for them in the technology.  Having been a Braun fan for many years, I&#x27;ve followed their advances and seen them focusing on moving heads and cleaning systems to get a closer and cleaner shave.  This model does not pivot, rather the head remains fixed.  And there is no cleaning regimen involved, a simple brush is included, harkening back to older models of Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has not changed is the quality manufacturing and good shave.  It&#x27;s a rather substanital unit to hold in your hand.  It has an ergonomic grip that fits and feels comfortable in the hand.  Rubber is placed in all the right places, so at the bathroom counter, it won&#x27;t slip or fall easily.  I did not find the lack of a pivoting head a detriment at all (was the pivoting head really all that necessary or did they figure out a flexible head that really works now?).  The contours of my face were navigated nicely and I got a close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big add though to this shaver is the cooling sensation that (in theory) is to make for less razor burn and less irritation.  I&#x27;m fortunate to not experience too much rough shaving consequences, so I am not one to easily address that.  But what I can speak to is how cool the sensation is and how it really does make for a pleasant shaving experience.  The cooling action is optional.  The user does have to depress a clearly maked button in the palm portion of the shaver to activate the cooling.  Once this is done, a metal bar in the shaving head cools very quickly so that on each stroke of the shave a cold surface glides across the face.  I found it to be a rather pleasant experience.  There was definitely no razor burn and my face was comfortable at the end of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual for an electric shaver, the cut is not as close as a blade can get, but it does a great job of cleaning up my face without all the prep and clean up as well as not requiring lots of creams, lotions, or similar.  I simply turned on the shaver, ran it across my face as necessary and then used my regular daily moisturizer and I was good to go. I am a big fan of the shaver, I will use it on days I just can&#x27;t take the time to use a blade (my wife really does like the closer shave) or for some of the trickier parts of my face where running over and over to get the desired results can rough up my face. The shaver does have a pop up trimmer which I found helpful in evening my sideburns, so that is a good feature to like as well. In the box is the shaver itself, a cradle for charging, a cord to connect to a power source and a small brush for cleaning the debris in the shave head. So, it&#x27;s a bit of a departure, but if you are Braun fan, you know the quality of construction and shave you will get. If you are not a Braun user yet - this might be a good time to join the fanclub. Braun indicates this appliance has an expected life span of 7 years. I won&#x27;t be able to review that until November of 2020. But if that is close to right, the cost seems well worth it compared to what you&#x27;d pay for blades and associated products.</li>
    <li> Thank you Braun from all the guys that have sensitive skin but want to use an electric razor. I received the CoolTec a couple of weeks ago as part of program offered by Braun to try out their new razor. Simply put - I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use a Braun 7 series so I am familiar with the brand and the type of quality razors they produce. The razor has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in your hand. Although it doesn&#x27;t provide a shave as close &amp; quick as the 7 series(bigger motor) the CoolTec peforms well. The added feature of the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; shave is awesome. I will admit, it takes a little getting used to but not having irritated skin after shaving is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this razor &amp; recommend it to a friend. I think it would be an excellent first electric razor for the teen shaver on your gift list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t plug the charger directly into the razor. It has to sit in the stand to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last suggestion would be to spend the extra money &amp; buy the razor package that includes the Clean &amp; Renew system for automatically cleaning the razor</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 7680 that I&#x27;ve used for several years and have been reasonably happy with. Braun in general doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a manual razor does, so by midday it usually looks like I forgot to shave, but I prefer the ease, comfort, and speed of an electric shaver to that of a blade. The Cool Tec struck me as being a little on the gimmicky side. First, to the shaving itself, there&#x27;s no real change from the Brauns of a few years ago. It&#x27;s no worse and no better. The trimmer on this model comes up only as high as the main section, rather than extending a little beyond it as on my 7680. This made it a bit more difficult to use. Further, the trimmer is not as wide as it was on my older model, so it required more passes than I am used to. As for the little refrigerated cold bar, it certainly works as promised and I can feel the coolness as I shave. I suppose if I were shaving for a few minutes and the unit started to become warm from friction, this would be welcome, but usually by the time that starts to happen, I&#x27;m finished. So it&#x27;s neither here nor there for me. The recharging base doesn&#x27;t have a firm latch so it&#x27;s easy to put the unit in such that the two metal contacts in the rear of the razor don&#x27;t touch the recharging contacts. I suppose that&#x27;s why Braun added a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; sound to let you know that the contacts are touching appropriately and the unit is charging. I&#x27;d prefer that the contacts be redesigned so that they work every time. So overall, an interesting effort, but I prefer my 7680.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver is a luxurious electric shaver, introducing a new icy cooling feature. The shaver has a strong build, feels great in the hand, holds a great charge, and a joy to use for daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Wet and dry shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Icy cool technology&lt;br /&gt;- Irritation cut-free shave&lt;br /&gt;- Two year warranty&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively long battery life (Up to 45 minute per charge, so shaving two minutes daily yields about 3 weeks use)&lt;br /&gt;- Love the charging unit (Charges via touch point surfaces)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design - The Cool Tec has a bright Blue LED light with a snowflake (go figure) and the power button is a bright green LED light. Around the top of the shaver is rubber for grip for users who like to hold their shaver close to the head. Towards the bottom half is a glossy finish, with the rubber running thinly on the sides for grip, too. The shaver feels balanced and light enough to maneuver in different angles when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving experience - I was surprised at how it barely left any irritation or cuts. Some shavers like the Remingtons have a strong motor but leaves some cuts. The cooling feature is super icy and I could feel the coldness even minutes after shaving. This feature works. But, do you need it? Probably not. I think this would make sense if this was a gift. Impress your loved one! It&#x27;s up to you if you think the Cool tec feature is worthy to pony up. Definitely works and it&#x27;s definitely luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, cut-free shave, an impressive shaver. Recommended</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to thank provided Braun for providing this great product for me to try out. When I first turn on the shaver it feels like I was shaving on a regular electric shaver. On the other hand when I pressed the blue button with a picture of a snow flake the whole experience started to change second by second. The blades feels as though it is cleaning my skin and the blades are starting to get cold and it is relaxing my skin. The shaver is amazing because in the beginning I was thinking there is no way that this will work but after I tried it I knew I was wrong. I never saw anything like this before and you have to experience to get the feeling. After I pressed the cooling button I feel my skin getting cool as though it applied shaving creme and after shave on me but without me doing a single thing but just press the button. I feel as though they put something in it and this is a much better shave then applying the shave creme  and after shave by myself because I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation in my skin at all. The shaver cut my beard close to the skin but the good thing is it won&#x27;t cut your skin. I would recommend this shaver to any age men out there because it is a simple shaver to use and is good shaver that will leave your skin cool and smooth.</li>
    <li> You have heard for years all about a nice hot shave, but I am hear to tell you that there is a new shave in town, and it&#x27;s cool!  For the past month I have been using the new Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver which was provided via a program run by Braun.  I am one of those guys who has a really, and i mean really rough beard / stubble.  My facial hair is so rough it has always been a challenge for me to be able to successfully use an electric shaver.  I have had a number of them throughout the years, both 3 head and foil.  They all would take some of my hair off but none of them would be good enough job that I wouldn&#x27;t still have to finish up with a manual razor.  Knowing this I was both excited to try a new one, but also skeptical due to my previous experiences.  Oh, and not to mention very intrigued about this \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start straight out by saying that the cooling feature is cool! (pun intended).  The cooling sensation really does feel nice and I do believe that cooling of the skin definitely helps with no razor burn.  There are two buttons on the shaver, one that turns on the power and the cooling (the silver one), and then the blue one can be used to cut off the cooling feature if you just want it to to operate without it like the regular Braun shavers.  I will say that I agree with the instructions included that they recommend you turn the shaver one an let it run for a bit in order to allow the cooling bar to get cool.  I guess my only complaint on the cooling feature is I wish it was either colder or the cooling bar was larger to allow more of cooling sensation to be felt.  I also wanted to comment that I really liked the weight of the shaver.  I has a really good \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel and you can get a very good grip on it.  The charger that comes with it is a stand that makes magnetic contact on the leads of the shaver and the stand.  The charging time seemed very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the all important question, how did it shave on my oh so rough beard.  I am happy to say that it shaves my beard better than any of the other electric shavers I have owned!  Is it perfect? No, but truthfully I don&#x27;t expect many shaver would be.  The best performance part for me is that with this shaver I did not notice near as many single unshaven hairs (which can lead to the dreaded ingrown facial hairs!).  The whole month I have used it I did not have to go and manually re-shave over top of the initial shave. The trick is to stay shaving with the electric shaver everyday even if you don&#x27;t need or want to shave that day.  This will train your face / beard to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me shaving really is a pain most days, just for the time requirements if nothing else.  Now that I have been using the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver, I am actually looking forward to shaving.....so for me...it is cool to shave again!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CFZJMFM Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System 1 Kit]]</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Cool Tec Solo Shaver through a program run by Braun. Previously I used an older Norelco model which I like more than any of the new floating head electric razors I&#x27;ve tried. This is my first time using a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Braun does an above average job, but is weak cleaning up in the neck area. This has been true for me for any electric shaver I have used however. It worked best for me when shaving every other day rather than waiting 3+ days to shave. My facial hair does not grow very quickly so I can get away shaving about 3 times a week. I do have sensitive skin so shaving every 2 days typically irritates my neck, but the Cool Tec feature does a good job reducing irritation for me.  Therefore it&#x27;s easier for me to keep to a schedule of shaving every other day. The downside to the Cool Tec feature is a heavy electric razor, likely due to a larger battery. The battery life is also affected by the Cool Tec as using it only provides about 15 minutes of shave time per charge vs. three times as long if not used. The shaver is water resistant, can be rinsed under running water and used in the shower. As such it uses a charging stand with two metal contacts on the shaver transferring the power rather than a charging cord. Therefore you need to make sure you have enough charge to get through your full shave as you can&#x27;t plug it in and keep shaving if you run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> disappointed. couldn&#x27;t feel &#x27;cool&#x27; at all, doesn&#x27;t shave well, back to my old norelco...</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Cool Tec razor through a Braun promotion.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I have used a Braun razor with rotary blades. I was concerned the foil shavers on the Cool Tec would be difficult to use, but I made the transition quickly. The cool tec technology is pretty powerful. The center cooling element gets cold quickly and does sooth the skin as I shave. I don&#x27;t always use the cooling element though because it can be a bit shocking early in the morning, just getting up from a warm bed.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cool Tec razor does provide a close shave. However, I use a traditional razor every few days to give myself an even closer shave. I have done this with all electric razors I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a razor and the Braun Cool Tec is in your price range, I would recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> great shaver！a little bit heavy when shaving but never fire my face. didn&#x27;t let me down, i love it, I will buy one more for my son.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband.  He likes it very much, and it does a good job on cutting his facial hair.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec is one if a kind.  The \\&quot;coolest\\&quot; shave ever.  Great handling and maneuverability.  Recommended for any man that needs a cool shave.  I received the Braun Cool Tec Razor through the Braun company to review the product.  I have tough facial hair and often suffer from irritation...the Braun keeps that from happening, at least for me.  The cooling sensation last and is beneficial for the man that may suffer from irritation.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and I have to say it is nice to have.  It provides a nice cool close shave.  I even let my hair grow for a couple of days and it worked great their as well.  It will trim it down nice so that I can shave it super close for the head but, daily keeps my face and neck nicely trimmed.  This electric shaver was a provided from a program run by Braun.</li>
    <li> What an amazing speed！3 days to Shanghai</li>
    <li> the best price and  vale.</li>
    <li> I received a Braun °CoolTec Solo shaver to test out, from a program run by Braun, and these are my honest opinions. I was pleased to see that the product&#x27;s claims are true, in that it gave me a smooth and close shave and the &#x27;Cool Tec&#x27; technology cooled my skin as I shaved. Even though you don&#x27;t use shaving cream or gel, your face won&#x27;t get irritated. I have been using this shaver in the shower a lot, so I&#x27;m loving that it&#x27;s waterproof - I&#x27;m a man that loves efficiency so I find that using it in the shower &#x27;shaves off&#x27; (bad pun intended) some precious minutes in the morning. The weight of the shaver is a bit heavy, but I&#x27;d prefer it to err on the heavy side than the light side, otherwise it just feels cheap and of low quality. I actually like the solid feeling in my hand and feel like it helps me be more careful in guiding it across m face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t travelled with this shaver yet so I haven&#x27;t used the travel lock features but I’m a fan of when products have these.</li>
    <li> This review of the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver is from a former Norelco shaver fan. Braun won me over in 2010 with their [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]]. I found that the Braun series 7-790cc Pulsonic shaver system offered me a noticeably superior shave to any Norelco shaver that I had used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary advantage of the Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver, as touted by Braun, is its cool shave option. (More on this in a moment.) The shaver also feels quite solid and firm in the hand. Although made primarily of plastic, there is some heft to the shaver. It simply feels heavy and that&#x27;s a good thing in my book. I also prefer the sideburn and mustache trimmer to the one on the Braun series 7-790cc Pulsonic. It operates in a different flip out manner makes it easier to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver uses Braun&#x27;s cooling technology they they refer to by the moniker of  \\&quot;Cool Tec\\&quot;. Braun claims that \\&quot;Cool Tec\\&quot; \\&quot;effectively cools down the skin while shaving, delivering a pleasant and skin-friendly shave without negative impact on shaving results.\\&quot; Braun states that it does this without using gels or lotions to improve the shaving process. That sounds quite nice, but I wondered if the performance of the shaver&#x27;s engineering matched the hype of its marking folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To check reality verses marking hype, I tried using the shaver both ways. (You can decide whether or not to turn on the \\&quot;Cool Tec\\&quot; function on a shave-by-shave basis, so if you don&#x27;t like it you don&#x27;t have to use it.) My sense was that switching on the &#x27;CoolTec\\&quot; feature did give a somewhat more comfortable shave. Whether the cooling effect will deteriorate over time, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s too early to tell. However, for now, you can definitely feel the cooling--so score one for engineering on this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is a travel lock. It is engaged by pressing the on/off switch for three seconds. The same action alsodisengages the lock. (It&#x27;s a toggle on, toggle off function.) A lock symbol in the display indicates whether or not the travel lock is engaged. This is extremely handy for those unhappy times when your shaver switched itself on in your travel bag. Of course, that always occurs when you leave the charger at home. Everyone knows that you get plenty of shave time from a fully charged battery--so why bother carrying the extra weight of the charger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories that came with the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver were a mixed bag. The instructions promised that a carry pouch was included. It wasn&#x27;t. The instructions also recommend that the shaver heads be oiled once a week with a light machine oil. A good idea that almost nobody does because very few people keep a bottle of machine oil in their bathrooms. Braun thoughtfully included a small bottle of light machine oil with the shaver. A nice touch that was not clearly mentioned as being included in the box by the instructions. It&#x27;s so much better when the instructions always match the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two holders that can be used to hold the shaver when not in use. There is a charging shell and shell power socket (base) that is included with the shaver. There is also an optional \\&quot;Clean&amp;Charge\\&quot; station that serves as a base. The included two-piece shell and base is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seem to provide the stability that a shaver this heavy deserves. Furthermore, I was disappointed that the cleaner base that is used for the series 7-790cc Pulsonic shaver system was much too narrow to hold the Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver. Why Braun can&#x27;t have one cleaner base that serves all their shavers is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some of my nit picks, I suspect that the Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver will quickly become my favorite shaver. It&#x27;s heft in my hand, travel lock and cool shave feel put it miles above any other shaver that I have used. Well done Braun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other reviewers have noted that Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver does a poor job shaving the neck. Having used this shaver for several weeks now, I can say that this is true.  This is a disappointing aspect of an otherwise decent shaver.</li>
    <li> good,fast,comfortable.</li>
    <li> First,  The Cool Tec Feature is Amazeing. It Feels Like A Piece Of Ice Glideing Over Your Face.  I own a High End Panasonic; I Purchased From Amazon &amp; While I would Rate The Braun About Equal With The Closeness Of The Shave, The Braun Is Much More A Comfortable Shave By Far.  The Braun Does Shave Better Under My Nose, Than The Panasonic &amp; The Battery Does Stay Charged Up All Through Use With The &#x27;Cool Tec Feature On&#x27;...I Chose The &#x27;Solo&#x27; Because I Just Dont care For the Self Cleaning Jobs. Compared To My Panasonic &amp; The Cool Tech Feature, I Give The Braun 5 Stars; As To My Panasonic I Would Rate It A &#x27;Hard 3&#x27;.  JMHO</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec shaver is one of the best shavers i&#x27;ve tried, I received it through a program run by Braun. Normally electric shavers cause iritation on my skin due to the heat and blades. But with the Braun Coole Tec shaver&#x27;s cooling technology, it solved the issue. The cooling caused by the shaver prevents the irritation a normal shaver would cause. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone, especially if your current shaver is causing irritation.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver from Braun a few days ago, and so far I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a tough time shaving.  Tough hair + bad skin &#x3D; no fun.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about everything out there with little to no success.  From the lift and cut electrics to the multiple blades with lotion.  I&#x27;ve actually had to shave the night before so the redness and irritation would be gone before work the next day...so I always look like I don&#x27;t shave!  I was literally going through a box of those quad-blade things a month, which get&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that Braun had a new &#x27;cooling&#x27; bar I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and I&#x27;m continually impressed with how it works. The only thing I would caution against is speed.  If you move too fast with it you&#x27;ll get more of a pull than a cut, which of course will lead to irritation.  Once you find the speed that works for your hair and skin type, it really does the job.  Also, move too fast and you&#x27;ll loose the benefit of the cooling bar, which seems to make a significant difference.</li>
    <li> I received my razor in the mail yesterday.  I charged it and tried it out last night.  I was impressed.  It actually did feel cool and did a good job at shaving.  My skin was not irritated at all.  I&#x27;m excited to keep using this razor. The electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
    <li> Finally, I just received my new Braun CoolTec Shaver, straight from Braun.  I have been given the opportunity to try out the product and tell the world about my experience(s).  The CoolTec design is streamlined and fits perfectly in the hand.  The soft touch buttons and smooth gliding action of the attached trimmer makes the shaver comfortable to use.  After waiting for its initial charge to complete, I put it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin, I was a bit apprehensive to use the electric style razor.  I have had bad experiences in the past with electric razor burn but this time was different.  The cooling technology was immediately put to the test and sure enough its ability to ease the redness and sharpness of a shave was apparent.  The smooth gliding action of the shaver along with the fresh cool sensation on my face.....my eyes were opened to a new way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On any given day I currently use the ever so costly razors that require a small investment when refilling the cartridge supply.  Absolutely.....NO MORE!  In one use, I am sold on Brauns ability to make a shave truly enjoyable. CoolTec is unequivocally the way to go.</li>
    <li> Received the through a Braun program and love it since the first go. I am using the shaver in correlation with &amp;#34;Movember&amp;#34; and my attempt at a mustache/goatee combo and it is nothing short of fantastic for shaving my neck and cheeks around the facial hair. It shaves right down and clean like a manual razor and with the straight edges (unlike other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried with round heads) it leaves nice clean lines along the hair lines. It also with the cool technology is a painless smooth shave with no hair pulling and is super fast. Really easy to clean too, bonus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 7 series shaver for quite some time and have been very happy with it, so I was excited to try out the new Braun Cool Tec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed out of the box, is that the Cool Tec is bulkier than the 7 series.  It&#x27;s still substantial as far as weight goes but the overall quality does seem like a step backwards.  Ergonomically, it fit well in my hands though, so it does feel like I have good control when maneuvering the shaver around my face, chin, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is good.  It takes a few more passes than the 7 series which is understandable since the motor on the Cool Tec isn&#x27;t as strong.  The non-swiveling head also took some time to get used to since getting around some of the curves and angles takes a bit more work.  I consider myself having a medium coarse beard and the Cool Tec cut through the hair effectively.  My skin is only mildly sensitive so irritation with the Cool Tec has never been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a push up trimmer/edger that works as expected.  It trimmed my sideburns and the edge of my mustache easily.  My one complaint about this is the trimming blade is too narrow for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature on this shaver does seem gimmicky at first, but I have to admit it is a pretty &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feature.  There is a thin bar between the two shaving foils that feels cool on your skin as you&#x27;re shaving.  Since my skin is not very prone to irritation, I&#x27;m not sure how helpful this is in that regard but it seems like it would help with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my 7 series shaver is easier to use and not as bulky feeling as the Cool Tec but the 7 series is more expensive.  At this price point, I think this shaver is a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I received this shaver in a promotion, so I will approach this review with full disclosure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have both liked and loathed Braun razors. I tend to have thicker-growing neck hair, and I found that the pop-out clipper on this model did NOT do a very good job of trimming the neck hair - sideburns were ok, moustache, ok... but neck hair took multiple passes, and was still unsatisfactory even after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been times in the past that I have liked Braun&#x27;s offering with the foil trimmer - this is not one of those times - it did not get my stubble as close as I like, and I had to go over it multiple times in different directions to get anywhere close to where my Norelco triple-head was able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW - the positives - I LOVED the Cool Tec! Great engineering feat, it really did keep the shave cool - without it I got razor burn from this razor, so it was a much-welcomed upgrade to the shaving experience. I just wish I could remove it and put it on my other razors! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great build quality, though plastic, it has a great heft, and good feel in the hand. The charge held fine, the stand was nice and the extra button/indicator for the Cool Tec was a welcome feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m giving this razor two stars, since the Cool Tec and build quality were really nice, but admittedly, I won&#x27;t be using this razor outside of the promotion I&#x27;m involved in, since it didn&#x27;t take care of my shaving needs as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review useful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun Shavers for many years and decided to get an additional shaver so I can keep one in my car which I can use it while in commute and keep another at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard Braun is advertising and running a promotion program on their new CoolTec Solo so I wanted to give it a try because of the new technology. However, using the new CoolTec Solo, while the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; works as great as their other Braun shavers, I didn&#x27;t really like CoolTec Solo because of the bulkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; works as advertised and it really helped since I have sensitive skin, but I feel like holding a mini refrigerator/shaver in my hand while shaving. Also, the blades were too far apart (comparing to the non-cooling-types) so it will take some time for you to get use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is still a great product.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through a program with Braun.  This electric razor actually works exceptionally well.  I have been using it for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.  First, it is fast for an electric razor.  Second, it is very comfortable.  There is a blue stripe down the middle of the razor that is cool to the touch.  It is a smooth, dry element that feels like cold metal to me.  It is actually really nice.  The sensation is a bit like the old menthol shaving creams that were around back in the day.  The only reason that this razor didn&#x27;t get 5 starts is because of the peripherals.  The stand seems a bit cheep.  Also, the razor needs to be used with the stand.  there is no way to plug the razor in directly, so if you want to travel, make sure you have a strong battery.  I&#x27;m not sure the battery would last a week.  Overall a great performer if used at home and not on the road.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver via a Braun program. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good shaver. I&#x27;m used to a triangle shaped design. But this linear design has it&#x27;s merits. Some usual problem areas were picked up well with this shaver. Other times not too great and would require a few runs. I don&#x27;t have the most cooperative facial hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like the cooling feature. I don&#x27;t know that it actually helps with burns or irritations but it does feel good. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Though I&#x27;m not quite sure about the features you&#x27;re getting for an over 100 bucks price point.</li>
    <li> IT HAS HEAD PROBLEMS, And due to that, it Isn&#x27;t as expected DITTO,  DITTO And due to that, it Isn&#x27;t as expected DITTO,  DITTO</li>
    <li> I received my CoolTec shaver through a special Braun program and at first was very hesitant because I have never had great luck with electric shavers.  I tend to also shave in the shower to reduce irritation so I was very hopeful that this razor could match my current process&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about how the aluminum cooling bar would feel but it did a great job in preventing razor burn.  The cooling bar feels really cold and prevents irritation although the battery life becomes very short with repeated use of the cooling bar.  I was surprised though as my face is smooth and irritation free after shaving.  I was also able to use this razor in the shower which was very helpful for my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has changed my opinion of electric razors in general and overall Braun did a good job with this one.  The only problem I have is that it is tough to get all of the hair on my neck and the overall weight of the razor, it is extremely heavy.  That is the reason for 4 starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this Cool technology to friends.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the nice cool shave. It is a bit heavy. I was excited to use this to shave after no shave November.</li>
    <li> This shaver was received through a program run by Braun and I must say, Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec is literally a cool idea. The incorporation of a bar that really does get cold, really feels great. I was skeptical at first but delightfully surprised, I didn&#x27;t have any irritated skin after. With continued use of the razor, I was awaiting the typical heating but couldn&#x27;t notice it with the cool bar in place and active. Please note, you can shut it off but after trying it I don&#x27;t know why you would. The cool bar doesn&#x27;t interfere with shaving and may actually help with a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are smooth and refreshing. I am used to the three headed circular razors and hope to see this idea incorporated into one. This would have received a 5 star but as I prefer the three headed circular, I think my preference would receive the 5 star rating. No disappointments here. A great razor with a great idea.</li>
    <li> Wish I would of known you can&#x27;t plug the charging cord into the shaver itself. The separate charging base is cheap and comes in 2 awkward pieces that require a lot of space to store. Can&#x27;t take traveling if you need to recharge with all this stuff because it takes up too much room. Does work nice and I like the cool feature and cleaning in water.</li>
    <li> I picked this razor up after reading a glowing review in Men&#x27;s Journal but have been very disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave quality is extremely poor, especially around my neck.  Whether wet or dry, I keep having to finish with a disposable razor.  The Cool Tec technology works well but only works for a short period of time.  It takes me a solid 10-12 minutes to shave with this razor but the Cool Tec bar only lasts for 4-5 minutes.  That&#x27;s the selling point of this razor.  Without it I might as well go with a 3 series from Braun for significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return this to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric shavers but since I have such sensitive skin none of them worked for me. After receiving an invite to try the Braun CoolTec Solo for free I was skeptical but decided to give it a shot since I have to shave everyday for work.  It was simple to plug in and charging was pretty quick.  I was impressed by the aluminum cooling bar and helped to not irritate my sensitive skin.  This shaver provided me with the closest shave from any razor without any irritation.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking of giving these to my brothers and father for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I received my Braun Cooltec Solo shaver last week from a program run by Braun but because I had to go out of town I was not able to charge it and use it.  I finally got a chance to use it this week though.  I have been using it for the last 3 days and I have noticed that it gives me a much closer shave than the electric shaver I was using before.  I was skeptical at first about the cooling bar but I really do think that it minimizes skin irritation.  My skin feels smoother, cooler and less irritated than when I was using my old shaver.  I would definitely recommend this shaver to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Braun CoolTec Solo shaver for free via a program by Braun.  I&#x27;m not one to give out good reviews solely based on getting an item for free.  If it was junk, I&#x27;d let you know.  I was skeptical at first about the claims of this razor, but it really cools my face as I shave.  It&#x27;s really amazing how much my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated anymore.  It literally feels like someone is putting an ice cube up to my face as I&#x27;m shaving.  The razor itself is powerful and does a good job of cutting my hair, which feels the same as any other razor I&#x27;ve shaved with.  There is a trimmer on it as well that is handy for sideburns, etc., which my other razor had as well.  I do like my other trimmer function better as this one doesn&#x27;t stick out too far and sometimes can be tricky to use.  Overall this is a great product and I would buy it.  I am anxious to see if the cooling strip goes bad, but for now I will continue to use it based on that cooling strip and how well it&#x27;s performing.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Braun Shaver user. I am very happy to get Braun Cool Tech Shaver to replace my current 5-year old Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first look, this Cool Tech Shaver is somewhat bulky and heavy. Though it feels quite solid and firm on hand, I am not sure I will bring it during travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newly added &amp;#34;Cool Tech&amp;#34; is to cool down the skin while shaving. I am not sure if this is a big deal to me. But, one thing is for sure, if I turn on the Cool tech feature, the battery run time is reduced from 45 minutes down to 15 minutes. I guess, I will just leave this feature off. But, the button that turns the cooling feature on an doff is easy to hit accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head of this shaver does not pivot. That adds a little bit of inconvenience.  In terms of shaving performance, it&#x27;s decent, but not spectacular. Around the lips and chip are OK, but it has hard time on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks usage, I decided to switch back to my old Braun....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t get excited about shaving but when I received a Braun CoolTec Solo through a program run by Braun I was elated as elated can be!  Nobody likes a painful or frustrating shave and when I tested this bad boy out and it not only felt refreshing but actually reduced razor burn I felt like a changed man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was a clean, smooth shave that left my face feeling fresh and nice, and even gave my confidence a boost!  My only complaint would be that the trimmer didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  It did do the job but just not with the efficiency that I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks as part of a program run by Braun, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for any guys on your holiday Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shaver overall and I agree with most of the reviewers here that it&#x27;s not the greatest for the neck area.  However, I use the trimmer pop up to trim the bigger hairs and then shave normally with the shaver to overcome this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it does a good job, and that the cooling feature works well.  It makes the unit heavier, but being of a larger stature, I don&#x27;t mind the heft in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary drawback that I have found is that the 2 point contact charger in the back of the shaver, doesn&#x27;t always connect.  While this isn&#x27;t a showstopper by any means, it still means that you need to be careful when putting the shaver away to charge it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program from Braun. For the first two to three weeks this razor worked great and seemed to be one of the best razors I  ever used but I found that after a month, the razor fell dramatically to a level of  dissatisfaction.  No matter how much time is spent cleaning the razor, I still find that it leaves a lot of stubble around the neck and jaw bone.  This is a great razor when time dosnt allow for a real shave with a traditional razor.  So yeah good at first but not worth the money in the long run..</li>
    <li> Very nice,  very coo!  Love the cooling feature built in. Now if they&#x27;d only make the cooling feature for the next iphone, the world would be good!  But yes, great shave fir the price!</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price around for this shaver. I really didn&#x27;t need or want the clean/charge station - manual cleaning with tap water is fine. I was concerned after reading in the manual that the Cooltec shaver cannot be used with any pre-shave products i.e. no shave lotion when used dry and no foams or gels when used in the shower. I planned on using it in the shower. I couldn&#x27;t imagine that there would be enough glide. My previous Philips and Panasonic wet/dry shavers had no problem with foam or gel. Braun customer service is not yet up to speed on the Cooltec. One agent stated that lotion, foam or gel would damage the shaver and that it would void my warranty! A supervisor corrected that...she said that pre-shaves might damage the shaver but that my warranty would still apply. Another Braun CS agent wrote to me that the Cooltec could NOT be used in the shower at all (she later apologized and said that it could).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the Cooltec gives me a comfortable and very close shave in the shower without foam or gel! That&#x27;s a significant savings - not having to purchase foam or gel ever again! I am amazed. The cooling technology is very pleasant and soothing as well. I did make sure to follow the recommended tips - short strokes holding the shaver at a right angle to the skin. My only reason for deducting one star is that the shave-time per charge drops from 45 to 15 minutes if you use the cooling feature.</li>
    <li> The new Braun CoolTec CT2s gives me a fast, close, and clean shave, which is the equal of the best that I have had. Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I have owned a rotary Remington shaver since the end of 2008. The new CT2s is a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works well.  There is also a trimmer attachments, which works well.  The cooling feature is a little strange.  I never would have thought of combining refrigeration with a razor.  I find that although this also works well, it is not really a necessity. Using the cooling does reduce the charge life by a factor of three, from 45 minutes to 15 minutes, according to the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads. The instruction manual indicates the use of the [[ASIN:B00DB5Q26M Braun 40B Foil Replacement Cartridge]] for the CT2s. These are available on Amazon for about $40, but can be found on the web for around $35.  The cost of these replacements is slightly higher than the prices of replacement heads for other razors. The instruction booklet suggests replacing the heads every eighteen months. My previous experience with Braun foil razors was that the heads last for about six months.  We will have to see how well these new ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real trade-off with this razor is cost versus quality.  The CT2s is about double the price of other electric razors.  However, the shave is very good.  If you are willing to pay the extra cost for the quality, then this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for about 22 years. The first one I bought, amazingly enough, lasted for about 20 years. The power cord input started to act a bit wonky. Otherwise I might still be using it. The next Braun I bought has been great also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Vine just offered me this Cool Tec shaver and I was glad to take it. I could tell immediately that it was substantial, of the high quality that I have gotten used to with Braun. It gives me a close shave without having to make too many passes over my skin. The sideburn and hair trimmer works even better than the trimmers on my previous Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not come with the cleaning cartridge mentioned here, which is fine with me. The top simply snaps off and can be rinsed underwater. It can be cleaned easily and quickly, so I don&#x27;t see the point of the cleaning cartridge anyway (there really isn&#x27;t any places where stray hairs could gather that wouldn&#x27;t come out by rinsing). The charging station works well and charges fairly quickly. The only downside is that the cord plugs directly into the station (not the shaver) so, unlike my previous Brauns, you are unable to use electrical power to shave if you forget to charge. You have to wait for it to charge - but, as I said, the charging time is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the Cool Tec function? I had never heard of this before and my first reaction what that it is simply a gimmick. Yes and no. I don&#x27;t believe that it gives me a better or closer shave. But after using it I think this is a great feature, especially when shaving in a warm environment or when your skin might be hotter than usual. I can see that it could cut down on skin irritation. It actually is very cool and refreshing. I can take it or leave it now on cold mornings, but think that I will be glad to have this everyday in the summer. I&#x27;m happy to have this shaver and recommend it completely.</li>
    <li> I saw this and decided to try it because I have very sensitive skin and one of my pain points with electric shavers is the heat build up from extended shaving.  The first time I tried this, I loved it.  The shaver stays cool to the touch and I find I shave better with the more comfortable shaver.  I am not sure how the tech works but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only 2 issues I can find with the shaver are:&lt;br /&gt;1) No ability to run it corded.  This makes it a disposable razor when the battery is worthless in a few years.  Not good for me financially or for the Earth&#x27;s landfills.&lt;br /&gt;2) The button that turns the cooling feature on and off is easy to hit accidentally.</li>
    <li> I have two other cheaper Braun Shavers, one of which I got on the VINE, and they both shave better than this model.  I waited about 5 days to shave to have a good test.  Then I turned this on and shaved for over 5 minutes.  It did a nice job around the lips and the chin, and not to bad on the cheeks.  Unfortunately, in the shallows of the neck it took going over and over and over again to get close to having a decent shave.  Even after five minutes there are still area&#x27;s I may have to touch up with a blade.  Now mind you the cooling thing is really nice, I would not have wanted to shave for so long if not for the cooling effect.  Additionally, I used this dry and without any bracer to make the hairs stand up, so that might help.  Bottom line is:  that the cheaper Braun shavers I have, do not have this problem, while costing about a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is the first of the cooling shavers as far as I know, so I assume they&#x27;ll correct this soon.  The cooling technology brings up an interesting point, I&#x27;ve long known that semiconductors can be used to cool, I have a mini-fridge that plugs in and uses that for six cans of soda or something that size.  It takes forever to cool though, and this seems near instant.  Granted it&#x27;s not very big, but I wonder if it&#x27;s using some new technology.  If so I have a suggestion.  The tech I speak of is nanotechnology.  I went to a educational talk at my company given 8 years ago about nanotech, and the institute at Purdue University that was for the study.  They could do two things well at the time, one was changing colors, and the second was cooling.  The speaker suggested 10X as efficient as current semiconductor cooling.  Does this shaver use that tech?  I can&#x27;t answer that, but it does cool down fast, so it may use something new.  Now for the suggestion, if the cool down effect is this fast, maybe Braun can create a handheld true cooling fan, that would be good for an hour or two between charges out in the heat!It might also appease women who get hot flashes, and need a temporary cool down as well.  As for my other suggestion, don&#x27;t buy this product until they improve the shaving part, it&#x27;s should perform better than a 30 dollar special!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend, I do not know the feedback, but the price was very nice, compare with some Japanese brand.</li>
    <li> I got the Braun Cool Tec via a program run by Braun, at absolutely no charge to me.  That&#x27;s a positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the Cool Tec cooling function.  I truly appreciated not having any irritation thanks to the 44 degree cooling sensation.  That&#x27;s the other positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that though, I didn&#x27;t care for this shaver.  The shaver is heavy.  The coils can be popped off and washed with running water but the head and mounts underneath have to be brushed off.  The hair that collects underneath is not easy to simply just blow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does not suit well with thick chin/neck hair.  It took at least 20 minutes every time I shaved to just trim my chin/neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up hair trimmer is not powerful enough for sideburns...it takes too many swipes which leads to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will happily return to using a razor and shaving cream rather than continue to use this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am a traditional wet shave soap and razor guy.  Although I have tried a couple of electric shavers before, I typically return to my old fashioned razor after sometime.  The only exception is that I prefer to use the electric shaver for trimming my beard and long hair, and I have always held onto an electric for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I was excited to try the new CoolTec Shaver through the Braun program, and I must say objectively it did not disappoint.  While I may still return to the close shave of a straight blade, the features of the CoolTec are quite an improvement over my old electric shaver.  First, I appreciate the cordless nature; I am aware that this is not new technology, but it is new to me, and I found myself using it in different rooms and on the go.  Also, it does provide a nice shave, still a bit different than I am used to, but certainly closer than my old electric and did not burn or catch long hairs.  The cooling feature that seems to be unique to the CoolTec I thought might be sort of gimmicky, but I was pleasantly surprised that it really did work.  It just feels nice to the touch, and in contrast to my old electric shaver that really burns and chaffs the skin, it is a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must give this product a proverbial “thumbs up,” or 4 out of 5 stars on that scale.  I think for someone who prefers to use an electric shaver, they would probably really enjoy it.  I will personally continue to use and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program run by Braun. It honestly is one of the best razors i&#x27;ve used. The CoolTec really relieves any irritation you may encounter while shaving and it feels spectacular and very different on your face. $99 for this razor is really a deal, and god forbid it breaks, I am definitely getting the same exact one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two very minor drawbacks: it is a bit heavy and it doesn&#x27;t trim the neck that well, but nothing the back trimmer can&#x27;t fix. Just if we had to be nit picky. But so far an awesome product!</li>
    <li> This shaver closely resembles a Series 3 Braun in performance and feel but with an added cooling unit. The cooling unit feels good, but I don&#x27;t think it is essential for most people. Shaving around the neck is not perfect, as expected. If I were to shop again, I would go for a regular Series 5 without the cooling unit.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Shaver, my go to being the seven series.&lt;br /&gt;I was initially concerned that the manual warned against using any pre-shave products - i.e. no lotion before dry shaving and no foam or gel for wet use in the shower. Now this is not exactly news for those who have other Braun&#x27;s as they even warn against you using water to rinse the head and blades as they can corrode without the lubricant that is in the lemon scented cartridge cleaner that that some models of the Cooltec shavers come with. This model does not have the cleaning dock feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is two fold. One its about fifty bucks cheaper without it, and two you don&#x27;t need the cleaning solution for the first time. Thats right the CoolTec&#x27;s have blades and foils that you can just rinse off in water or completely submerge. YAYYYYY that is great news if you are on a budget and don&#x27;t want to spend the extra 15 bucks a month on the Braun cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Braun CS and asked if shave products would really damage the shaver and if so, would using them void my warranty. The agent said, \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; the warranty would be void! I was incredulous and asked for a supervisor who corrected the previous agent and told me that although using pre-shave products was strongly advised against, the warranty would still stand. I use a pre shave just because you get a closer shave without road rash. It has a lubricant in it so it won&#x27;t corrode the blades or foils so big deal. Aramis Lab series for men is the best.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000H7Y250 Aramis Lab Series Electric Solution]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another CS agent emailed that the Cooltec could not be manually cleaned with water at all and could not be used in the shower! I knew from the manual that both of these statements were incorrect and she later apologized and confirmed that I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly Braun US customer service is not up to speed on this product.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the Cooltec works great in the shower without any foam or gel. I am amazed at the close and comfortable shaves I&#x27;m getting. Braun should really promote this as a \\&quot;plus\\&quot; since anyone would be happy to save money by never having to buy shave foam or gel again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling technology is very soothing and has greatly diminished the irritation I used to experience. The only reason for deducting one star is that use of the cooling feature drops the shave-time per charge from 45 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling bar really works&lt;br /&gt;Water proof within reason&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - just rinse under tap&lt;br /&gt;Dock for easy charging&lt;br /&gt;Li-Ion Battery&lt;br /&gt;Built to last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat Heavy but Brauns are bank vault built so no surprise&lt;br /&gt;No charge without the honking dock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is a pretty good deal given all the technology pumped into it by those meticulous Germans.hout any foam or gel.

    <li> As part of a program run by Braun I received a Braun °CoolTec Solo CT2S shaver to try out. I have been using Braun shavers for several years and overall have preferred this brand over others. The °CoolTec Solo CT2S provided them same close shave and excellent quality that I expect from Braun. I have sensitive skin that usually results in some minor irritation with my current shaver, but the °CoolTec Solo CT2S cooling bar eliminated any irritation and burn that I would usually have. The only downside I had was that I found the shaver head was too wide due to the cooling bar being in between the cutting heads which made it a little awkward at first, but I did get used to it. If I was purchasing a °CoolTec  shaver myself I would have chosen the CT2CC model with the Clean and Charge station which I have enjoyed with my previous Braun shaver. Definitely would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> While a great idea in theory, this electric razor neither gives you a close shave, nor stops irritation. Upon first trying it i was pleased at the cooling sensation. But, unfortunately it still pulls and tugs causing more irritation than it can soothe. plus, it only get&#x27;s about 85% close ans takes forever to get there. I&#x27;ve tried shaving pre, during, and post showering and it&#x27;s all the same. No matter what direction i go or how much i stretch the skin, it just doesn&#x27;t shave right. I&#x27;ll stick to blades for now.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the Braun CoolTec razor at first because I&#x27;m usually a regular wet-shaving kind of guy. I&#x27;ve had an electric one before (the kind with 3 razor heads) and it was okay, but nothing special. I&#x27;ve also used blade razors that range everywhere from the 5-for-a-dollar disposables to the fancy ones that require a battery and didn&#x27;t see a huge difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried the CoolTec with the cold-technology I thought it was just another &amp;#34;fancy battery&amp;#34; feature, but it actually is pretty awesome. It gets super cold, which makes the hair stand up on end and also feels really good on your skin. Also, since the razor is two parallel blades instead of the circular 3 setup, it catches the grooves of your face much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this. Nice work, Braun.</li>
    <li> Every man has different preference when it comes to shaving, therefore every review will be different as well. For the sake of this review, it will be helpful if I provide my context: I am mid 40s Asian man, who shaves 3 times a week. Throughout my shaving journey, I tried BOTH blade and the electric. So I can tell the pros and cons of both.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that no electric shaver will shave as close as the blade: Blade actually touches the skin while the electric does not. For this review then, I will focus not on the closeness of the shave but overall usability of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does what it claims. It does cool your skin while you shave. The &amp;#34;active cooling technology&amp;#34; does work. I did not feel any burn sensation at all. Other electric shavers you have irritation on your skin, you would feel the heat traveling to the blade foil. But Cool Tec was comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2. It gives you a closer shave than other electric shavers. I always liked the Braun electric shavers, because they gave me closer shaves due to straight foil and this Cool Tec also has adaptable 3-stage cutting system (basically, it has 2 independently moving cutting elements that cut BOTH the short hair and the long hairs. The two foils move UP&amp;DOWN and SIDE-to-SIDE to ensure capture all your hairs, while contouring to your skin).&lt;br /&gt;3. It can be used in shower WITHOUT the shaving cream. Yes, you can use it in the water. I personally do not like to use the shaver in shower, but I can see that others might find it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to clean. Just pop out the top, and you can simply rinse it with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is heavier and bulkier than the most electric shavers. I have small hands, therefore it was hard for me to control and maneuver the shaver. To be fair, you can get used to it within 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;2. Price. I think it is somewhat pricey, but it is subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do like the product a lot. If you only use electric shaver, and are looking for something that is excellent and can be used in the shower, then I highly recommend this Cool Tec!lot. If you only use electric shaver, and are looking for something that is excellent and can be used in the shower, then I highly recommend this Cool Tec!</li>
    <li> its too thick.i feel not good.i like thin,so this is not suit for me.i like 5 sieries. could i hand it return?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun razors my whole life, but this is my first Cool Tec razor. I also own a Norelco. The Braun gives a closer shave, and the straight foil makes it easier to give an edge to sideburns. The Norelco gives the more comfortable shave, but the tradeoff is it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the PROS and CONS of the Braun as I see them. You can decide which are important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;gives a close shave&lt;br /&gt;the cooling feature feels nice on the skin (it really is cool)&lt;br /&gt;the travel lock keeps the razor from turning on in your baggage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, probably due to the Cool Tec components&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t shave as comfortably as my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my Norelco for everyday use (more comfortable shave, lighter in weight), but when I need to look my best, I&#x27;ll use the Braun (closer shave).</li>
    <li> Two of the men in my family used the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver.  I asked them for their comments and have written them below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver is a decent electric shaver.  They used the shaver on their faces and don&#x27;t maintain  beards or mustaches.  The shaver successfully cut their facial hair.  They followed the instructions to the letter, but the shaver still had trouble cutting the hairs at the corner of their jawlines.  That had to be touched up with  razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Maybe it&#x27;s just me,&amp;#34; one of them said, &amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the &amp;#34;Cool Tec&amp;#34; that Braun is boasting.&amp;#34;  They agreed that the shaver felt the same whether or not the &amp;#34;Cool Tec&amp;#34; was activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t like the stand, finding it  &amp;#34;....just weird and flimsy! I expected the parts of the stand to snap together to form a modestly solid structure.  Instead, two little rubber feet of one piece come to rest in a pair of shallow indentations on the other piece.&amp;#34;  Maybe Braun thought this would make the Shaver better designed for traveling.  If convenience is what Braun had in mind, then the power cord should be able to plug directly into the shaver.  Unfortunately, the power cord only plugs into the easily-dissembled stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the stand was questionably designed, they both like the shaver itself, saying it is very ergonomically designed.  Also, they like how quickly the shaver charges and is easily cleaned.  To do that, just pluck the top of the shaver off the body and remove the hair trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver was only modestly liked, they were impressed with the hair trimmer.  It did a fantastic job on their necks and side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher-end shavers do a better job of shaving and come with stands that don&#x27;t fall apart.  Like most electric shavers, the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver leaves the facial hair significantly longer than a razor.  All in all, the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver rates four out of five stars as a good, mid-range electric shaver., the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver rates four out of five stars as a good, mid-range electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The new CoolTec Razor from Braun is definitely the coolest electric razor I have ever owned.  You never get any razor burn sensation.  The CoolTec immediately starts working like a ice cube being slid across your face while shaving.  I used it with about three days growth and it worked quite well. Under the chin on the neck needed a little more care but I chalked it up to never having used a foil razor before.  Overall I am happy with it. To be honest I received this razor through a Braun give away, but it is still pretty cool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shaver. Shaves close. It weighs 9.8 ounces, which is significantly heavier than other shavers. Due to the cooling element, it is also a bit bulky. This can wear out your hand pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean. The cooling feature, which is supposed to help with razor burn, doesn&#x27;t really do anything but make your face cold. It seems to come on, even when you don&#x27;t have the switch turned on. It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge, and stays charged for about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not the best shaver I&#x27;ve used. I probably won&#x27;t pick it or one like it again.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec is amazing from the very first shave my skin irritation was cut in half and now I have none!! I would recommend this shaver to anyone with sensitive skin. Buy it its AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> In a program run by Braun, I was fortunate to trial the Braun CoolTec Solo shaver with a 3 stage cutting system.  It&#x27;s a pretty good shaver. Shaves close. It weighs 9.8 ounces, which is significantly heavier than other shavers. Due to the cooling element, it is also a bit bulky. This can wear out your hand pretty quickly.  The cooling technology is very pleasant and soothing as well. I did make sure to follow the recommended tips - short strokes holding the shaver at a right angle to the skin The CoolTec technology offers a pleasant sensation with no irritation while I shave - not afterward with aftermarket product - and does not require extra effort to maintain its performance integrity. I found that I prefer this 3 stage cutting system over another 3 stage, rotating head, system &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; as the results of the shave and time to execute are much better in each respect. If you are considering a shaver, consider this Braun product to get and feel the results a man desires.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and was curious if this would make my rosacea and facial redness worse. Surprisingly, this new technology has made shaving enjoyable.  I&#x27;m one week in from trying the Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver and my face looks better than the day I started using this new razor. The cooling technology helps the reduce the inflammation associated with shaving. I highly recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin or rosacea.  I received the razor to trial by a program run by Braun.</li>
    <li> This Braun Cool Tec men&#x27;s shaver gives the closest shave I have seen next to the Braun Pulsonic. It shaves just as close and is half the price. The unique feature about this shaver is that it has the cooling which is nice and soothing to the skin. I like that it can be used wet or dry. I prefer to use it in the shower and it is not designed to be used with shaving cream nor does it need it.  It is relatively quiet and hold the charge for a very long time. I have been using it every other day since I received it a month ago and have only recharged it once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased withy this razor overall. The cooling feature works very well and really does stop irritation. That&#x27;s been a good thing because in the problem areas I do have to spend a little more time shaving. Around my jaw line and neck area I end up doing the normal vertical strokes but then also some horizontal which does the trick. I switched to this razor from a lotion-dispensing rotary one so the technique is slightly different anyhow. I do really like the fact that my sensitive skin is taken care of without having to purchase the expensive lotion as well. It does also give a pretty close shave. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about as good as shaving with a blade - with the grain. My beard is light to medium.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave at all.</li>
    <li> great shaver! it&#x27;s cool when pushing the blue button ,it&#x27;s really really cool. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged guy, and like many people here, tried lots of electric and foil shavers in my 20+ years of shaving. I&#x27;ve owned several Braun foil shavers, and have always appreciated their build quality and durability, but the Cool Tec is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. The most high-end Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned before this was the Braun Activator 5 series shaver, which delivered a very close facial shave and acceptable neck shave. The Cool Tec beats my Activator hands down-particularly in the neck area. Not as good as a high quality blade shave, but really close. I also like the Cool Tec&#x27;s ergonomics-it is more narrow and easier to grip than my fat, rectangular Activator. The Cool Tec rear beard trimmer is a little small, but excellent at trimming side burns (the best trimmer I have used on an electric shaver). The Cool Tec is also a wet/dry shaver that can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the Cool Tec is easy.  You place the shaver on its&#x27; charging cradle, and the shaver&#x27;s power button emits a green blinking light.  When the shaver&#x27;s green light stops, your shaver is fully charged. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t plug your Cool Tec directly into a wall outlet with the charging cable if your shaver&#x27;s charge is low, but the charging process is fast.  I still have a Braun wet/dry shaver from 8 years ago that still charges in minutes and holds a charge, so I&#x27;m assuming this won&#x27;t be a problem with my Cool Tec.  I also think Braun is trying to avoid users from plugging their Cool Tec into wall outlets and foolishly taking a plugged-in shaver into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the main draw for this shaver is active cooling technology.  I thought the Cool Tec feature was gimmicky at first, but it does provide a refreshing, cooling sensation on your face while shaving.  You don&#x27;t have to use the cooling function-it&#x27;s activated by the light-up blue button in the middle of the shaver. Cleaning the Cool Tec is fast and easy-simply run the foil and cutting areaunder hot tap water and air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the Braun Cool Tec is a versatile German-made offering that delivers a great shave at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I tried electric shavers years ago and hated them, so I&#x27;ve been using a manual razor ever since. I had the chance to try out the Braun Cool Tec Shaver and it rocks. Now I know it will take a few days to weeks to get my face to adjust to the new shaver, however my first shave with it I was impressed with how close it got. I really love the \\&quot;cool tec\\&quot; feature that actually makes your face feel cool as you shave. I had thought it would be a gimmick, but it actually works and feels good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver I got does not have the automatic cleaning stand, but it cleans easily enough by running water over it and then letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY complaint I have is the charging stand it came with. The shaver has 2 metal contacts on the back of it and you have to place the shaver perfectly in the stand. When I first put it in apparently I had it off just a little and it never started charging. I tried a few more times and now it sits in everytime, but if you aren&#x27;t paying attention it&#x27;s possible you won&#x27;t put it on the cradle to charge properly.  (-1 star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shaver really is good, I like it and will be trying to go this route instead of manual. I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Tried the CoolTec shaver and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived from a Braun testing program.  The shaver feels well built as it does have more weight to it then preferred.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or just made of plastic and I&#x27;m sure I will adjust to the weight of the product. I used the shaver by itself on one half of my face.  It gets a good close shave and with its setup, it works well with side burns and goatee.  I then turned on the cooling option of the shaver and used it on the other half of my face.  You can definitely feel the coolness of the shaver and after about an hour I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation on either side.</li>
    <li> I was given a Braun Cool Tec from the company to try. I was skeptical at first because I thought the cooling technology was a gimmick. After trying the razor, it really helps get a closer shave without irritation. It leacves a cooling sensation on my face that feels nice. I have been very happy with the Braun Cool Tech. I have stopped using my other electric razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, close shave!</li>
    <li> Right up front, I must say that the Braun CoolTec reviewed here was provided via a program run by Braun; that said....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is top of the line. Great for my sensitive skin. No problems over chin/jawline. The cooling was the best...like I said...especially for my sensitive skin and *if* you live in a climate where the weather affects your skin. There is an alcohol cleaning system to eliminate germs...think \\&quot;infection control\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies~ the Braun&#x27;s the one your guy will thank you for. The tough guy&#x27;s sensitive. Treat him to this one.</li>
    <li> I really like the Braun °CoolTec Solo!  I received this electric shaver from a program run by Braun.  Once you push the &amp;#34;cooling button&amp;#34; it provides and instant cooling relief!  I thought it&#x27;d take a minute or so but nope, was pretty much instant.  Gives a close shave for an electric razor.  Almost as close of a shave as a straight razor!  It fits well in my hand and not too light or heavy.  The head pivots nicely as it goes over my face and adjusts well too.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I got it run through a promotion by Braun. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But it shaves great and the cooling effect is more than just a gimmick. It really does make for less irritation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well built razor that shaves good. The cooling effect is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> First off, don&#x27;t waste your money on the model that comes with the cleaning kit. The cartridges need to be refilled and the cleaning base isn&#x27;t worth the $30 increase in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to talk about the shaver. I&#x27;ve been purposely shaving my face to have scruff for the past 8 years because my skin is too sensitive to try to get a close shave with an electric razor. Every time I&#x27;ve tried out a new razor I&#x27;ve seen the same results -- breakouts and irritation on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cool Tec is a total game changer. From the very first shave it managed to yield smooth, close shaves while preventing irritation. The cooling feature is noticeable and effective, and shaving with this in the morning feels refreshing and easy. Since the Technology is paired with a series 3 razor you still have to make multiple passes, but doing so isn&#x27;t too difficult. This shaver made my face smoother than it has ever been since puberty -- that&#x27;s worth much more than the $100 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for Braun to release this feature on a series 5 (or even 7) razor, it would be even better!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I received this shaver through a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much enjoyed the cool bar on my skin.  It had an instant cooling effect that previous shavers have never had.  I also like that I can get it wet if needed in the shower.  And I have used Braun products in the past and I trust the quality of the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my previous shavers have all been floating head electric shavers (most recent shaver was a Philips 7310XL) and my facial hair must be too used to the floating heads because after a dozen uses I was still not able to get anywhere near as good of a shave with this shaver.  I have to go over the same area many more times than I&#x27;m used to having to do.  My three floating head shaver got me through a shave in 30 seconds and left me with a pretty complete shave.  To get the same effect with this shaver I have to spend multiple minutes to get the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, if you are happy with bar-type electric shavers, I would recommend this shaver.  In fact, I wish they would make a floating head shaver with the cool bar!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver. It does keep your skin cool, which prevents irritation. And yes, I do use it on my head.</li>
    <li> I had to wait until I was 55 years old for an electric razor to be developed that didn&#x27;t leave me with ingrown hairs!  Congratulations Braun...all your other shavers trimmed well but didn&#x27;t solve the ingrown hair problem.  Apparently it was the Cool Tech Technology that solved the problem.  Don&#x27;t know how the Hell it works, but you can feel the coolness of the blades as you shave.  Wow, I never thought I would live to use an electric razor for daily shaving.  Get one you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love it so much, a pretty cool shaver and so cheap.</li>
    <li> I really could sum this review up in about 1 sentence.  Pure heaven.  I received this electric razor to try via a program run by Braun.  The way my face felt while shaving with this Braun CoolTec is basically indescribable.  I have never heard of a razor with cooling abilities and I&#x27;m sad I&#x27;ve only learned about it now.  I really wish I had known about it sooner.  I got the best shave of my life with this electric razor by Braun.  My face got a smooth, close and cool shave.  I am a Norelco 3 floating head guy and I can honestly say that I have retired my Norelco and it will stay this way as long as my Braun lives; which I hope will be forever. There isn&#x27;t one bad thing I can say about this electric razor. 2  thumbs up Braun and thank you for giving me the opportunity to discover, try and fall in love with this razor!  You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am a man who has a routine and likes sticking to it, but when I got my box from BzzAgent and discovered the Braun CoolTech Solo (valued at $149) for free, I knew I had to give it a try. Shaving was always such a drag because I would spend hours having to get everything perfect only to find that after I was done, my face was red like a lobster and beyond irritated.&lt;br /&gt;The aluminum cooling bar is like no other razor because the cool feeling really feels great against the skin. After shaving my face in less than 10 minutes, compared to over an hour before, my skin had much less redness, and did not burn or feel irritated whatsoever. One of the top features for me was the fact that the 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade gave me a closer shave then I could have achieved with using my other electric shaver and then razor blade. It adapted to the shape of my face and I shaved with ease and no fear of cutting myself on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I thought another great feature to mention was the accessory charging station, which charged the Braun CoolTech Solo very fast and it lasted much longer than any brand I have used before. It was also very easy to clean and maintain. I look forward to many years of close shaves, less irritated skin and spending less time in the bathroom. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Braun CoolTech Solo for any man looking to revolutionize their shaving routines.</li>
    <li> the electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun. I have curly hair and am prone to shave bumps. I had high hopes for this razor but I was let down. It does stay cool which is great but it misses a lot of hair. It cuts some but leaves some. The battery is great. I have not had to recharge yet. Maybe if you don&#x27;t have curly hair it will work great for you.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the Braun shaver with cooling technology, that was said to help aid in keeping your skin from not burning when your done dry shaving. I have been using a Norelco shaver for 4-5+ years. I have never wanted to use anything else, but I decide to give Braun a try with their at home program. I have had the CoolTec Razor for about 2 weeks, and I can say that it has completely changed my view on what makes a great razor. I was amazed at how great the razor conformed to my face, and didn&#x27;t require me to bring out my old fashioned hand razor to pick up the stubble that my electric razor would usually leave behind. It was nice to have a razor that would work great on all parts of my face, and wouldn&#x27;t pull hair as well. The best part of the razor was the CoolTec technology, that aids in preventing skin irritation. I can say for a FACT that this thing works GREAT!! I was amazed at how a bit of cooling would help in keep the irritation down. I would usually shave in the shower, because the water would help keep my irritation down to a minimum. I can use this razor dry and have 0 irritation after shaving. It was quite fantastic experience, and I highly recommend it to everyone who shaves quite frequently. The cooling factor will definitely aid in helping to minimize your skin irritation. For all those men out there that battle with skin irritation, put down your aftershave and pick up this Braun CoolTec Razor!! This razor thing rocks!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo through a program run by Braun.  I was eager to try the CoolTec because of my experiences with irritated skin after using electric shavers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give the shaver the best test I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days.  Overall I would say the shaver is ok.  Above my jawline the shave was great, very smooth and the cooling effect keep my skin from being irritated.  My neckline was a different story.  The shave was cool, but following the contour of my jaw and getting a close shave on my neck isn&#x27;t what I got.  Even after tugging and stretching my next to give the shaver a flat surface it still missed spots on my neck.  However, even after going over those spots multiple times which would typically cause horrible irritation my neck remained irritation free which was a relief since the shave wasn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line as promised the shaver left me irritation free although the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I wanted.</li>
    <li> When I first turn on the shaver it feels like I was shaving on a regular electric shaver. On the other hand when I pressed the blue button with a picture of a snow flake the whole experience started to change second by second. The blades feels as though it is cleaning my skin and the blades are starting to get cold and it is relaxing my skin. The shaver is amazing because in the beginning I was thinking there is no way that this will work but after I tried it I knew I was wrong. I never saw anything like this before and you have to experience to get the feeling. After I pressed the cooling button I feel my skin getting cool as though it applied shaving creme and after shave on me but without me doing a single thing but just press the button. I feel as though they put something in it and this is a much better shave then applying the shave creme  and after shave by myself because I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation in my skin at all. The shaver cut my beard close to the skin but the good thing is it won&#x27;t cut your skin. I would recommend this shaver to any age men out there because it is a simple shaver to use and is good shaver that will leave your skin cool and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is very good  Worth buying  Together with a very cold  There is no uncomfortable feeling</li>
    <li> I always wait a little while after using something before giving a review, but I&#x27;ve been using the Cool Tec shaver for about 3 weeks now (I got the shaver through a program run by Braun), and I think I can accurately identify the positives and negatives of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives - It&#x27;s hard to identify what benefit, exactly, the cooling strip has, but it feels nice as immediate cooling when you&#x27;re shaving. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I feel like it is helping my skin (even if I can&#x27;t define why). The trimmer on the back also does an admirable job of defining edge lines, although I&#x27;ve only used it to set the line at the bottom of my side burns - the divider between hair and shaving area. Also, it is rather easy to clean, which is an extra little time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, it does a great job of trimming hair on the first or second pass, especially on everything above the neck. As I have sensitive skin, this is important to me, because (and this is a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past) multiple passes over the same area tends to aggravate the skin. The dual-foil setup of the razor helps with the contours on my face. On everything below the neck (and this is detailed in the negatives), the razor did a good job of getting hair that grows in the direction that it is supposed to. It did a good job going over the jaw line, which I&#x27;ve previously found to be a problem with foil razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives - If you&#x27;re traveling, using the cooling strip tends to burn the battery a little quicker than one would like. I found that I could get by a 3-day trip without having to recharge, but any more than that, and I&#x27;d need the charged as well (which isn&#x27;t that large or difficult to travel with, just an extra thing to bring), I actually checked the manual on this, and it tells you the same (the razor kills the battery much more quickly with the cool strip on), but I enjoy the cool strip enough that I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this may just bethe way that I hold the razor, I find that I frequently bump the button for the cooling strip, constantly turning it on and off. That&#x27;s probably just the way I hold the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other negative with this product is the same I&#x27;ve had with all foil razors - if your hair (especially on your neck) doesn&#x27;t all go in the same direction, you need multiple passes over the same area to get the hair in the direction in which it grows. I don&#x27;t want to blame this particular product for it, more so the style of product, but this one did not offer any improvement over the other foil razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I enjoy this razor, and am continuing to use it (despite having to make an extra couple of passes on the &#x27;trouble&#x27; spots on my neck). The cooling sensation plus the easy cleaning makes it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Braun included me in a promotion to try out Braun Cool Tec shaver and give my honest opinion. Very impressed. I am a Norelco fan and have been for years. After using the Braun Cool Tec 4 times now already (I typically shave a couple times a week), I am a fan now. I never really had too much problems before with irritation, only once in a while, but with Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec I don&#x27;t see how I ever will again.  It&#x27;s optional to use the cooling and it definitely soothes the skin great without redness. The shaver is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge. It holds the charge pretty long too. I typically dry shave with electric shavers so I am used to these kinds. After using it a few times I can honestly say it gave a clean shave equal to my Norelco.  So, in my opinion, if anyone is looking for a good shaver, easy to use, has very sensitive skin, ok with dry shaving and ok with the price, I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received this electric shaver via a marketing program with Braun. I am not a fan of electric razors. They never cut close enough for my facial hair type and how quickly it grows. I was glad when I got to try one out for free. Out of all the types I used, this one worked the best. It still had to take a regular razor and take care of the stubble on the thicker areas of my face. I gave it a try a few more times and tried to be daily with its use but I still had to take a razor to it. I guess electric razors are not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a friend instead who has finer and lighter facial hair growth. He loves it. It takes care of all his stubble and it is the best electric razor he has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the cooling features on the razor. It felt really god to hit the button and have the heads turn ice cold for a nice comforting shave.</li>
    <li> So I received my razor through a Braun promotion so I thought I would give it a try.  I typically stay clear of all electric razors due to them not giving me a smooth face.  Usually I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 11 am whenever I use an electric.  Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec did a fantastic job giving me a nice clean shave.  I also have very sensitive skin and have to usually go through a process every time I shave with both electric or standard razor.  So my hope was that this razor would be different but alas it was not.  My face still got pretty beat up and the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; factor seemed more like a gimmick than anything else.  All in all if you want a close clean shave and don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin then this razor is for you.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor my whole life and picked up the Cool Tec through a Braun promotion.  I have to say that I really liked the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feature of this razor.  The cold strip on the razor head did feel soothing on my face and made for a comfortable shave.  That said, I found it hard to get a close shave and I spent more time shaving as I had to run over my beard several times to get it all shaved.  All in all, the face cooling features felt great but the closeness of the shave left something to be desired.</li>
    <li> have had this terrible shaver for five months. Despite cleaning it regularly with their recommended cleaning station, it slowly breaks down. Nothing you can do about it. First the cooling function stopped working. The shave was never really that great so if the cooling doesn&#x27;t work either what&#x27;s the point of the price here. Finally a couple weeks later I came home to find the shaver sitting in its cradle charging and in the on state. It simply would not turn off!! I removed from the charging cradle and I pressed and pressed and pressed the power button but it would NOT turn off. Must be terribly cheap components inside. It continued to stay on until the batteries drained. Charging it again made it turn on again and could not be turned off. At least it was quiet then, or so I thought. Then it had fits and starts of a loud sudden on that lasted about ten seconds at a time, then would shut off again for a few minutes (like the batteries still had some juice left). Happened all night. Had to move to a closet and shut the door so I could get quiet for sleep. Their service is terrible and there&#x27;s no way for me to shave while trying to get this fixed by the company. Their tech support is horrible. Simply a terrible product. Will be looking toward a different shaver. Never buying Braun again.</li>
    <li> I received Braun CoolTec though a Braun promotion. Overall, I&#x27;m not happy with the razor. I only shave about twice a week so my facial hair tends to be a little longer. My hair is also rather thick. This razor really pulled on the hair but did not give me a smooth shave. I did notice the cooling features and thought it felt nice on the my skin but that does not make up for the overall performance. I usually shave dry but tried this in the shower wet and did not notice any improvement in performance. I quickly switched back to my previous Braun electric razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo through a special program run by Braun.  I waited a few weeks, giving my face a chance to develop a decent beard and this morning, I ran this razor through a serious challenge.  I started by using the trimmer to cut most of the hair.  This was a minus.  The trimmer was too small for that task.  However, for normal &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; work, it would be just fine.  Next, I activated the chiller and started shaving.  I thought it would be cheesy, but it felt REALLY nice to have that cooling sensation while shaving.  That&#x27;s a plus.  As far as the shave part went, I would give the razor a 95% for the cheeks (most of it was as close as a blade shave) and an 85% for the neck.  It got most of the hair, except for a few strays.  For going from a full beard to a clean shave, it did pretty well.  I&#x27;d give it a 90% for that task.  On a daily or regular basis, it would probably score better.  This is coming from a blade user!  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use some of the other exciting features, like the cleaning or wet rinse, but that part will be nice.  I was a little bummed that I HAD to charge it and couldn&#x27;t just plug it in directly.  But ultimately, not a big deal; it charges really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked using it and give it a 4.5 star.  For an electric razor, it&#x27;s pretty darn cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months now, so I feel like I can give it a decent review. Usually I go for the razors with 3 circular heads instead of the &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; style that this has, but I was provided this razor for free through a program run by Braun.  This razor has some definite positives and negatives in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shave is pretty close.  It does a decent job of getting most of the shorter hairs trimmed down to skin level.  On the other hand, longer hairs tend to need SEVERAL passes before they get trimmed.  The ads on the box/in the booklet say that it has a special area to get the longer hairs, so perhaps I am just bad at using the razor.  I feel like I would need to use the sideburn trimmer to get those cut down before the normal razor part would get them.  I&#x27;m not talking inch long hair here, I&#x27;m talking maybe quarter inch (ish) hairs.  Speaking of the attached trimmer...  It does a good job of cutting, but its position on the razor made it difficult to see where I was trimming easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the main selling point of this razor is the cooling bar, I imagine.  It certainly does cool.  It gets pretty cold.  I was skeptical that it would make a difference in regards to irritation, but it does seem to.  The cooling effect is immediately felt as you start to shave.  It doesn&#x27;t get to the point of making you shiver, but it gets noticeable cooler.  It does have a switch to turn off the cooling if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some general items, unrelated to shaving: The battery seems to last a long time on this razor. I&#x27;ve only really charged it twice, and it is still going strong.  The charger is like a cradle.  It takes up a good deal of real estate on the sink, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged often, so that can usually be hidden away.  I do think you can simply charge it with the cable instead of using the cradle, so that may be a better idea if you have limited space. This razor is very heavy compared to my last one; It sounds more powerful than the last one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically, this razor does a decent job of shaving your face.  It does a good job cooling it too.  The razor helps keep irritation down.  But, it is a bit heavy, and the head doesn&#x27;t seem to be as face-friendly as a 3 circle headed razor.  I had a bit of trouble getting it to get into the contours of my face.  As long as you shave frequently, keeping the hair short, I think you will probably be Ok with this razor.  In the future, I will probably stick with the 3-headed style razor as long as my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo Shaver via a sponsored program run by Braun. After using it every day or every-other day for the past month, I found myself liking it more than my Norelco 81 series electric razor that served me for a solid 7 years. The cooling bar on the shaver is a very helpful feature that really improved my overall experience. I have sensitive and dry skin that generally tends to get red and irritated with electric razors, and with the cooling feature activated this didn&#x27;t seem to be the case. So that was great. Also nice was the edge razor &amp;#34;attachment&amp;#34;. It was sturdy and effective at trimming my sideburns with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I mentioned in the title, I don&#x27;t think the performance of 2-piece head of the Braun CoolTec was as efficient and effective as the 3-piece razor head of my old Norelco. It took a bit longer to get rid of some of those peskier hairs particularly on my neck and cheeks, but I think also I&#x27;m not used to the 2-piece configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nice things about the Braun CoolTec compared to my old razor and others I&#x27;ve seen was the waterproofing (really nice for people who like their things to be clean, like me), and the ease of cleaning the actual razor parts (again due to the waterproofing and also the ease of detachment of the actual blade cartridge). The charge holds pretty well, too - it lasted about 10 uses of an average of 2-3 minutes each, with the cooling feature on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I think this shaver is a great value for under $100, is especially helpful for people with irritable skin (like me), and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, great shaving performance.  Cooling bar is a little gimmicky but pleasant on the skin.</li>
    <li> Yeah.. for the price-- can&#x27;t complain. This is my first one ever and i am likin&#x27; it a lotttt... pleasantly surprised ... I recommend you shave before you shower - it is more precise on dry skin than wet.</li>
    <li> I received my Braun CoolTec Solo Shaver several months ago through a program run by Braun. I&#x27;ve used a variety of both electric and manual shavers and this definitely has the least facial irritation of any of them. Even when trimming down from over an inch of facial hair, my face avoided most of the irritation that it often experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is an electric shaver, it tends to do better with more common trimming. If you regularly only shave every few days or have heavy facial growth and are used to a manual shaver, plan on adjusting your schedule a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mentioned in some places, but as this is a sealed shaver, it is safe both for use in the shower as well as that you can clean it off by rinsing it in the sink. This means that even after a heavy shave, you can rinse all of the bits clean without major fuss. This is a major improvement over my prior electric razor, which needed to be brushed and had beard dust that was almost impossible to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver that will serve me well for those times when I need to stay clean faced. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a shaver that&#x27;s safe with water.</li>
    <li> Great close shave, the cooling feature stops teh razor burn, easy cleaning</li>
    <li> I still find it hard to shave my dementia conditioned husband, but I manage, although it takes a long time to get his face smooth.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old, I am very pleased with the new Braun shaver. Previously also used this type of shaver, but this has a lot of modern perfection, because goals as accurately as razor Doni pull his beard and I do not feel like the roughness of rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> I have a complexion that makes shaving with a blade all but impossible. Whenever I try, I wind up looking like hamburger. So I am forced to use an electric shaver. The problem is that I&#x27;ve never found one I really liked. Very few have lasted more than a year or so with me, as I grow discontented with them and (especially) the razor burn they cause. I&#x27;ve tried all shapes and kinds: round ones, flat ones, foil ones; American ones, German ones, Scandinavian ones, on and on. Among that extensive experience with electric shavers are several made by Braun. Now when I was growing up, Braun was considered the highbrow of home electronics (Braun and Siemens, anyway). But no Braun shaver ever pleased me, and I include in that number their fairly recent self-cleaning-and-lubricating model that gave an indifferent shave, took up too much space on the dresser, and was expensive to maintain with its drug cocktail neeing to be replaced every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus I approached this latest Braun with less than high hopes. But I was wrong. And seldom have I been as glad to say that I was wrong. This shaver is marvelous! It delivers a blade-close shave with **no razor burn**. For the first time in years, I now can shave only once a day in the morning, even if I&#x27;m going out that night. There&#x27;s no dragging, tugging, or burning. The cutting head is a foil model, with three levels of cutters, making even the thorniest hair easy to cut. Plus there&#x27;s an extra kicker here: there&#x27;s a bar in the middle of the shaver head. \\&quot;What&#x27;s this?\\&quot; I wondered. Well, it keeps the shaver head cool on the face. (And if you don&#x27;t want it during the chilly winter months, you can turn it off.) That&#x27;s a really nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of other good features here. The battery life is reasonable (I have to recharge about twice a month). And it has a warning light that tells me when to recharge.  It&#x27;s a wet/dry model, so you can use it in the shower if you wish, and it cleans up under the faucet. The trimmer is a pop-up model (thank goodness not a separate attachment which I always seem to misplace when I need it). It&#x27;s about ¾ of an inch wide--not as wide as I&#x27;d like but a bit more than average nowadays. It seems to work fairly well in trimming my sideburns. This model comes with a nifty little stand that keeps the shaver handily on the dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There is an optional stand you can buy that keeps the razor clean and lubricated. But I had one of those in a previous-model Braun and didn&#x27;t like it: too bulky in design and expensive to maintain. So I&#x27;m just fine with this little one, thank you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe you will be pleased with this model. If you have the shaving problems I have, I suggest you give it a try.

    <li> cool part of shaver worked, but as far as the shave, nothing special. series 7 much better razor.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver.  I can get just as close a shave as I do using gel and a manual razor but with no skin irritation (which I think is due to the cooling bar).  5 stars because it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Cool tec is something amazing.</li>
    <li> A shaver has only one real purpose, of course, to buzz away the stubble on your face (and possibly elsewhere, but I am not reviewing particular scenario).  I&#x27;m a Braun shaver fan, and I&#x27;ve used one model or another for decades.  However, for the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Norelco 1250X SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor.  The Norelco is fabulous in my book, so I want to compare this Braun model ( Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver) with the Norelco 1250X SensoTouch.  How?  I alternated days using them, plus I would shave one side of my face with one model, and the other side with the other, and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun model as a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; razor hum, albeit a bit more mellow than most.  The Norelco is much less noisy, if that is an issue.  Both give a fine shave, although the Braun required more time to catch those difficult hairs that always seem to get missed in the regular passes.  I definitely found myself pressing harder with the Braun than with the Norelco.  Fundamentally, however, I have to admit the final result was pretty similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun features a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; system, and the razor head certainly feels cool.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a feature that means anything to me.  This may be a significant feature to others, especially if you have a sensitive skin that feels like it is burning during a shave.  The Norelco feels like a facial massage, so the heat build up just isn&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For both razors, I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t plug the razor into an outlet directly; you have to use a holder.  This is just another thing you have to bring along if you are traveling, and if you forget it, you won&#x27;t be able to recharge.  I know this to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the costs of these two shavers, the Braun is the better deal.  However, even owning both, I will continue to use the Norelco.  If it goes bad, I have no problem pulling the Braun out of the drawer and making it my workhorse.  I may not need the cooling function, but it still provides a close, dependable shave.cooling function, but it still provides a close, dependable shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Braun and have been very happy with the results.  Not thrilled with the weight, but the shave is great, and the active cooling feature actually works surprisingly well...my old razor I used to have to stop for a minute or run it under water so as to cool it down.  I&#x27;ve had good results with Braun razors in past, and this one is no different; I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I received my CoolTec Solo yesterday and charged it according to the directions. I received my shaver through a test program by Braun. I&#x27;m starting off with a positive for the Braun CoolTec Solo. This is a very nice shaver that as you shave it cools the skin, and I mean really cools the skin. This shaver drops in temperature and that allows the unit to cool the skin as you shave which for me prevents irritation from using electric shavers. Here is a kind of negative. On my cheeks where my hair is fine it shaves to the skin and is very smooth, but under my neck the hair is very coarse and the shaver has a harder time cutting all the hairs. A mesh screen that had holes slightly larger holes could possibly fix that. The build quality is very nice. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that shaves and will continue to use it but would like it to accommodate my coarser hair. That one drawback is why I rate it a four star and not a five.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very surprised so far with Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec. Not a huge fan of electric razors, but my skin felt fantastic while shaving with this and my face is less irritated that with previous shavers. Brauns campaign has given me hope for electric razors and think I will shave my beard by the end of November to try a full shave!</li>
    <li> I used Braun CoolTec though a Braun promotion and I wasn&#x27;t a fan. Fairness in conversation, I struggle with most electric shavers and find very few that work for my skin sensitity and thickness of facial hair. I have very thick hair and the Braun Cooltec pulled hairs rather than shaved them. Even when using the cooling button it stilled caused irritation on my skin. I did like the feel of the razor and the design but ultimately I passed it on to my cousin.</li>
    <li> Definitely not a gimmick.  Most other electric shavers give me bad razor burn and irritation.  This one doesn&#x27;t, i&#x27;m not sure if its the cooling factor or just the razor itself but it works.  Shave is close and the beard trimmer actually works.  Cleaning is a breeze, just run it under water and let it air dry.  I&#x27;ve used it every day since i received the free unit from BRAUN as a part of a trial program.</li>
    <li> I had been waiting for the newest technology to come out and was excited when Braun finally came out with something new.  I have tried everything over the years, from Panasonic to Phillips to manual to Braun (including their Series 7) but struggled to find something that was great.  I have been using an older Braun in recent years (8000 series with Series 3 Combi 30b replacement foil), and it&#x27;s been ok, but I get a lot of irritation/redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, after 3 weeks, while the cooling sensation is a good idea, the performance of the shave is noticeably worse than what I had before.  I have to go over the same area multiple times in order to get it reasonably close, but even then I had to pull out my old shaver often.  The cooling effect had a subtle, if any, effect on my irritation, although it probably could have been better if I didn&#x27;t have to repeatedly shave the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Decent price (I was able to get it $80-90 on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;- Cool Tec sensation can get as cold as ice, which feels nice and may have (minor) benefit for irritation/redness&lt;br /&gt;- Can rinse with water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Unacceptable shave (not close enough) -- both missed hairs and not short enough&lt;br /&gt;- Wide two-part foil is awkward for challenging places, like neck and above lip, and it does not pivot like my other shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Cooling button is big and placed poorly so that can mistakenly turn off this feature&lt;br /&gt;- Cooling can take more than 10 seconds to kick in after turning on&lt;br /&gt;- Charging station is awkward -- short cord and has to be done at an angle.  Also, shaver can easily not be touching charging prongs.  I preferred system with my other shaver where I can connect directly with (long) cord.&lt;br /&gt;- No protection case like my other Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish they added the cooling feature to one of their other shavers that works better rather than this disappointing new product.  Fortunately, Braun has a 60 day money-back guarantee, although it will cost me $10 in return shipping.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Cool Tec Solo Shaver as part of a promotion from Braun.  The Cool Tec has replaced my Braun 5610 electric razor.  As a daily shaver, I like the closeness that the Solo Shaver provides.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I received a Braun Cool Tec Solo thru a program run by Braun.  After using this product for a few weeks,  I am quite satisfied with the results.  I really appreciate the cooling bar as it seems to really keep my skin cooler and reduce irritation.  I really like that I can use it in the shower or dry at the sink so there is quite a bit of versatility there.  My skin is usually red and itchy following shaving but with the Cool Tec, that did not happen. I didn&#x27;t need to use any shaving products with this razor.  It fits my face quite well and does a great job of shaving without needing an extra trimmer.  I also liked the feel in my hand - it fits very well.  I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from shaving irritations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use a Braun shave before, a long time ago, in that time they&#x27;ve update their electric razors to include \\&quot;cool tec\\&quot;, what that simply means is that instead of your shaver getting hot while you shave and irritating your skin a cool bar that runs between the two shaver heads keeps it cool on your skin. Braun has designed a cooling technology that is built into the shaver&#x27;s head. At first it feels like a cool brisk sensation, it&#x27;s different for sure. Braun shavers, I think, are the Porches&#x27; of the electric shaver. You can opt out of using the cool button but after you&#x27;ve tried it once it&#x27;s hard to stop using it. Although most shavers &#x27;learn&#x27; your whiskers and eventually become your electric straight razor I found that this Braun gave me a good shave the first time out. I&#x27;ve used Norelco for a number of years and I&#x27;ve become a fan but I&#x27;m a fair weather fan at that, just like technology updating every few years it probably good to update your shaver every few years as well. I usually press down pretty hard on my face to get a close shave but this Braun wasn&#x27;t tough on my face afterwards. If you are looking for a gift for the man in your life this is a good electric razor, don&#x27;t just get it for the guy who has everything, get it for the guy who has everything to gain. I must also mention that I received the shaver via a program run by Braun.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver as a BzzAgent. It was easy to set up and had frustration free packaging. I gave it a few seconds when turned on to cool prior to my using it. The first thing I noticed before even putting it on my skin, is that this razor is substantially heavier than past and current electric shavers I have used and are on the market. This may not bother others, but it is heavier to hold which could be a bit awkward to maneuver and could cause wrist problems due to the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling technology is a nice addition when you can actually feel it. The chilling plate is in the middle so you don’t always feel it when detailing your hair, but did provide a cool shave that was noticeable when doing an overall shave (not detailing around a goatee or lining up around a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important aspect to me is the closeness of the shave. As a military man who’s been deployed, I have had to shave in all conditions and situations because we still have to stay clean shaven. Would this razor work in that situation? Yes. However, in my day-to-day life, I prefer a smooth shave when I rub my hand in any direction. Unfortunately, the shave wasn’t as close as a wet shave with disposable razors or blades. I can generally feel smooth in all directions while the dry shave with this razor left minor stubble I prefer not to have. It was difficult to shave my jawline and neckline. The shave was cool, but trying to shave on the contour of my jaw and neck, it was near impossible to get a close shave. I would tug my skin in multiple directions to give a flatter surface for the razor, but it would still miss spots even with running over it multiple times. If in a hurry, this will be great except it really isn’t that quick when you have to go over areas several times. If wanting to make my best impression, this would not be my first choice. While much quicker than lathering up, filling a sink, slowly shaving, rinsing, and more in the old school process, the results just can’t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is my personal opinion and experience. If you&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric shaver for a long time, then the closeness of an actual razor may not be what you desire. However, my wife and I like the smooth, stubble-free closeness.</li>
    <li> This shaver really does what they say. I shave twice a day and the shaver is always cold on my face preventing razor burn. It holds charge for more than a week. I have a Norelco shaver that is less than a year old and my Braun CoolTec is 100 times the better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Braun</li>
    <li> can not shave clearly, especially the jaw!</li>
    <li> I have tried about 6 different electric beard trimmers/shavers, and this one is the best. I received this product from a Braun program to try out. All the previous shavers I tried always left my face feeling irritated and raw. Those other shavers were well known brands in the trimmer/shaver space as well. The Cool Tec Solo Shaver&#x27;s cool feel function is what makes it feel less irritating. The shaver also does a real good job of shaving, although I still found myself stretching my face&#x27;s skin more with this than I would have with a normal wet shaver to get that close shave. The shaver has a real premium feel and heft to it. The only real con I can think of is the battery life. When the cool feel function is on the battery&#x27;s duration drops from roughly 45 minutes to 15 minutes, meaning only 2-3 shaves at most before putting it to recharge.As someone who prefers a wet shave I still find this a great alternative to wet shaving that leaves your face feeling much better than the other electric shavers out there.</li>
    <li> This shaver is outstanding!!&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly and the cooling tech&lt;br /&gt;Thing is no gimmick!  Excellent product at a very decent price</li>
    <li> Good shaving and the feeling of cool metal is awesome.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave!  No burn afterward, very impressed!</li>
    <li> OUT OF THE BOX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box you&#x27;ve got the shaver, two pieces of plastic that form the charging stand, and the power cord. Other than the instruction manual, there isn&#x27;t much else in the box. The first step is to simply attach the plastic parts together so you can charge the shaver. The power cord plugs directly into the stand so the shaver can rest in there and charge via the metal contacts. This is the only way to charge the shaver, it must be in the dock. That can be somewhat inconvenient if used for extended trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saver itself is basically a mid-range foil shaver in terms of features and functionality. It&#x27;s a tad bulky and on the heavy side for most shavers in this class. It has 2 separate foils that are spaced apart due to the middle \\&quot;cooling bar\\&quot; and cutting system. The shaver is straight as can be, no angle or adjustments. The foils of course move up and down for some movement, but it is limited in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a power button and of course, the blue snow-flake to enable cooling functionality. At the back you have a basic trimmer. It opens upward into a locked position allowing for forward and backward movement, without closing. Although the blades are very short and actually angle backwards, which can limit it&#x27;s usefulness. There is no cleaning system with this unit, but the foil pops off making cleaning about as easy as it gets for this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my shave without washing my face and at 90 degree angles, as directed. They&#x27;ve made it very clear you shouldn&#x27;t wash your fast before the shave as I suspect it can prevent a smooth shave. And the 90 degree angle would be required since the head doesn&#x27;t move and is stuck in one position. I started without the cooling function on one side and it went as expected. Then switched on the cooling for the other side. First, that cooling bar gets rather cool very quickly. It basically feels like a cold metalbar going across your face. It&#x27;s a rather odd sensation at first. My infrared thermometer was indicating around 68 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as is expected with most mid-range shavers, they just don&#x27;t do quite as good of a job as the higher-end models. Essentially requiring more passes over the same area that others went through much easier. Despite this, once I was done, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice there was slightly less irritation, as my skin can be somewhat sensitive. And at the end of the shave, my face is smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Cooling bar actually works&lt;br /&gt;+ Dual foil system&lt;br /&gt;+ Water proof&lt;br /&gt;+ Lockable trimmer&lt;br /&gt;+ Li-Ion Battery&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to manually clean&lt;br /&gt;+ Dock for easy charging&lt;br /&gt;+ Smooth shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not cheap&lt;br /&gt;- No head adjustment&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat Bulky &amp; Heavy&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t charge without dock&lt;br /&gt;- Short, limited trimmer blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that my most recent shavers are the Braun 790 and Panasonic ES-LV81-K shavers. While these are much more expensive units, I am of course taking into consideration the price and functionality compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers decades, so I&#x27;ve gone through a few. With all that considered, and despite my skepticism, I did find the cooling technology to actually work. I&#x27;m quite happy with the shave, which says a lot considering it&#x27;s competition. If you have a good shaver, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s awesome enough to buy a new one. But if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade and are interested in trying something just a little different, I consider this one recommended.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was a skeptic when I read the info on this shaver. To me, it sounded like gadgetry gone amok, and I had doubts that active cooling on the shaving head would in any way enhance a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I was wrong. After one shave I was sold. The shaving head is perceptibly cold, and it gives the perception of a more comfortable shave. In fact I REALLY liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed shaving with Braun Electric Razors for the last 10 years, and must say that this razor takes shaving comfort to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one question in my mind would be whether to purchase this Braun, or the similar Braun model with the cleaning base, that cleans and lubricates the razor after each shave. The last two Braun&#x27;s I have had have the cleaning base, and I will admit I have come to enjoy the comfort of a freshly cleaned and lubricated razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my bottom line is I LOVE this razor, but if you can afford it, I would suggest considering the version of this model that has the cleaning/lubrication base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product, and another in a long line of great Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> This is a close cutting razor that compares well to the best shavers I have tried. I&#x27;m not sure about the cooling mechanism. Cooling isn&#x27;t really something I thought I needed when shaving. Plus it diminishes battery power by two-thirds. For my money I would just prefer to prolong the charge and not use the cooling feature.  The charger has a very small footprint which is nice while storing in a bathroom with limited space. The base assembles easily by inserting the plug-in cord. The shaver balances nicely in the hand and can be used in the shower but I am not sure why that is necessarily a plus since I just use a [[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Razor]] without shaving cream while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing with a shaver is that it give a close shave and this shaver does that without pulling or tugging at your stubble. The head of this comes off in one piece. I have actually had shavers that when you took the head off for cleaning several pieces fell out. Very irritating! But this is all of one piece and looks like it will be fairly easy to dust off. It comes with a small brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband who has been using it everyday for two weeks now and loves it. He has very sensitive skin with hair that grows as it pleases and pretty much everything makes him break out. So far this razor has done exactly as it promised and he has yet to have any irritation at all.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good,make a good job,better than the else i used before,fast and easy to use .i like it .</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for several years. It is important to clean any brand shaver frequently to get an excellent shave. The ease of cleaning is one of the aspects I look for and receive with Braun shavers. The Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver delivers an excellent shave, cleans fast and the pop-up trimmer works better than their other models. I only wish the cord plugged directly into the shaver, so that traveling did not require bringing the charging unit. Other Braun models plug directly into the shaver.</li>
    <li> Beard cut very well, but many times; Cold function very well.</li>
    <li> Good product.I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this. Shaver it is very nice to have the cooling bar. I was able to get this shaver from a program Braun was running it it was very good. It is a very nice shave and gets right down to the skin and the bar keeps skin irritation at bay. All in all I loves this product and use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a promotion from Braun.  It was a little difficult to figure out how to charge the razor until I read the instruction book.  First time I used it, I was very happy.  The shave was great.  I can&#x27;t wait until the summer to have that cold shave.  It will feel great.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have been able to use on my neck. Usually I have to use a disposable razor to shave my neck because it makes my skin so irritated and red.  I did receive this  electric shaver via a program run by Braun.  I think it is the cooling features that did not cause my neck to get red and bothered. It also provided a very close shave. I do not shave every day so it made it so I could go a  couple of days in between shaving which was nice. It does a lot better with a days growth than 2 days growth&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Loved the cooling feature- Really helped cut  down on razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Charged super fast&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in the shower-  not so useful to me but could be for someone else&lt;br /&gt;Travel lock  feature- no more having my razor going off in my check on bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Heavy - it weighs alot - sturdy  but heavy&lt;br /&gt;Fills big in your hand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I would highly recommend this shaver.  For the price it is a winner and I loved that it worked on my neck and that it have such a close shave.</li>
    <li> dont expect close shave</li>
    <li> I was given the Braun Cooltec Solo electric shaver through a program run by Braun. Now, I normally do not shave and in fact when I received the Cooltec Solo I hadn&#x27;t trimmed my beard in months and it was now over 2in in growth. My plan was to make it into a goatee and I wondered if the Cooltec Solo would be able to do the job. The long hair trimmer did a fine job of trimming the beard back and the fine details around my lips and ears. The shaver has the ability to cool the razor via an aluminum bar that sits between the 2 rows of blades and is able to be turned off if desired. The unit cools these blades and metal screen very quickly. So quickly in fact that it felt almost instantly chilled to me and was quite nice. Once I was done shaving I had no skin irritation and a sweet goatee. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> As part of a promotion from Braun, I got to try out this new electric shaver. I am amazed at how quickly and cold the little bar gets. It did in fact leave behind no irritation and seem to leave a pretty smooth face. Still not quite as smooth as blade shaving leaves, but again, not many electric shavers do. The look of it is quite sleek with the matte rubber grips and smooth polished black body. Placing it in it&#x27;s included charging dock is as simple as it gets. I use a blade and shaving cream more often, but will use this when traveling or don&#x27;t feel like making a mess with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> What a COOOOOOOOOOL idea.  Itried the product for free via a program run by Braun. I had seen this product in the stores for a while and was wondering if it helps. I can tell you that I used another national brand and I always got red blotches on my neck no matter what I did, shave dry, shave wet or use pre shave nothing helped till now. The key is to turn it on and the snowflake and let it run for 30 seconds. Now the bar is ice cold and it makes a world of difference. The shave has good weight to it and seems well made. I did get the cleaning base too and that is a pretty cool idea too. Insert, press the button and it cleans its self. I am a BRAUN  COOLTEC man for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Normally I switch between a electric razor and a blade razor and have the problem of fighting the hairs, but this electric razor is far advanced in my opinion. Where I still had the occasional issue it was far better than most, all, I have tried. If you typically use an electric razor, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec razor started off slow for me as the razor I was using before this one was a lot lighter in weight. Once I used this razor for a few weeks the weight was not a factor anymore as you hardly notice it anymore. The cool technology helps on your face as someone like myself who must shave daily in the morning before work can frequently get razor burn due to the irratation, I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in razor burn since I&#x27;ve used this product and recommend this for all men who shave daily and can get irratated by razor burn.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver through a promotion from Braun an have been overall satisfied with its use. Receiving the shaver during &amp;#34;Movember&amp;#34; gave me plenty of time to get solid use out of the product and all it&#x27;s features. The device is very easy to handle and comfortable to hold and use, it charges quickly and keeps that charge for a good period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Tec feature is unique and worth the cost of the device. Previous devices I&#x27;ve used tend to heat up during use and irritate my skin but this feature makes the use of the device very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly (and probably most importantly) the shave; the styling feature is easy to use and helps to keep things clean and tidy. However, the main shaver didn&#x27;t seem to perform better than a typical electric shaver and although it does a sufficient enough job to get you out the door looking good it doesn&#x27;t get you as smooth as a razor and most times I could have gotten the job done with a razor in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice unit and with the Cool Tec feature something I&#x27;d use more often than not and would use over other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> The first few shaves I was impressed how smooth and with little irritation it left my face.. After that the irritation bumps on my neck were worse than any razor I&#x27;ve used before. However my face was smooth. So its kind of a catch 22. If you want to use separate razors for your face and neck then I would definitely recommend using Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver  for your face.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor since I was 13.  I really wanted the ease of the electric razor, but they used to tear my neck up so bad that it looked like raw hamburger.  This Braun Cool Tec was given to me by Braun as part of a marketing campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its Cool Tec technology, I no longer have to deal with it tearing up my neck.  It is amazing how cool the metal is and keeps me feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing Movember and my first time to really use it (not just for trimming) was a doozy of a job.  It was good at shaving, but did not get a close shave.  Had to bust out the Mach 3 to finish it off. Since then, I have tried it twice (don&#x27;t shave very often, I like a little scruff usually).  Both times I had to sure the Mach 3.  I am going to keep trying it out (maybe I am not doing it right).  If I get it to do a closer shave, it will get a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I learned I would receive this CoolTec Solo shaver through a special Braun program.  Before this razor, I was using a lower-priced Norelco and I was beginning to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about how the aluminum cooling bar would feel but it did a great job in preventing the razor burn that I normally experience with a new razor.  I have never used any lotions or products that many people choose to use and thankfully this razor works just right for me.  As the razor glides across your face, the cooling bar feels really great and prevents irritation.  I am thoroughly impressed with this razor so far and I am truly excited about how smooth my face is afterward.  Battery-wise, I am able to get about a weeks worth of shaves in on a single charge which has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has changed my opinion of electric razors that were not the traditional 3-head type and I would definitely recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> FYI, I received this product as a part of a promotion. I tend to have a thicker beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction. It&#x27;s made of plastic, but has an excellent weight to it and feels great in the hand. Looks nice, and has easy to use buttons. Charging dock is solid as well, and easy to use. Lasts for many uses on a single charge. The CoolTec feature significantly reduces razor-burn, and is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;While it does a decent job of bulk shaving, it requires multiple passes to get a uniform trim. I would honestly say it&#x27;s a trim, and not necessarily a shave, because it doesn&#x27;t get as clean a shave as the more pricey electric razors. Unfortunately, if you have to go to work everyday, having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in the morning might not cut it. I&#x27;m aware electric razors will never get as close of a shave as a blade, but the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t get close enough for a professional look for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the CoolTec has a very nice build quality, but I personally cannot use it for my daily shave because it just doesn&#x27;t leave me with a clean enough shave. I think it would work better for thinner hair, and maybe if a clean shave isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary. I will, however use it for casual days when I don&#x27;t want a thick beard, but am ok with a light amount of scruff, because it is probably the best feeling electric razor I have every used.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver through a program run by Braun. Let me start out by saying that I have never had good luck with electric shavers. I have always had horrible irritation after shaving, thus I have never owned one that I used very long. This razor was quite a surprise I must say. The cooling feature helped reduce irritation. I did find that in order to avoid irritation the least, you should shave every day.  My face felt smooth after each shave. I did not like that the razor was heavy. Overall, I was much more impressed with an electric razor than I had been in previous years.</li>
    <li> Just what it claims, cool to the touch.  I have used it twice now and where others leave razor burn, this one doesn&#x27;t.  I do wish it was a closer shave but it is quite acceptable.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a really good razor. Been using a blade for almost 3 years. It doesn&#x27;t shave as good as a lade but nothing will</li>
    <li> Seems to be all that it&#x27;s advertised to be. After 6 weeks of daily use, I am pleased with performance and quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Braun electric shaver for nearly a decade. I’ve been thinking about purchasing a new shaver, so when I had the opportunity to try the BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER, I couldn’t pass it up. The BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER does a great job at giving a close shave without giving any nicks or cuts. In fact, I was a little surprised at how close the shave was: I have had experiences with a Braun electric shaver in the past that I had to use a straight razor to clean-up the areas that the electric razor missed. Not so with the BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER: it provides a smooth shave that doesn’t leave any missed areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is solid and sturdy, but it isn’t so heavy to make it awkward to use. Visually, it’s also a bit more appealing than other electric shavers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standout feature of the BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER is the “cool tec” feature. By pushing a blue, snow-flake button on the shaver, the user engages the “cool tec” feature. The “cool tec” feature is the radiant coolness that the shaver gives to one’s skin as you shave. It’s a different sensation on one’s skin, but it does seem to help my skin from becoming irritated while using it. However, unlike other “Cool Tec” products from Braun, this shaver does not include an automatic cleaning stand. So, when you clean the shaver, you have to do it the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also includes a lock. This is nice because when you use it, it keeps the shaver from accidently coming on while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fully charged, the razor will last for about three weeks without having to be charged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER includes an electric charging stand, some cleaning oil, a small cleaning brush, and an instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the design and feel of the BRAUN COOL TEC MEN’S SOLO SHAVER. I also like the way it shaves. It is a bit pricey, but really is an electric razor worth owning &amp; using.a bit pricey, but really is an electric razor worth owning &amp; using.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Braun CoolTec razor through a test trial that was sponsored through Braun. It is one of the best razors I have used because of the cool bar technology which help prevent my face from breaking out. I have very sensitive skin and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a close shave without razor burn. I like to use straight razors because it is faster to shave but can get expensive. This is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Cool Tec&amp;#34; thing is technologically very impressive - there&#x27;s a reason you can buy a car with seat warmers, but not with seat coolers - but it comes with a cost.  Two costs, actually, one in dollars the other in weight - this shaver is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cooling effect to be totally and completely useless.  The shaver itself is unexceptional.  It seems to struggle with longer hairs - I think because the cooling element protrudes past the &amp;#34;long hair-catcher&amp;#34; part of the shaver.  I have a relatively inexpensive Panasonic electric shaver that I like much much better and have switched back to.  I think the secret to that shavers effectiveness is that the motor runs at a much higher speed - but I&#x27;m not sure.  Whatever the case is, this Braun shaver gives me razor burn (while simultaneously cooling my skin), takes much longer, and seems to ignore the facial hair in entire regions of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One area that really shines though is the charging aspect - the shaver charges quickly, comes with a brilliant charging station, beeps to let you know charging has begun and doesn&#x27;t wake you up in the middle of the night with annoying flashing LEDs to let you know &amp;#34;hey I&#x27;m done charging over here&amp;#34; like every other shaver I&#x27;ve owned inexplicably does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, phenomenal engineering on the cooling technology and the charging technology.  The shaving, not so much.</li>
    <li> This was a razor I received through a program through the Braun company.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used an electric shaver with 3 round revolving heads.  Therefore, I was curious about the differences when I received this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of shaving is average, though I have not had and rashes that  normally get as a result of shaving.  I could not feel the cool Tech part of the razor unless I pressed hard on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use tap water to clean the machine, which is what I normally do,so there is no need for me to have the auto clean part (which was not included in this instance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I place the razor in the charging stand, I hear a slight beepng noise that tells me it is getting charged.  I do sometimes have to place it in again if I don&#x27;t put the razor in just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special features I lke:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The travel lock (so t doesn&#x27;t start if accidently gets bumped).&lt;br /&gt;2.  The remommended clean with oil (and comes with oil)&lt;br /&gt;3.  Wet/dry feature (can use n the shower).</li>
    <li> I have now switched to an electric razor, and the Braun Cool Tec Solo Shaver helped me to do so.  I received this razor in a promotion run by Braun and was fairly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used disposable manual razors and shaving cream for 12 years, so the transition took some time.  It is different and one must shave daily to ensure a close shave and to prevent longer hairs being caught in the shaving mechanism.  The transition took approximately two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor performs well and gives a fairly close shave.  The cooling bar actually does get pretty cool and really makes the shaving experience better.  I probably would not have made the switch to electric without that bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver feels well built and should last for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;- The cooling bar feels nice against the skin and helps prevent irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean: Open and shake&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a good charge, even when using the cooling bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not as close as a manual razor, but I think this is true of electrics in general&lt;br /&gt;- The foil cover doesn&#x27;t sit perfectly on the razor</li>
    <li> I got this from a campaign by braun and all i have to say i could not be much more please. I am i person that always used straight razors but im glad i got the upgrade. Honestly, at first i though i would not care/ would not like the cooling effect that this razor provided. But oh did they prove me wrong! It is really good to have this run across my face in the morning before work and the simple fact that it&#x27;s feeling can not be beaten. The only complaint that i have on this razor is that the button may be a little finicky but i really have no other issue.</li>
    <li> Just started using it- it does feel cool!</li>
    <li> The best shaver I have found in keeping a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I relieved this shaver for free from a try program by Braun. I loved the idea of this shaver because I have even used ice cubes in the past to try and cut down on irritation. I was hoping for more from the shaver, but know others will love it. The cooling technology definitely gets cold! The only issue is the shaver, it still pulls and caused irritation. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly, but even following all direction didn&#x27;t help. I have to give a high review for the technology, but overall it wasn&#x27;t really for me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this shaver to be the holy grail, but I was not wowed.  It didn&#x27;t shave my problem areas as close as my old shave system.  Based on 3 weeks of use, I still go over my neck with my old Remington.  Just doesn&#x27;t make the grade in my book.</li>
    <li> What I love about this razor is how it feels and the charging dock haven&#x27;t tired it in the shower yet</li>
    <li> I decided after several years away from electric razors (usually Norelco) to give this $100 plus Braun COOL cutter a chance. Attempting to shave a 2 day growth resulted in scraping, biting, and motor quite underpowered. To receive a mediocre cut it required several minutes work. Shaver does not roll over the chin. Only redeeming plus was the cooling feature.</li>
    <li> In the hand, more components, a little bit heavy.The need to repeatedly shaving, shaving clean hair,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Braun electric shavers for several generations of their products. Having very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve experimented with every type of blade, cream, oil and machine possible. I finally found the right combination of double edge safety razor blade, handle and cream that leaves me unscathed in getting a perfect shave, but since I travel for a living and razor blades are frowned on by the TSA and scary men with uniforms and hand cuffs, my preferred solution was an effective electric shaver, especially while traveling. Braun has been the most effective alternative for me with the last previous incarnation being their Series 7, 790 shaver, which I&#x27;ve used with complete satisfaction. Admittedly, though, it&#x27;s effectiveness came at a cost of being just slightly aggressive, and if I pressed to hard against my skin in a hurry to get out the door, I managed to inflict some irritation. This new series of shavers from Braun , boasting a cooling bar, in all honesty had the ring of a gimmick after perhaps having nowhere to go to improve an already near perfect product as their 790. I&#x27;m very happy to admit that I was cynically mistaken. this shaver, while not perfect, is welcome and appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction when examining it was frankly, disappointment. It looked and felt like a cost cutting compromise. Unlike the 790, the shaving head is fixed and doesn&#x27;t pivot. It shed the beautiful glass indicator at the bottom that graphically showed both the degree of charge and the degree of hygiene, i.e. when it was time to thoroughly clean the head. The 790 had a clever arrangement where the sideburn trimmer rose vertically out in a 90 degree snap that made it very accessible, whereas this new model has an arrangement where the trimmer lamely slides up with less drama and range. I was ready to pronounce it a disappointing cost reduction design at a premium price. Until I fired it up and tried it. It has a solid, monolithic feel, and requires more conscious maneauvering due to the lack of the pivoting head I was accustomed to. But that translated into feeling less gimmicky and more solid. The shave and cutting action does seem less aggressive than my old Braun which also seemed disappointing, until I realized that it was in reality more gentile to my skin. But the whole point to this new incarnation is The Cool factor. There&#x27;s an aluminum bar positioned between the two cutting foils that presses against the skin and it is indeed cool. I cynically muttered that, while it had a refreshing sensation, that it wasn&#x27;t making any difference to the skin. Again, I gratefully had to assess that I was wrong. Evidently, that quick touch of coolness is enough to calm any abrasiveness the blades and cutting foil might cause. I think I did have to revisit a spot or two because of the more mild aggressiveness, but ultimately the shave was complete and effective with no irritation whatsoever. Even the shape of the shaver which is mildly more of a broader &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; and is bulkier at the top than the the older model is more ergonomic and so more natural to hold. I should note that according to the manual, using the Cooling feature does diminish the battery charge more quickly, whatever technology that cooling involves, so you can press the blue button on the front to disaffect the cooling. But since the shaver is recharged as soon as you place it back in the stand and since the cooling factor is really the whole point of this thing, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d want to turn that off. In some ways, the look and design does appear to be pared back and no doubt is cost cutting on the manufacturing, the reality is that it seems to be achieving a superior end result. Which is the whole reason you choose an electric razor and this particular Cooling design to begin with. If you, like me, are migrating from the Braun 7 series, it will take a small adjustment. But especially if you have sensitive skin prone to irritation, you should find this model awelcome and effective product. It might be mentioned that it&#x27;s made in Germany, which gives me more confidence in it&#x27;s integrity than if it had been stamped out in China. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days but from that limited exposure, at this point, I can highly recommend it and don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.welcome and effective product.

    <li> I got the model without the cleaning unit. The shaver is solidly built and a little heavier than my last shaver. It shaves very close and the cooling feature is very nice. The only reason I did not give it five stars is using the cooling feature really uses up the battery fast. It is easy to use recharge the unit though with the charging stand.</li>
    <li> In a program run by Braun, I was fortunate to trial the Braun CoolTec Solo shaver with a 3 stage cutting system. I must note that my facial hair growth is medium to light, but grows enough stubble to clean up on a daily basis. After a week of shaving each day, I have been happy with the results day in and day out of this Braun product! I am not a brand loyalist when it comes to shavers, but the innovative product in hand certainly makes a case to reconsider and support Braun going forward. The CoolTec technology offers a pleasant sensation with no irritation while I shave - not afterward with aftermarket product - and does not require extra effort to maintain its performance integrity. I found that I prefer this 3 stage cutting system over another 3 stage, rotating head, system &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; as the results of the shave and time to execute are much better in each respect. If you are considering a shaver, consider this Braun product to get and feel the results a man desires.</li>
    <li> A much improved product from the electric razors of the past. The only thing I disliked was having to run the razor over the same foot to get all the hair off and achieve a close shave making it slightly more time consuming than I would&#x27;ve liked. Other than that it has a lot of positives and I plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if the CoolTec was much of an upgrade over my previous one-foiled shaver, but over time it really is more comfortable than traditional shavers. It does cut less effectively than a 5 or 7 series shaver, but in return you get that cooling sensation that makes you want to use this for extended periods. At least that&#x27;s how it works for me.</li>
    <li> I received the CoolTec Solo through a Braun program. I like the actual feel of the unit itself. It has good weight and feel. The cooling bar is a great idea and when I made sure to angle the shaver right, it seemed to help. Here&#x27;s my problem; I have curly hair and no matter how hard I try it&#x27;s difficult to get a clean shave. I also have sensitive skin so irritation is always an issue because I have to shave in every direction. This isn&#x27;t the CoolTec Solo&#x27;s fault though, I have never found an electric shaver that I could use daily, but of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the CoolTec Solo charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Good product&lt;br /&gt;-I just can&#x27;t use electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun °CoolTec Solo via a program run by Braun. I was excited because I&#x27;ve enjoyed the ease and convenience of electric shavers in the past. The box design and packaging is great and I was excited to experience the shaver. I was a little confused because the box stated it could be used in the shower for wet shaving, as well as for regular dry shaving. However, the instructions said not to get the razor handle wet , so i didn&#x27;t try it in the shower. Also the instructions cover three different models with different features and methods of use- some get cleaned one way, others another; some charge a certain way, others not... very confusing and inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice much cooling sensation from the aluminum cooling bar, but the instruction booklet warned me that I may not notice any cooling, so I was prepared for that. I did not get as close a shave as I would like from the shaver, but it apparently adjusts so i&#x27;ll have to reread the instructions and figure out how to do that. This shaver would be great for someone with a large head that shaves all their facial hair as it has a thick, wide rectangular head that does not make any detail work  around a mustache or goatee easy. The shaver head is wider than my chin and could do my cheeks in one pass each if I could get it to shave any of my day old stubble.  It also does not pivot to the curves of your face as easy as some other electric shavers. The instructions also state that it needs to be maintained at a 90 degree angle with your face, thats an awkward shaving strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was not impressed with the shaver due to the confusing directions and bulky inconvenient shave. Though, as I said, it may work better for a man with a larger face and hands.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried at first cause electric shavers irritate my face but I gave it a shot and I love it that&#x27;s all I use now I recommend it to everyone I know light weight easy set up don&#x27;t take a lot of space and the cool button WOW great idea can&#x27;t say I love it enuff</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tex Men&#x27;s Solo Shaver is one of the best electric razors that I have used.  It provided me with a very clean shave and the \\&quot;cool tec\\&quot; feature was very remarkable. I received this product as part of a campaign by Braun as was very satisfied with the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this electric razor, I had developed the opinion that all electric razors were the same, but Braun&#x27;s Cool Tec shaver has changed my opinion. With the added mustache trimmer and the \\&quot;cool tec\\&quot; feature, I am thumbs up for this product. Braun has moved a step above other companies and I will continue to use this product anytime I need to shave.</li>
    <li> My husband received this shaver to try through a program supported by Braun. He let his beard grow for about 4 days then gave it a go. The cooling part, which looked like a ceramic strip between the blades, was pretty neat. It actually cooled the skin. That was pretty neat. The shave was not near as close as his other shaver, which has a pivoting head. So that wasn&#x27;t so great. He does like to use it if he is doing a quick shave and not too worried about how clean shaven he is. Would we purchase this from the store? No, definitely not. Not a bad product, just not a great one.</li>
    <li> While I received this product via a program run by Braun, the opinions here are entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solo comes with a charging shell, base that can hold it the shaver upright, wall charger, a small amount of machine oil, small cleaning brush, a vented clear plastic cover to protect the foil blades and of course the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is a little heavier than I thought it would be so it takes a little getting used. As soon as you get a good feel for it, it&#x27;s not that noticeable. The top portion has a textured, rubber grip area and the finger indentation and trimmer areas are made of rubber, so it doesn&#x27;t get too slippery. Although, for some reason, they used the same slick plastic as the charging shell and base for the front part on the sides and very bottom which doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. It would be much better if it was all rubberized or at least had a more matte plastic for that portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the plastic quality, I think that the base that keeps the charging shell upright feels a little cheap. The plastic used is not thick and stable enough when you consider this is not an inexpensive shaver. With the somewhat heavy shaver sitting on it, it can wobble and just doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy at all, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s best not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to charge. You just lay the back of the shaver on the 2 metal pins of the charging shell (which is a light, but thankfully semi-firm plastic) and plug the charging cord into the shaver before plugging it into the wall. The on/off button will blink green until it is done charging and it takes a good hour to fully charge. It would be nice if we could just charge without this extra piece, though. The wall charger does have a convenient spiral cord which I love, but it&#x27;s made of very cheap plastic, so it may not last that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature (which is indicated by a snowflake) really does work but sometimes I find that I hit the button because of the placement, turning it off. I suppose I still need to get used to that part but perhaps if it was smaller, that would be very helpful. But this feature has really helped my skin because other shavers would sometimes give me harsh irritation and redness. The cooling sensation is hard to explain but it really makes my skin feel refreshed and I only use aftershave about once a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to press the small button to slide it out and is a good size for most, I think, at a drop under an inch wide. It might be nice if it slid out 1/4 - 1/2 inch more only because it ends up being just a tad higher than the blades, so you have to be mindful of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cleaning, I&#x27;ve found that rinsing it under hot water with a gentle liquid soap while it&#x27;s on works great. Sometimes I remove the foil blade cartridge, which is very easy, and gently tap or use the included brush to clean the remaining hair from inside, just be careful that you don&#x27;t touch the \\&quot;SensoBlades\\&quot; because that could damage them. I&#x27;ve been using a drop of the supplied machine oil every so often to keep the blades at their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel lock function is excellent so that it doesn&#x27;t go off by accident. When pressed, the shaver turns on for a few seconds and then a lock symbol appears and you&#x27;re good to go. Also, when not in use, the vented clear plastic cover does an okay job but doesn&#x27;t stay on very well if it&#x27;s moved around, so it&#x27;s probably best to buy a carry bag to keep it in better condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice shaver and does what it says. The cooling feature, while some may say it&#x27;s a gimmick, does what it is meant to do. It&#x27;s possible all skin types may not benefit but it&#x27;s worth a try. One thing to note, though, is that using this feature does considerably shorten the charge of the shaver. I would recommend this if you are looking for a comfortable shave, but it&#x27;s disappointing that many of the accessories aren&#x27;t better constructed since the shaver itself feels very solid.</li>
    <li> Great service highly recommend.</li>
    <li> To have the shaver last and to keep my face from being irritates,I have been using this shaver only once a week since the beginning of this year. The rest of the week I use my old Norelco  triple header shave which is easier on my face.  I can&#x27;t believe that the foil is already worn through on two spots, which do not touch my face.  This is always the problem with these foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I just looked harder and the foil is fine, it is very shiny and hard to see well.  there is no problem with the foil.</li>
    <li> With all the Braun hype being one of the best shavers I am very disappointed with my first Braun purchase. I had a Panasonic razor that was getting old so decided to go with a Braun . Well the only thing that was decent on this model was the cooling mechanism . My older shaver still cuts faster and smoother than the new Braun and it&#x27;s 4 years old with a 2 year old foil and blade....!</li>
    <li> it is very cool,though it looks a little big,but it does not matter.it just useful and comvenient.i like it and it is the second time to buy</li>
    <li> I do like the cool feel against the skin, it does seem to allow me to shave more for a closer shave. It would be nice if it had a travel container.</li>
    <li> This was useless. The electronics were for voltages in the US and Canada , and wouldn&#x27;t  work in the UK which needs 250 voltage. Returning the item cost £20.00 which was not refunded and the amount refunded was approx £3 less thanIwas charged, even though it was the fault of Amazon. I shall never buy anything from Amazon again!</li>
    <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
    <li> This product is very good</li>
    <li> Good quality and smart price!</li>
    <li> I bought one, and recommended to a friend of mine. Now I bought it 3 times on Amazon. It proved by me and my friends. This is a great one if you wanta shaver!</li>
    <li> This razor takes a few more swipes to get everything but it is very comfortable and cool blade works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months.  I shaves well.  Cool feature feels nice when shaving.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, comfortable cooling affect, no razor burning feeling.. All the best of a electric razor.. Highly recommend.</li>
