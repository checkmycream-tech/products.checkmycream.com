      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS SUNBLOCK.</li>
      <li>This product is family owned &amp; they provide fabulous customer service!</li>
      <li>Just make sure you purchase product by Maui Babe &amp; they now sell this product on their website as well as amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I LOVE the browning lotion.</li>
      <li>I love that this does not smell like normal sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and it flakes right off.</li>
      <li>that you feel your putting on another layer of skin, it feels just right.</li>
      <li>If you want just a little color or more use the 30 sun block then apply the browning lotion, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My husband was the first one to point it out, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it myself.  </li>
      <li>I BOUGHT MY FIRST ONE IN HAWAII</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for at least 4 years, and it&#x27;s always been great.  </li>
      <li>When you put this on it is very clumpy and makes either your skin peel or the sunscreen clumps up and will not rub in.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing...</li>
      <li>Fell in love with this produce in Maui and have since been purchasing online to get my fix, however I have to agree with other reviewers that something is awry with the formula.  </li>
      <li>BUT THIS ONE I JUST BOUGHT FROM THIS COMPANY SEEM TO BE OLD.</li>
      <li>This bottle seemed to me to be old</li>
      <li>Compared to an older bottle and the ingredients are different.</li>
      <li>This Sun Lotion is pretty heavy and contains a lot of &amp;#34;Staining&amp;#34; agent.  </li>

<li> This bottle seemed to me to be old</li>

<li> This Sun Lotion is pretty heavy and contains a lot of &amp;#34;Staining&amp;#34; agent.  </li>
<li> Shortly after applying this sunscreen, when I&#x27;m still trying to rub it in, it starts peeling off; it feels like dead skin after exfoliating scrub.  </li>
<li> friend tried it a few days later thinking it was just me</li>
<li> a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> So, you have to be very careful</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t burn, you tan, I&#x27;ve turned several people on to this product after them being disappointed w other products that burned them, and full of dyes and unnatural ingredients.</li>
<li> However, the last 2 times that I ordered it, I noticed its poor quality (as if they changed the formula all of a sudden).  </li>
<li> I applied it before applying the browning lotion, and it started to flake off and ended up making a mess all over my bathroom floor.</li>
<li> It rolled up as I was rubbing on, looking like dead skin peeling everywhere.</li>
<li> I love their tanning lotion, but this sun screen is awful.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering again, as I keep giving it &#x27;one more bottle&#x27; but the consistency is consistently terrible.</li>
<li> I also like the consistency its not to thick</li>
<li> this sucks, so does my sunburn!</li>
<li> It is very weird.</li>
<li> Maybe I just got a bad batch?</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Great coverage and so easy to smooth on. Very moisturizing...</li>
    <li> I love their tanning lotion, but this sun screen is awful. I applied it before applying the browning lotion, and it started to flake off and ended up making a mess all over my bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it with Maui Babe Browning Lotion!!</li>
    <li> This bottle seemed to me to be old when applying it turns rubbery and clumps foest not rub in.  Very disappointed. 😕</li>
    <li> I love that this does not smell like normal sunscreen. It has a bit of a tropical scent to it, its nice. I also like the consistency its not to thick that you feel your putting on another layer of skin, it feels just right.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 4 years, and it&#x27;s always been great.

My husband was the first one to point it out, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it myself.  I am reluctant to order this product again because it hasn&#x27;t met my expectations, even though it used to be real good.  However, I must note that I used to order this product from [...] (their official website) that no longer exists. So, now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s actually produced somewhere else and not Hawaii...</li>
    <li> Protects well, but still got some color.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> This Sun Lotion is pretty heavy and contains a lot of &amp;#34;Staining&amp;#34; agent.  So, you have to be very careful how and where you use it.</li>
    <li> This didnt work at all. Compared to an older bottle and the ingredients are different. this sucks, so does my sunburn!</li>
    <li> Sunscreen rubs off as soon as I start putting it on. Once it is on, I can scrub my hands over my skin where I put it and it flakes right off. Does not stick to my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this produce in Maui and have since been purchasing online to get my fix, however I have to agree with other reviewers that something is awry with the formula.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering again, as I keep giving it &#x27;one more bottle&#x27; but the consistency is consistently terrible. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> i broke out in a rash within minutes and had to get a shot in Mexico - NO BUENO!&lt;br /&gt;My friend tried it a few days later thinking it was just me and she got bumps as well.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there start using years ago &amp; still love it.Start using it on a trip to FLA when asked some one were they got that tan Maui BABE was the answer been hooked since</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion before, however I used it 2 weeks ago in Mexico and it did not go on smoothly, it kind of peeled away from my skin everytime I rubbed my arm, leg, etc.  Maybe I just got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> Love it. Great protection and moisturizing. Pleasant smell</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SUNBLOCK. I BOUGHT MY FIRST ONE IN HAWAII 6 YEARS AGO. I BOUGHT IT AGAIN ONLINE, BUT THIS ONE I JUST BOUGHT FROM THIS COMPANY SEEM TO BE OLD. IT EXFOLIATES IN MY HANDS WHEN I APPLY IN MY SKIN. IT MAKES ME THINK I AM PEELING EVEN BEFORE GOING TO THE SUN.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I LOVE the browning lotion. When you put this on it is very clumpy and makes either your skin peel or the sunscreen clumps up and will not rub in. It is very weird.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it. This time was totally opposite. There were lumps of product coming out of the bottle. I shook it up and used it anyway. It rolled up as I was rubbing on, looking like dead skin peeling everywhere. I checked the expiration date and it should have been good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along w the browning lotion since I visited Maui several years ago! You don&#x27;t burn, you tan, I&#x27;ve turned several people on to this product after them being disappointed w other products that burned them, and full of dyes and unnatural ingredients. This product is family owned &amp; they provide fabulous customer service! If you want just a little color or more use the 30 sun block then apply the browning lotion, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results. I haven&#x27;t used anything else since finding this gem, no comparison to what&#x27;s sold in the stores &amp; a little goes a long way! Just make sure you purchase product by Maui Babe &amp; they now sell this product on their website as well as amazon.</li>
