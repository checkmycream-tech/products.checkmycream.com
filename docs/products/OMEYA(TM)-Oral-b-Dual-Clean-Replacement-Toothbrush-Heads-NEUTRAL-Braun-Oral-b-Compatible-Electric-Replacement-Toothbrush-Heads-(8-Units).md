These are just as good or better then the namebrand Oral-B brushes. I am so thrilled that I found a reasonable replacement for my toothbrush heads. They are about a quarter of the price of the namebrand brushes. I was so happy with these that I ordered two additional packages of eight brushes.</li>
    <li> These heads are good - I love the way my teeth feel after cleaning with an electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;as opposed to a manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are a little big for my mouth but they suffice. Not bad for a knock-off.</li>
