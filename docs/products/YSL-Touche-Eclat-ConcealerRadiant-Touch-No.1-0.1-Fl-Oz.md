### Positive Reviews

      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>But then again, at my age (50), this might be the best I can hope for!</li>
      <li>and it would be absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>This was a real good lesson for me never to buy makeup on line and never to buy anything out of the country.  </li>

      <li>This product is a nice highlighter for shadows on the face.</li>
      <li>I liked this product.  </li>
      <li>looks nice, works well..</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller, but of course I did not get any kind of refund or replacement.  </li>
      <li>This product reminds me of the 60&#x27;s when luminous highlighting was popular even in foundation makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even spot used it on a healed blemish that was a bit darker than my normal skin tone and got perfect coverage.</li>
      <li>I tan very easily except under my eyes</li>
      <li>It goes on very easy with the brush</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Great product and worth the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t spend more than 5 mins on my makeup, but I still want my skin to look nice.</li>
      <li>the product&#x27;s price seems too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>I have very light skin</li>
      <li>i love this stuff</li>
      <li>I have been a devotee of this product for many years</li>
      <li>It worked ok as a concealer, but not as a highlighter because it&#x27;s darker than my skin.  </li>
      <li>Okay now.</li>
      <li>My order arrived very promptly, and in great condition.</li>
      <li>It has a bit more of a pinkish color to it.</li>
      <li>Just make sure the product has been used up off your brush before you close it and store it.</li>
      <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product for under my eyes as a concealer.  </li>
      <li>Ordered a #1 from Sephora so we&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s any better.  </li>
      <li>Still, this is better than anything else I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This review is not for the product purchased from authentic distributors, but the counterfeit products sold on Amazon.</li>
      <li>That was now many years ago, as I&#x27;ve been a devout user ever since.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t tell you have any makeup on except that your face looks better.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more to enhance and shadow than to cover up.</li>
      <li>Love it/ will keep re-ordering.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>tried many many concealers , my daughter told me about this product ...</li>
      <li>Thinking it had separated, I shook it 10 more seconds.</li>
      <li>Love this,does everything it says.</li>
      <li>Have used a drug store brand that worked better.</li>
      <li>This cannot be an authentic YSL Touche &amp;Eacute;clat highlight pen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is great stuff, but I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, goes on smoothly, and is a really nice product.</li>
      <li>however getting the top off it and reclosing it is a huge pain..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it.  Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried has covered my dark circles, but this one seems to soften their appearance as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried--better than some.  I like the texture of it.  It blends in pretty easily.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous concealers over the years for under eye circles.  Finally a product that actually fulfills it&#x27;s claims. This glides on and manages to conceal and highlight at the same time.  Great product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> i tried this product before as a sample and i loved it... not too sure now, but I believe i made the wrong choice of color. ill try again.</li>
    <li> Really gives the eye area a lift!</li>
    <li> This item was empty.  Only got a tiny bit of product out of tube. Want to return.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice highlighter for shadows on the face.</li>
    <li> Must have been mislabeled or a dupe for the real thing. Had a genuine one and it and this one were no where near the same color. this was very pink undertone.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this here.  I used to get it from QVC.  Lasts forever.  They stopped carrying it so I was on the hunt.  forget contouring use this to highlight brows, cheekbones and hide the labial folds (laugh lines) around the mouth and nose.  It camouflages so well.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product for anyone with a few lines or dark circles under their eyes.  If I only have time for one or two things, this, some blush and lipstick. Good to go.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, I first found this highlighter at an expensive makeup store in the mall. The product if the same quality for much less on here! Very happy with this, will order again</li>
    <li> Love this. You can find it on Amazon cheaper than Sephora, which is amazing. This is a MUST HAVE for people with very dark circles under their eyes - which I unfortunately have, and sometimes it&#x27;s the only product I need to use concealer wise. Definitely buy if you have dark circles or you need to brighten the under eye area - it&#x27;s an absolutely amazing product that will not let you down!</li>
    <li> Okay now. I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars because it is VERY comparable to either Mac Prep+Prime Highlighter in Radiant Rose or the Maybelline Dream Lumi in whatever the lightest Radiant color is. This YSL one is awesome and it blends so much better than the other 2 but for the money it&#x27;s not worth it when there are 2 other products for much cheaper that do almost the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> Good product. Creates a pleasing/relaxed appearance for an older man.</li>
    <li> This is my third Yves Saint Laurent Eclat pen; I have used numbers 1 and 2 in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give an even glow when using as a concealer but I wish it stayed on longer than a few hours.</li>
    <li> It seems to be the best cover for older women who do not have the perfect skin.  That&#x27;s what makes a good product great!</li>
    <li> I like this and it works, but from recommendations it sounded especially good. For me it functions like a normal makeup highlighter -- helpful, but no different from any other product of this type.</li>
    <li> it is really nice and blends beautifully, I&#x27;d tried it once in a store before buying. my only reason for using 4 stars is because this listing is labeled mascara and this is not mascara.  I took a chance that the description and rest of the product name, referred to the product I was looking for, and not an eye make up product and I was correct.  But the description needs to have the word &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; removed.  This item is in the original basic shade and there are now more shades available.  but I will stay with the product, I use it on my cheekbones, above where I&#x27;d place blush. and it other areas that seem to be a little dark, around the mouth and nose.  but it&#x27;s not an opaque concealer, it&#x27;s more to enhance and shadow than to cover up.</li>
    <li> I have been a devotee of this product for many years and I couldn&#x27;t live without it. Works under the eye to cover bags or darkness, above the eye as a nude shadow or on the brow as a highlight. I&#x27;ve even spot used it on a healed blemish that was a bit darker than my normal skin tone and got perfect coverage. the tip is to use small dots or dashes and quickly blend with small, light feathery strokes. You can&#x27;t tell you have any makeup on except that your face looks better. Because you don&#x27;t use much, it lasts for ages.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beauty product! It&#x27;s so easy to use, lasts all day, and looks great. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product for under my eyes as a concealer.  It is easy to apply, can fit in your purse and brightens your eyes.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Love this,does everything it says.</li>
    <li> this product was awful!!! im sending it back, it is NOTHING like the ones i have bought at Nordstrom. The color is wrong, its dry and just wrong.</li>
    <li> tried many many concealers , my daughter told me about this product ... so I thought I would try it ... well she was right , its Awesome .... i will buy it again and again ... great stuff .....</li>
    <li> I liked this product.  My only problem with it is it is a bit too light for me.  Goes on well and stays on and does provide some &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i have dark under eyes and when i put this on it help a lot! my dark circles are barely noticeable now!</li>
    <li> I have several friends who swore by this product and encouraged me to try it. That was now many years ago, as I&#x27;ve been a devout user ever since. It does the best job with under eye circles. It&#x27;s light, goes on smoothly, and is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I use this highlighter every day on my eye lids in place of eye shadow. It&#x27;s subtle for the barely there make up look which I like. It brightens up my entire area. This is my daily go to make up.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other customers.  The product that I received is not a real YSL Touche Eclat product.  It was dry and only worked one time!  Then promptly ran out of product.  Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> The minute I took this out of the package I suspected it might be counterfeit. This was confirmed when I got the product out of the tube and it was terribly dry and unblendable. I&#x27;ve owned the real touche eclat, and this is certainly not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is great stuff, but I have sensitive skin and when I put it under my eyes it burns. For that reason I had to quit using it so I can&#x27;t say whether the product actually works as described.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Fast service and delivery. I have used this product for years. Tried other drug stor brands but this one beats them all. Light and natural.</li>
    <li> The tube had nothing in it. Possibly completely dried out.  I have purchased one from a cosmetic counter before; but, now purchase this from here again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Original I believe,  though it does seem to have a little less product inside. I found this in New York several years ago and been loving it since for my eyes.</li>
    <li> wonderful, non drying, brightening, easy to use. i use it under makeup and when i just have time to highlight a little i where it alone</li>
    <li> This is a great HIGHLIGHTER, not concealer. If you have dark under eye circles or hyperpigmentation then go with something thicker. I tried it on my dark blue/purple under eye circles and it did not cover them. It might have highlighted a bit but the circles were still very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is best used to brighten eyes (not conceal) and highlight features like nose, cheeks and brow.</li>
    <li> I completely forgot this magic wand existed, now I am clueless as to how I ever got by without it.  The $40 is a bit much, but I got a sweet deal through this seller.  Lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this from Mile High Beauty Supply. I just received mine today and it is a counterfeit. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have known if I didn&#x27;t keep my old Touche Eclat that I purchased from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fake one&#x27;s tube is longer compared to the legitimate product. The bottom also has the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; stuck on instead of being engraved. When I took off the cap, there was already some product/liquid coming out of the brush and that&#x27;s not supposed to happen unless I press the bottom clicker. Some of the text on the fake one is also bolder than the original product. The text should look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product&#x27;s price seems too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it. I&#x27;d rather pay the extra at Sephora, Nordstrom, etc. for a legitimate one.</li>
    <li> This highlighter/ concealer has no equal.  It is lightweight and invisible while it brightens shadows and blurs imperfections. Use it around the eye and in the folds around the nose and lips.  Just great!</li>
    <li> Heard great things about this product ,the color was too light and did not do what it said . If I did not know better I would have thought it was a cheap drugstore product</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product and really brightens up your eyes. I watched a tutorial on youtube that was very helpful.</li>
    <li> Too thick, not crazy about it</li>
    <li> I love this product however it seemed old and dried up.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I was happy to see the great price. I love the way this highlights! can be used under eyes also.</li>
    <li> For such a well known product, I was pretty disappointed. It creased and caked very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement of my under eye area. Have used a drug store brand that worked better.</li>
    <li> This is a counterfeit product - DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> been using this product for years - I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I do not notice any difference between this (expensive) and a normal over the counter luminous highlighter.  I do not think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have one makeup item with me, this would be it.  People have honestly asked me if I was getting botox around my eyes!  Suckas!</li>
    <li> Not as much of a rave as others have posted, but definitely a high quality product. But then again, at my age (50), this might be the best I can hope for!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to cover my dark circles and brighten around my eyes! Perfect for under my Physicians Formula - Powder Palette Multi-Colored Highlighter! It&#x27;s a super light powder so it needs to be paired with something light and easy to use. I don&#x27;t spend more than 5 mins on my makeup, but I still want my skin to look nice. It&#x27;s pricey and we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but so far I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle make up tool. I love it!</li>
    <li> It is great, works best if you use only a little</li>
    <li> This does exactly what everyone says it does. Beautiful!  But...expensive.  Happily found a cheaper version that works just as well...but I&#x27;ll never forget this fancy gold pen.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful concealer although it is a bit thin.  And I&#x27;m not a fan of the delivery system.  That being said, however, when I do use concealer, this is my go-to product.  I have both #1 and #2 and I mix the two colors to get the perfect match for my light skin (#1 is a bit too light, which only highlights my dark circles).  I have tried many different concealers over the years, both high-end and low and this is by far the best.  I just wish it was a tad bit thicker.  Just a little heft and it would be absolutely perfect. And the delivery system is awful.  How many times have I turned the dial too much and a wad of product squeezes out.  Frustrating and wasteful!  Still, this is better than anything else I&#x27;ve used so I will continue to have it on hand.  It was expensive, much more than the price Amazon is selling it for as of this writing, so I try to use it judiciously.  This concealer is definitely worth the hype, however.  I can highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Normally my go-to, I mean what else can be said about Touche Eclat.  However, the one I got was marked #1, but did not in any way resemble the original T.E. shade, which it&#x27;s supposed to be.  It was quite a bit darker and pinker... almost a reddish tone.  It worked ok as a concealer, but not as a highlighter because it&#x27;s darker than my skin.  Will cover up blue circles under the eyes, but they still look &amp;#34;shaded&amp;#34;. Ordered a #1 from Sephora so we&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s any better.  If YSL has actually eliminated their original shade of Touche Eclat, they are the dumbest company on earth.</li>
    <li> after trying lots of under eye hopes,.this is the easiest to apply, smooth, wonderful liminous quality.....I would recommend touche to all...............lolli, Pa.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as stated. Easy to use, with or without foundation. Have used it for years, would not be without it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it under my eyes and it really lightens the area. Just a hint...not heavy.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought something because of a free sample I received in the mail/a magazine. It works great! Goes on smoothly and blends well. Looks good at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This is as wonderful as others have said.  The shadows under my eyes are very dark and this covers them in a natural way.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of the 60&#x27;s when luminous highlighting was popular even in foundation makeup.  This product makes your eyes appear soft and rested and dewy.  It really makes a difference to the undereye appearance especially.</li>
    <li> Probably the best concealer I have ever used hands down. Period.</li>
    <li> YSL Touch&amp;eacute; Eclat Concealer Radiant Touch, No1, is the true YSL brand. I received mine from Blue Orchid. I compared the tube to my old one that I purchased from Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Touch&amp;eacute; Eclat for at least ten years. After I wash and moisturize my face, I app,y some of the concealer under my eyes, down the middle if my nose, at the inner corner of my eyes and on my chin. I massage the concealer in softly and carefully. I then apply my makeup. The concealer works well for under eye darkness, on the bridge of my nose it has a slimming effect, and at the corner of my eyes it gives a brightening effect. You need to be sure not to apply too much, particularly under your eyes, or you will have the reverse Racoon effect, shiny half moons under your eyes. Use a little at first until you feel comfortable using the concealer. And, use it with a good light or near a window. I have seen several celebrities on television with half moons under their eyes, lines down their nose, from a make up artist who applied too much concealer, or who did not blend it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, YSL makes the best concealer, and I have tried most of them. Another important piece of info is that you need to click the bottom of the tube at least 40 times before the concealer works it&#x27;s way up the tube. Do not think there is nothing in the tube, keep clicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-06-16</li>
    <li> I learned after I bought this that it is tested on animals, which I dislike greatly, so unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> makes my eyes look brighter and younger.  i use under the eye-a little goes a long way. i love this stuff</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the genuine YSL Eclat product. It looks like the real thing, but the tube is filled with colorless oil, not the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package, took out the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34;, shook it for 10 seconds, clicked the bottom 10x and nothing came out. Clicked it 10 more times and a clear, colorless oil came out. Thinking it had separated, I shook it 10 more seconds. I clicked it over 100 times total and, other than the initial oil, nothing ever came out.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it from seller: Sassy Makeup in Manhattan . I should learn to read feedback before purchasing.</li>
    <li> First purchased this at Sephora and swore to never use any other concealer.  Goes on beautifully, minimizes the look of lines, smooths skin under eyes, blends perfectly.  Price shopped with Amazon and was pleasantly surprised.  Well worth the retail price but am very glad to pay less with Amazon</li>
    <li> The concealer is good..looks nice, works well..however getting the top off it and reclosing it is a huge pain..hands already slippery, it&#x27;s all but impossible to get the top off it..then you click the opposite end to release the product..then when you put the top back on, you must be very careful so as not to release more product when you try to snap the top back on..I like the concealer..but won&#x27;t buy again because of the container.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still a great concealer, and I&#x27;ll probably repurchase when I run out. it&#x27;s easy to apply and not too moisturizing which doesn&#x27;t last or too dry. The consistency is perfect.</li>
    <li> This product will be my go to cover for everything. As a 61 yr old I need lots of cover</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It covers beautifully and does not cake in the fine lines. I have very light skin so the lightest shade is great.</li>
    <li> I am such a fan of this product! My eyes are instantly brighter and I look refreshed after applying. It is great for someone who struggles with dark circles. I would, however, caution to use it sparingly, as a little goes a long way. Too much and you get bright circles under your eyes that do not blend well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great, light-weight cover up for quite some time now. I absolutely love this one! It goes on very easy with the brush and then I just blend with my fingertips. It stays on all day and really does brighten my skin without making me look shiny. I would highly recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> A good reason you should test make-up in person before ordering online: this stuff is pink. Like super pink. I already have a peaches-and-cream complexion so I didn&#x27;t think it would be too pink for me but it is and it&#x27;s expensive and now I&#x27;m stuck with it but it isn&#x27;t the miracle product I expected from the gazillions of beauty editors who swear it&#x27;s the holy grail of concealers. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Actually works well . Use it everyday now</li>
    <li> I liked the product but not sure if this one was a bit old when it was sent -- it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as one I purchased from a physical store.  I had no way to check this out.  I didn&#x27;t need it right away when ordered so didn&#x27;t use right away.  Still, the product wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;fluid&amp;#34; as I have experienced in the past.</li>
    <li> THIS CONCEALER IS OKAY,BUT I DON&#x27;T THINK IT&#x27;S AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE FOR A CONCEALER.  WOULDN&#x27;T PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, convenient, and works beautifully. I use it under each eye in a triangular shape and blend it in with my fingertips. Then I lightly draw on the laugh lines and add a little on the crease at the chin, and a little around the base of the nose. It brightens the dark areas and makes me look younger. Convenient to use and carry around. Just make sure the product has been used up off your brush before you close it and store it.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and wrapping, it&#x27;s a great product to hide blemishes...Choose the right color though, go lighter....Do not go yellow....</li>
    <li> I normally get this at a department store and love it, but this product was pretty dried out- it must be very old</li>
    <li> I use this over my makeup to give a boost (very small amount is used). Definitely a product worth keeping in your arsenal of makeup products</li>
    <li> Would not be without it.  I truly love this product.  It add highlighting where I want it and&lt;br /&gt;also hides the places on my face where I need it.  Would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Trusty great product.</li>
    <li> Flawless makeup cover.</li>
    <li> Had been looking at getting this for a while, recommended by my sister. Finally decide to get and have been pleased with how it makes under my eyes look. They look very refreshed and awake!</li>
    <li> My order arrived very promptly, and in great condition. The consistency and coverage of this highlighter were beautiful. It glided on without any cakiness or settling into fine lines. I highly recommend it for highlighting and concealing! This was an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I have used YSL Touche Eclat for several years I have tried others but there is nothing else like it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I went to a local sephora, looking actually for a pimple scar concealer. A helpful personelle helped me try on a dozen or so product, this was the last on the list, as it was the most expensive, but as soon as it was on, i knew it was the right product. It is said to only have \\&quot;medium coverage\\&quot;, more makeup than concealer- but the liquid from the brush tip went on very smoothly, and blends very well with a regular concealer brush (small tip).  I do not use makeup and the look did not require additional foundation.  After the product came down (about 30 clicks initially), you only need one click for enough product to cover a half centimeter area.  It is easily cleaned by makeup remover and my skin is not breaking out further which is a plus.  I like the slightly brightened, natural look, the brush tip is soft and easy to clean.  Overall, great for the bang of the buck, would not mess with the cheaper stuff.</li>
    <li> I just got Revlon Photoready and, frankly, for the money, i prefer the Photoready. This is almost the equivalent of Garnier (that roller ball thing for undereye circles) in terms of coverage. It has a bit more of a pinkish color to it. I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the little brush. Ick. Germs.</li>
    <li> Love it/ will keep re-ordering.  Never want to run out.</li>
    <li> This review is not for the product purchased from authentic distributors, but the counterfeit products sold on Amazon. I have purchased this product previously from Sephora online and loved it. This time I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon, and maybe save some money. I researched different sellers and thought I found one that was genuine. But when my Touche Eclat arrived in the mail I was immediately suspicious. The packaging, color, and consistency seemed off. I went ahead and ordered one from Sephora (in a slightly different color, which shouldn&#x27;t make a difference in packaging) and waited to compare the two. Turns out I was right to be suspicious. The one purchased from Amazon was indeed a counterfeit. I took several pictures but am unable to post them on here. The seller I purchased the fake from was Endless Lips. I&#x27;ve since accepted the fact that if you are going to buy expensive makeup, be prepared to pay full price, or end up with something very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use to use it but have been without for a long time. Really works!!</li>
    <li> This gets rave reviews by makeup artists.  It didn&#x27;t last very long and I didn&#x27;t see anything special about it compared to L&#x27;Oreal concealer regardless of the much higher price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Looks so natural on. Doesn&#x27;t crease in skin when covering dark circles.</li>
    <li> This cannot be an authentic YSL Touche &amp;Eacute;clat highlight pen. I purchased one last year from Amazon and it was great. This one is really thick. The color is off- and it has a distinct perfume like smell. The difference between the one I bought earlier, and this one is night and day. Please Amazon, the quality &amp; reliability of your vendors is sinking rapidly.</li>
    <li> The product I receive is very drying on my face. Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this on Amazon, it&#x27;s the best concealer &amp; highlighter I&#x27;ve ever used!  Use it sparingly for best result.</li>
    <li> The best used it for years</li>
    <li> Just like any other concealer. I would just buy it at the nearest drugstore.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job making the eyes look brighter and younger, and doesn&#x27;t cake into wrinkles nearly as much as lower quality products.  You also only need to use a tiny amount to get this effect.  Will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> The seller that I purchased this from, HSawyer &amp; Company, sent me a counterfeit YSL Touche Eclat. I&#x27;d recommend researching how to tell if a Touche Eclat is counterfeit/fake before ordering. It&#x27;s scary because you really have no way of knowing what the ingredients are if the item isn&#x27;t genuine. Could be anything in there.</li>
    <li> This was a real good lesson for me never to buy makeup on line and never to buy anything out of the country.  This item would not work.  It is almost as if there is no product inside the tube!  I contacted the seller, but of course I did not get any kind of refund or replacement.  Such a letdown.  A bad product and a really bad purchase.  Be warned!</li>
    <li> I have always had what I call raccoon eyes.  I tan very easily except under my eyes, so it always appears that I have circles under my eyes....my doctor thought it was birth control pills causing the problem, but even after I stopped them, raccoon eyes still here.  This product is great in blending my eye area with the rest of my face, either with or without foundation.  Blends great and not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
