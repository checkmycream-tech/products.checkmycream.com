<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works for headaches! I&#x27;ve tried other products to help with migraine headaches and they did not do the job that they promise. This works great and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It is so relaxing, and I love how it smells. I have frequent headaches, so it&#x27;s nice to have this to carry around for instant relief. My only complaint is that I wish there were a bit more for my buck. It is too expensive to buy more than every once in a while.</li>
    <li> i love this product! i get migraines at least once a month! and this product helps! i just put some on my forehead and it calms the migraine!</li>
    <li> The handy little roll on is a perfect cooling concentrated massage oil .It cools and calms down my migraines very quickly.I really loves it . It works wellfor me . It releives tension on my neck after a few minutes of Rollins also having good aroma.it is just perfect for me .</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, being a roll on product. But this stuff really works! Within minutes the tension started to release and I was able to get back to normal life. Love this!!</li>
    <li> love all their products.......especially the body perfume oils the scent last all day and u only need a lil dab its amazing....</li>
    <li> it works but it is weak.  You have to apply too many times just relieve a headache.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It helps me to relax and keep calm instantly when I can&#x27;t fall asleep,..at the dentist, ..or after too much coffee. It&#x27;s easy to apply, it has very pleasant scent, even my dentist and my boyfriend liked it. Best of all, I do not need to use harmful drugs to relax. Effect is mild and pleasant and yet it gives me relief of stress and discomfort.  I would recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> My experience with using this product has been extremely positive. I love that it is an all natural product that allows to calm me when I am tense or stressed. When I have used blissoma stress relief serum, it reminds me to stay in the present moment and breathe which is one of the most important things one can do to remain in balance and harmony. I have even used product right before I go to bed as this helps to calm and relax me. I would greatly recommend this product to anyone who needs calming and relaxing of the mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years. It&#x27;s the best of this type of product that I have found so far. And I love that it&#x27;s organic, without the cheap dangerous additives and preservatives that many of these types of products use.     I take it with me everywhere. It helps with headaches. It helps with stress. I use it before bed to help me sleep.     Also, I&#x27;m very sensitive to overpowering scents and this product is so gentle I can use it whenever I need to.    Great stuff and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is just ok.  Have other migraine aromatherapy oil that works much much better.  I thought I&#x27;d try this because the other is very expensive.  I guess when it comes to this particular item - you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC product!  Everything it promises, it delivers - it&#x27;s perfect for tension, stress relief and headache pain.  I never leave home without it.  Even my husband asks to borrow it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to knock this too much (hence the 3 stars) but that was being generous.  Really generous.  It is only .33 ounces.  I tried it when I had a migraine and it only irritated me.  If you are going to go this route, either use head-on (which actually does work) and the migraine cooling pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!  Hope it works better for someone else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannah</li>
    <li> Love this product. it smells so good and it helps me.I also like the fact that the prices are \\&quot;doable\\&quot; if that&#x27;s even a word.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an altermative to origins because it is so much cheaper. I was really surprised how well it works. It is so relaxing.</li>
    <li> This serum works great! i cant believe the results! will buy again :) thank you so much for reading this review and hope it helps you!</li>
    <li> My daughter get really bad migraine head aches, and being that she is 9, I don&#x27;t like to give her a lot of medicine for this...I like to go more natural..so I tried the Origins Peace of Mind cream...which is $11!! for this little tiny bottle. The Blissoma Stress Relief Serum has the same result, and its cheaper for the amount you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;s a great product! Thank you Blissoma.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent stress relief serum by Blissoma. Its non-greasy, soaked in by the skin very fast and it leaves a amooth glowing sheen to the skin. I&#x27;m very much pleased with the product. Will surely recommend this to a friend. Thank you Blissoma.</li>
    <li> Calm, Relax and Relief  Was looking for a cheaper product than what I was previously using (Relief Organic Aromatherapy by bath by bettijo). I really love it, works well for me. But like what I said wanted something less expensive. And I am happy I did. It works just as well. Helps relieve tension on my shoulders and back of my neck after a few minutes of rolling it on. Smell helped me relax and...</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a roll on that is good for stress relief, migrane, and tension pain.  I wish it would help with my sinus congestion as well, who knows.  Awesome idea.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a good stress reliever and i&#x27;ve heard this is a good product looking forward to tying. Ive had some friends already try this product, no complaints.</li>
    <li> My dad uses this often and I tried it a few times when I had some moderate headache. always gave me relief in about less than half hour.  I think it&#x27;s the smell of the ingredients that reduce the stress, especially the smell of ginger and the cool of peppermint.  great alternative for someone who dont want to use tylenol or aleve..</li>
    <li> Love this product but don&#x27;t have much more to say about it until I get to sample it. I hope to get to sample this product very soon.</li>
    <li> Blissoma Stress Relief Serum,  I used it once and it was wonderful. My skin felt lighter and in the next few days it was less oily with less breakouts.   triple a rating</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift and was very pleasantly surprised at the results.  This item helps relive my headaches better than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so relaxing!  Not sure how it works, but it works!  I get a super stiff neck and this helps especially at night.</li>
    <li> i am only writing this to get a free sample of Irie Star Stress Relief Serum.  I have yet to try it.  When I do receive a sample, I will come back and give a true review</li>
    <li> Have been searching for a good releif ointment, I think this is the one, took care of the pain. Would recommend anyone who has headaches too.</li>
    <li> This product just so soothing. It really takes the stress away and relaxes me. The roll on applicator is easy to use and does not waste product. It&#x27;s convenient to carry, so you can use it anywhere. The aroma oils have a beautiful smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely terrific, I am a mother of two a 13 year old daughter, and a 11 year old ADHD son, my husband is bi-polar and I take care of my 86 year old grandmother, so I am stressed out most of the time and this stuff really helps to relieve it.</li>
    <li> i find this is one of the best products to date as a single mother of 4 im stressed im always on the go so at the end of the night i just rub a little on my back neck and sholders and watch the tension and stress float away</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I felt like it rlly relieved my stress.. Plus has a great cent loveeee itttt I have sensitive skin awns usually everything irritates it, but this stuff didn&#x27;t bother me at all it was wonderful. I strongly recommend this product to all you ladys out there that need a little relaxation after a long stressful day.</li>
    <li> I do alot of lifting and this works great on my shoulders and back. This is the best stuff ever. Thank for reading.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this stress reliever in a bottle! I suffer from migraines and have noticed that if I sense an onset headache coming along, it assists in taking some of the strain away. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me but it is a lot to pay for such a little bottle. I may buy this product again but not quite sure.</li>
    <li> Works excellent for migraine and tension headaches!! Provides an instant cooling sensation which soothes and comforts achy pain and results in quick relief...The smell is not overbearing and actually smells nice..A must buy for quick, fast, and long lasting comfort!!!!!</li>
    <li> This serum is great for people who suffer from Headaches. I struggle specifically with Migraines and it has helped relieve some of the pain associated with migraines.I use it in combination with other treatments but it does help. I also use for tension headaches. A great all around product for any headache or stress relief.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWSOME ! I get debilitating migraines and this stuff works and works fast !</li>
    <li> I have terrible headaches all the time and someone told me about this serum. I recently borrowed some from a friend and it took care of my headache instantly! It was WONDERFUL! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> When my mother gave me the Blissoma Stress Relief I was amazaed by the fact the product actually made me feel better.. It does have a cooling effect which is a nice distraction. And it smells good too. I would say if you are not sure about this product try it!! You will be amazed by the way it calms you especially if you get migraines like I do.. ( I even had my husband by me some more for Chirstmas)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lower priced product and i found i really good one picking this product, however i wish it came with more in it for the money</li>
    <li> Blissoma Stress Relief Serum is a must product...Serum helps eliminate wrinkles and is a daily requirement for women of all ages..remember prevention is always the best medicine so give it a try</li>
    <li> I am so thankful to have found Blissoma&#x27;s Stress Relief Serum.  I suffer from headaches and neck and back pain.  I can&#x27;t take a lot of pain medications, so I usually find relief at the chiropractor and using ice packs, patches or Biofreeze.  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of expectations when I bought this, but felt it was worth a try since we try to use only natural or organic products.  I was very surprised the first night I used it.  I rubbed the serum into my temples and on my neck and shoulders.  Yes, I wouldn&#x27;t put my hands near my eyes after applying this, but I didn&#x27;t wake up with my face burning because it was still on my pillowcase like the Biofreeze.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I woke up the next morning and wasn&#x27;t in pain.  This has helped me in times when a visit to the chiropractor would have been necessary.  I personally would never want to be without this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the really great serum for any type of skin and can be apply to any age. It really refresh the skin and I would recommand this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a cheaper product than what I was previously using (Relief Organic Aromatherapy by bath by bettijo). I really love it, works well for me. But like what I said wanted something less expensive. And I am happy I did. It works just as well. Helps relieve tension on my shoulders and back of my neck after a few minutes of rolling it on. Smell helped me relax.</li>
    <li> I suffer from headaches quite often and I absolutely hate taking pills so a friend let me use some of her serum and I was pretty impressed, it didnt cure me completely but it definitely made the headache bearable.  I liked that there isnt a super strong fragrance and the consistancy isnt bad.  give it a try.</li>
    <li> this is a best stuff ever.[[ASIN:B0036YWM2G Blissoma Stress Relief Serum Roll on Aromatherapy Oil for Migraines, Tension, Pain, .33 Oz, 10 Ml]]</li>
    <li> It has helped me with so many things, horrible headaches, stress, and smells soo wonderful! i really enjoy this stuff!</li>

    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I was scared to try them but they are worth every penny! I was having bad headaches for a while but after using this once I already felt a relief. I usually do not like a lot of scents but this was great.</li>
    <li> Great product, works wonders!  It&#x27;s hard to find organic products now a days that actually do the trick... It has a nice smell and is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Nice product with a cool mint smell... It reduces nausea and helps me relax by clearing my head congestion. I really like mint and ginger and besides it&#x27;s natural--Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> i got this for my girlfriend. she says she really likes it. so if anyone eles is interested, like i said i got it for her and she really likes it and says it works well.</li>
    <li> I use this product when minor headaches annoy and I want to avoid medication.  It has a cooling effect and a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, it works wonders and anybody will be happy with it. Now that Christmas is coming you should get it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good forehead application remedy since HeadOn appears to be discontinued.  This did nothing to help my headaches, and smelled too strong perfume-y for my taste.  Perhaps it works for minor headaches, but I need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Origins Sensory Therapy™ Peace Of Mind™ On-The-Spot Relief.  It is more expensive, but I only need a tiny amount, and when you&#x27;re in a lot of pain, money doesn&#x27;t mean near as much as whether something works or not.</li>
    <li> This serum is all natural and really works! It instantly helps to calm you down and chill out. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> When HeadOn was discontinued and I was pregnant (no Advil Migraine!) I was panicking. This really saved the day. Works like a charm and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I suffer from migraines daily and have been on so many different medications that have horrible side effects. With this product as soon as I feel a headache coming on I rub this on my temple and it gives me relief and I can go on and enjoy my day with my kids, it&#x27;s also excellent when I&#x27;m at work as well. I&#x27;m so glad I have found this product because I take it everywhere I go and I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. What a relief. I will definitely be purchasing another one.!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This helps my headaches like no other! I received a sample in my March Eco-Emi box, and I will definitely be purchasing!</li>
    <li> with the world around us moving so fast and stress at an all time high its good to know if my head starts to hurt i have this to rely on it works effectively and quickly i love this stuff....thanks blissoma</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been suffering with anxiety for years. It has helped me immensely! It is a charm. Thank you thank you. :)</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about this - my friend swears by it for her stress headaches!  can&#x27;t wait to try it!~</li>
    <li> The Blissoma Oil works really well for the stress from everyday work and relieves my headaches, as well. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Sometimes I am nervous about buying products like this online but I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works wonders for me.   I have two small kids and a lot of stress is my life  And this product is awesome at helping me keep my  Cool</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have two cats and a lot of stress is my life&lt;br /&gt;And this product is awesome at helping me keep my&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
    <li> Often times I feel stressed from work and even at home. I feel much better after using this item and taking it easy after a long day. It soothes, cools, and refreshes.</li>
    <li> I love massaging this on my neck. It relieves tension very well. I don&#x27;t like using it on my temples b/c it&#x27;s greasy (it&#x27;s an oil duh). I ended up ordering another one to keep at work.</li>
    <li> I bought Bath &amp; Body Works Peppermint Headache Oil and loved the way it relieved my headaches without medication. BBW must have discontinued because I can never find it anywhere. So I took my search to amazon and found a similar product by Blissoma. This is even better than BBW&#x27;s headache oil! The combination of scents is so pleasing that it eradicates my headaches most of the time without any help from medication. I don&#x27;t like taking too many medications, even OTC medications such as Advil or Tylenol, so I am thrilled to have found something that works for me without popping pills. Pretty good price, BUT I was less than excited about the shipping cost. I just ordered two more of these for friends and the shipping was $7. To me, that&#x27;s alot for shipping two very small, light rolls in a bubble pack. One star off for this.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product!  I am calling it my \\&quot;cure all\\&quot;.  It works, as listed, for headaches and tension, but also I have found that it works for reducing pimple size and pain, smoothing lips, breathing clearly, and just over all soothing your whole vibe.</li>
    <li> This item is so so.  When I tried it I guess I was expecting something spectacular but it was not.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my migraines at all.  However, I do enjoy the scent and roll it on my wrist at night near bedtime so I can enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter to help her with stress and headaches.  It worked for her, smelled good and felt better, and was definitely relaxing.  This is a product I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I get migraines frequently. This stuff works great. I have told all my friends and ordered another bottle. definitely will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I used to use the stress serum at Bath and Body Works and of course it is discountinued. I found this and it smells wonderful and works great. I was surprised to see that you could also put on sholders to relieve tension and muscle aches. I have a lot of this and it really helped out. The scents in this really calm and soothe you. It arrived very quick as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scent is like a magic cup of tea! Very soothing and quick to put on in a jiffy. Haven&#x27;t used it for any pain/ stress relief...just for the smell</li>
    <li> The roller-ball application is terrific.  The serum is minty and stays for a long time - I use it on my forehead and under my nose.  I can&#x27;t say that it does anything with my migraines, but does offer some distraction for a period of time.  Super-easy and portable, the same size as a lipstick tube.</li>
