      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>get compliments where ever i go sexy.</li>
      <li>I was already familiar with the Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar Lotion.</li>
      <li>Was litte iffy if the scent would be really strong but it had a light scent and liked how it lathered up.</li>
      <li>Just tried it for the first time, and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>And, most importantly, the smell is &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or conflict with her perfume.  </li>

      <li>This was a Christmas gift to my daughter and she enjoyed it very much!</li>
      <li>It really smells like warm, vanilla sugar.</li>
      <li>This was a Christmas gift for my wonderful but very selective teenage granddaughter --&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>but if you can go to the store you will get a better value and the container seems to look fresher and less handled, but the smell is beautiful.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong which is nice for sensitive noses.</li>
      <li>I love the aroma of this product and it, combined with the lotion also available on this site, is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This product came in great condition, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a not as sweet as I thought.</li>
      <li>smells great pretty big worth the price</li>
      <li>Keeps body clean &amp; fresh.</li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothing.  </li>
      <li>This smells so good, is not greasy and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>The gel lathers very well and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>I knew she liked, and occasionally wore, a vanilla-scented perfume and that she used a shower gel, so I was very hopeful she&#x27;d like this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet enough without being sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>your looking for an aroma that is soft and  not to sweet, this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>So  I was hoping the scent carried over well as some gels I have tried have missed the mark by a large margin.</li>
      <li>I really like this scent because my perfume that I wear has vanilla undertones to it and this soap does not clash with my perfume.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for helping me make her have a Merry Christmas.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>why I keep ordering it, in large quantitys it is hard to find this particular product</li>
      <li>It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> would buy this forever it is sexy but not over perfume counter smell get compliments where ever i go sexy.</li>
    <li> This body wash lives up to it&#x27;s name. It really smells like warm, vanilla sugar. An inviting, sweet and delicious scent. I&#x27;ve received this as a gift a few times, which is usually around the holidays. I like this lotion a lot, so I&#x27;ve also given it as a holiday gift. I&#x27;ve also had the warm vanilla sugar lotion and body spray.</li>
    <li> Happy wife makes a happy man is oh so very true. Thanks for helping me make her have a Merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> Soapy and with great scent! Keeps body clean &amp; fresh. No need to use a lot ..a little goes a long way. Use along w/ body cream. Great together</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the hand soap in this scent before and didn&#x27;t realize they made body wash as well.  I really like this scent because my perfume that I wear has vanilla undertones to it and this soap does not clash with my perfume.  It&#x27;s sweet enough without being sickly sweet.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of this product and it, combined with the lotion also available on this site, is very moisturizing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to my daughter and she enjoyed it very much! Nice comforting smell. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  The main feature I look for is a good lather.  This one lathers great.  It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  I&#x27;m not going to review the scent because that is such a matter of personal taste.  I like the quality of this shower gel and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my wonderful but very selective teenage granddaughter --&lt;br /&gt;and she loved the fragrance &amp; product.</li>
    <li> Was litte iffy if the scent would be really strong but it had a light scent and liked how it lathered up.</li>
    <li> love the fragrance.  it was packaged properly.</li>
    <li> smells great pretty big worth the price</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with the Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar Lotion. So  I was hoping the scent carried over well as some gels I have tried have missed the mark by a large margin. Not with this gel it smells just as good with the same light warm vanilla scent. The gel lathers very well and rinses off easily. I would recommend it for all ages.</li>
    <li> With Midwest winters and the dryness, this gel is great on the skin and the smell is soothing and not flowery.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, makes a good gift for people who like vanilla smells and it&#x27;s not too strong which is nice for sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> Love this product thats why I keep ordering it, in large quantitys it is hard to find this particular product</li>
    <li> I bought this shower gel as a present for my sister.  I knew she liked, and occasionally wore, a vanilla-scented perfume and that she used a shower gel, so I was very hopeful she&#x27;d like this one. Well, I batted 1,000!  She says that it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever used.  First, the gel is thick, unctuous, and a very little goes a long way. And, most importantly, the smell is &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or conflict with her perfume.  If you know someone, or if you are someone like my sister, I&#x27;d definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but if you can go to the store you will get a better value and the container seems to look fresher and less handled, but the smell is beautiful.</li>
    <li> The products are just at expected.  Delivery was on time, with adequate packaging!  Now I smell noice when am going to bed.  lolol.</li>
    <li> This product came in great condition, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  The smell wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a not as sweet as I thought. On the plus side though, it does smell like what it says on the bottle and the size was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for an aroma that is soft and  not to sweet, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is a very very nice product.  Just tried it for the first time, and I loved it.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, is not greasy and lasts a long time.  It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This company always produces a great product.never tried this fragrance before but love it. Lots of suds and many compliments on aroma. Than you bath and body works.</li>
