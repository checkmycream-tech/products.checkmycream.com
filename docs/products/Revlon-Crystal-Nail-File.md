### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>When I lost it during a move from one apartment to another, I was devastated--it was the perfect nail file.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great!</li>
      <li>bought this thinking it would be a GREAT thing!</li>
      <li>A perfect match with the Quimica Alemana nail hardener.</li>
      <li>I lost my wonderful glass nail file and I bought this one.</li>
      <li>Like others, I purchased this item after using a crystal nail file and being impressed with the results, though I dropped it</li>
      <li>It worked great until I ran it over with my wheeled chair</li>
      <li>It worked great for about three or four fingernails, after that - worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thought it would be a great buy since it was a crystal nail file, and carried the Revlon name</li>
      <li>and they are great.</li>
      <li>Except...those cost about $10 each, bought at a craft fair.</li>
      <li>and I loved it, which was why I was trying to replace it.</li>
      <li>I had an Essie file I loved until it broke.</li>
      <li>A piece of notebook paper would do just as good a job as Revlon crystal files.</li>
      <li>Came in a timely manner, so I would say the seller is good.</li>
      <li>I used to have a glass file from one of the Avon lines, and I loved it.</li>
      <li>The first glass file I had was wonderful</li>
      <li>I love this file!</li>
      <li>love this!  </li>
      <li>It is my own fault that I let a SA influence my purchase instead of you guys.</li>
      <li>I turned on the light and had a good look.  </li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that because it was revlon that it would be a great bargain however, there is a reason that it was worth 20¢. I got to use it once</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work all that great the first time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more, as I&#x27;ve given most of mine away, and want more to give this year as stocking gifts for friends and family.</li>
      <li>I have an onyx stone file for oover 20 years and it does a much better job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it for the top of nail too.</li>
      <li>Way better ratings.</li>
      <li>These work perfectly, have had them for a year now, and there is no difference in the ones I use almost daily.</li>
      <li>recommend you save your money and buy a better quality glass file.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because Revlon products are generally okay</li>
      <li>I already had a Vitry glass file that i love, from France.  </li>
      <li>In the package, it looked like it would work just as well as the ceramic one, maybe even better.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, it worked beautifully....</li>
      <li>After using a friend&#x27;s crystal file, I loved it so much I bought this one.</li>
      <li>The little case is just perfect to be able to carry it around in my purse, I think I might even buy another.</li>
      <li>This particular item is good for about 1-2 uses, after which the texture is no longer sufficient to get any results from it.</li>
      <li>so it was smooth as, well, glass.</li>
      <li>I bought  this at Target because it was on sale and came with a free nail shining buffing pad.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hers was different, and I was impressed by how fast it filed my nails and how reuseable it was.</li>
      <li>Through doing some online research, I read many recommendations to use a crystal nail file, which is supposedly more gentle and does not cause nails to peel.  </li>
      <li>They are very nice but larger than I had seen</li>
      <li>I was excited to try a crystal nail</li>
      <li>She said she was pretty sure it was a fluke as she had never heard of problems with it before.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t even worth one star!</li>
      <li>I told her if that is true,  </li>
      <li>I received a full refund.</li>
      <li>It looks like there are other crystal files on Amazon that have great ratings.  </li>
      <li>The glass turned smooth after the first use.</li>
      <li>told her I was going to write a review on Amazon and lo and behold, I am not the first to have this problem!</li>
      <li>At first, it seemed adequate, although nothing miraculous.  </li>
      <li>Recommended to anyone who gives themselves a manicure; nice smooth finish and less stress than metal.</li>
      <li>I found a package of 9 files on Amazon, Cheeky brand, for about $15.00 which are exactly like the ones I had before the Walgreen&#x27;s purchase.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what the title says.  </li>
      <li>Like everyone else here, I purchased a product that basically stopped working after the first  3-4 times that I used it.</li>
      <li>The first time I cut my nails and used this file,</li>
      <li>I read the information on the package,  and it sounded like exactly what I need.  </li>
      <li>first impression was that neither side was as fine and smooth as my other file.  </li>
      <li>I expected this to be the smooth crystal nail file, but it&#x27;s pretty rough and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as a crystal file I bought.</li>
      <li>I have it to my 12 year old daughter and bought a true set of crystal files.</li>
      <li>everyone else has stated, it wore out after a few light uses and there are bald spots on the glass, which is now entirely smooth.</li>
      <li>I bought it on a whim at Target without researching it because I lost a more expensive glass nail file that was amazing for the year that I had it.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t really know what to say about a nail file</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rinsed it, stored it in a drawer in its case, didn&#x27;t use it on anything but fingernails, and it should have lasted much longer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had el cheapo emery boards that lasted a whole lot longer.  </li>
      <li>Surface becomes smooth after only three uses.</li>
      <li>The file work very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really bummed about this file...</li>
      <li>I followed the packaging instructions to \\&quot;rinse and reuse,\\&quot; but rinsing did absolutely nothing to restore the surface grip.  </li>
      <li>(I also cut my nails regularly and dont like sharp nails because if I have an itch and go to scratch with sharp nails, I end up doing more harm than good.)</li>
      <li>after using it a few times, I tried to clean it and reuse it, but it&#x27;s still smooth and the lost texture will not return.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought it thinking it was better for my nails which are weak and peel easily</li>
      <li>It takes forever to file them down and at most it does not even do it.</li>
      <li>The most abrasive emery boards are less damaging to my nails than this nail file.</li>
      <li>A cheap emery would last far longer.</li>
      <li>Since, I&#x27;ve ordered 2 new ceramic ones and plan on only ever using this in an emergency or most likely throwing it away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After it was clean and dry a replaced it in my nail implement box.  </li>
      <li>When I went to the store to find a new one, they didnt carry the ceramic one anymore and had this one instead.</li>
      <li>I decided to be vigilant and clean it with alcohol afterwards in case she had a fungus or some other infection that I didn&#x27;t want to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like everyone else, was totally deceived into thinking this was a smart buy.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t the description or the picture showed it clearly.</li>
      <li>It is very grainy and coarse.</li>
      <li>Revlon&#x27;s nail file is a complete piece of garbage that wore out within a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle, and that is the only star I can give it.  </li>
      <li>B0017KCPUK Revlon Crystal Nail File]] cost me nearly $9 at Walgreens.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely worn out does&#x27;t file at all.</li>
      <li>I just had to add my two cents worth to the other reviews here.    </li>
      <li>Supposed to be gentle and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>Is thin an authentic Revlon file?</li>
      <li>unfortunately purchased this to replace an awesome nail file purchased from duane reade that was broken by the TSA or frontier airlines.  </li>
      <li>I could actually feel the file wearing down after its first use...</li>
      <li>but apparently everyone else on here is having the same issue.</li>
      <li>for the first few times I used it.</li>
      <li>This file worked well the first few times</li>
      <li>it got dull fairly quickly</li>
      <li>but the file surface went dull quickly.</li>
      <li>This product lasts no longer than an emery board and no where near as long as a regular metal file.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it got dull fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Revlon released this product. This is the worst crystal nail file I have EVER used. It is very grainy and coarse. The most abrasive emery boards are less damaging to my nails than this nail file. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I read the information on the package,  and it sounded like exactly what I need.  Supposed to be gentle and long lasting.  It is gentle, and that is the only star I can give it.  After only 2 uses, shaping my natural nails (no synthetics), the file texture has worn off,  and the tool is totally useless.  I rinsed it,  as per directions, and that did nothing to improve the performance.  This [[ASIN:B0017KCPUK Revlon Crystal Nail File]] cost me nearly $9 at Walgreens.  I&#x27;ve had inexpensive emery files that lasted lots longer than this piece of junk.    Update, 19 July 2010: I returned this product to the store where I purchased it, and the clerk in the cosmetics department said that this is \\&quot;not intended for filing nails,  only for smoothing the nail surface\\&quot;.  I told her if that is true,  then it should be called something other than a nail file.  I received a full refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this crystal file to add to my collection of nail implements.  I already had a Vitry glass file that i love, from France.  I expected this file to be the same type product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that neither side was as fine and smooth as my other file.  After I used it a couple of times, using my other one to finish up, I used it on my mother.  I decided to be vigilant and clean it with alcohol afterwards in case she had a fungus or some other infection that I didn&#x27;t want to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it was clean and dry a replaced it in my nail implement box.  When I took it out to use it again, STRANGELY, it didn&#x27;t seem to work.  I turned on the light and had a good look.  The \\&quot;texture\\&quot; seemed to be missing on the places I had used it on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Revlon customer service and asked, \\&quot;What is going on here?  Did the texture melt in the alcohol or just wear off?  Is this file not made from etched glass like the others I have?\\&quot;  The customer service lady was polite but had no answer and said she would look into it and get back to me.  She said she was pretty sure it was a fluke as she had never heard of problems with it before.  She would send me a coupon.  Thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her I was going to write a review on Amazon and lo and behold, I am not the first to have this problem!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this crystal file. After using a friend&#x27;s crystal file, I loved it so much I bought this one. Hers was different, and I was impressed by how fast it filed my nails and how reuseable it was. This one is not useable after only 3 uses. As others said, the surface is supposed to go back to a sandpaper-like texture after it is rinsed, and this one does not. I&#x27;m going to try a different one.</li>
    <li> I had an Essie file I loved until it broke. I ordered this because Revlon products are generally okay and it was cheaper than Essie. Now I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews. Just as other reviewers note, the file becomes smooth and useless after a few uses. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target. The glass turned smooth after the first use. Won&#x27;t file nails anymore. Don&#x27;t buy this! Waste of money. Go search for the OPI one. Way better ratings.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read some of these reviews before buying this nail file.  It could not be worse!!!!  After just a couple of uses, you have nothing.  The finish is gone!!!  A real waste of money!!!  It isn&#x27;t even worth one star!</li>
    <li> I used to have a glass file from one of the Avon lines, and I loved it. When I lost it during a move from one apartment to another, I was devastated--it was the perfect nail file. I saw this product at Target and assumed it would be of similar quality, if not better. (After all, this is Revlon we&#x27;re talking about!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blinded by trust, I purchased the file and brought it home. Sure enough, it worked beautifully.... for the first few times I used it. Like everyone else here, I purchased a product that basically stopped working after the first  3-4 times that I used it. Minimal use wore off the rough crystal edging and left smooth, useless patches that appear to have no remedy. I&#x27;ve scoured the internet looking for ways to fix it, but the only solution seems to be buying another nail file. Obviously, I will not be purchasing another from Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing and certainly not what the product advertised.</li>
    <li> I work with metal and use my finger nails to feel burrs and sharp edges so occasionally I create sharp \\&quot;dips\\&quot; in them. (I also cut my nails regularly and dont like sharp nails because if I have an itch and go to scratch with sharp nails, I end up doing more harm than good.) With that said, I had a Revlon ceramic nail file that lasted forever and that I broke accidently. When I went to the store to find a new one, they didnt carry the ceramic one anymore and had this one instead. In the package, it looked like it would work just as well as the ceramic one, maybe even better. I was wrong. The first time I cut my nails and used this file, the \\&quot;crystals\\&quot; on it wore off completely (in the spots that got used) leaving the smooth surface that you see on the handle and rendering those parts useless. For $7.50 (about the same price I paid for the ceramic one at the same store) I expected this one to last longer than one use. Also it doesnt work as well as the ceramic ones. Since, I&#x27;ve ordered 2 new ceramic ones and plan on only ever using this in an emergency or most likely throwing it away. Complete waste of time and money. Wouldnt recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, was totally deceived into thinking this was a smart buy.  Totally false!!!! My paper files last longer!!!!!!!!  Now, who will give me a refund???!!!!!  Not worth even one cent.  Well be calling Revlon soon.  Wished Amazon had a ZERO star option.</li>
    <li> I would give this product zero stars, if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone else has stated, it wore out after a few light uses and there are bald spots on the glass, which is now entirely smooth. I have the weakest nails ever - and I got two uses out of it. I did rinse it and let it dry, as directed, and it didn&#x27;t help. In fact, I was so ticked, I decided to google the nail file and see if it was a dud and lo and behold, I saw it had an unbelievably low rating on Amazon. I&#x27;m so mad I wasted my money, I figured I would post my negative review too and warn off any would be buyers about this defective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you save your money and buy a better quality glass file.</li>
    <li> I had a glass file I purchased at the farmers market for about the same price.  It worked great until I ran it over with my wheeled chair and it broke.  So when I saw the Revlon one, I immediately purchased it.  It lasted about 5 uses.  Now it is going in the trash and I am going to see if I can find one from the Farmers Market again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Target a month ago. I&#x27;m absolutely disappointed with it. After using it for the second time, it wore off and it started to chip my nails! Now I can only use the tips of it because the middle part is has become only \\&quot;crystal\\&quot;. I had one product like this a couple of years ago (I can&#x27;t recall the brand) and never, never happened something like this . Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail file 1 week ago and it&#x27;s already dull and unusable.  Like the other user said, rinsing the file does not restore the grinding surface.</li>
    <li> It took a single filing of ten nails to remove all of the abrasive material at the edges of the file. This product lasts no longer than an emery board and no where near as long as a regular metal file.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another glass file that I had lost-it&#x27;s useless after the first use. The part that I had used had worn down so it was smooth as, well, glass. I rinsed it like they say to, but to no effect. The first glass file I had was wonderful and I loved it, which was why I was trying to replace it. This one is terrible, though.</li>
    <li> Bought at CVS thinking it would last longer than an emery board. Joke&#x27;s on me. Surface becomes smooth after only three uses. Rinsing does NOT restore the texture. Waste of money. It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I just had to add my two cents worth to the other reviews here.    I bought my Revlon crystal nail file at Osco for 7.95.  I used it a couple of times and started having problems with it filing.  I washed it with soap and water, but it didn&#x27;t help at all.  The finish seemed to be worn away already.  I came on here to see if anyone else was having problems with it and was glad to see I wasn&#x27;t crazy.      If you&#x27;re considering buying this file, please do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  It looks like there are other crystal files on Amazon that have great ratings.  I&#x27;m trying Sassella .</li>
    <li> I have been using crystal nail files for 7 years and this is the worst I have ever used. After only one use I could not use it anymore. I rinsed it and let dry it as the instruction says but it is totally smooth and useless.</li>
    <li> I bought  this at Target because it was on sale and came with a free nail shining buffing pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a great buy since it was a crystal nail file, and carried the Revlon name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong! I could actually feel the file wearing down after its first use... after using it a few times, I tried to clean it and reuse it, but it&#x27;s still smooth and the lost texture will not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really bummed about this file...</li>
    <li> I recently bought this crystal file in order to shape my nails for classical guitar playing.  The nail file works well, but it only last a few day before it became very dull and unusable.    Stay away from this product. A cheap emery would last far longer.</li>
    <li> I feel the same way all of you do about this nail file... used for a few days and it became smooth and useless.  I contacted Revlon and they&#x27;re sending me $10 in Revlon certificates and a metal file.</li>
    <li> Absolute crap! I got this and it wasn&#x27;t anything like advertised! I have it to my 12 year old daughter and bought a true set of crystal files. This wears out and it&#x27;s coated not etched.</li>
    <li> Same experience as read in all other customers reviews.. Bought it thinking it was better for my nails which are weak and peel easily but after few times it was completely worn off... A glass nail file is supposed to last a lot longer than a regular one but this one was a big dissapointment. Is thin an authentic Revlon file? Hard to believe.</li>
    <li> I see that another reviewer had the same experience I had with this Revlon file from Walgreen&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t take mine back, although I had paid about $9 for it also. I found a package of 9 files on Amazon, Cheeky brand, for about $15.00 which are exactly like the ones I had before the Walgreen&#x27;s purchase. Except...those cost about $10 each, bought at a craft fair. These work perfectly, have had them for a year now, and there is no difference in the ones I use almost daily. I&#x27;m ordering more, as I&#x27;ve given most of mine away, and want more to give this year as stocking gifts for friends and family. They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 or 4 times now.  The last time I used it I realized that the etching on the glass is not part of the glass.  Its added to it and wears off.  This is just worthless. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> I love this file! The little case is just perfect to be able to carry it around in my purse, I think I might even buy another.</li>
    <li> My nails are very thin and weak, and I have a horrible problem with peeling in particular.  Through doing some online research, I read many recommendations to use a crystal nail file, which is supposedly more gentle and does not cause nails to peel.  Although it was difficult for me to shell out close to ten dollars for this product, I figured that if it solved my peeling problem, it would be worth it, and so I purchased this Revlon crystal file in my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the file was a huge disappointment.  At first, it seemed adequate, although nothing miraculous.  However, I never had the opportunity to determine whether this file would actually help my nails stop peeling, as after just a few uses (I would say less than five), the surface of the file became so worn down that it was totally ineffective.  I followed the packaging instructions to \\&quot;rinse and reuse,\\&quot; but rinsing did absolutely nothing to restore the surface grip.  Therefore, after owning this file for only a few weeks, I found it to be totally unusable.  (As a side note, I did contact Revlon to complain; rather than to refund my money, they gave me a 5-dollar off coupon towards another purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I can find no redeeming qualities about this product whatsoever, and I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like others have already said, this product wears out after several uses.  I bought it on a whim at Target without researching it because I lost a more expensive glass nail file that was amazing for the year that I had it.  I am extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I lost my wonderful glass nail file and I bought this one. (can&#x27;t remember the name!!) It didn&#x27;t work all that great the first time. I rinsed it like you&#x27;re supposed to...and it never worked again....AT ALL. Terrible product!!</li>
    <li> Do.Not.Buy.    I was excited to try a crystal nail file-- smidge more expensive, but it&#x27;s supposed to last!!  I wish I had read these reviews before wasting my $8 bucks in a local store.  :(      I was just online trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, as that the surface is SMOOTH and useless.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times!! SOOO disappointing!!!  What the heck were they thinking?!?!?!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t really know what to say about a nail file but it is glass and it will break if you drop it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS FILE!!! it wares down after 2 uses, and that is the maximum. it just becomes a worthless piece of shiny glass. i spent $9 at a drugstore on this piece of junk. awful!!</li>
    <li> They are very nice but larger than I had seen</li>
    <li> I believed the Revlon brand name stood for something.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately purchased this to replace an awesome nail file purchased from duane reade that was broken by the TSA or frontier airlines.  Revlon&#x27;s nail file is a complete piece of garbage that wore out within a couple of weeks.  There are actual bald spots on the file where there are supposed to be abrasive ridges.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what the title says.  In other words .. don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  If I could give it zero stars, I would have.</li>
    <li> The file work very well.  It took me a few trys to get used to it as it is thick and does not always manuver easilty.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner, so I would say the seller is good. But I was disappointed in the product, which is no reflection on the seller. I expected this to be the smooth crystal nail file, but it&#x27;s pretty rough and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as a crystal file I bought. I don&#x27;t the description or the picture showed it clearly.</li>
    <li> I always read amazon reviews. Period. I base my purchases off them and haven&#x27;t been steered wrong yet so when I actually went to a store to purchase a nail file with a coupon I had for Ulta... did I check the reviews? No. It is my own fault that I let a SA influence my purchase instead of you guys. There was a blub on the back of the package about returns if the product failed which of course it would never do that!?! (yeah, that&#x27;s sarcasm there for you). I demolished the packaging trying to get the file out so there is no hope of a return. It lasted 2 uses. If only I could find another DiamondDeb like my mom had. That thing was indestructible.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that because it was revlon that it would be a great bargain however, there is a reason that it was worth 20¢. I got to use it once and it had already became dull on me. It&#x27;s a waste of time even ordering it. I&#x27;m upset that I had to give it one star. I&#x27;d like go give it a zero.&lt;br /&gt;STAND CLEAR.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP BROWSING.</li>
    <li> Like others, I purchased this item after using a crystal nail file and being impressed with the results, though I dropped it and it shattered so I needed a replacement. This particular item is good for about 1-2 uses, after which the texture is no longer sufficient to get any results from it. I rinsed it, stored it in a drawer in its case, didn&#x27;t use it on anything but fingernails, and it should have lasted much longer. Save your money and time and buy a different crystal/glass file.</li>
    <li> Recommended to anyone who gives themselves a manicure; nice smooth finish and less stress than metal. A perfect match with the Quimica Alemana nail hardener.</li>
    <li> The only reason i gave these one star is because you have to give a product some sort of star rating to post a review.  They should get zero stars.  I, too, noticed the smooth-looking places on both of my Revlon crystal nail files after four or five uses.  I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t washed them correctly, although I&#x27;ll be darned if I know how one could wash them incorrectly, so I tried washing again.  These things are totally worthless.  I&#x27;ve had el cheapo emery boards that lasted a whole lot longer.  I&#x27;ve started to throw them away several times but kept trying to use them.  A piece of notebook paper would do just as good a job as Revlon crystal files.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money and time.  It worked great for about three or four fingernails, after that - worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This file worked well the first few times I used it  but the file surface went dull quickly. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I do not find this product to file my nails at all.  It takes forever to file them down and at most it does not even do it.I have an onyx stone file for oover 20 years and it does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I would defi nitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the Revlon Crystal Nail file I have ever used I bought it at a local supermarket I spend a lot of money for trash.  I got some of the cheeky files here for almost nothing and they are great., Dont waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> bought this thinking it would be a GREAT thing! Long lasting and all! Not exactly. A couples filings in and the thing is useless. It&#x27;s completely worn out does&#x27;t file at all. I thought it was just me but apparently everyone else on here is having the same issue. What a waste</li>
    <li> love this!  Feels like glass and files quicker and smoother than emery boards.  I use it for the top of nail too.</li>
