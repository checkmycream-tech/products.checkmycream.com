### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It fits perfectly in my hand and gets the job done quicker than the infant one.</li>
      <li>I used this to slip trail on my ceramic pieces, works great!</li>
      <li>Great for cleaning out the ears on a basset hound.  </li>
      <li>Great just what I needed</li>
      <li>you are reading this review because you are looking for a good ear or nose syringe, forget this one.  </li>
      <li>Just as good as the one at the hospital.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I would have been more charitable with the stars if I had not had the good fortune to find the Cara Ear Syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel there are even more uses for me to explore for it.</li>
      <li>We thought the size would allow more pressure with the flow of the ear wash</li>
      <li>even more thanks:D</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have good suction as expressed by another reviewer.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to all.</li>
      <li>Have also used fit or oiling shredder.  </li>
      <li>This was a useful tool, among others to clean the Parker 61 fountain pen.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipment also.</li>
      <li>Good size for clearing out baby nose and toddler noses, works much better than the small ones.</li>
      <li>a little bigger than i anticipated, but awesome!</li>
      <li>These squeeze-bulb syringes let me safely water my plants in place, without having to constantly carry all the pots to the kitchen sink!  </li>
      <li>I am still using the first one after more than 3 years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has pretty much ended the problem of repeated infections.  </li>
      <li>Very soft just like the ones only in hospitals love it</li>
      <li>Large size, very inexpensive and no shipping charge.  </li>
      <li>But much to my amazement, this syringe has lasted, and lasted, and lasted.  </li>
      <li>Still looking for a decent aspirator for my son...</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>Our toddler hides them when she gets a chance, so I&#x27;m ordering a few more.  </li>
      <li>Used maybe a dozen times, washed only with hot tap water.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to clean, not strong enough to damage pens.</li>
      <li>So far, we didn&#x27;t have any of them split, though we don&#x27;t use them every day.</li>
      <li>Does the same thing, maybe a little better, easier to use, because it is bigger.</li>
      <li>But the others, too, split in the same fashion after much too short a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and not big.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my dog, it&#x27;s soft enough and with durable plastic.  </li>

<li> For the past 5 or 6 years I have irrigating my nasal passages daily with a solution of salt and soda.  </li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But much to my disappointment, after no more than 2 months of daily use the bulb split, much like those that have the seam.  </li>
<li> Albeit odd, perhaps, I routinely use these 3-ounce Hand (squeeze) Bulb Ear Syringes for watering beneath the leaves of my indoor houseplants.  </li>
<li> This is really bulky and awkward to use for our purpose.</li>
<li> Even though a little more  expensive than the others, I bought several, expecting the worst.  </li>
<li> I bought this syringe because it does not have a seam running around the diameter of the bulb, which is the weak spot of the syringes that do.&lt;br</li>
<li> but it just makes the process complicated.</li>

    <li> It works as it should. I have had no problems with this syringe.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work. Still looking for a decent aspirator for my son... any suggestions...</li>
    <li> Albeit odd, perhaps, I routinely use these 3-ounce Hand (squeeze) Bulb Ear Syringes for watering beneath the leaves of my indoor houseplants.  When you have hardwood floors like I do, you get persnickety about liquids dribbling onto the floor.  These squeeze-bulb syringes let me safely water my plants in place, without having to constantly carry all the pots to the kitchen sink!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good size for clearing out baby nose and toddler noses, works much better than the small ones. We bought three of them about a year ago. So far, we didn&#x27;t have any of them split, though we don&#x27;t use them every day. Our toddler hides them when she gets a chance, so I&#x27;m ordering a few more.  Update November 4 2015 One has broken after being used a few times a month for saline wash, but the others seem to be fine.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dog, it&#x27;s soft enough and with durable plastic.  Great for cleaning out the ears on a basset hound.  Quick shipment also.</li>
    <li> I used this to slip trail on my ceramic pieces, works great! a little bigger than i anticipated, but awesome!</li>
    <li> I use it for ear and eye washes.  Have also used fit or oiling shredder.  I feel there are even more uses for me to explore for it.</li>
    <li> This was a useful tool, among others to clean the Parker 61 fountain pen.  It is strong enough to clean, not strong enough to damage pens.</li>
    <li> For the past 5 or 6 years I have irrigating my nasal passages daily with a solution of salt and soda.  This has pretty much ended the problem of repeated infections.  During this time I have used a number of syringes.  This was one of them.  I bought this syringe because it does not have a seam running around the diameter of the bulb, which is the weak spot of the syringes that do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But much to my disappointment, after no more than 2 months of daily use the bulb split, much like those that have the seam.  Because I had learned from my previous experience that I should buy several, I did when I ordered these.  But the others, too, split in the same fashion after much too short a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I would have been more charitable with the stars if I had not had the good fortune to find the Cara Ear Syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay no attention to &amp;#34;ear&amp;#34;, it works well for the nose, also.  Even though a little more  expensive than the others, I bought several, expecting the worst.  But much to my amazement, this syringe has lasted, and lasted, and lasted.  I am still using the first one after more than 3 years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this review because you are looking for a good ear or nose syringe, forget this one.  It won&#x27;t last but a fraction of the time the Cara syringe will.</li>
    <li> Large size, very inexpensive and no shipping charge.  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> High quality. Just as good as the one at the hospital.</li>
    <li> Great just what I needed</li>
    <li> Very soft just like the ones only in hospitals love it but my child loves it even more thanks:D</li>
    <li> This syringe does the job well.  It&#x27;s soft and not big.  So it is not hard to use in little noses.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last.  Used maybe a dozen times, washed only with hot tap water. The seam split.</li>
    <li> This is the same quality as the one the hospital sends home with your newborn.  Helps those babies who can blow their noses yet.</li>
    <li> This is somewhat bigger than the ones that come with the Murine kit.  Does the same thing, maybe a little better, easier to use, because it is bigger.</li>
    <li> I love it! I couldn&#x27;t find this size anywhere. It fits perfectly in my hand and gets the job done quicker than the infant one.</li>
    <li> This is really bulky and awkward to use for our purpose. It doesn&#x27;t really have good suction as expressed by another reviewer.  We use it for cleaning cats ears and too often you have to \\&quot;re grip\\&quot; the bulb to get the product to dispense.  We thought the size would allow more pressure with the flow of the ear wash but it just makes the process complicated. You almost need two hands to use it and as our cats are not inclined to cooperate, one hand it engaged in maintaining the head lock.</li>
