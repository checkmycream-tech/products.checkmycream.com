      <li>These strips are just awesome.  </li>

      <li>I love these strips!</li>
      <li>And now love it because of its size!</li>
      <li>Great for precise shaping.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d buy them again just to have them handy.</li>
      <li>I found that if you apply the strips to the area you&#x27;d like to remove hair from, and press gently, and immediately remove the strip as directed, these work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to do my own eyebrows with wax</li>
      <li>warm them, 2.</li>
      <li>i am ordering more of those and if it lasts a couple of weeks or more i will be quite happy.</li>
      <li>The way it is described misleads a consumer into thinking the wax strips will be shaped to give you a nice curved brow.</li>
      <li>Try Sally Hansen&#x27;s, the work much better for a better price!</li>
      <li>The best part is that I haven&#x27;t paid to get my eyebrows professionally waxed since purchasing this product.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyebrow waxing products and strips over the years and these are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
      <li>Super easy to use and works great.  </li>
      <li>Not a product for full waxing, but great to clean up strays etc.  </li>
      <li>is a refreshing experience.</li>
      <li>it is ok.</li>
      <li>Most of the time they&#x27;ll remove hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>First is that I can wax my own eyebrows with these!</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I also love the azulene oil that comes with out.</li>
      <li>maybe better for someone with thinner hair.</li>
      <li>I wish it was more oval for shaping.</li>
      <li>I love these strips for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>i love it more because it is a painless experience.</li>
      <li>I really do love the ease of this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still great and easy and pulls the hair out really well.</li>
      <li>I trim the strips to fit better to the arch of my brow.  </li>
      <li>I thought that since I loved these so much I would go ahead and get their warmer, wax and fabric strips</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>Easy for novices.</li>
      <li>This is SO easy</li>
      <li>it was easy, it did not irritate my skin, no rashes or redness.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend for others to give it a try</li>
      <li>The quality and easy of use is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t write many product reviews, but these strips are awesome.  </li>
      <li>Will not work whatsoever for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but they still work fine.  </li>
      <li>applying, I make sure to quickly rub my finger over the strip after I apply it to whichever spot, going in the direction of the hairs.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and clean up is a breeze.</li>
      <li>With the mixed reviews, I figured this product had a 50/50 chance of working, or maybe only work moderately well, but I&#x27;m very happy to say this product works perfectly.</li>
      <li>They make me happy and last about two months</li>
      <li>The wax is nice and sticky, so it really picks up a lot of hair when you use it</li>
      <li>Good to use between professional waxings.  </li>
      <li>quick and easy</li>
      <li>but well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>No cutting and shaping these strips!</li>
      <li>But once I placed the first one underneath my eyebrow, I was able to truly appreciate its size.</li>
      <li>not as user friendly as I had hoped</li>
      <li>I need to use like 8 of them to clean up my brows.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how other people are having issues with these strips, they&#x27;re literally the BEST at home waxing experience</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s not painful.</li>
      <li>The bottle of oil fell out of the package and shattered all over the place, but thankfully, using it wasn&#x27;t essential to getting a good wax with these strips.  </li>
      <li>This means I get 4 full waxings for under $10.</li>
      <li>I also tried it on my upper lip and it did not work there at all - it removed no hair from that area (its not advertised to do this but seemed like a good idea</li>
      <li>Affordable, easy to use, work great, and saves me from having to go to the salon every few weeks for an eyebrow wax!</li>
      <li>These wax strips are easy to use and really yank off a lot of hair.  </li>
      <li>They actually worked better on my eyebrows than I thought they would!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly, but all I got was a sticky residue on my eyebrows, and didn&#x27;t even get rid of any hair!</li>
      <li>And they weren&#x27;t strong enough to pull most of the hairs</li>
      <li>The wax area is nice and small, so you can really get in close and get a nice clean line on your brows.</li>
      <li>You probably don&#x27;t have to, since it&#x27;s a pretty soft substance, but I feel this warms the goo up and adheres it more to the hairs, just as with true wax.</li>
      <li>You must warm the strip between your hands for a tiny bit to make them work well.</li>
      <li>(dont know what it is called right now) but that could be because i am a newbie and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a bit of experience waxing my own brows with anything from pre-cut and shaped wax strips to hot wax to larger strips.</li>
      <li>The clear paper makes it easy to see what I am doing.</li>
      <li>always wash my face a good half hour before and don&#x27;t apply anything else.</li>
      <li>i flinched before taking the strip off and then was surprised at how easy and painless it was.</li>
      <li>I personally enjoy these strips and they work much better than other types that I&#x27;ve tried, IMO.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These strips are just awesome.  I didn&#x27;t buy them for a few months after using them for a couple of years and there was no substitution. I really missed them</li>
    <li> They worked pretty well for the price, but I did have an allergic reaction and my skin around my eyebrows broke out after using this. So be cautious if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They remove larger hairs alright, but always leave at least 1/3. Will not work whatsoever for fine hair.  I went through 8 strips and got about 10 hairs out total. Buy something else.  (and yes, i read the directions and followed them.)</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use and worked great compared to other stuff she has used in the past. Strongly recommend for others to give it a try</li>
    <li> I thought these were terrible. Threw the whole box away after one use. They didnt remove any hair and were useless.</li>
    <li> not as user friendly as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I use these on my husband&#x27;s eyebrows and they work wonders. No pain, no residue, works every time!! They come in small easy to use little wax strips.</li>
    <li> These work and do not cause damage to your skin. I wish they were a bit cheaper but less expensive than going to a professional. I have purchased them four times. They are easy to use and clean up is a breeze. Comes with oil to help reduce redness.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write many product reviews, but these strips are awesome.  Affordable, easy to use, work great, and saves me from having to go to the salon every few weeks for an eyebrow wax!</li>
    <li> When I first received these, I was surprised/slightly disappointed by how small they were. But once I placed the first one underneath my eyebrow, I was able to truly appreciate its size. And now love it because of its size! It fits and angles really well to help shape while waxing. On a slightly unfortunate note, you will have to use the strips in pairs of two since they are packaged that way. But I had no problem using them up! They actually worked better on my eyebrows than I thought they would! You still will have to tweeze leftover stray hairs, but in comparison, it is not a big deal. These have worked better than any other wax I have tried for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I would use nothing else for eyebrow grooming.  The strips work effectively, can be used several times for complete hair removal.  One improvement I would like is some curve in the strips for easier placement.</li>
    <li> Wish there was more in the pack because they are little mini- wax strips so it takes around 4-5 just to do 1 full eyebrow but these are perfect for cleaning up straggling hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to do my own eyebrows with wax so I could have them shaped just like I want them but was too afraid to use hot wax--this product was a win-win. With the mixed reviews, I figured this product had a 50/50 chance of working, or maybe only work moderately well, but I&#x27;m very happy to say this product works perfectly. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. I followed the directions and it worked as well as going to the salon where I usually get them waxed. I have very thick bushy eyebrows naturally and I hadn&#x27;t had my brows waxed in 3 months before using this.  1.  I put on the strip where i wanted in the direction my eyebrows grow.  2.  Pressed down on the strip to make sure it was secured where I wanted it.  3.  Ripped it off in the opposite direction my eyebrows grow and voila!!  BTW, yes it hurts but far less than the women at the salons who I think secretly get a kick out of causing that pain.  Very happy customer!!</li>
    <li> I had great hopes but these just don&#x27;t work.  I followed the directions, but it was just a failure.  Sigh)</li>
    <li> These simply don&#x27;t work. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there must be something I can do to try to get them to work for me, but I only tried a couple times and gave up for now. They didn&#x27;t pull any hair out for me at all. Maybe I&#x27;ll try again soon. I really want them to work because they would be such an easy solution to quick hair removal.</li>
    <li> Good to use between professional waxings.  I trim the strips to fit better to the arch of my brow.  The only draw back is it can be hard to remove the residue but using the enclosed oil help some.</li>
    <li> These seemed like a great option for brow maintenance between shaping appts. However, in a nutshell, they do not work. They don&#x27;t have enough grabbing power to pull the hair out. I use other Parissa products with great success, but this shortcut falls short.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is easy to use and avoids all the inconveniences of messy warm waxing specially for small facial areas.</li>
    <li> quick and easy I like it lots</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great for precise shaping. Not messy. Painless! What else can you ask for? Been using these for years with great results.  They even work on my thick brows.</li>
    <li> These work really well, However as some reviews state they are pretty small stripes. I had to use at least 4 per eye brow just for some maintenance. If you really needed a good waxing or have thick eyebrows you&#x27;d probably use a whole box. That being said I was satisfied with how they worked and will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> These suck! Not only are they super tiny, they don&#x27;t remove my thick, coarse eyebrows. I do not recommend. Blah!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly for those little blonde hairs under eye brows.  It didn&#x27;t remove any hairs just dead skin perhaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyebrow waxing products and strips over the years and these are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve tried!  The wax area is nice and small, so you can really get in close and get a nice clean line on your brows. The wax is nice and sticky, so it really picks up a lot of hair when you use it (you can only use it once though, not multiple times like some wax strips I&#x27;ve used).  I&#x27;ve never had any reactions to the wax or the oil since I&#x27;ve started using them (admittedly, I only use the oil on occasion). The best part is that I haven&#x27;t paid to get my eyebrows professionally waxed since purchasing this product.  I am planning to purchase the other Parissa wax products to use to remove the peach fuzz on the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this and I found the eye brow one. UNLESS you have baby eyebrows, not sure how anyone can use just one.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have always opted threading for eyebrows above all other methods available for the same. However I was presently surprised when I used Parissa mini wax strips for those quick touch ups before attending unexpected parties or guests...it was easy, it did not irritate my skin, no rashes or redness. You will certainly feel that you have waxed your eyebrows but that&#x27;s not painful.It comes with a tiny bottle of oil which works well. But one really really needs to be careful while using it because it really does wax all the hair in one pull,so if you place it wrong ..it&#x27;s a disaster !! Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product. I have given it 4 stars because I think that the price of the product is too much for the quantity of wax strips we receive in the box.</li>
    <li> I love these strips! I hate going to get my eye brows done because I do not like people close to my face and these do the trick very nicely! I have had them for a month and just ordered a new box</li>
    <li> These strips didn&#x27;t work at all. I followed the directions exactly, but all I got was a sticky residue on my eyebrows, and didn&#x27;t even get rid of any hair!</li>
    <li> I tried this brand out and was very pleased.  Super easy to use and works great.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> These are tiny but work well</li>
    <li> fast delivery...product works great...quick and no mess!</li>
    <li> I want to give this six stars. I have tried so many wax strips in the past only to find most of them stick to my skin without really removing any hair. I end up just stuck with a bunch of goo on my face. Parissa strips are the only ones that seem to work on my skin. These strip are tiny but they work wonders at helping me shape my brow. I usually use this in conjunction with the facial/body strips which I use for between the brows - aka, no mans land. I originally bought these at that big store with the red bulls eye logo (you know what I&#x27;m talking about) but unfortunately for them they have stopped stocking them. Amazon is the only place I can get them. I truly wish Parissa would sell these in bulk with the blue oil (for removing sticky build-up) separately. Speaking of sticky build-up I barely get any. I thought that since I loved these so much I would go ahead and get their warmer, wax and fabric strips but I couldn&#x27;t get that to work as well as these. Oh well. They make me happy and last about two months (I wax my brows once a month).</li>
    <li> The one thing that would make them 5 star is if they had some CURVE to them...hard to get to the arch under the brow...</li>
    <li> These wax strips are easy to use and really yank off a lot of hair.  The bottle of oil fell out of the package and shattered all over the place, but thankfully, using it wasn&#x27;t essential to getting a good wax with these strips.  One purchase will save me hundreds of dollars spent at the beauty shop for eyebrow waxing - never mind the time saved not having to go to a salon for something I can at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little practice, I think I&#x27;ll get good at using these.</li>
    <li> These did not remove anything and left the gooey, sticky waxy stuff on my brow that I had to rub off to remove.  What a waste of money. I threw the whole box in the trash.  If I could give this product a NEGATIVE star I would times five.  What a joke of a product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t thinking it through when I ordered these in the middle of summer here in Arizona, as they did melt in transit.  However, after they cooled down to in-house temperature, I was able to try them.  I love the fact they are so small, as it really lets you get into those hard to reach areas without destroying your brow line.  Because mine melted and &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34;, I probably have a thinner layer to work with than you are supposed to but they still work fine.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews, but I guess these things work differently on people. I personally enjoy these strips and they work much better than other types that I&#x27;ve tried, IMO. I rarely get a dud unless my skin isn&#x27;t dry enough or if it&#x27;s a bit oily, and most times I can reuse each side and on various hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wash my face a good half hour before and don&#x27;t apply anything else. Although I normally use an oil-based cleanser (Orange Essence by Burt&#x27;s Bees - I have combination-dry skin), I use one without any oils in it before using these strips. One for oily skin might help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, I make sure to quickly rub my finger over the strip after I apply it to whichever spot, going in the direction of the hairs. You probably don&#x27;t have to, since it&#x27;s a pretty soft substance, but I feel this warms the goo up and adheres it more to the hairs, just as with true wax. I then quickly rip if off in the opposite direction. Sometimes I&#x27;ll rub my finger over the strips before I peel them apart, especially if I get the odd batch where it doesn&#x27;t split apart evenly on its own (rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I feel they&#x27;ve made these smaller than what they used to be, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep reordering.</li>
    <li> I use it for the lack of options but I would not suggest it to anybody especially Asians with thick black hair</li>
    <li> Wax works well, but overpriced for the small amount of tiny little strips you get.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than advertised. And they weren&#x27;t strong enough to pull most of the hairs</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. They work exactly how they are supposed and didn&#x27;t even irritate my skin. They did some serious work for my bushy eyebrows. will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use for eyebrows - the strips are just the right size and give great results ...better than the $25.00 salon results and 1/4th the price !!!!</li>
    <li> I used to use these as an upkeep between waxing. I now use them only. Not a perfect strip you will need to tweeze some of the strays but well worth the money!</li>
    <li> These did not work at all.  I was so disappointed I threw them away.</li>
    <li> I have never ever ever waxed at home before this. This is SO easy and I never mess up. The oil for after is wonderful. I save so much money waxing my own thick black eyebrows than going to a salon with this.</li>
    <li> These are good. Most of the time they&#x27;ll remove hair. You need to let them set for a minute though.</li>
    <li> Wow....just skip this one.</li>
    <li> This produce gives you very little product for your money. The way it is described misleads a consumer into thinking the wax strips will be shaped to give you a nice curved brow. Instead each of the 32 mini strips (16 strips that peel in half) is a tiny straight line. They&#x27;re not even an inch long and are ridiculously narrow. Because they are completely straight you also have to be very careful when waxing in order to get evenly curved brows on both sides. I personally would never waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> I really do love the ease of this product. No messy creams or heating gels! Everything you need is on the strip. And for some reason my skin doesn&#x27;t react as much when I use this product!</li>
    <li> not accurate in description&lt;br /&gt;difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;cannot recommend this product at all. just totally not happy with it at all</li>
    <li> My husband has long, thick eyebrows. It has served it&#x27;s purpose. I bought it to do his eyebrows not my trying to save money instead of him going to beauty shop when I can do it myself. This is the first time I have ever done this.</li>
    <li> I love these strips for eyebrows. The tiny strips make it possible to shape and clean my eyebrows with precision I can&#x27;t get with tweezers or larger strips. I only wish they were cloth and not plastic backing. I also love the azulene oil that comes with out.</li>
    <li> I needed wax strips cause I just don&#x27;t have the time to sit and pluck one hair at a time nor do I want to pluck one hair at a time. Bought these strips and they work great.. I just wish the wax strips were bigger.. Delivery was fast and on time. Thank You!</li>
    <li> granted, it took me 10 out of the 32 strips to wax my eye brows and the spot between my eye brows (dont know what it is called right now) but that could be because i am a newbie and this is my first time waxing my eye brows.i just took them out one by one before and to be able to do it all in less than five minutes is a refreshing experience. i love it more because it is a painless experience. and this is coming from someone whose pain tolerance level is below zero. i flinched before taking the strip off and then was surprised at how easy and painless it was. just follow the instructions and remove the hair against the hair growth, the only time i didnt do that nothing came off. i am ordering more of those and if it lasts a couple of weeks or more i will be quite happy.</li>
    <li> Is not worth the money at all. The strips were all dried up.</li>
    <li> The dual strips worked well for me. Not to painful and removed the hair on the first application.</li>
    <li> Not sticky enough to get the thick brow hairs. Also, they&#x27;re tiny. I prefer a bit larger ones I can cut to size. Try Sally Hansen&#x27;s, the work much better for a better price!</li>
    <li> It could be me but this did not remove all the hair under the strip. So I&#x27;ll be looking for another brow solution since I can&#x27;t see well enough to tweeze. I also tried it on my upper lip and it did not work there at all - it removed no hair from that area (its not advertised to do this but seemed like a good idea so I experimented). I like the Parissa green wax that comes in its own &amp;#34;pan&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works great. No mess. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I love these little eyebrow strips.  They do a great job on my eyebrows, without redness or irritation.  They include azulene oil, which helps get any little bits of wax off your skin when you&#x27;re done.  I used to hate having to make salon appointments, spend at least $15 (and then add tip), and have to drive to the salon.  Now, when I notice my brows getting crazy, I take out a couple of strips and two minutes later, I&#x27;m done.  I&#x27;ve used them for years- I love them.</li>
    <li> This product is really good! The size is perfect for the eyebrow area! My sister has a unibrow and she always uses these and loves them! I don&#x27;t have a unibrow but my eyebrows are pretty bushy so I use these often and adore them!</li>
    <li> the product itself is great, but my vial of the oil came in broken though</li>
    <li> These worked for what I required them for, but they were smaller than I expected (even given that they&#x27;re labeled &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;). I assumed that they would be a *bit* smaller than Parissa&#x27;s other facial waxing strips, but they actually turned out to be much, much smaller. Other than that, these strips were easy to use, didn&#x27;t hurt, and didn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on my skin. I like this brand, but in the future it might be worth my while to get regular sized strips and trim them down.</li>
    <li> The quality and easy of use is fantastic. A lot of waxes irritate my skin and make me break out but this does not. They are super easy to use and removes hair well without having to mess with hot wax. My only complaint is that the strips are REALLY mini. I need to use like 8 of them to clean up my brows. I like that they are small but they are a little too small. I don&#x27;t see what you could possibly need them this small for.</li>
    <li> There are two things I like about these. First is that I can wax my own eyebrows with these! The clear paper makes it easy to see what I am doing. And I like it that the wax is pre-shaped, I don&#x27;t have to worry about wax pooling or going somewhere I don&#x27;t want it and then waxing off too much (I did that to my daughter once, not good.)  The only bad part is that the shape is a rectangle- I wish it was more oval for shaping. But it&#x27;s still great and easy and pulls the hair out really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a bit of experience waxing my own brows with anything from pre-cut and shaped wax strips to hot wax to larger strips. I generally pay about $10 to have my brows waxed in a salon. The results are always great but I leave with a very red face and can&#x27;t go out in public for the rest of the day. Previously, when I&#x27;ve waxed at home I&#x27;ve used a Sally Hansen product which I had to cut and often left me with too little brow after waxing. I found these super simple to use and for the price, I have enough to do my brows 3 more times (4 times total). In my opinion, that&#x27;s a great deal compared to the $40 I&#x27;d spend to have this done in a salon 4 times! I found that if you apply the strips to the area you&#x27;d like to remove hair from, and press gently, and immediately remove the strip as directed, these work wonderfully. I have coarse eyebrows and I had no problem with these strips. I really don&#x27;t understand how other people are having issues with these strips, they&#x27;re literally the BEST at home waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had. I was actually hesitant to purchase these strips because of all the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance for myself. I had a bit of redness after waxing, however, considering I have very sensitive skin, the redness was almost nonexistent. It was gone in less than 15 minutes. I am purchasing the body wax strips and another box of these immediately!</li>
    <li> This works really well!</li>
    <li> Not a product for full waxing, but great to clean up strays etc.  The price is good so I&#x27;d buy them again just to have them handy. The strips can be cut off into individual sections, so you could carry them in your make up bag for travel, gym etc.</li>
    <li> These did not work at all. You can put it on but it was not strong enough to rip eyebrow hair out.</li>
    <li> While these are very small, and one must use 2-3 on each brow to get the job done, I still LOVE these in terms of how well they pull hair. I found them on Amazon a year ago, but now I&#x27;ve discovered Ulta has them for cheaper, especially when on sale. I am Portuguese . . . . meaning thick, dark hair and brows. You must warm the strip between your hands for a tiny bit to make them work well. Then, they take your brow and leave nothing behind if done right. Remember: 1. warm them, 2. smooth it down, 3. pull quickly in the opposite direction of growth. There is no pain or blood, both of which I see at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 32 strips they advertise are actually only 16 (counts double when separated). When I am not just touching up, I use four strips total. This means I get 4 full waxings for under $10. My salon charges that for one, so it&#x27;s still a deal. If I&#x27;m feeling cheap, I get the other pack (that I use on my upper lip) and cut those into smaller strips.  Usually I just get both boxes though. Make sure it&#x27;s the pink boxes! The others don&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for not giving them a full 5 stars (besides the 32 count propaganda) is that they aren&#x27;t arch shaped, which makes it much harder.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! No cutting and shaping these strips!</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough fro brows -- even my teenagers brows.</li>
    <li> Great product removes hair well</li>
    <li> Crrrrapppppy eyebrow wax</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate making a trip to the salon just for my eyebrows so I&#x27;ve been sampling different at home wax sets. This is by far the best. No messy wax to microwave, then stir, then apply, etc...it&#x27;s simply little strips of wax that you put wherever you want and pull. That simple. After having mine waxed by an &amp;#34;eyebrow specialist&amp;#34; and threaded, this is the least painful by far. I&#x27;ve seen reviews that say they are too small but I think they&#x27;re just perfect. They are small enough so beginners won&#x27;t make too much damage if they make a mistake. I went a full month without plucking just to see how these would work and they removed my thick hair with ease. The only suggestion is to not press down the strip too hard. I did on one pull and it left a tiny irritation. This wax is strong, you hardly have to put any pressure on the strip to remove the hair.</li>
    <li> No heating, no waiting, no mess.  Easy for novices. Does the job.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Easy to use, they do a great job and the oil the icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> it is ok. maybe better for someone with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> They get the job done when I don&#x27;t have time for threading. Doesn&#x27;t require one to be skilled in the use of regular waxing, which is a plus. They&#x27;re not perfect but helps keeps things clean.</li>
