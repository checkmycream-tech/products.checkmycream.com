      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I also like that my hair continues to look good for a couple of days without any effort beyond a light morning brushing when I use this</li>
      <li>This is a great product, but it costs too much!</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind it, then it does a fine job!</li>
      <li>And I love that I can fill a travel container and take it with me, unlike the mousse I used to use.</li>
      <li>Love  Bed Head products.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>Pump is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what I always used before, but I found that the Foxy Curls combined with a smooth, straightening blow out leave my hair feeling thicker and holds the smooth style better than Control Freak.  </li>
      <li>This product is a strong styling gel that accentuates the curls.  </li>
      <li>This one leaves my hair a bit sticky &amp; the smell is really strong.</li>
      <li>Removed one star because of its strong scent.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but it will wave and get frizzy.</li>
      <li>It also has a very fruity smell to it, that my daughter liked.</li>
      <li>The spray is light..</li>
      <li>with many of these types of styling products, don&#x27;t apply too much or you&#x27;ll have sticky hair.  </li>
      <li>I put it on damp hair and it keeps my hair looking good all day long.</li>
      <li>It makes my natural curls look even better.</li>
      <li>Love this spray on my fine curls, isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down.</li>
      <li>I also recommend Rock Star sugar spray for extra volume :)</li>
      <li>With Foxy Curls, I actually like my hair on those days even better than on the days I shampoo.</li>
      <li>A nice extra is that if I get caught out in heavy rain, the nicely curled style manages to recover when it again</li>
      <li>I use this whole line.</li>
      <li>This curl spray smells really fruity</li>
      <li>--it can be a bit sticky if you use too much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those times when I&#x27;m smoothing my hair into a long, straight style, I&#x27;ve found that I prefer Foxy Curls over Tigi&#x27;s Control Freak lotion which is their product intended for smooth styles.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good for the days when I don&#x27;t shampoo, and I just spray lighly on dry hair and scrunch, bend over and fluff my hair.  </li>
      <li>The curls are more defined and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair will curl naturally without any encouragement, I really like the difference that this spray makes.  </li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;ve positioned my part, I take several minutes to scrunch my hair beginning at the top and working down to the ends.</li>
      <li>And as far as its use, I can&#x27;t tell a difference when I use it or don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really desire to smell like a middle schooler.</li>
      <li>It was wrapped very securly, and the bottle had no defects spray is working properly</li>
      <li>I have wavy full fluffy hair.</li>
      <li>She has very thick hair that tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>Then I let it dry either naturally or with a blowdryer with diffuser.  </li>
      <li>Really helps define my curls without weighing them down!</li>

    <li> My hair likes to frizz out when the humidity is up. This products helps reduce that frizz. I put it on damp hair and it keeps my hair looking good all day long.</li>
    <li> It was wrapped very securly, and the bottle had no defects spray is working properly</li>
    <li> Great if you want curls!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This curl spray smells really fruity and I&#x27;m in my 20s. I don&#x27;t really desire to smell like a middle schooler. And as far as its use, I can&#x27;t tell a difference when I use it or don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling product out there. It makes my natural curls look even better. The curls are more defined and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> horrible drys hair out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product ever since Abba discontinued its really good hair setting products.  My hair dresser &amp; I tried Bed Head &amp; it works quite well--it can be a bit sticky if you use too much.</li>
    <li> I have used this curl spray for years. It is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is fine, but it will wave and get frizzy. This somehow manages to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the wave pattern and keep it. I don&#x27;t put it on dripping wet hair, but wait for it to air dry a bit, then put a little creamy leave-in conditioner on the ends. After that I spray the &amp;#34;Foxy Curls&amp;#34; all over and scrunch it. The Foxy Curls locks in the wave pattern. I finish drying and scrunching with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Tigi Bed Head products for years and this one, Foxy Curls, is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and slightly curly and falls a bit below shoulder length.  Even though my hair will curl naturally without any encouragement, I really like the difference that this spray makes.  After towel drying, I just spritz it over all my hair and then comb it through with a wide-toothed comb.  Once I&#x27;ve positioned my part, I take several minutes to scrunch my hair beginning at the top and working down to the ends. Then I let it dry either naturally or with a blowdryer with diffuser.  A nice extra is that if I get caught out in heavy rain, the nicely curled style manages to recover when it again dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those times when I&#x27;m smoothing my hair into a long, straight style, I&#x27;ve found that I prefer Foxy Curls over Tigi&#x27;s Control Freak lotion which is their product intended for smooth styles.  It&#x27;s what I always used before, but I found that the Foxy Curls combined with a smooth, straightening blow out leave my hair feeling thicker and holds the smooth style better than Control Freak.  I also like that my hair continues to look good for a couple of days without any effort beyond a light morning brushing when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many of these types of styling products, don&#x27;t apply too much or you&#x27;ll have sticky hair.  One drawback to it and the reason I deducted 1 star from my rating:  it&#x27;s a bit drying compared to the Control Freak and some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, promoting lively curls for my otherwise thin and frizzy hair. Love  Bed Head products. I also recommend Rock Star sugar spray for extra volume :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it costs too much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I purchased the curl cream as well, and my hair retains its curl and is shiny. Only downside: it has an odd smell. But if you don&#x27;t mind it, then it does a fine job!</li>
    <li> Tigi Bed Head Foxy Curls is just what I was looking for!  I have thick layered collarbone-length hair that curls near my face and has pronounced waves in the back when it&#x27;s longer.  This product is a strong styling gel that accentuates the curls.  I have used it sucessfully before blow drying, but I prefer to spray it on towel dried hair and scrunch my hair with my hands.  I get lots of curls, front and back, with this method and they last all day.  It&#x27;s also good for the days when I don&#x27;t shampoo, and I just spray lighly on dry hair and scrunch, bend over and fluff my hair.  I get lots of volume.  With Foxy Curls, I actually like my hair on those days even better than on the days I shampoo.</li>
    <li> Works great in my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very thick hair that tangles easily.  This helps with the tangles and the struggle to get her hair combed.</li>
    <li> I use this whole line. I have wavy full fluffy hair. The spray is light.. Pump is easy to use. Smells fruity.</li>
    <li> Really helps define my curls without weighing them down!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair extremely sticky, I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Curls Rock spray. This one leaves my hair a bit sticky &amp; the smell is really strong. It&#x27;ll work in a pinch though.</li>
    <li> Holds curl well, without making hair all stiff.  It also has a very fruity smell to it, that my daughter liked.</li>
    <li> Love this spray on my fine curls, isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down. And I love that I can fill a travel container and take it with me, unlike the mousse I used to use.</li>
    <li> Removed one star because of its strong scent.  Behaves like a hairspray for curls.</li>
    <li> Helps my hair curl up and isn&#x27;t too stiff. Works well on day two as well as day one. Good price and great service.</li>
    <li> Its stiff like hair spray, they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say you need a sense of humor to use their products,</li>
