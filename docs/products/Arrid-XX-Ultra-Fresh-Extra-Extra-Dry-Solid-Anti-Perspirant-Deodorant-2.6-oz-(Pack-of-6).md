    <li> Hmm such a clean smell</li>
    <li> Arrid has always kept me drier than any other brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s, Gillette gel, Speed Stick, Old Spice, Arm &amp; Hammer and Mitchum. Arrid out performs them all&lt;br /&gt;because they got the fragrance formula right, can use it every day. The bar sticks the best to my body, not my clothes which is my biggest complaint about the others. Never the less, some chalking will be evident on dark dress shirts.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to see this on your site.  While I have always used the gel  I thought I would try the dry.  Wrong.  It is too dry putting it on.  Doesn&#x27;t go on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite deodorant. Great fresh scent and not overpowering. It works and works. Wouldn&#x27;t even consider a different product.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> The only one that works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! Since I was 13 yrs. old I&#x27;ve used this deodorant ( I&#x27;m a woman ) and I swear I have NEVER had body odor under my arms. Not even sweat. Even when I exercise...the absolute best. Try it,  I promise you will not have any doubts.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I use it every day, although I believe I could probably use it every other day.  It has never let me down.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant/antiperspirant available to humankind.  No gimmicks, no nonsense - just does what it promises to do and the scent is pleasant as well.  I buy these every few months to restock and love the convenience of multiple sticks at a time.  You can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite deodorant.  It smells like a slightly scented bar of soap. It is the only deodorant that works all day for me...I am a female in my mid-forties. The scent is neutral enough to be used by either a man or woman. It smells clean and fresh, not like perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> The deodorant is good but my guy is still sweating. I guess it just didn&#x27;t do for him. He sweats even while he is cold. The first few days seemed like it would work but then it didn&#x27;t. I still recommend.  It might work on you.</li>
    <li> This is right on . I have used it for years and find nothing wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE FOUND THIS DEODORANT PERFECT FOR ME....IT IS ALMOST ODORLESS, AND HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN  FOR THE MANY YEARS I HAVE USED IT....RECOMMEND HIGHLY....AND ALWAYS CONTINUE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON IN A SIX PACK.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, especially if you sweat a lot and also have sensitive skin. This stuff actually had me scratching my under arms it was that bad plus it didn&#x27;t last more than a few hours, which compared to the original which can last two days if you only sweat a little or not at all.  I usually get the ORIGINAL scent but this was all they had and in a two for one pack. it&#x27;s going in the trash as soon as I can find my original scent. Of maybe I can find a use for it repelling bugs or something - it is THAT bad a smell.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant that I use!</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering unscented, I MADE A BIG MISTAKE, WIL DO BETTER THE NEXT TIME.</li>
    <li> I think this is better than what is at walmart. It&#x27;s heavy but lasts all day</li>
