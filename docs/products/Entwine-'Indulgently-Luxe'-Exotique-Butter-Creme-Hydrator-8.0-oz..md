    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. But each to his own.</li>
    <li> I use this as the cream in my &amp;#34;LOC&amp;#34;  It is the best.  It smells great and leaves my hair soft.  Sometime I use it  to a refresh a twist out a couple of days after I used a gel, or curl definer...it is all I need to refresh my twist out.  It makes it soft, shiny and pretty--no build up.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product, no matter the cost, it is worth every penny! Go buy it! NOW!  Yes now!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product that I have purchased in a long while. Leaves your hair soft and manageable. Works great on natural hair</li>
    <li> I did my research and this product did not let me down. I have VERY thick 4a type hair and moisturizing can be a task, but nonetheless given the use of this product my hair was moisturized and soft. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my TWA and my hair loves it. 4C by traditional hair typing. my hair is soft and retains moisture for a few days. now that is it growing out I hope it still is as effective. i use it with the styler for my coil outs and twist out and they are perfect. please note it does not play well with other product lines except for maybe the eco styler gel.</li>
    <li> There is really no words to say about this product.  I order over and over.. my hair is natural. and it loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy, this moisturizer will keep even the driest hair soft. A little goes a long way so the product last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product line by my hairdresser (who specializes in natural hair care). The Entwine Exotique Butter Creme Hydrator is a great product because it really does moisturize your hair and make it very soft and manageable without feeling greasy.  I was searching for a product that would really soften my hair and help me be able to comb it without the breakage. And my two-strand twistouts give me a soft curly fro that&#x27;s not crunchy and dried out.  For those with natural hair: these products will allow you to wear your hair with confidence!!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for my thick 4 c hair and this is the best yet.  It does not work well with some oils but I have never gotten so many curls with my twist outs before with the Hrdrator along with the styling jelly.  I really works!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for natural hair especially for twisting or just to moisturize. Get this product. I was all out and it was shipped just in time.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I have a twa, so I haven&#x27;t used it for twist outs or anything, just to keep hair moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d paid closer attention to those style videos and no been so completely sucked in by the hype. I ordered three products from the entwine website a few weeks ago: the hydrator, the manipulator, and the edge control creme. NONE of these products worked well on my 4b hair. I think maybe if I&#x27;d blown it out or. . .something it might have liked these products better, because it seems to me that these are for slightly straighter hair (with a looser curl pattern).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the hydrator inparticular, I have to say that it did NOTHING for me. I think it wasn&#x27;t thick enough; it seems designed not to weigh someone&#x27;s hair down--but mine NEEDS that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manipulator really dried my hair out (although I used it in conjunction with my regular conditioner, as some have suggested doing), and my hair just basically laughed at the edge control stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the products together, and I&#x27;ve used them alone. They&#x27;re not for me, and if you&#x27;ve got 4b or 4c hair, chances are they&#x27;re not for you either.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it gets my hair super soft and really curly. I will definatelly try it again</li>
    <li> great product but must be used with The Manipulator&#x27; Creme Jelle Styler, for great results.  Highly recommend for those with natural hair</li>
    <li> This hydrator has changed my life.  My hair was so brittle and was breaking off.  I almost lost all my hair when Nubia Hair Studio Hair specialist in the Bronx introduced me to the products and saved me from going bald.  I am so very happy I learned about these products because I realize how great it is to have a full head of hair.  Thanks to the entwine line of products and answered prayers.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling managable. If your hair is hard to manage use this , if u can the entire line is awesome</li>
    <li> this Exotique Butter Cream Hydrator is the best, I love how my hair feels after using it. I have natural hair and wear wash and goes a lot EBCH keeps my hair from being dry!!!!! I received items in a timely manner, it was not 8oz jar it was 2 4oz jars which was fine, but the add should have said that.</li>
