      <li>Having now experienced this is like a dream come true of awakening 30 or 40 years</li>

      <li>Now, it&#x27;s like the supplements I take and the foods I eat are being assimilated better.</li>
      <li>I know it was the supplement that caused my pain because when I reduced the dosage to one pill every two days I didn&#x27;t experience any more of the side effects.</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>I have had more energy and feel so much better on it.  </li>
      <li>and I will buy some more.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Ok product just not for me</li>
      <li>and hopefully he will not have to take Blood Pressure medicine any more.</li>
      <li>i love the idea of this product</li>
      <li>Perhaps by themselves, they won&#x27;t add up to this stunning an effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the benefits of the product and it&#x27;s continuing news letters and update.</li>
      <li>ok but not reordering this product</li>
      <li>The reason I dropped to one a day when I started taking the niacin is that both supplements are vasodialators and will therefore drop your blood pressure - and I cannot take more than 500 mg of Niacin with the 2 Neo40</li>
      <li>MUCH MORE ENERGY  </li>
      <li>Plus, he is feeling much more energetic.  </li>
      <li>Got to order more Neo 40, it works for me.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in my fingers and toes insofar as the dryness in my skin being relieved with more moist skin and being warmer.  </li>
      <li>do find I am more thirsty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>how much more energy I have.</li>
      <li>had excellent service from the supplier and will order from them in the future.</li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>Of course if you have the test strips, you would be able to judge that easily.</li>
      <li>it is safe and easy to take,</li>
      <li>I have felt healthy (normal) during this time but suspect some good effect from the product.</li>
      <li>These easy  to take lozenges make my blood flow better and therefore feed the important parts of my body.</li>
      <li>I liked this item because of the reviews,I will try and have used it one day and saw it working right away.</li>
      <li>But for now this supplement is priceless to me when used with the other one.  </li>
      <li>Easy to work with.</li>
      <li>so that was fine</li>
      <li>My energy level has increased noticeably and I was able to buy the exact dosage and product from Amazon&#x27;s seller for 1/2 what my Dr&#x27;s office was needing to charge!</li>
      <li>I am 61, started taking this last month, I work for UPS, I got a great energy boost, clearer thinking, I love it and will order it every month, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>When you think about it, flow of any of the functions of life is so important that if it stops so does the body.  </li>
      <li>I seem to be more alert and more capable doing my chores now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SO far, so good.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, AT AGE 80, I FEEL A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MY CIRCULATION AND ENERGY LEVEL.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely excited about it, but it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
      <li>Adding the NEO40 to my protocol has made a significant difference for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think Nitric oxide can have many positive effects on your health</li>
      <li>boy was he right!</li>
      <li>Makes me feel full of energy.</li>
      <li>Item arrived promptly and I actually purchased this supplement twice in order to give it a fair chance.</li>
      <li>Anyone who has feasted on fresh beets will be familiar with this effect.</li>
      <li>Therefore have more patience for my fabulous 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>MY LEG CRAMPS HAVE EASED TREMENDOUSLY.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it I have had more energy and feel so much better on it.  I have a lung problem and it has helped my breathing so much.</li>
    <li> Very well done from all aspects</li>
    <li> great to lower blood pressure</li>
    <li> Good product - recommended by our Doctor for my husband who has Atrial Fib</li>
    <li> I just started to take the supplement. As far as taste it was very good. Now I must see over time if it is working. Check back in another month I will have a progress report.</li>
    <li> This is an easy way (although not inexpensive) to get a regular energy boost.</li>
    <li> I started taking this to help with my blood pressure.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and my bp has not lowered that much but it does help me sleep very well when taken at night.</li>
    <li> Got what was ordered but no evidence of improvement based on blood tests.</li>
    <li> It is fine if all you want a very expensive laxative.</li>
    <li> Total waste of my money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Wow. Really. Wow.  Last year&#x27;s trip to Breckenridge found me suffering altitude sickness for the first time. Missed out on some of the fun. Spouse did a little research for this year&#x27;s &amp;#34;out - west&amp;#34; ski trip - left Neo40 up on the desktop (very effective method BTW.) Without much of my own research I started taking them almost a month ago - we leave for the mountains in about another week (and will report back on that aspect.)  +++ Unexpected Benefit!?!?  &#x3D; MUCH MORE ENERGY  It&#x27;s crazy how much more energy I have. I am using less caffeine and sleeping better. Therefore have more patience for my fabulous 4 year old.  So why not 5 stars? ~ waiting to see if it helps with the altitude sickness ~ even though it&#x27;s been &amp;#62;2 weeks of more energy, still skeptical that it won&#x27;t last  3/9/15 UPDATE: + upgraded to 5 stars + have not noticed any ill side effects + no altitude sickness at Brian Head, Utah (with a base elevation of 9,800 ft., the common wisdom of &amp;#34;ski high, sleep low&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t apply here)    DISCLAIMER: I did also take a low dosage of acetazolamide (125 mg - twice a day) in addition to the Neo40 - I will try the Neo40 alone if my spouse doesn&#x27;t sabotage me with the one of the highest ski resort locations on our next trip + energy levels still up (no other changes in lifestyle/eating/sleep that would contribute to this) - recommended to a friend</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and has met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I think Nitric oxide can have many positive effects on your health&lt;br /&gt;and I have bought plenty of this product, but just recently read the fine print&lt;br /&gt;and much to my amazement it contains  sodium nitrate which has been linked to alzheimer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;there are bester, cheaper and safer NO products out there. I am angered that they would put this&lt;br /&gt;in the supplement, which in the end could very well cause a very serious illness.</li>
    <li> I took this for a year and reduced my plaque from 50-80% to under 50% in my carotid arteries.  Also, the velocity of blood running through increased greatly.</li>
    <li> ok but not reordering this product</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference after taking 30 tablets. Definitely not worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> it does help to control my blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Great product!  And like the good tasting lozenge.  Does increase energy and circulation!  Joy</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like any of them.</li>
    <li> I only took half a lozenge after reading some of the negative results experienced by other reviewers.  Even with that I woke up in the middle of the night with kidney pain.  That is not caused by the vitamin B dosage but something else in the product.  I recommend great caution.  I threw it away after that.</li>
    <li> Not great, not what I expected but I wont give up. I am trying to lower my blood pressure naturally All suggestions accepted.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything different after taking it for 18 days.</li>
    <li> Ok product just not for me</li>
    <li> I am 62 and have both high blood fats and erectile dysfunction - which incidentally go hand and hand according to medical research. I refuse to take statins for the high blood fats even though there is evidence they work on the ED as well. I tried Neo40 and, which I do not have feedback on the blood fat issue yet, the supplement definitely works on the ED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking 2 a day. I dropped to 1 a day so I could also take Niacin and the ED issue came back so I am back to two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: I am one of those perhaps rare folk who does not have high blood pressure even though I have high blood fats and Neo40 does drop your blood pressure. The reason I dropped to one a day when I started taking the niacin is that both supplements are vasodialators and will therefore drop your blood pressure - and I cannot take more than 500 mg of Niacin with the 2 Neo40 or I definitely get low blood pressure issues. Also, if you are taking anything like Viagra you must be careful - it works by raising Nitric Oxide in your system as well and can also double up with the Neo40 to lower your blood pressure as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there are other beet root powder supplements in the world but there is a known mechanism of saliva helping trigger the production of nitrites (and therefore nitric oxide) so Neo40 is unique (at least from what I have seen) in having it melt in your mouth as a delivery system</li>
    <li> The Neo40 lozenges seem to work quite well.  I feel better, and there seem to be measurable ways to confirm that good things are happening.  I notice my blood pressure readings tend to be a bit lower after taking the lozenges, and the test strips the company offers also show an improved reading in Nitric Oxide availability.  It&#x27;s not often you have measurable ways to confirm a product like this works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do any thing for me.</li>
    <li> I seem to be more alert and more capable doing my chores now. Been on NE040 for two months now and will have a better assessment of this product after my three month trial.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I have used 1 lozenge a day for 3 days, my blood pressure has dropped from avg,155/88 to 135/76.  Yeah!!!</li>
    <li> Neo40 increases nitric oxide levels in the blood, which improves cardiovascular function. The tablets have a pleasant taste, making them easy to take.</li>
    <li> I have been taking a supplement from nutrabio.com called Arginine Ethyl Ester, and another from same source called Citrulline malate.  Both are powders I mix with water and pomegranate juice.  I take about 3-5gm/day of the Arginine, and about 1-2grams Citrulline.  This has boosted my nitric oxide levels, which I verify by test strips.  HOWEVER, being 67 years old it only does so much.  This is because the arginine reaction slows down as you age (everything does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Neo40.  I took two lozenges/day in addition to the above.  It&#x27;s night and day.  I haven&#x27;t tried the neo40 alone, but in combination with the arginine it&#x27;s a huge boost to energy, alertness, speed of doing things in general, and overall sense of well-being and optimism.  I am aware of the simple version of why this is so, having read Dr. Bryan&#x27;s book on Nitric Oxide solutions.  Having now experienced this is like a dream come true of awakening 30 or 40 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see anyone writing about using both methods, arginine and also nitrite (the active ingredient in Neo40).  It will be my go to formula, and I will experiment from there to find out what is controlling what.  But for now this supplement is priceless to me when used with the other one.  Perhaps by themselves, they won&#x27;t add up to this stunning an effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can do the above and get half what I have got, you will be very pleased indeed.  Kudos to Dr. Bryan, his book is excellent and vital to anyone&#x27;s health.  Science has got there in this important area thanks to him.  If you go down this road and devote the time needed to read his book and delve into the definitions of the simple terms used, you will break through the fog that is killing us needlessly, and gain for yourself power and freedom over things you thought were inevitable.  There&#x27;s good hard predictable reasons that are simpler than we thought if only we can look freshly at the nitrogen compounds and how the body makes use of them.  It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
    <li> Just bullcrap to get money!&lt;br /&gt;Snake Oil! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s, and I am trying it along with my normal blood pressure medicine and it seems to take my upper number closer to 100 which is pretty good for me. It usually stays around 120. The bottom number stays about the same, between 60 and 70.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that eventually I will not need the medication. I going to be working closely with my Doctor on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO far, so good.</li>
    <li> The purchase arrived in good condition, and meets my expectations.  I could recommend this product for anyone who suspects he or she might need it.  it is safe and easy to take,</li>
    <li> By testing my NO levels using the test strips I ordered, my levels test good. When I take the Nitric Oxide  pills I feel unusually warm and sweaty, giving me indications that I might not need to take them. I am a diabetic and have hypertension; but, I didn&#x27;t see where the NO interfered with the medications I am taking. Have other customers reported these same type of warm and sweaty conditions; or, is this normal?</li>
    <li> Lots of exciting claims but no results. An expensive disappointment! Sounds good but a waste of your money! Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing.!!  A total waste for me !  I would try something else  taste like a vite c pill...way to costly for no results</li>
    <li> It is impossible to overstate the importance of nitric oxide and Neo 40 is formulated to facilitate the body&#x27;s ability to produce nitric oxide without fail. Every person on the planet over 40 years of age should be taking steps to sustain nitric oxide production and this product will deliver every time. Many negative reviews are based on the false assumption that Neo 40 should eradicate symptoms in a short period of time, and while this is true for many individuals, it typically takes 4-6 months to see maximum benefit. The fact is, regardless of symptoms or how you feel, everyone over the age of 40 should be taking this or something similar. I have been using Neo 40 for two years and have seen pretty amazing changes on my blood tests as well as in physical stamina and even my memory. I have, however, recently switched to a newer nitric oxide booster called Nitroxyl, because it is half the price and has a more comprehensive formula. It contains all of the key ingredients in Neo 40 (not the B12 or sodium nitrite) as well as many other ingredients that are backed by science and even featured in the book that I bought from Neogenis the first time I ordered Neo 40. I would recommend this product or Nitroxyl over any others on the market at the time of this writing.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my fingers and toes insofar as the dryness in my skin being relieved with more moist skin and being warmer.  This all happened within 4 days.  Got to order more Neo 40, it works for me.</li>
    <li> I used this because it was recommended by a docotr for my feet and it has helped.  I recommend it for people with foot problems.</li>
    <li> I liked this item because of the reviews,I will try and have used it one day and saw it working right away. My expectations have been met with the item, would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Pity this supplement contains mannitol, this ingredient is known to upset the stomach :-( I was taking a Sam-E supplement that contained this ingredient and it really hurt my stomach, other people complaining about mannitol too :-(</li>
    <li> Both myself and a friend started this a month ago.  My friend is already on blood pressure meds and within a few days, his blood pressure has been a good 20+ points lower.  Plus, he is feeling much more energetic.  For myself, I don&#x27;t have BP issues, but after @10 days or so, I definitely felt more energetic and mentally sharper.  Now I have started my 95 yr. old mom on it.....we shall see what she thinks!!!!</li>
    <li> Giving it 3 stars might be a little much.  I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at all. I was extremely excited about it, but it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
    <li> When you think about it, flow of any of the functions of life is so important that if it stops so does the body.  These easy  to take lozenges make my blood flow better and therefore feed the important parts of my body.</li>
    <li> My Husbands  B/P started at a  high 190/120 and with NEO40 dropped and has stayed at 126/76. I think the results speak for themselves.  His blood pressure is now normalized.  LOVE this product! I have been married 46 years and feel like we have another 46 years to go now.  THANK YOU NEO40!</li>
    <li> This item exceeds my expectation. I have tried other supplements and this is the best so far. I recommend this for people who are looking for similar supplement.</li>
    <li> This product help my husband with breathing problem when exercise or walking. I have been ordering this product for years and is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Advertised as supplements that would last a month.  The directions had weasel words that suggested the need to take 2 per day, reducing the duration of the package to 15 days.  I took them religiously and found no physical change at the end of the period.  A friend had suggested this supplement and I wasted $60 on it.</li>
    <li> I had tried Neo40 before, and am happy to say it worked well for me, especially for lowering blood pressure, with systolic readings that were widely varying from around 115 to as high as 145 to a more steady range as low as 105 to 110 in the morning to about 110 to 122 in the evening  (and I am 82 years old and do not use prescription drugs).  Also, Neo40 greatly reduced night-time leg cramps and improved my sleeping.  I took about three weeks for the full effects, especially for BP, to be realized  The only problem was the cost direct from Neogenis was too much foe me.  I tried a couple other Nitric oxide boosters, and they worked to some degree, but not nearly as well as Nio40.  Then I found the source from Amazon, which I could afford, and I have just re-ordered and intend to keep on doing so</li>
    <li> My husband has decided that he needs this product all the time.  He tried it for a month, then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;He could tell a big difference in the way he felt.  So this will be a regular order from now on.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I take one (1) lozegine once a day in the morning.  Mi nitric oxide was depleted and now it is in the low range.</li>
    <li> As a retired RN, and a lifelong advocate of organics and supplements, I was very interested in trying a nitric oxide losenge.  While it is too soon to evaluate it&#x27;s positive effects, after 3 days I have noticed one of the &amp;#34;unmentioned&amp;#34; side effects. N.O. Can cause a red discoloration of stools, mimicking blood.  Anyone who has feasted on fresh beets will be familiar with this effect. I thought I would mention this in case anyone has noticed this and become concerned. Just stop taking the supplement for 48 hours. If your stools return to normal, you can resume without worry. However, if you&#x27;ve not had a colonoscopy - go get one done!</li>
    <li> i love the idea of this product and i used it for a while, but i really didnt like the idea that the ingredients included sodium nitrate, so i eventually returned it. this was a shame because i really felt the effects pretty quickly. If you dont mind the sodium nitrate, you will feel pleasant results from this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes me feel full of energy.</li>
    <li> Everything was super will order again, thanks</li>
    <li> it contains mag.stearate a poison.Do  not buy this poisonous product.Go on line and see for yourself that mag.sterate is harmful.</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. In my case a waste of money. didn&#x27;t taste to bad, but candy would have been better buy.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it as need to talk to my doctor about it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference after taking this product for a month.  It is not worth the money in my opinion</li>
    <li> Great product that my doctor recommend.  I actually think that it is working.  BP is slowly going down.  I know that it doesn&#x27;t help when one has a stressful career.</li>
    <li> I like it, I&#x27;m definitely going to get more. Works at replenishing the nitric oxide levels in the body that are depleted as a person ages.</li>
    <li> I AM USIING THIS PRODUCT FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD TIME.  HOWEVER, AT AGE 80, I FEEL A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MY CIRCULATION AND ENERGY LEVEL.  MY LEG CRAMPS HAVE EASED TREMENDOUSLY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE OVER 50 YRS. OLD DUE TO OUR DECREASE OF MAKING OUR OWN  NITRIC OXIDE</li>
    <li> I tried to look up the ingredients but all I found was proprietary blend. So I guess its some sort of a snake oil mix</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel any different, so I doubt that this stuff is worth the money</li>
    <li> Taking these lozenges daily shows slow but steady decline in my blood pressure. Until I have my next cholesterol/triglyceride test, I can only assume those are declining at a similar rate. Very good product, and I understand, being promoted in sports medicine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much from it and at the price I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> From a saliva test I found that my nitric oxide level was depleted. I didn&#x27;t know anything about nitric oxide until my doctor explained it to me. He also gave me a pamphlet that explained all exactly why our body needs nitric oxide. I noticed a big improvement in the way I felt, in just a few days. Neo40 is pricey, but it does work, if your body is depleted of nitric oxide.</li>
    <li> I take 1 lozenge a day and it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used several nitric oxide supplements myself as well as with many of my patients over the past several years.  The product really does work in terms of nitric oxide support and I have observed positive changes in many patients, but at roughly $100 per month (taking two lozenges per day) it is not the best deal or most effective supplement out there.  I now use Nitroxyl from Pale Blue Dot, Inc and I see wonderful results with only two capsules per day, which incurs a cost of $60 every six weeks.  I would advise any consumer to compare formulas of the leading brands of nitric oxide supplements and try the best.  Nitric oxide is considered to be as important as oxygen when it comes to healthy aging, especially for the heart, arteries, and brain.  Every person over forty years of age should be taking steps to support nitric oxide, and with cursory comparison of the different formulas on the market anyone will see that the cost versus benefit here is out of balance.</li>
    <li> Did increase my nitric oxide levels.  A little pricey however.</li>
    <li> has helped my husbands blood pressure issues,  his coloring is better,  and he feels great</li>
    <li> Still too early to comment.</li>
    <li> The first two three days I felt very good then noticed my energy dropping on day 4.  Took it again on day 5 and woke up sleepy after a good night&#x27;s sleep feeling very depleted all day,  only took one,</li>
    <li> did not see any improvement</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that has prevented me from getting more is the cost, it is&lt;br /&gt;far to high for my limited budget.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now. I love the benefits of the product and it&#x27;s continuing news letters and update. Getting the product from Amazon has been a great help to me</li>
    <li> Not sure they actually do anything that I can discern, but worth the try I suppose!</li>
    <li> Best price I have found for a remarkable supplement.    My MD told me I could benefit from taking this product and boy was he right! :)    My energy level has increased noticeably and I was able to buy the exact dosage and product from Amazon&#x27;s seller for 1/2 what my Dr&#x27;s office was needing to charge!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed the product contained artificial sugars, which upset my stomach and vitamins (B&amp;C) I did not need.. The product was returned unopened..</li>
    <li> SO FAR HAVENT NOTICED MUCH....</li>
    <li> worked as promised lowered blood pressure and helped activity downstairs</li>
    <li> I am 65 and have been battling a serious condition for a number of years. Although doing all of the \\&quot;right\\&quot; lifestyle/wellness things, could never get over a health \\&quot;fragility,\\&quot; poor circulation, often out of breath, feeling weak, and many of the symptoms that come with my particular illness. Now, it&#x27;s like the supplements I take and the foods I eat are being assimilated better. NEO40 has been wonderful!    At first, I noticed a slight difference and now at the five week mark, my strength and workouts have solidly improved (in leaps and bounds).    I met Dr. Nathan Bryan, good man, fine researcher.</li>
    <li> I am not saying it is bad but don&#x27;t really think I will order any more.</li>
    <li> Seems to help chest pain and shortness of breath. I have been having less pain and it helps me relax and breathe better</li>
    <li> Yes, I see the difference.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin B12 content is far too high.  It caused me to have stabbing pains in my feet and dizzy spells, especially if&lt;br /&gt;I took two pills daily, which I needed in order to get the full benefit of the supplement.  In order to use up what I have on hand, I am taking one pill every two days.  If you bring the B12 down to a more reasonable level, let me know and I will buy some more. I would really like to take it because I received amazing results from it, but when I started having the unacceptable side effects I had to reduce the dosage and obtained only minimal benefits from it.  I know it was the supplement that caused my pain because when I reduced the dosage to one pill every two days I didn&#x27;t experience any more of the side effects. I took the two pills about 12 hours apart just like the instructions said to do. Mr. Roy Martin purchaser of NEO40</li>
    <li> Definitely works.  My doctor (MD) agrees with continuing use.</li>
    <li> Increased my energy enough to make me want to buy more.</li>
    <li> NEO 40 Really Works. Amazing product. As a health praticioner I personally use it everyday. My NO levels are now optimal and have been verified with independent testing methods.</li>
    <li> Works well have given it as gifts as well great for pre workouts and general mental acuity.  The real deal</li>
    <li> The clamed benefits / good effects from using this product are unclear(don&#x27;t jump out at you) in my experience. I intend to try up to 3 months worth and then evaluate. Currently on the 6th week. I have felt healthy (normal) during this time but suspect some good effect from the product. I need to study the situation further. The product seems too costly. The link between Nitric Oxide being good for our health and this product being good for our health cannot be rationally assumed.&lt;br /&gt;Matt C</li>
    <li> Keeping my heart healthy, circulation and overall energy and well being improved when I use it. Clearly provides many unseen benefits, you just know it&#x27;s working and you miss it when you stop! At 61, this is something I take like clockwork every morning and I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice.</li>
    <li> My Husband is 67 and a Fire Chief.  His blood Pressure was 170 ish over 110. Started taking Neo 40 one week after he retired and his blood pressure has normalized to 130/70.  HUGE difference! I just placed another order of this amazing product and will have him continue it and hopefully he will not have to take Blood Pressure medicine any more. His energy level is also up and that was good before- better now. Don&#x27;t know how it works on him, but it does. For me- My normal blood pressure is 135/80 and when I took it it made mine too low and I crashed, so I quite and gave my order to my husband. SURE WORKS WONDERS FOR HIM!</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and I actually purchased this supplement twice in order to give it a fair chance. I will not be re-ordering because I do not think that it was effective.</li>
    <li> This product did help to lower my blood pressure but it also made me have headaches.  I had to take it a night instead of during the day for that reason.</li>
    <li> Cannot say they worked all that well, but they did increase my Nitric Oxide levels a smidge.....</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised......</li>
    <li> My circulation has never been better</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t pass judgement yet because I am still in the testing mode.</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and had ordered it because my hands and feet feel like they are forzen all the time. I am at the last of the first months worth of order. It is not doing a damn thing for me, except push my blood presure up. One time it got as high as 149/99. Will be requesting a refund next week. Nothing against the suppller, just the product. Jack</li>
    <li> I have been taking two each day and can see no difference in my blood pressure.  The test strips do seem to work.  I check blood pressure every day and the lozenges seem to make no difference.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and was skeptical.  Kind of expensive but happy with the results.  Ready for another order!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I found no benefits from this product. I thought I would at least get some reduction in blood pressure but nothing. A rather expensive experiment. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I took lozenges as suggested but noticed no change. A waste of money as most of these wonder cures are.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing but empty my pocket book. Would not recommend it to any one. They are price gouging just like the pharmaceutical companies.</li>
    <li> I am 50 yrs. old had suffered a mild heart attack and was put on Lipator. I changed my diet, eliminated meat and dairy ( no small feat). And live an active life style.  But despite taking every reasonable vitamin supplement the chest pains and shortness of breath continued.  To make matters worse I experienced erectile difficulties!  With virtually nothing to lose, I sent away for Neo40 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, I have not experienced any tightness or pain in my chest and my breathing is starting to clear up.  And the other problem, ........what problem.!!!  My wife told me that she thought I didn&#x27;t find her attractive anymore!  Hello!</li>
    <li> Does do anything. Complete waste of money and time. This product doesn&#x27;t do any of what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I think I should feel something if this product was helping me. I know they said maybe it would take a year depending on the person , but not feeling anything does not make me want  to spend  a year&#x27;s worth of product not to feel alittle improvement</li>
    <li> products ok, but in today&#x27;s world who has time to use a product where it has to be used alone and the info that I have about N/O products just don&#x27;t preform for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable! Added energy and drive in second day! Recommend to all!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied that it has helped my blood pressure issue where 3 MD&#x27;s could do no more than relieve the problem!..been working for 6 months now!  I used the test strips to see when I need more in my system!  Yes it has Helped Me!</li>
    <li> After multiple tries, and personnel tests, with my blood pressure device, and their test strips no change. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 cans of ProArgi-9, and so far, It seems to work. I&#x27;ve also tried L-Argentine Plus (red can) and that is also worthless.  I have not tried Circ02 and cant comment on it.  Please notice that the reviews are very polymerized.  No 3 stars?</li>
    <li> Great Product, this seller has a lowest price. You can feel it working 1 min after taking. Its great for those who don&#x27;t have time to make their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time you can make your own with Beet root power, Raw Hawthorne berry&#x27;s and L-Citrulline mixture, which are the 3 main ingredients to produce Nitric oxide. I do both, I buy Neo 40 the best product out there and make my own mixture when I have the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everal nitric oxide supplements but only this and NOxplode work. It takes a month before you can feel the effects but it is worth your patience.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using Neo-40 for 2 years now and find does help .</li>
    <li> Excellent for strengthening capillaries, supporting the cardiovascular system. Helps with high blood pressure.</li>
    <li> All I can say is when I don&#x27;t take it I can tell it;s missing and when I consume it every day I have better stamina.</li>
    <li> Prompt. Delivery to my home.  An excellent product for heart and circulation!</li>
    <li> This used to be called &amp;#34;Altitude Adapt&amp;#34;. I split the pack with my group on a ski trip. I won&#x27;t go to Colorado skiing without it. Great product.</li>
    <li> Product was very easy to take plus the &#x27;melting in the mouth&#x27; is the best way to absorb L-Arginine so that was fine but I saw no improvement in the one month I took it.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised.  Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. However, when purchasing it do not go for the two box deal. It proves to be more expensive per box than buying only 1 box.</li>
    <li> I have tried my first order of Neo 40 without the test strips and I have noticed some changes particularly in a more steady blood pressure, as opposed from my medication which takes it down but then back up again. Yes I have also begun lifestyle changes. However to answer the very negative review that says the directions \\&quot;weasel\\&quot; in the need to take 2 - in any of the advertising I have read, it advises to take two to begin with at least for the first few weeks. Of course if you have the test strips, you would be able to judge that easily. There really isn&#x27;t any \\&quot;weaseling\\&quot; about it. Each one of us is different, and you don&#x27;t just take Nitric Acid but need to produce it. The Supplement is there to help that production. Some folks of course will respond sooner than others. I have just ordered my 2nd bottle along with testing strips which would seem to be the only sure way to go. The instructions also say that it could take as long as a few months. I have had hormone replacement therapy (this isn&#x27;t) and it can take that long. You should not expect miracles in a week or two. Some people, depending on age, will react that way, not all of us will. That is how I would go into this. Know that you may have a prolonged time before you begin to notice - and get the test strips so you really know.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> pricy and little results...</li>
    <li> I tried this product after I tried the more expensive Circ02, which, from what I can discern, is almost identical and made by the same company. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between the two. I started out taking two per day and felt a real difference in my energy. I&#x27;m down to one a day, in the a.m., because I was thinking the night time lozenge might be giving me too much energy at bedtime. The lozenges have a pleasant sweet-orange taste. I will be adding this product to my permanent protocol.</li>
    <li> I am 61, started taking this last month, I work for UPS, I got a great energy boost, clearer thinking, I love it and will order it every month, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> NEO40 was introduced  to me by my Nutritional practitioner. After the saliva test strip showed almost no Nitric Oxide in my system. I started taking the lozenges twice daily as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adrenal issues and spend summers in WY at a very high elevation. Having trouble in the past adjusting to the elevation. Adding the NEO40 to my protocol has made a significant difference for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Husband also takes them twice daily and he also notices more energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find I am more thirsty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped! It is easy to take and has a pleasant flavor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had excellent service from the supplier and will order from them in the future.</li>
