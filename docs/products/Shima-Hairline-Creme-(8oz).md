      <li>This shampoo is silky and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to know I&#x27;m using products that have natural ingredients made for people of color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It takes care of those fly-a-ways, and lays my hair down wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best products on the market for smoothing and laying down my hair.</li>
      <li>Although I am very new to Shima and her products, upon discovery I automatically fell in love!</li>
      <li>My hair looks like that of another race because it&#x27;s so silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really good product and this is my second order.  </li>
      <li>I received the items quickly.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today and was not disappointed at all.</li>
      <li>It really does smooth as promised and like all the others products I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I love this product it makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
      <li>My hair has grown two and a half inches since March :) :)</li>
      <li>the cream is very moisturizing and has natural ingredients which i love.</li>
      <li>Ive searched high and low and i found one of a kind.</li>
      <li>Dear Shima it seem&#x27;s as if im late in putting in my review to win your [[ASIN:B005I72MXI Shima Hairline Creme (8oz)]]</li>
      <li>first i bought the hairline cream after I saw her tutorial</li>
      <li>It was soft, well moisturized, smooth, silky, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She will inform amazon executive office about the matter, thank God for amazon always ready to help!</li>
      <li>I purchased the shima hairline cream because of all the positive reveiws.</li>
      <li>I tried several other Shima products and weren&#x27;t happy with them either.</li>
      <li>i have used Shima hair cream it does help you lay down your edges, so it comes in handy when you are trying to streach your relaxer</li>
      <li>Ladies, I think you would really like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, I expected more out of this product</li>
      <li>no matter how much of the leave-in I put on my hair.</li>
      <li>and it does really work</li>
      <li>This product did nothing, absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>It did not make my edges straight at all.</li>
      <li>Great product shouldn&#x27;t only be advised for African American women.</li>
      <li>Her product is really a lifesaver for stretching relaxers.</li>
      <li>It is a really reliable product.</li>
      <li>Thanks shima</li>
      <li>Thanks Shima</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much shine</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, since I have started stretching my relaxer touch ups (4 months now), the use of shima&#x27;s hairline cream has made the process so much easier to manage my hair.  </li>
      <li>However, I learned that if I apply the creme at night and tie a scarf over my edges, they will lay down nicely and I am still able to wear my hair down.</li>
      <li>, I use it on wet and dry hair and it does great, even during my 6 month stretches when my new growth comes in.</li>
      <li>However, Shima recently had a special</li>
      <li>cream works better for me if I put it on at night and tie my hair down</li>
      <li>It is like a life saver i have very curly hair and the Hairline creme smooths my hair down and makes it feel so silky smooth as if i just had a relaxer.</li>
      <li>I like to use it on my edges and new growth.  </li>
      <li>The hairline creme lays my ends down in between relaxers -which was a big issue to me because I felt that as long as my hairline looked good that I can deal with the rest of the new growth.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>It like a soft gel with the added benefit of conditioning cream</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft, shiny and moisturized all while taming my fly-aways.</li>
      <li>I have all natural afro kinky/curly hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I enjoyed this product it was just a bit pricey for the amount you get but I admit it is a great product and works well on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or turn white. I would honestly buy again.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift. the cream is very moisturizing and has natural ingredients which i love. try this product you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I already posted a review on Shima&#x27;s oil but I didn&#x27;t say how well the creme has been working for me. My hair looks like that of another race because it&#x27;s so silky smooth. My sister keeps telling me how good it looks. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been natural all my life and sometimes i want a sleek slick ponytail so i have to use a gel. Shima hairline creme helps me to get that look without the dry affect for the alcohols and other products in gels. It keeps my hair soft, shiny and moisturized all while taming my fly-aways. 5 star product!!</li>
    <li> Ok I usually don&#x27;t write reviews because I&#x27;m to lazy but this needs to be heard I love this cream and it does really work I stopped using gels years ago because of the end result once it dried it was of course flaky dry and crunchy so I was left with a awfully dry hairline and when I stopped using gels my hair would pucker up unless I had a perm now I came across the shima oil first i bought the hairline cream after I saw her tutorial it&#x27;s totally worth it I find it hairline cream works better for me if I put it on at night and tie my hair down it does mimic a perm and keeps my edges and back neat I don&#x27;t see much shine but that&#x27;s no big deal it&#x27;s worth a try u won&#x27;t regret it this will put gel companies out of business</li>
    <li> O my god i love the shima hairline products. Ive searched high and low and i found one of a kind. This truly works and im defiently a shima girl. Thanks shima you are truly a blessing...LOve you</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market for smoothing and laying down my hair. I like to use it on my edges and new growth.  When I wear my ponytails, or french rolls, I add it to my edges, and the back of my neck. It takes care of those fly-a-ways, and lays my hair down wonderfully.  I add a little Shima oil, and I am out the door.  Also, at night, I just tie my hair up and the hairline cream keeps everything in place.  I use this on my points instead of using protein gel too.  I would use gel (brown) and it would leave a sticky residue on my phone and on my skin and around my ears.  I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to use gel anymore in order to get my hair to look like I have a relaxer on those sections.  There is no buildup, no flakes and no stickiness.  It&#x27;s a really good product and this is my second order.  Ladies, I think you would really like it.</li>
    <li> So i purchased the Shima hairline creme about 4 months ago. It is a really reliable product. I am texlaxed and although I have no problems with my hairline and hair growth along my hairline I do have problems smoothing down my edges with products that leave my hair dry. I have very tight curly edges and before purchasing the hairline creme I would tie my hair down at night wet, and wake up with (believe it or not) frizz around my edges. But after using Shimas product I no longer have problems with it. Its moisturizing and although the consistency seemed a little too thin to make a difference to me, it really does! I love the product and will continue purchasing it, I use it on wet and dry hair and it does great, even during my 6 month stretches when my new growth comes in.</li>
    <li> love shima hairline creme. best product i ever used on my edges.. very light weight and leaves my edges sleek and smooth :)</li>
    <li> To my afro-textured sisters:  This stuff is amazing!!!  I ordered my first container a little over a month ago and have been using it in addition to the oil.  Let me tell you, since I have started stretching my relaxer touch ups (4 months now), the use of shima&#x27;s hairline cream has made the process so much easier to manage my hair.  The cream makes my natural and permed hair feel so soft.  The new growth actually feels like baby hair. Wow!  I thank God for leading me to Shima&#x27;s channel on YouTube and the gift that He gave her to share with us.</li>
    <li> About a 9months a go when i began my hair journey after i discovered healthy hair care, my hair was badly damaged from putting in and taking out weaves using the glue method and my hair was nothing but a dry pealing mess. When i discovered shima youtube channel i found her products. And though i didnt always have the money to buy all of them the ones i most loved was the shima oil and this, the shima hairline creme. Amazing stuff it kept my hair always looks healthy and within a month i began to see my hair increase in volume!!! love this stuff and will love it till it dies!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Dear Shima it seem&#x27;s as if im late in putting in my review to win your [[ASIN:B005I72MXI Shima Hairline Creme (8oz)]] but I will put my review in anyway.I have not used your cream but I would love to start trying it as I have seen progress from your videos stateing that it is very good for your hair if you are looking for healthy hair as I am that is why I have come to you and i&#x27;m glad that I saw your video on youtube and cant wait to try this and your shima oil plus your other wonderful products ok take cream peace.&lt;3</li>
    <li> i have used Shima hair cream it does help you lay down your edges, so it comes in handy when you are trying to streach your relaxer</li>
    <li> I tried her oil and hairline cream. The hair line cream works great it light and smell awesome. And Iam natural and I use it to moistuirze and seal the ends of my hair, great for twist and twist outs. Ive been following shima for 3 or four years. Happy hair growing ladies.</li>
    <li> This Shima Hairline Creme works wonders for me hair. It is like a life saver i have very curly hair and the Hairline creme smooths my hair down and makes it feel so silky smooth as if i just had a relaxer. I use alot of Shima&#x27;s hair products and i can honestly say its the best!!! Thanks Shima</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot (good and bad) about the Shima hair line and when she was featured in Sister2Sister magazine I thought I&#x27;d give her products a try. I have all natural afro kinky/curly hair. I received the items quickly. They were packaged nicely. I knew the hairline cream was a joke as soon as I saw how thin and runny it was. The one and only way the hairline cream would lay down my hairline is if I wrapped my edges after I put it on. I could&#x27;ve used plain water and wrapped my hairline and gotten the same results. I&#x27;ve used all natural pomades and never had to wrap my hairline. The leave-in left my hair feeling stripped...it was a weird feeling. It made my hair tangle very badly I mean absolutely no slippage no matter how much of the leave-in I put on my hair. I used it once on one section of my hair and that was it. I had to use another product on top of the leave in. The shampoo is very stripping as well and left my hair very very dry. The only thing I did like was the oil and I will probably continue to use it. Also, who ever said her products smell good is a bold face lie. I don&#x27;t really care about a products&#x27; smell so long as it isn&#x27;t offensive and the product does what it says. Her products have a tolerable smell but they do not smell good. Shima&#x27;s hair products did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Hairline cream was like putting water on my hair kinda made it dry and leaves a dandruff like deposit when it dries.</li>
    <li> did not work at all order to lay my edges down and it did absoluty nothing, you may as well use water lay them down</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on my hair journey for a few months now (since March). Upon starting, I&#x27;ve used a lot of drug store products -a few working well and  most working not so well. So I started doing research on healthy hair care and came across Shima and her line of products. I was skeptical, I&#x27;ll admit, but then I thought to myself, I&#x27;d be spending money on hair care products anyway, why not use a product that has all natural ingredients? I order her product and tried it. Ladies, when I say the condition of my hair changed the very next day, I am not kidding with you. It changed! It was soft, well moisturized, smooth, silky, etc. I also had my mother buy her own. She loved it. The hairline creme lays my ends down in between relaxers -which was a big issue to me because I felt that as long as my hairline looked good that I can deal with the rest of the new growth. My hair has grown two and a half inches since March :) :) Please ladies, try this product and the rest of her product line. It will be well worth the money spent.    -Jenni</li>
    <li> Although I am very new to Shima and her products, upon discovery I automatically fell in love! Shima&#x27;s youtube videos are so informative yet, I was a bit skeptical to purchase her products as anyone would originally be. However, Shima recently had a special so I purchased the 4 oz. container of hairline creme and I do love it! I will say that it works best on hair that is worn pulled back (for example in a pony tail). However, I learned that if I apply the creme at night and tie a scarf over my edges, they will lay down nicely and I am still able to wear my hair down. Her product is really a lifesaver for stretching relaxers. I recently stretched my relaxer for 16 weeks with Shima&#x27;s help!</li>
    <li> I did not believe the product would work. I bought it for my sister who was going through hair loss due to health issues and it did help.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair shiny and soft. Not only do i use it on my hair line and nape area I also use it to style my hair as well.  I will give it a two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This hair creme worked as advertised and is so awesome that I just ordered my second jar. Both my stylist and I have noticed an increase in hair growth around the my hairline. I also noticed less dryness and brittle hair. As advertised, the creme didn&#x27;t crust like gels.</li>
    <li> This is a edge control creme.  Has that same odd fragrance but it does what it promises.  It like a soft gel with the added benefit of conditioning cream so your hairline will not break.  It is a great product.  I am just into smells.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I was not a believer of the shima product until I tried it for myself! It was a gift from my mom and it was the best she could have done for my recovering from heat damage natural hair. I only had the product twice but it has brought my edges back miraculously and I was very pleased.I used it to massage my scalp as well and it smells wonderful! I am a shima girl and recommend her products for all hair types no matter what race. :)</li>
    <li> This product did nothing, absolutely nothing for my hair. It did not make my edges straight at all. Like I was putting a product on my hair that did nothing of what it said it would.</li>
    <li> Nothing to note here.</li>
    <li> Every product in this line is awesome. I used this for the first time today and was not disappointed at all. It really does smooth as promised and like all the others products I&#x27;ve purchased, it lives up to it promise. I love this stuff...</li>
    <li> did not bennefit from purchasing this product, this doesnt mean i speak for everyone, it might work for someone else</li>
    <li> I want more of this stuff.  This is a miracle cream.  I wish I had an infinite amount of it.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair and this stuff doesn&#x27;t lay my edges down. I tried several other Shima products and weren&#x27;t happy with them either. I later found a video on YouTube making shea butter crème and it&#x27;s awesome my hair is moisturized and shinny and I make it myself which is liberating and cost effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I expected more out of this product and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but I love everything else....the oil, shampoo, and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product shouldn&#x27;t only be advised for African American women. This product is great on all hair types who deal with frizz and fly aways. Change the scent or leave it out its odd.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shima hairline cream because of all the positive reveiws. Well to my surprise, and now yours, this product I got on Friday. When I opened the box it seemed like it had exploded in the box and got on the other item I&lt;br /&gt;Ordered along with. Her cream was everywhere in the box pouring out on the other item. When I went to take the boxes out of the amazon box my left hand touched the loose shima cream and I felt a burning sensation at that time&lt;br /&gt;I realized that my hand was burned by touching the cream. I then bandaged the burned side of my hand and vowed&lt;br /&gt;Never to purchase this product again. On Saturday I called amazon and spoke to Jesscia in the Philippines she said&lt;br /&gt;She will inform amazon executive office about the matter, thank God for amazon always ready to help!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product did not work on my 3b, 4a/b hair.  I thought it would give me that relaxed look on my edges.  All it did was dry out my hair and it felt crunchy when it would dry.  It may work for others but I did not like how it made my hair feel.  I may try Shima&#x27;s hair oil though that seemed to get good reviews.  I will not be buy this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Shima Hair Products!!!! I&#x27;m so blessed to have found Shima Hair Products online. It was ment to be. I&#x27;ve tried every product over the counter and beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;Shima Hair Products has help my hair grow back healthier and thicker. My hair was dry, brittle, and thinning on the sides from weave damage. After I tried Shima Hair Products I finally found the cure to grow my hair.&lt;br /&gt; Shima hair cream has grown my sides back. Shima Oil gives my hair a healthy shine that&#x27;s not greasy. When you spray the Leave in Conditioner it locks in the Shima Oil to create moisture that makes your hair grow even more. Shimas Shampoo is AMAZING!!!! This shampoo is silky and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to know I&#x27;m using products that have natural ingredients made for people of color.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m finally in a long committed relationship with \\&quot;Shima Hair Products.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Shima, I thank God for your gift. Thank you, for being a blessing in my life. God Bless You.</li>
