<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t come off! Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but it defied soap and water, makeup remover, mascara remover and argon oil! Took four days before it was gone. I bought three and threw them in the trash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every mascara out there, and this one is right up there with DiorShow Mascara.  I am very pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  Makes my lashes thick, long and curved, doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.  You don&#x27;t need to use an oily eyemakeup remover to remove it, either. A+++++++</li>
    <li> This mascara is expensive! But, it works nicely. I don&#x27;t get the clumps that I typically get with other mascaras. However, I wish it lasted a bit longer, I feel like for the price I paid it should last a bit longer than the store brands....</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. My eyes are sensitive to all brands I&#x27;ve tried, even high end stores. This, I can wear all day and my eyes feel great. Lengthens and thickens lashes too. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Thank you for a wonderful product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> In a word, awesome.  Thick enough to coat well and make my lashes look thich and full but not clumpy. No smudging, no flaking.  I curl my lashes most days first, but even the days that I don&#x27;t curl and I just use the mascara I notice that my lashes look big, lush and a little curvier. Comes off easily when I wash my face with soap and water.</li>
    <li> After YEARS of searching for and throwing away drugstore brand mascaras, I am finally happy with a mascara.  No clumping or glopping, the brush loads precisely the right amount of product for long, sweep-y lashes.  I am very impressed with it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is not remarkable. I picked it up in a sample pack which is good for me because I got to try out a lot of mascaras without having to commit to a full tube. It looks good, but I prefer Buxom Buxom Lash. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last the whole day.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Badgal Lash mascara.  Every other brand I have tried over the years has always turned thick and gloppy within a couple of weeks - including the high-priced brands.  Badgal does NOT and it is so reasonably priced.  It applies evenly without gloppy bunches on my lashes! I highly recommend this mascara.    UPDATE 4/10/11: Well, I may have spoken too soon.  This particular order seems unlike my initial order.  I noticed that as I withdrew the wand from the tube that the mascara had a \\&quot;stringy tail\\&quot;.  At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem, I just blotted it off a tissue.  But now, after a couple of weeks of using I have found that this \\&quot;stringing\\&quot; continues and the mascara tends to get \\&quot;gloppy\\&quot; when I apply it.  I am going to reorder (from a different vendor, just in case) and see if the next tube is as good as the first one.  If so, BadGal Lash has sold me for life.  If not . . . .</li>
    <li> I am SO disappointed, I purchased this mascara bc I figured 30+ positive results can&#x27;t be wrong, but I only wish that I had tried using this when I first recieved it instead of waiting till my old mascara ran out. My previous mascara was by Loreal and it was 3times LESS expensive and did a MUCH better job, take my advice and RUN, this is sooooo not worth it!</li>
    <li> good volumizing and lengthening without clumps. I still need to use another mascara on just the ends but this is a great base mascara.</li>
    <li> My eyes are my favorite feature on my face, so I usually tend towards the dramatic look rather than natural. This usually means a couple extra coats of mascara... and lots of brushing out of clumps. This mascara gives me a dramatic look without clumping up at all or risking \\&quot;spider eyes\\&quot;. Also, if you fall asleep with it on at night and wake up in the morning, you don&#x27;t have \\&quot;dead hooker in the alley\\&quot; eyes, even if you&#x27;ve smushed your face against the pillow all night. BUT, it comes off very easily with nothing more than water. And as though it couldn&#x27;t get better... it smells like apples!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this mascara a lot and was always very happy but after I received it this time it does not work so good. I feel like it&#x27;s way too thick I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they changed an ingredient or maybe because I received an old product either way not happy with it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is difficult to apply. The mascara is flaky and smears extremely easily. I have never had these problems with even the cheapest mascara. Bad product.</li>
    <li> I used this mascara for 2-3 months this summer. This mascara does a good job at separating the lashes. However, I will not buy it again because, like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used before, it wears off onto the skin underneath my eyes after a couple of hours of wearing it, making me look very messy and frazzled. This happens inevitably, even if I am in air conditioning all day long, or even if I powder my under eye heavily so that the mascara can&#x27;t cling onto my natural skin oil.    I was disappointed. It&#x27;s a shame because as I said, the mascara really separates lashes beautifully. I&#x27;ve switched back to my old pharmacy-bought Maybelline mascara, which I&#x27;ve used for years. No matter the weather, regardless of whether I&#x27;m oily or sweating or not, I&#x27;ve never had racoon eyes with Maybelline.</li>
    <li> Great mascara!  No clumping, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> All signs point to this mascara being old based on the smell and goopy-ness.   Disappointed never the less.</li>
    <li> Although the mascara shipped on time as promised, I was very disappointed to see the mascara had a completely different brush and the liquid of the mascara was also not the same as bought in stores. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a great deal but no! It&#x27;s a cheap fake don&#x27;t be fooled, save your money and time. I have been using Bad Gal Lash for years and this is not the same!</li>
    <li> I have the flattest lashes ever and this mascara, in combo with the Sephora brand eyelash curler, makes my eyelashes long, thick, and curly! By far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - its totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> It was dried out when I received it, which was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  The consistency of the mascara made it impossible to put on in a decent way.  Benefit also produces &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real!&amp;#34; mascara which is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  I would advise trying &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real!&amp;#34; before wasting you money on this one.</li>
    <li> This mascara has been amazing so far and it&#x27;s awesome. I absolutely love it and I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> This is the fourth time I have purchased BadGal Lash and I hope it stays on the market forever.  It goes on easily and stays on all day without smudging or getting clumpy.  I especially appreciate that, unlike other mascaras in this price range, it doesn&#x27;t get thick and gummy within a week or two of opening it; it applies smoothly to the very end.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product twice, once a couple years ago and then just recently, thinking that with such rave reviews I may have gotten an older formula the first time around. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product works fine, but at the tune of $19 dollars I&#x27;m thinking people seem to love it and are ok to spend more dough because of the brand name. No matter which mascara I have tried I always go back to volumnious by l&#x27;oreal. It&#x27;s cheap( you can buy 3 and still be under 20 bucks), lasts about as long as the more expensive products and still gives you that bold, big lash look, you were aiming for in the first place. All in all, I won&#x27;t be returning this product, it works as it should, I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend more money on a higher end brand name when I can get the same quality else where.</li>
    <li> Bad Gal mascara is one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s to use. It makes my eyelashes look long, thick and voluminous. I switch back and forth using Bad Gal and Maybelline because Benefit products could get a little pricy and Maybelline is the second best in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few other products I buy from Benefit but their mascara is amazing, I get lots of compliments when I wear this one. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Other mascara&#x27;s either make my lashes look long and clumped together or they flake off during the day but Bad gal does not. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this mascara.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product goes on nice a dark.  The wand never clumps.and product does not go on clumpy.  When I wash my face, the products comes off like little tubes from your lashes very easily.  This is my 3rd consecutive purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> This mascara arrived as if it was used up already.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned me onto BADgal Lash Mascara and I&#x27;ve purchased it several times now.  Both tubes were barely moist of mascara to the brush.  In the past, tubes have been so overfilled, they were somewhat challenging to apply but no complaint for being overgenerous.  After a a month, both are in need of replacement.</li>
    <li> I have been using for the last 5 years on an off, by far the best.  The mascara does not dry out or start to clump for at least 4 months with everyday use.  On a sidenote, the Blue BADgal Mascara seems to be a different formula, I hate it.</li>
    <li> Like it. The brush is quite big and distributes the mascara evenly without clumping. It reminds me of DiorShow mascara that I am allergic to, unfortunately. But I am not allergic to this one. Price is fair too.</li>
    <li> i just purchased this mascara for the second timne and i really love it. It fills out my lashes and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, but I have been using this brand of mascara for years. I love it, but this particular one was possibly old or has a faulty seal. Nevertheless, it does not apply as it should and flakes off very easily (very thick and dry consistency), so I&#x27;ll have to toss it and buy a new one. Lesson learned: Buy make-up at Sephora...you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Oh I have tried them all. This is the best mascara I have ever had. I also have it in plum.  It does not clump, which is a miracle in a mascara!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and was super disappointed when it arrived and was old! I can&#x27;t even wear it because it clumps and has a funky smell... The mascara is great, but this particular item was not...</li>
    <li> It was empty when I received it. I can not believe I spent money on this. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> I love Benefit&#x27;s Bad Gal Lash. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6  years. However, the tube I received was nearly dried out and too thick. I&#x27;m super disappointed because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stock at any Sephora near me and I was excited to find it on Amazon (tax free). I&#x27;m considering trying again to see if it&#x27;s a one off. I did order Total Moisture Face Cream in the same shipment, and it was fine.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I have tried SO MANY different mascaras, and this is the first time in a long time that I have said WOW!  My lashes actually DO look volumized!  I love that with ONE COAT there was a real difference.  The lush, full brush is wonderful and separates lashes at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying BAD gal lash by Benefit!</li>
    <li> makes your lashes thick and long! What else could you need?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only mascara I use and I love it. I have super long lashes already, but this makes them thick and dark.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite mascara.  Thickens and separates like a dream!  If you use a lash primer first the mascara will last all day for sure!</li>
    <li> I have 35 mascaras at home.  I have decided to use one per month.  This is the most recent one I grabbed.  (No logic to the selection, just the first one I put my hands on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really feel like this is anything to write home about.  It&#x27;s OK but certainly not the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It does make my eyelashes darker and maybe makes them look a little thicker.  It doesn&#x27;t make them look longer.  I find that it lasts all day and is not too hard to take off with a makeup remover wipe.  It does not irritate my eyes, even with contact lenses in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is all right -- definitely not the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  But the end of the brush tends to pick up extra liquid from the tube and if I am not careful to wipe it off, it tends to get everywhere.  (Application with the brush is generally OK without a lot of mascara getting where it shouldn&#x27;t be.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it for the month but I&#x27;m not wowed and will probably move on to something else eventually.</li>
    <li> At arrival it was broken right at the cap and completely dried out. What a mess!  It was broken in two pieces - inferior.</li>
    <li> I love the REAL BADgal Lash Mascara. I was excited when I saw a supplier on Amazon selling it for a little bit cheaper than what I was paying for it at the Benefit cosmetic counter at a local department store. I ordered two. When they arrived to my house, I immediately realized it wasn&#x27;t the real Badgal mascara, instead, they were imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My favorite part of the original mascara, was the oversized wand. What I received from this Amazon supplier had a skinny wand. It also had a smell to it that the real mascara does not have. It did nothing for my lashes, which was opposite of what the Benefit mascara I had been buying for years did.  It was a fake. I highly recommend BadGAL mascara (it gets 5 stars), but be cautious and sure it is the real stuff before ordering from here. The real stuff isn&#x27;t going to cost any less than $19.</li>
    <li> WHY do I feel like I need to change?  Read a positive review &amp; ate it with a spoon...&lt;br /&gt;After applying 3 coats, it still didn&#x27;t give the &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; I like to feel on my lashes, poor consistency.  2 hours into wearing &amp; I have mascara speckles flaking onto my cheeks and &amp;#34;crumble-dy&amp;#34; looking lashes.  Save yourself and stick with the tried &amp; true: Maybelline pink &amp; green; or the higher $ version: Smashbox Photo Op Eye Brightening Mascara.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did xo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  55 yeqrs old and had stopped wearing mascara years ago. No matter what I did, curled, heated curl ,different brands, used clear or white pre-coat, my lashes looked like spikes ... sticking straight out and scary. So reading the reviews for this product was a \\&quot; oh well, I&#x27;ve blown many dollars on other mascaras, what&#x27;s one more donation to the cosmetic companies.\\&quot; Boy was I surprised and extremely pleased when my spikes curled and looked like girl lashes with just one application! No curling, just put it on and it&#x27;s lashes. Some of the bad reviews that I read didn&#x27;t give the age of the writer. To them I say too bad you didn&#x27;t find the magic wand you needed for your probably very young and already curled lashes. I have and I&#x27;m happy. Some complained about smudging, not a problem for me. I only apply one coat on my upper lids and keep my hands away from my face. I&#x27;m a retired RN and know how important it is to avoid infections by not touching your face. Glad I found this product and would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Thie mascara works great and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better one yet. Problem is that it is pretty expensive.  Love this product because it&#x27;s cheaper but same great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara--for not being waterproof, it stays on all day and never clumps, and it really makes my eye lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> I would advise people to not buy this from this dealer!!!  When I received my product the box was totally smashed in.  No big deal but when I opened it up and took the wand out to use it........the smell was terrible!!!  It was so strong and the mascara was sooooo runny.  It literally dripped off the wand onto my counter.  I have bought this exact product from Sephora and the consistency was nothing like it.  The wand was different too.  It was short and not fat like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Mascara.  I am totally disappointed.  I have never received such a poor product in all my life!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did agree to give me my money back but I had to send the product back.  I am a very busy working mom and I do not have time to package this back up and go to the post office!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!!!</li>
    <li> Benefit BADgal Lash Mascara is a staple in my Sephora cosmetic trunk. I love the mascara, no clumps, and really makes your eyes POP! The wand is magic~ big, bold, and easy to apply, lasts all day. I love this, and will keep ordering BADgal!</li>
    <li> I liked this Mascara, but it did not blow me away. I was satified with it while I was using it but I dont think I&#x27;m going to repurchase it. It did not do enough to make my lashed REALLY stand out.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara for Christmas last year and I love it! It is the perfect formula. It does everything I want it a mascara. It is not clumpy at all. My lashes doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky. I would definitely recommend this mascara to anyone. It is my go-to mascara that is with me at all times.</li>
    <li> As someone with naturally long, but straight and not super thick, eyelashes.....I LOVE this mascara. It&#x27;s buildable, so I can put on many coats and make them look so good people think they&#x27;re fake eyelashes. I will never try a different mascara, it&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper on Amazon than it is from department stores or cosmetic stores.</li>
    <li> This mascara is simply gorgeous. I usually stick to drugstore mascaras, but I bought this after all the talk my favorite Make-Up artists do about it and I am not disappointed. I love how black and full it makes my lashes. Actually, my Father was convinced I was wearing fake eyelashes (I told him no, but he didn&#x27;t believe me!) but I was just wearing this mascara. Everyone should have this in their make-up bag.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for the perfect mascara and is one of my favorites that I always have in my make-up bag (along with [[ASIN:B001DJ9H7Y Dior DiorShow Iconic Mascara Noir]] or [[ASIN:B000JZ1230 Chanel Inimitable Multi Dimensional Mascara Volume Length Curl Separation 10 Noir - Black 6g/0.21oz]]).  This is a great mascara for when you want a stronger look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is thick with a lot of bristles which does a great job of catching every lash.  I usually use 2-3 coats but only need 1-2 with this one unless I&#x27;m really going for it.  This mascara provides a darker then black look with lots of ooomph.  This will not give you the natural look.  This mascara does not leave lumps behind, flake off or make your lashes clump together.  The only flaw is that after long hours of wear, it does smudge slightly under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep this in my purse to effortlessly go from daytime to nighttime.  No matter what mascara I wear during the day, a couple of swipes of this mascara and I&#x27;m ready for the night!  I love this mascara and the dark look it provides at a reasonable price.  It never lets me down.</li>
    <li> I usually love this brand but this time it was dried out.</li>
    <li> the wand was missing brissles. mascara left me with coon eyes . just not a good product for the money</li>
    <li> The main reason I&#x27;m in love with this mascara is because it doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, which is a problem with every other type I&#x27;ve been using (Cover Girl, Maybelline, L&#x27;Oreal).  I would rate it higher if it gave me a little more volume, but it&#x27;s really a decent mascara.  I love the big brush, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it&#x27;s very creamy so it&#x27;s easy to work with, and it comes off only when it&#x27;s supposed to (when I&#x27;m taking it off at night).  I would definitely give this a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good basic mascara.</li>
    <li> Benefits BADgal Lash Mascara is my favorite out there at this time! I see a tremendous difference in the length and the thickness of my eyelashes with this mascara. It is a true black- and is not clumpy. (I do replace my mascara&#x27;s every 4 months.)  I even give this one away as a gift along with a few of my other staples, and it always gets rave reviews!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product . I love bad gal lash I have used it for years. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price it was so reasonable. The mascara I got had something wrong the printing on the tube was a different color than the others I&#x27;ve bought at ulta and sephora. The mascara was loose and very thin. Bad gal is thick. I question this product .</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara since I was 18 (now 23). When I find myself low on cash I&#x27;ll go back to whatever new drug store mascara I feel like trying and EVERY time I find myself angry that I wasted my money and go right back to this one. The tube tends to last me about 4- 6 months, great coverage (never needing touch ups during the day), doesn&#x27;t goop or clump lashes together. I&#x27;m from a family of three girls and we all use this one. But if you don&#x27;t buy the waterproof be warned it smears!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras in my lifetime and this is by far the best! It separates every single lash and the volume is amazing! every single mascara before this one stuck my lashes together and made it look like I didn&#x27;t have very many but this mascara is almost like putting on fake lashes...amazing! Just give it a try i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!! I recommend buying this for anyone who wants to find a great mascara that will not cost too much, but will get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara, makes your lashes full and thick without clumping or a bunch of junk sitting on your lashes. really recommend.</li>
    <li> Like other posts, I concur that this mascara is NOT what you&#x27;d buy in a store. There&#x27;s no way.  I was very disappointed and wish I could have returned it before trying it out. Guess I had high hopes. Back to Loreal for me! Much cheaper and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Have used this product from sephora multiple times always love it. Decided to order from Amazon, was sent a fake. Unfortunately didn&#x27;t realize until I already put the mascara on. I ended up getting a rash. Really wish I could give no stars</li>
    <li> This broke the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, but there is something wrong with the one I recieved. It was gooey and unfit to put on my lashes.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brand. I got her several of their products for stocking stuffers and she loves them all!</li>
    <li> I have thin, sparse lashes and this is the only mascara I use now--I apply several layers and have been pleased with the results for the past 2+ years I have been using it. The only problem I have is flaking, and that is usually because I keep it on too long (don&#x27;t necessarily remove all my eye makeup every night).</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. The brush is a bit big, but it helps to coat and separate every lash. I will never go back to drug store mascara.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of mascaras, from the expensive Clinique/Lancome brands to affordable Maybelline/Cover Girl brands and this one DEFINITELY is the best! No flaking, no smudging and makes my thin, frail lashes stand out, separate and appear full.  It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look fake, so if you are going for that look - forget it, but it does make me appear to have lashes in a natural way.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Anyone who is giving this a positive review is purchasing it for the first time through this seller. I had my old one to compare it to- the packaging is not the same color and the mascara itself has a HORRIBLE chemical smell to it that the real BADgal does not have. I was scared to even put it on and ended up throwing it out. Do not buy this product and purchase directly from Benefit or Sephora. The real thing is amazing :)</li>
    <li> This is by far my favourite mascara. The brush is perfect for kicking clumps to the curb and, even without a curler, it gives your lashes a wonderful curl! You don&#x27;t get as much volume with this, but it still does a fantastic job at covering every lash and really making them pop!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this instead of Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; to save money.  This only lengthens and doesn&#x27;t thicken. I ended up replacing it anyway.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what they have done this product but it clumps now and the more you try to fix your lashed. The worse your lashes look and talk about trying to get it off. I used to the this brand but it&#x27;s just terrible now.</li>
    <li> It clumps every time I use it.  I almost tossed it out after my first use; but decided to give it another try since I paid for it.  Very disappointed in this product.  :(</li>
    <li> I have been unable to find any other brand of mascara that can do to my sparse, short and fine lashes that this mascara does! If you have fine, short or light eyelashes as many of us over 50 do, this is a must have! It gives me great length and volume in one coat for during the day and when going out, I use two coats which takes them to a level I&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of having even when I was younger! Two coats and I can feel my eyelashes on my glasses! I&#x27;ve used all the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; beauty counter brands and the old standbys and nothing comes close to the performance of BAD gal lash! There is no clumping or flaking so once on, you don&#x27;t have worry about a touch up or raccoon eyes until you remove it!</li>
    <li> There was hardly any mascara in the tube. A week in and I&#x27;m out!!!</li>
    <li> Looks way too thick, clumps and falls off late in the day</li>
    <li> I am an huge fan and lover of Benefit&#x27;s BAD GAL lash. I bought this mascara online and thru amazon because I had a gift card. I was excited when my mascara came in only to be brutally disappointed. This is CLEARLY a fake, a cheap one at that. Kudos to them for replicating the packaging so well but as soon as you open it, and DEFINITELY as soon as you apply it, its VERY clear that this is not Benefit. The mascara does not glide on the way Bad Gal does, it&#x27;s clumpy and thick. The biggest thing that stood out was how flaky it was. I had raccoon eyes by lunch time with this product. I just recently moved and was going through a box when I came upon my still &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; tube of crap mascara and was so angered by the memory of me getting ripped off that I decided to write a review. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. save your money, your time and your lashes!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find this mascara a little cheaper than most stores, however, I can see why it was less expensive. This is NOT the same product of BADgal mascara you get from Benefit. The bottle looks similar, but the brush is different and the mascara itself does not apply the way it should. I have bought this mascara from Sephora before, and it is never like this. My sister said it smells like turpentine, and I would say maybe like a Sharpie too. I normally love this mascara, and would give it 5 stars if it was the actual product. If you don&#x27;t like it, I would recommend buying it from an actual store, because it is a great mascara, so don&#x27;t base it on this buyer.</li>
    <li> This mascara is OK for every day use. I haven&#x27;t noticed as much buildup or lengthening, but it covers my lashes well without clumping.</li>
    <li> Product was dry, and half empty. This usually last approx. a half a year and ended up only lasting a month.</li>
    <li> Produced the look I wanted on my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mascara, but can irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras from drug store to expensive department store brands but this remains my favorite. Good price for fabulous lashes!</li>
    <li> I loved the plum color, which they have discontinued.  So I tried the black one which they sell now.  YUCK.  It runs and creates the dreaded raccoon eyes.  I have a job with long hours and no chance to look in a mirror-- how embarrassing when I finally saw the black smudges!  I tried it several times, each time same result:  black smudges!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Bad Gal Lash.  I prefer the softer brush to the plastic brush that comes with Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara.  I have not had any issues with the mascara clumping, and it washes off relatively easy with soap and water.  It stays on even when I am sweating, and I have not had issues with raccoon eyes at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara isn&#x27;t too stiff or hard, but it&#x27;s not the softest mascara I&#x27;ve used.  I curl my eyelashes before use, and the mascara seems to help maintain the curl throughout the day (unlike They&#x27;re Real).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue I have with this product, and the reason I gave it a 4/5, is that I wish it would apply a bit more heavily or look more black on my eyelashes.  Overall, though, I like this mascara and I am definitely willing to spend the money on it.  I feel that it looks a lot better than the cheaper mascaras I used to buy, and it lasts longer, too.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this product based on other reviews, however the mascara arrived completely dried out and unusable! I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This seller sells bootleg makeup. I purchased Bad Gal Mascara and its fake. I compared the tube I bought from this seller with the one I just finished (purchased at Ulta). Everything is wrong from the brush, the formula, the tube, the ink used to print on the tube, the benefit logo etc. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me shadows like other mascaras do. Great brush, whic is very easdy to apply with. The mascara is very creamy and comes off when its supposed to.  A good, basic mascara.</li>
    <li> I wear this every day, and use an eyelash curler after I apply it. This means I have to clean my eyelash curler with makeup removal at least once a week, but that&#x27;s ok. My only nitpick with this is that the end of it tends to collect mascara, so I have to wipe it off very carefully before applying it to the inner lashes, or I get black marks on my inner eye. Not a big deal, though, still a great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF !  Works great &amp; last a long time in my book . Worth the cost I believe</li>
    <li> Was not the same as sold in stores. Product seemed aged as if the mascara was old and sitting a long time. I have previously bought this mascara from Sephora and love it. However, my year old bottle from Sephora was less dried out and still applied nicer than this one.</li>
    <li> Just another mascara, nothing special about it.....It did not give me luscious eyelashes, or volume.....just a basic mascara. Kind of disappointing.....</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! This is a knock OFF!!  Do not buy if you are familiar with the REAL brand!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years and I always look forward to the first application, which makes my lashes super full and long. I used this for the first time this morning and expected the same result, but I had to apply 3 coats and my lashes still don&#x27;t look good. This is NOT bad gal mascara! Don&#x27;t be fooled. What a rip off!</li>
    <li> The do what they claim. No clumping and longer lashes. I&#x27;ve used it only twice with no regrets.  For now They get a 4. I would recommend .</li>
    <li> Since some of the reviews here warned about the Badgal mascara being sold here on this listing as fake, I went to Sephora instead to buy the waterproof version. I was looking for a mascara that would not clump or smear, which were 2 of my biggest problems with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After curling my lashes and applying Garden Botanika&#x27;s lash primer, this mascara pretty much never clumped and it didn&#x27;t smear all that much. However, after it started to smell strange and I knew it was going bad, I threw it out and bought Mary Kay&#x27;s ultimate mascara instead. http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Kay%C2%AE-Ultimate-MascaraTM-Black/dp/B003DGKFV2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1363840846&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;mary+kay+ultimate+mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper and I found that it made my lashes thicker than Badgal. Badgal is okay, but I personally like Mary Kay&#x27;s ultimate mascara much better. Even though it clumps more than Badgal, a lash primer should sort that out and it does a better job at thickening my lashes.</li>
    <li> I only ever buy this mascara. It&#x27;s beautiful, easy and long lasting. I buy one tube a year!</li>
    <li> I received a sample size tube of this mascara in a Benefit kit for christmas. it was purchased from Ulta, so i know it wasnt bootleg. this crap was AWFUL. it did nothing but clump, did not lengthen or volumize, and smeared within an hour. i ended up throwing it out within a few days. i will stick with my Loreal Telescopic or maybelline the falsies. MUCH better product and both are under $10.</li>
    <li> This came in a sample from sephora, and I must say I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend 20 dollars on it!  It&#x27;s a fine mascara, it does what MOST mascaras do, even the cheap ones work somewhat.  But for a high end product, I&#x27;d like my money&#x27;s worth.  It didn&#x27;t flake off or run, and it doesn&#x27;t have a makeup-type smell, but it doesn&#x27;t create any sort of WOW effect..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look good up close with this mascara.  However, if you are standing about two feet away, it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s any added effect at all.  I also find the wand too big and thick.  I know  a lot of people like that...but I can&#x27;t get it close to the roots of my lashes and it doesn&#x27;t grip the lashes at all.  I sort of have to blink into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit \\&quot;they&#x27;re real!\\&quot; mascara is a much better formula AND a nicer wand, so i&#x27;ll stick with that over this.</li>
    <li> Not the real mascara!!! What a rip off</li>
    <li> My favorite Mascara. Been using it since it came out!</li>
    <li> Every girl has her go-to beauty product, the one item she simply cannot live without. For Carrie Bradshaw, my personal, fearless fashion and beauty icon, it was shoes. Carrie was fortunate enough to lead a lifestyle in which she could wear fabulous shoes every day of her life. I, on the other hand, do not. As a 21 year old college student I would look more like a frequented floozy if I flaunted six inch Manolo Blahniks around Campus Corner.&lt;br /&gt;So, you ask, where do I find my fill of fabulous? My vice comes in a little black tube with pink writing, and luckily for me and my borderline bankrupt Chase account, it costs less than the heel on one Manolo Blahnik! It&#x27;s called BADgal Lash Mascara.&lt;br /&gt; BADgal Lash is only one of the hundreds of best selling makeup products by Benefit. The brand was created by twin sisters who were sick of the same ole serious beauty rut that women were seemingly stuck in. They saw no reason why makeup couldn&#x27;t be fun and fabulous. And did they succeed! Benefit is nothing short of fun, fearless, and fabulous. The brand has been recognized in some of the most prestigious fashion and beauty magazines in the world, and BADgal Lash has won best mascara awards in both Allure and Elle magazines.&lt;br /&gt;  Benefit products come in boxes and bottles of unexpected shapes and sizes and are whimsically decorated with color. The packaging alone is enough to attract my attention but it is the quality and consistency of the product that keeps me coming back for more. Mascara is absolutely the one make up product I couldn&#x27;t live without, and BADgal Lash is my Manolo Blahnik. It&#x27;s the holy grail of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;  I have used this product for years now and every bottle glides on smooth and creates the thickest, longest lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen right in the mirror! I have naturally longer lashes and it helps to separate and thicken them. My mom, on the other hand, who also uses BADgal, has shorter lashes and says that the mascara makes her lashes look longer and fuller as well. Lengthening and thickening with no clumps? What more could a girl want from her mascara?&lt;br /&gt;  Although I am a loyal Benefit customer I am especially loyal to BADgal Lash. I have tried a few other mascara products from the brand at the recommendation of sales associates. (Although it often times seems more like bullying...!)  Unfortunately, I was not impressed by any of those products. This perhaps is just another testament to how impressed I am by the BADgal product.&lt;br /&gt;  There&#x27;s just something about swiping that wide, plush mascara wand through my lashes in a zig-zag pattern that makes me feel more confident, more vivacious. I would recommend BADgal Lash to any woman in need of a good mascara, which should, in fact, be every woman! A great mascara is just one of those things that a gal shouldn&#x27;t have to live without!&lt;br /&gt;  So, I will definitely continue to semi-splurge on my mascara favorite. Because the feeling I get from wearing BADgal is almost as good as that \\&quot;I&#x27;m wearing a new pair of Manolo Blahniks\\&quot; feeling without that \\&quot;holy crap I don&#x27;t have any money to fill up my tank of gas\\&quot; feeling. I think Carrie would approve. BADgal is infinitely better than BROKEgal.d fuller as well. Lengthening and thickening with no clumps? What more could a girl want from her mascara?&lt;br /&gt;  Although I am a loyal Benefit customer I am especially loyal to BADgal Lash. I have tried a few other mascara products from the brand at the recommendation of sales associates. (Although it often times seems more like bullying...!)  Unfortunately, I was not impressed by any of those products. This perhaps is just another testament to how impressed I am by the BADgal product.&lt;br /&gt;  There&#x27;s just something about swiping that wide, plush mascara wand through my lashes in a zig-zag pattern that makes me feel more confident, more vivacious. I would recommend BADgal Lash to any woman in need of a good mascara, which should, in fact, be every woman!

Because the feeling I get from wearing BADgal is almost as good as that \\&quot;I&#x27;m wearing a new pair of Manolo Blahniks\\&quot; feeling without that \\&quot;holy crap I don&#x27;t have any money to fill up my tank of gas\\&quot; feeling. I think Carrie would approve. BADgal is infinitely better than BROKEgal.</li>
