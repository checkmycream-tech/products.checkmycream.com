      <li>great product always buy remington prodducts reasonable and well made will order again from this site, thanks you for selling this product</li>
      <li>After going from store to store (and using precious gas)we found exactly what we needed through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Considering that my original blades lasted me for 10 months or so, razors for under $20 comes out to under $2 per month.  </li>
      <li>We ended up buying a Norelco and are happy campers because he finally ends up with a more than decent shave in record time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to do, and cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a timely fashion , was easy to install on his shaver and it works exactly as it should.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As advertised this replacement package is easy to install and really makes a noticeable difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish someone could make a cheaper generic  kind like they do for ink replacements in computers.</li>
      <li>These actually seem to cut better than the original cutters.  </li>
      <li>I would reccomend the product top anyone using electric shaver reminding them to keep it clean daily to prevent problems.</li>
      <li>I may have overused this unit the first year, but I enjoyed the cordless/corded option so much I used it as my main razor all year</li>
      <li>These foils fit very nicely, however, they are a little different from the original foils that came with the shaver.</li>
      <li>I guess this could be a nice feature that gives a closer shave, but for me it gave me a noisier shaver (if you press the foils down the noise is reduced to original levels).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reasonably priced you will enjoy the benefits of a like new razor again.</li>
      <li>, razor burn--guess I should have read the instruction book ;)</li>
      <li>on your first time replacing u may need to call remington to see how to replace the screen.</li>
      <li>The first shaver cleaning unit cracked and leaked cleaning fluid all over our counter top.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more when it is time for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described</li>
      <li>Should have known and will not forget to look first at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Very please with this purchase</li>
      <li>Foil wears out fast.  </li>
      <li>He loves how fast he can shave his face with this product.</li>
      <li>I JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH TITANIUM IS IN THE METAL SHAVER</li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the shaver/cleaning unit.</li>
      <li>It really shaves close.  </li>
      <li>The free replacement cleaner cracked, and did the same thing.</li>
      <li>It fit my razor and was very simple to exchange for the older blades.  </li>
      <li>The razors do not seem to have the same quality from the original ones that came with the unit.</li>
      <li>Other on Line retailers had it but wanted more.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I do not like is the price on the components compared to the full shaver&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>These are decent cutters for the price.</li>
      <li>My original cutters were damaged when I dropped my razor and were only a couple of months old.  </li>
      <li>I needed to either get a new shaver or buy the replacement screens and cutters.  </li>
      <li>The new blades &amp; screens have not given me a close shave.</li>
      <li>My husband got this for his shaver and it works like new again.  </li>
      <li>Makes my electric razor like new.  </li>
      <li>Just pop out the old &amp; pop in the new and PRESTO-CHANGO a new shaver!</li>
      <li>Make my old razon look and feel like a new one!</li>
      <li>course I should include the fact that due to health/allergy reactions to my own \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; I have shaved my entire head from April to November every year since the mid-seventies, so it isn&#x27;t just facial hair</li>
      <li>This was for my father in laws old razor that he loves and refuses to replace.</li>
      <li>So far, the shaver is running a year or so without the cleaning unit.</li>
      <li>He no longer says he has cut himself with his old shaver head.  </li>
      <li>This replacement Remington cutter/screen package is just what my old electric shaver needs.</li>
      <li>and this was cheaper than buying directly from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>It had become increasingly irritating trying to find Remington replacement blades and screens in department stores for the model of electric shaver I own.  </li>
      <li>I have always used remington for the last 57 years so I cannot compare them to other shavers except to say using a circular motion seems to cut my beard better then straight shaving up and down motions.  </li>
      <li>There was a little delay shipping them but not bad</li>
      <li>These are almost impossible to find in the store so I really appreciate being able to find them on Amazon.</li>

    <li> What a difference this replacement set has made--no more pulling, razor burn--guess I should have read the instruction book ;)</li>
    <li> It fit my razor and was very simple to exchange for the older blades.  It did improve the shave from the previous worn blades.</li>
    <li> They are the same as the ones in the store. I wish someone could make a cheaper generic  kind like they do for ink replacements in computers.</li>
    <li> It had become increasingly irritating trying to find Remington replacement blades and screens in department stores for the model of electric shaver I own.  The stores carry only a few replacement accessories, and this was seldom one of them.  The product itself is fine, but I appreciate the convenience of ordering direct from Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> These Remington Replacement Screens for my MS-5100 were fantastic.  My razor is as good as new.  Considering that my original blades lasted me for 10 months or so, razors for under $20 comes out to under $2 per month.  You can&#x27;t beat that quality/price combination.</li>
    <li> Very please with this purchase</li>
    <li> My husband got this for his shaver and it works like new again.  He no longer says he has cut himself with his old shaver head.  It really shaves close.  He is smooth after he is done.  I am so happy we ordered a new one.</li>
    <li> Foil wears out fast.  Buying replacement foils for this razor every four months or so has me thinking of switching to another brand.</li>
    <li> if you have the shaver, you will need this every six months.  Have a spare standing by as the screens on the shaver can fail without warning (chewing your face to bits).</li>
    <li> These are almost impossible to find in the store so I really appreciate being able to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband can no longer find these replacement parts in a local store. Shooping thru Amazon is so easy: find the vendor and the best deal and it&#x27;s at the house in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I replaced the blades and screen with no problem since I have done it before. on your first time replacing u may need to call remington to see how to replace the screen. Also use care when handling the screen to prevent damage to it. The cutters are well made and not as fragile. I have always used remington for the last 57 years so I cannot compare them to other shavers except to say using a circular motion seems to cut my beard better then straight shaving up and down motions.  I signed up for the 6 months automatic replacement since i might forget to reorder and also the price was cheaper. I would reccomend the product top anyone using electric shaver reminding them to keep it clean daily to prevent problems.</li>
    <li> This work as expected/designed.  Easily and quickly replace the blades and screens for your MS-5100 (which is what I own).  I was confused after seeing a few replacement units.  So if you&#x27;re confused, I can assure you that this includes all 3 rows of the cutters and the metal mesh/screens for all three.</li>
    <li> Save the environment. Replace your shaver screen and cutters instead of tossing your shaver. It&#x27;s very easy to do, and cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I am giving the Remington Replacement Screens and Cutters for the MS-5 series a 5-star rating but the Remington razor is another story.  I bought the Remington for my husband and we (I sometimes shave him) never liked the end results although we struggled through the trial period and never used his safety razor in between.  Even after replacing the screens and cutters the shaver never produced a satisfactory shave no matter who performed the shave.  We ended up buying a Norelco and are happy campers because he finally ends up with a more than decent shave in record time.  Good rating for the replacement screens and cutters (the shaver was the problem from the beginning and not the replacement parts) and a two-star rating for the Remington MS-5100 or 5200 unit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. It arrived in a timely fashion , was easy to install on his shaver and it works exactly as it should. He is well pleased with it.</li>
    <li> After going from store to store (and using precious gas)we found exactly what we needed through Amazon.  Product came in 5 days and was the perfect replacement fit for the razor.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades are VERY simple to install. Just pop out the old &amp; pop in the new and PRESTO-CHANGO a new shaver! Be sure to run the shaver through the cleaner both before and after you replace the blades.    By the way, to keep from having to install replacement blades, NEVER take the top off and run the shaver over the sink to give it a quick clean......especially in a hotel room with no grating in the sink drain!!    Dumb-de-Dumb-Dumb!!!    Dave</li>
    <li> Couldn\\&quot;t find these at any brick and mortar so went looking on line.  Should have known and will not forget to look first at Amazon.  Other on Line retailers had it but wanted more.</li>
    <li> There was a little delay shipping them but not bad and I&#x27;m real happy to have them.</li>
    <li> I received these on time, well packaged, and am pleased as punch with how they rejuvenated my MS-5100 shaver. I hope I don&#x27;t have to buy them every year, but I will if needed.  I may have overused this unit the first year, but I enjoyed the cordless/corded option so much I used it as my main razor all year long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I should include the fact that due to health/allergy reactions to my own \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; I have shaved my entire head from April to November every year since the mid-seventies, so it isn&#x27;t just facial hair this thing has to cut. I also have a rotary head corded Remington, but I left it in the cabinet and used the 5100 cordless the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CCW.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington razor many years ago and just keep getting replacement blades at Amazon. A pack of two blades lasts for a year with everyday facial shaves.</li>
    <li> fast response and great unit. Works great! Make my old razon look and feel like a new one! Recommend to buy!</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> great shave at a good price</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my razor.  The transition was smooth and I successfully shave with it each morning as a result.</li>
    <li> Simple to install. It improved the cutting ability of the shaver. I wish they included a new plastic head cover though, my old one was broken.</li>
    <li> The new blades &amp; screens have not given me a close shave. Very disappointed,  considering the high cost. Think I will go back to a safety razor!</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and cutter set was what I needed and easy to install.</li>
    <li> I am one of the oldest user of Remington Electric Shaver. I tried some other brands as well But Remington is still the top of the line for me. About an year ago I bought Panasonic and found to comparable.  However I still stick to Remington.  The only thing that I do not like is the price on the components compared to the full shaver&#x27;s price. The ratio proportion is out of line.   ANM</li>
    <li> These replacement screens fit on my electric razor just like the factory ones and do a good job. Now go away!</li>
    <li> A great item and esxactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The Remington replacement screens &amp; cutters will turn your inefficient razor to smooth shaving machine again.&lt;br /&gt;As advertised this replacement package is easy to install and really makes a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced you will enjoy the benefits of a like new razor again.</li>
    <li> The shipment of Foil microscreens and cutters for my Remington MS-5500 Titanium arrived quickly and fit perfectly.  The titanium nitride coating where the cutters rub on the foils does seem to make the foils last longer.</li>
    <li> I have used the same replacement screens and cutters once before and found them to do a very good job.    I love my MS 5100 Remington Shaver. I also own a MS 5500 Remington which is a big disappointment, nothing close to the MS 5100.</li>
    <li> The razors do not seem to have the same quality from the original ones that came with the unit. But it works OK.</li>
    <li> Fit was perfect. Item was exactly as described</li>
    <li> These actually seem to cut better than the original cutters.  My original cutters were damaged when I dropped my razor and were only a couple of months old.  These are decent cutters for the price.</li>
    <li> these did not fit well.</li>
    <li> He loves how fast he can shave his face with this product. The originals of course wore out ( as do all razor products) The Remington moves a lot faster than other razors he has bought in the past. I will definitely order more when it is time for a replacement. Can&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Good, high  quality for the price.Arrived and worked as advertised. I look forward to doing future business with your company.</li>
    <li> This was for my father in laws old razor that he loves and refuses to replace. Thank goodness we can still get the parts.</li>
    <li> I needed to either get a new shaver or buy the replacement screens and cutters.  It was cheaper to replace.  It works great now.  Good to go for awhile now.</li>
    <li> This replacement Remington cutter/screen package is just what my old electric shaver needs. I am good to go with months of great shaves to come.</li>
    <li> Had a heck of a time finding replacement blades and foils for this locally and this was cheaper than buying directly from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The cutters are excellent, the foil is a different story.  These foils fit very nicely, however, they are a little different from the original foils that came with the shaver. They give you a little spring action so the foils can move up and down a little as you move the shaver along your contour. I guess this could be a nice feature that gives a closer shave, but for me it gave me a noisier shaver (if you press the foils down the noise is reduced to original levels). That is why I give it only 1 3 star.</li>
    <li> I should have replaced this quite a while ago. Makes my electric razor like new.  Simple installation and great results.</li>
    <li> great product always buy remington prodducts reasonable and well made will order again from this site, thanks you for selling this product</li>
    <li> I JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH TITANIUM IS IN THE METAL SHAVER BLADES/ IF THERE IS ANY THE BLADES WOULD NEVER NEED TO BE REPLACED</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed to extend the life of my Remington shaver. The parts were easy to remove and replace. I can&#x27;t say much about the shaver/cleaning unit. This is just to keep you buying supplies and adding to Remmington&#x27;s profits. The first shaver cleaning unit cracked and leaked cleaning fluid all over our counter top. The free replacement cleaner cracked, and did the same thing. So far, the shaver is running a year or so without the cleaning unit. The replacement screens and cutters will probably last longer than the shaver. Oh, and another thing, the shaver no longer recharges, and I have to use the cord. The battery only lasted a few years.</li>
    <li> Remington Replacements are very Good, I like Them a lot. Thank you, RICHARD S.</li>
    <li> Great replacment - works fine- great money saver</li>
    <li> over priced! They don&#x27;t allow choice of screens which are actually needed. I don&#x27;t like being forced to purchase a part I don&#x27;t really need or may not use.</li>
    <li> OEM replacement for my 7+ year old Remington MS-5100 shaver...works perfectly, as it should.</li>
