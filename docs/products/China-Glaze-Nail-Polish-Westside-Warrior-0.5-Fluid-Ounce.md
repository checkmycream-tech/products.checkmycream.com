<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hunted all over town looking for this CG shade.  I think it&#x27;s beautiful.  I had it narrowed down to this one and OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Uh-oh, roll down the window.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a very close shade.  That being said, I wish I had gone with OPI.  I feel like CG is too thick for me.  I like my polishes a little thinner.  But the color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> this was a spur of the moment purchase for me, but it&#x27;s now my favorite color. i highly recommend this polish...it dries fast too and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
    <li> I really love this polish! It goes on smooth, sets quickly, &amp; doesn&#x27;t easily chip. Not to meantion its my favorite color!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a China Glaze polish and it put it right at the top of my list. Colour is extremely accurate, application is simple and looks great even with just one layer. Great polish.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time finding non-sparkly olive nail polish.  I wanted something that was &amp;#34;olive drab / army green&amp;#34; and I found it with this product.  Definitely requires two coats, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the shade of green. And stayed on for about a week and a half.</li>
    <li> Pretty color. I received some compliments. It lasted for 6 days before the tips began to wear off, didn&#x27;t chip though. I have three young children and I&#x27;m a sahm.</li>
    <li> And it didn&#x27;t disappoint in the slightest. It&#x27;s a really deep, slightly dusty olive drab. It always looks brighter in photos, but it&#x27;s beautiful and far more versatile that you would really believe.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would be different so I purchased it but once it was on my nails, it did not look very appealing. It looks like cheap paint on your nails, no shiny finish or deep richness to it. The polish lasts better of course than the dollar store nail polishes, but in about two days, I started to notice chips especially near the top of my nails. It shipped on time and fast though!</li>
    <li> Starts out green but after a while it starts to lose tone and starts looking grey and dull. Put only once.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted an army color. I went online and saw this one. Gave it to her for Xmas and she&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the color and the price was good too!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain about the color it&#x27;s what I was looking for and shipping was fast which is a plus</li>
    <li> I loved the color and used it to create a camouflage nail design but it looks pretty all alone.  Recommend</li>
    <li> I love camo so this is a great polish to choose. Very fashionable and the polish last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really cute fall color and found this one! My package came almost 4 days early! The package was tightly wrapped with layers of bubble wrap. It is such a cute olive color and I would highly reccomend getting it.</li>
    <li> amazing nail polish, it stays on for a long time plus it goes on super smooth. i love the color also.</li>
    <li> Border patrol green!!</li>
    <li> I really live the Chiba Glaze brand. The color is  great and the polish goes on great!</li>
    <li> Online it is more green, I almost thought it was a dark grey and sent it back as a mistake and then I read the bottom and it said westside warrior so I guess it was the right one. Was not very happy with color but oh well sometimes you get what you get right. So remember its a lot darker and greyer then green, so if your looking for green look elsewhere</li>
    <li> This color looks awesome on me....n da gems went so good with it....it was amazing...got compliments..everywhere...you got 2 get da color</li>
    <li> This is so hot!  It dries pretty fast, too, and is super easy to apply.  It&#x27;s comparable to O.P.I.</li>
    <li> love this fall/winter color</li>
    <li> Nice color but chips after just a day. Pretty if you want to keep changing polish but I like something that lasts longer. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> this product is great , dries fast . its my favorite color . would buy this again and again .</li>
    <li> Color true to picture. Have never used this brand before - OPI is my favorite. However, I like the texture once dry. Don&#x27;t even need a top coat! LOVE it and will definately check out more colors from China Glaza!</li>
    <li> This polish is really green. It looks a lot like army green. It does need two coats, but it have beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> Looking for the perfect green can be a lifelong quest for some. Shade upon shade, purchased in vain, longing for the depths of dragon scales and the warmth of Chinese Military uniforms to no avail. Too blue and you get a 1997 forest green that would make Ross and Rachel get back together, again. Too yellow and all of a sudden you look like you&#x27;ve dipped your fingers in pea soup vomit and YOU LIKE IT. Too green of a green and you&#x27;re wondering what sports team you&#x27;re representing and if they&#x27;re going to need you to get the face paint out too. Too much sparkle and you&#x27;re in danger of a leprechaun falling in love with you. (If you can overlook the whole creepy nature of leprechauns and go for the gold then this polish isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is perfect. The enamel is durable and dries quickly. Dragon scales clad in Chinese Military uniform, but harder and more respecting of human rights.</li>
    <li> Comprei este esmalte mas confesso nao gostei como esperava, achei a cor fica diferente na unha nao atendendo as expectativas iniciais.</li>
    <li> this is my first time using China glaze.I always use Sally but i love this color I own green but this green is the bomb.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  The color received is exactly as depicted in the photo.  It&#x27;s a deep olive green.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product. The picture does a good job of portraying the color you&#x27;ll get. In general, i&#x27;m a china glaze fan because their polishes are long lasting and remain shiny for a few days. Even my friend was impressed on how it out shined her OPI nail polish (i love OPI too tho).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no complaints; good polish, good color (:</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> China Glaze is one of the best brands I have used, it goes on thick but not too thick and has great shine. This color, westside warrior, is a beautiful hunter/oilve green. It is great if you want a shade that is differant but not too differant or &#x27;funky&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a HUGE fan of green colors, but this one is PERFECT. It&#x27;s a very nice darker shade of green that makes an excellent base color for layering other polishes such as flakies and glitters. I think this is my #1 favorite polish I have in my collection right now.</li>
    <li> Great product, received quickly with no hassle.  I was looking for a color like that and was happy it was so convenient to find.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous, beautiful color. &amp; it works well with any color brown or gray. (: More like an Autumn Color but its still cute . ^_^</li>
    <li> Color is very disappointing . . . . I expected the color on the photo, the color is very dark almost like Bark , not cute !&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best nail polish. This color is just as expected in the picture and looks great with black crackle over the top. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this polish to go with a outfit and it worked perfectly! I found that the color was subtle but really pretty as well. I really like the China Glaze line and have purchased more colors.</li>
    <li> Love this color!!! Love this brand!!! You will not be disappointed. China Glaze has some really cool colors, so I purchased a few. This was one of them. I am an Army Brat with no desire to ever join the military, but I respect them greatly, so to show my love and support I purchased this color. FABULOUS and SHINY!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a color that I will definately buy again. I love that after you apply the polish that the color lasts and shines for days.</li>
    <li> The color is alot darker and a slightly different shade, put a clear coat on top of it and it lightens up slightly. Still not a bad color once it FINALLY arrived in the mail.</li>
    <li> China Glaze Westside Warrior is exactly the Army Green I have needed for years !  Its great for halloween or wearing earth tone clothes.  I love the unique color and its very thick opaque color that covers in just one coat,  very rich and shiny, dries fast and doesnt chip even after many days of hard use on the hands.  This color is difficult to locate.  I love it so this gets 5 stars as well as all the other from China Glaze</li>
    <li> Gorgeous cream army green.</li>
    <li> It went perfectly for my bridesmaids in my wedding so they all matched their dresses beautifully! Great quality nail polish as well.</li>
    <li> Very ugly like baby sweet peas just does not look good on dark skin. Although is still like looking at the color just not on my nails.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  Its different from the usual green shades you normally see.  It&#x27;s a perfect Army shade of green.  It will make a beautiful fall or winter color.  I love it!</li>
    <li> A very unique, army/camo style green. I LOVE the look of this, with a tan as well as with my normal fair skin. I knew I&#x27;d hit a popular color when my daughter, um, \\&quot;liberated\\&quot; my bottle and took it home with her, so I ordered another.Nice color in 2 coats, doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 5th and received it on the 9th. I have been looking for a army green color for a while and saw this one, I was hesitant to shell out the money for it because I don&#x27;t like paying more than 2-3 dollar&#x27;s for nail polish, but I have heard such good things about this brand. I am so glad I did, it was well worth it. The color is the perfect shade of green for me, not to bright, not to dark. I only put one coat on and it did the job. I brought this along with [[ASIN:B005EHILOG China Glaze Metro Collection #1000 TRENDSETTER 81076]]I used the trendsetter as a french tip, the color&#x27;s look lovely together. I also did not use a topcoat and it&#x27;s now 3 days days later and with all the house work I did I have no chipping, that&#x27;s a win in my book. I am so happy with my purchase. I will be ordering more color&#x27;s soon.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t chip easily. It&#x27;s a little darker than the picture shown, but I love it. I&#x27;m definitely ordering more from China Glaze.</li>
