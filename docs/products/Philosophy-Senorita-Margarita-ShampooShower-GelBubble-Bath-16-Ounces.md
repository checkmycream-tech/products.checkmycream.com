      <li>(though how many gyms have a bath tub?</li>
      <li>It truly smells like a refreshingly lime margarita.</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I LOVE this bubble bath.</li>
      <li>I know for most people the lack of these scents lingering is a con,</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Just wish they had more philosophy shower gel.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and light.</li>
      <li>i love this product so clean</li>
      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t quite as strong but it is as close as I&#x27;ve found...</li>
      <li>Luckily, that wasn&#x27;t the case!  </li>
      <li>It leaves hair and body smelling great, and does a pretty decent shampoo &amp; condition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a sulfate free girl when it comes to shampoo</li>
      <li>had it been available.</li>
      <li>so the actual soap is of great quality.</li>
      <li>Does not have a lasting fragrence but while showering it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a rich and creamy luxurious feel</li>
      <li>Sweet, citrus, and an almost energizing scent.</li>
      <li>Full of moisture and luxury.</li>
      <li>Most of the time if I purchase a philosophy scent that I don&#x27;t love I will pass it along to one of my daughters but this one I simply threw out.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at a local store and since I absolutely love lime and lemon scents, I figured this was going to be very special.  </li>
      <li>I love it, my skin loves it and there is no other product on the market today that will give you these results from the first use.</li>
      <li>Makes me want the real thing!</li>
      <li>This was my first Philosophy purchase.</li>
      <li>I only wish that it made more suds as a bubble bath.</li>
      <li>This smells exactly like a margarita.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several Philosophy shower gels and THIS is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This was ok for me to use and while I expected a Margarita scent, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be an almost exact replica!  </li>
      <li>It really does well if you are traveling or going to the gym, because it&#x27;s one bottle versus three</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was Timely and appreciated.</li>
      <li>Hair is well conditioned and shiny and styles very well.  </li>
      <li>:33 smells just like the real thing</li>
      <li>Also lathers very well as a shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>haha)</li>
      <li>It seems to agree with my hair very well....</li>
      <li>I really wish I had pulled the tab before purchase and smelled.  </li>
      <li>Also product color much lighter than the photo,  and in no way would it make bubbles for a bath.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very fragrant is the shower, but as all 3 in 1&#x27;s, this does not linger on the skin.</li>
      <li>So much so that I have it on auto delivery now.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hang around the skin once you&#x27;re out of the shower quite as well as some of the others like vanilla, but I don&#x27;t really use it for that anyway.</li>
      <li>Try it for a bit of a change from the normal smell of your shower!</li>
      <li>I love these since they are shampoo and body wash, it doesn&#x27;t give me dandruff as other shampoos.</li>
      <li>Love the margarita scent - mostly a soft lemon-lime, not really any alcohol.</li>
      <li>Loved all of them, but not the Red Velvet Cake, really dried my skin out for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Needless to say the quality is great</li>
      <li>Hardly no scent,  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a new scent to try and opted for Senorita Margarita.</li>
      <li>3-in-1 gels and leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I personally do not want to smell like a margarita all day, and in general I prefer to not have shower gels linger as it interferes with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and foamy like all the other Philosophy shower gels.</li>

    <li> This is my 6th bottle over the years. It is refreshing an delicious to shower and bathe in. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome- makes me want to have the real thing!</li>
    <li> Love the Product! And the packaging was Fab!&lt;br /&gt;I would PURCHASE- again from this Seller...&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was Timely and appreciated.</li>

    <li> Love this. Makes me want the real thing!</li>
    <li> All of philosophy&#x27;s shower gel/bubble bath/shampoo lather wonderfully. I was looking for a new scent to try and opted for Senorita Margarita. Needless to say the quality is great but the scent is just off. I was expecting a delicious citrus scent but this smells like pure salt and lime in a unflattering way. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or recommend.</li>
    <li> Hardly no scent,  disappointed,  after others raved about this scent.  Also product color much lighter than the photo,  and in no way would it make bubbles for a bath.  Wording on bottle is different also.  Concerned about authenticity of product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price with fast delivery</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely amazing. Sweet, citrus, and an almost energizing scent. It&#x27;s my favorite Philosophy scent. I only wish that it made more suds as a bubble bath.</li>
    <li> Not sure how Philosophy did it, but this truly does smell just like a margarita from the lime to the tequila right down to the salt. Definitely rings lime, but not in a overly citrusy way. The scent is very fragrant is the shower, but as all 3 in 1&#x27;s, this does not linger on the skin. I know for most people the lack of these scents lingering is a con, but for me it&#x27;s a plus. I personally do not want to smell like a margarita all day, and in general I prefer to not have shower gels linger as it interferes with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a sulfate free girl when it comes to shampoo so I haven&#x27;t used this on my hair, but it doubles are a bubble bath just as well as a shower gel, lots of bubbles. Also lathers very well as a shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I really love Philosophy products and the Senorita Margarita body wash is no exception. The product is great and it arrived in a timely manner. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> YUK! I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND, SHE SEEMS TO LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> Watch the warning label!  It has warning due to any prolonged use may cause issues.  DO Not use daily either male or female!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local store and since I absolutely love lime and lemon scents, I figured this was going to be very special.  Unfortunately, my bottle has zero scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all.  I really wish I had pulled the tab before purchase and smelled.  It bubbles up just like all philosophy 3-in-1 gels and leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.  There just is no scent and lets face it that is what draws most of us to the philosophy line is that great smell.  All this being said, from the other reviews I gather I am in the minority and have to figure that the bottle I received was defective.  Most of the time if I purchase a philosophy scent that I don&#x27;t love I will pass it along to one of my daughters but this one I simply threw out.</li>
    <li> i love this product so clean and it makes me drunk just smelling it! :33 smells just like the real thing</li>
    <li> so creamy &amp; the smell is a Margarita!  Prefer to use it as the body gel &amp; not to &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; it as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really great product, a truly wonderful brand - it smells so incredibly good &amp; is my very favourite shower gel</li>
    <li> I like all Philosophy products and this is no exception. Feels great on the skin and the scent is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Dermstore is a wonderful place to do business....have been a customer of theirs for many years. Just wish they had more philosophy shower gel.</li>
    <li> I only wish there were a 16oz  lotion too. I would have definitely ordered it, had it been available. This comes in a foot scrub with foot lotion also. That will probably be my next purchase from Philosopy.</li>
    <li> Loved all of them, but not the Red Velvet Cake, really dried my skin out for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;They all smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> I do like this body wash... however I buy it as a replacement for my very favorite Bath and Body Works Need a Margarita body wash that was discontinued, and it is not quite as good as that in my opinion.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t quite as strong but it is as close as I&#x27;ve found...</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I LOVE this bubble bath. It truly smells like a refreshingly lime margarita. Mmm</li>
    <li> It smells DIVINE. I love this, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it as a shampoo, wash, bubble bath. It really does well if you are traveling or going to the gym, because it&#x27;s one bottle versus three (though how many gyms have a bath tub? haha). I love Philosophy. Their fragrant washes are nom nom nom! :-p</li>
    <li> This was my first Philosophy purchase. I love it! I was concerned about using it as a shampoo, but WOW it was GREAT! My hair was soft and not weighed down. Great summertime product!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I questioned my wife about this purchase.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell like I just came back from a Cinco De Mayo celebration after a shower or bath.  Luckily, that wasn&#x27;t the case!  You smell pretty dang good, not like booze at all! It&#x27;s refreshing and light. Of course, it&#x27;s Philosophy so the actual soap is of great quality. Try it for a bit of a change from the normal smell of your shower!</li>
    <li> smells awful, but i used it and can&#x27;t return this $18 bottle of crap.</li>
    <li> This is always a yearly gift for my son he adores it, I usually get at least 2 bottles a year</li>
    <li> Makes bathing an experience.  Refreshing lime scented wakes you up. I have tried several Philosophy shower gels and THIS is my favorite.  So much so that I have it on auto delivery now.</li>
    <li> If you know of this product, you know that it is amazing. If smells great, it feels great and it works, hands down the best thing you can do for your skin. Full of moisture and luxury. The smell does not linger or interfere with you colognes. I love it, my skin loves it and there is no other product on the market today that will give you these results from the first use. I could go on and on but I will let you buy and try it for yourself and see what kind of comments you leave, I know they will be great ones as well.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this stuff!  The fragrance is light and citrusy and lingers nicely.  It&#x27;s got a rich and creamy luxurious feel and I use it for body and hair!  It seems to agree with my hair very well.... Hair is well conditioned and shiny and styles very well.  Who knew????</li>
    <li> Love the margarita scent - mostly a soft lemon-lime, not really any alcohol. Doesn&#x27;t hang around the skin once you&#x27;re out of the shower quite as well as some of the others like vanilla, but I don&#x27;t really use it for that anyway. It&#x27;s very soft and foamy like all the other Philosophy shower gels.</li>
    <li> Does not have a lasting fragrence but while showering it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have never used Philosophy products before.  This was ok for me to use and while I expected a Margarita scent, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be an almost exact replica!  I have weird hair, so while I enjoyed the scent, it just didn&#x27;t mesh well with my hair chemistry.</li>
    <li> As promised. Love this product!</li>
