### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>GREAT!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!!!!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>It feels great and taste great, but best of all it gets rid of flaky chapped lips.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>but then again, philosphy are always good.</li>
      <li>Good while it lasted though.</li>
      <li>Not working as good as it used too</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find one good thing to say about this \\&quot;lip therapy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that the minty flavor was good.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
      <li>I wipe it all off because it&#x27;s kind oily in use of it...</li>
      <li>nice sugary and minty flavor/sent if a bit ends up in your mouth.</li>
      <li>Plus this stuff smells fantastic and tastes just as good.</li>
      <li>but I am still on a search for a better lip scrub.</li>
      <li>i really am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>i really really love this product.</li>
      <li>Leaves your lips smooth and hydrated!</li>
      <li>I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love Philosophy products and was just waiting for something like this to come out.</li>
      <li>I usually love Philosophy&#x27;s products, but this one I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>i have full lips, and i have to make sure they look and feel nice.</li>
      <li>the effect is minimal at best.</li>
      <li>There is a light minty scent which isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>but my lips are so smooth.</li>
      <li>If you want this, use it up FAST, or you won&#x27;t be able to use it at all.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I love trying new products and am always excited when I find something I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
      <li>It is very reasonably priced and works wonders.</li>
      <li>My husband told me that my lips are much softer now!</li>
      <li>Okay, it has a nice pepperminty taste and it has some exfoliating properties, but you can get the same effect by rubbing a wet washcloth across your lips.  </li>
      <li>This product makes your lips feel so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It was good at first, but then I started using a different product I got as a gift, and left it alone for a while.</li>
      <li>Nothing special and considerably overpriced.</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again, philosophy.</li>
      <li>Then I get most of it off with a slightly damp wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Philosophy&#x27;s Kiss Me Lip Exfoliant.</li>
      <li>and it just needs a little more then this stuff.</li>
      <li>have nut allergies and this is a big problem with most other brands.</li>
      <li>Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils.  </li>
      <li>but I think the scar is too old</li>
      <li>So, you get a whole lot of oil on your finger before you actually get to the scrub.....</li>
      <li>I have cracked/chapped lips all year long and this stuff really makes them very soft.</li>
      <li>A few months ago I saw this product in a local beauty supply store, and an associate gave me a free sample at my request.</li>
      <li>I did order more than one item from Philosophy to make the shipping a little easier to accept, but still this product is not worth the price.</li>
      <li>The last test had me completely sold.</li>
      <li>I think I will try the lip scrub by Lush next.</li>

<li> Sorry Philosophy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Philosophy products and was just waiting for something like this to come out. It is very reasonably priced and works wonders. You will notice a difference after one application. Your lips will be softer and smoother. Plus this stuff smells fantastic and tastes just as good.</li>
    <li> Got the idea for this from dooce and I have to say I love this stuff. It works great. I have cracked/chapped lips all year long and this stuff really makes them very soft. Careful that you do not rub it in to long otherwise your lips will be sensitive.</li>
    <li> This product makes your lips feel so smooth and soft. I&#x27;m completely addicted. Thanks again, philosophy.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I put a small amount on my finger and rub it on my lips in small circles.  Then I get most of it off with a slightly damp wash cloth.  It feels great and taste great, but best of all it gets rid of flaky chapped lips. I absolutely love it and don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I love trying new products and am always excited when I find something I can&#x27;t live without.  This is not one of those products.  Okay, it has a nice pepperminty taste and it has some exfoliating properties, but you can get the same effect by rubbing a wet washcloth across your lips.  Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils.  I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better.  I did order more than one item from Philosophy to make the shipping a little easier to accept, but still this product is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This did not arrive as pictured. Packaging was a little jar and not a tube.</li>
    <li> I usually love Philosophy&#x27;s products, but this one I didn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t find one good thing to say about this \\&quot;lip therapy\\&quot;. Well, that&#x27;s not true. I can honestly say that the minty flavor was good. Other than that it feels like there is sand in your lip ointment and the effect is minimal at best. I found that using the Microdelivery Peel on my lips had a larger effect than the lip ointment. Sorry Philosophy.</li>
    <li> I use this and keep this in my shower. Leaves your lips smooth and hydrated!</li>
    <li> It did leave my lips less dry and soft. However, something has to be done about the packaging of this product. It should probably come in some type of small jar or something of that sort. The reason I say this is because it is mixed with oil, so when you squeeze the tube, the oil and sugar scrub seperate. So, you get a whole lot of oil on your finger before you actually get to the scrub.....it did the job but I am still on a search for a better lip scrub. I think I will try the lip scrub by Lush next.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awful. This is just oil not even a scrub.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I saw this product in a local beauty supply store, and an associate gave me a free sample at my request. It is hard for me to keep my lips feeling soft on a daily basis, but I gave this product a try. After just one use, I found that I had to use lip balm less often and the softness lasted throughout the day. The last test had me completely sold. My husband told me that my lips are much softer now! There is a light minty scent which isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. This product can be used as a hand or facial exfoliate if your in a pinch. I would highly recommend Philosophy&#x27;s Kiss Me Lip Exfoliant.</li>
    <li> i really really love this product. i dont have problems w/ my lips but they are a big part of my beauty. i have full lips, and i have to make sure they look and feel nice. the only thing about it is that its a little oily. but my lips are so smooth. i ordered the lip therapy stuff to go with it. i really am pleased with this product. but then again, philosphy are always good.</li>
    <li> Nothing special and considerably overpriced.</li>
    <li> Not working as good as it used too</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Put it on your lips and rub them together till all the bead are gone. I have used it a few days and they aren&#x27;t chapped or flaky anymore! GREAT!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  It&#x27;s basically a peppermint essential oil with sugar granules.  I can make it myself!</li>
    <li> It was good at first, but then I started using a different product I got as a gift, and left it alone for a while. BIG MISTAKE. After a while the oil and the actual scrub substance separated. I can&#x27;t get any of the scrub out, and instead just wind up getting peppermint oil out of it. Good while it lasted though. If you want this, use it up FAST, or you won&#x27;t be able to use it at all.</li>
    <li> peeling lips... one scrub and it&#x27;s over. have to moisturize well after use.... I wipe it all off because it&#x27;s kind oily in use of it... but it&#x27;s ment to be wiped off.  nice sugary and minty flavor/sent if a bit ends up in your mouth. I always shake the tub before I use it too.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY ONE OUT THAT DOENS&#x27;T HAVE NUT PRODUCT IN IT.&lt;br /&gt;I have nut allergies and this is a big problem with most other brands.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!  Put it on and rub it in.. then wipe it off.  Your lips feel like satin!!!  I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product and the fact that it exfoliates but it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I was getting it to make the appearance of an old scar on my lip that was puffed up a little less noticeable but I think the scar is too old and it just needs a little more then this stuff.</li>
