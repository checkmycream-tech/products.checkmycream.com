      <li>Perfect size for the frequent traveler.  </li>
      <li>pleased.</li>
      <li>Like this bag, took a trip to Vegas with my girlfriend and wanted to make sure I sailed through TSA without any issues.</li>
      <li>definitely more convenient and durable than ziploc bags.  </li>
      <li>I ended up buying the Flight 001 quart bag and love it.</li>
      <li>Who knew you couldn&#x27;t bring brass knuckles through airport security?  :-)    </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet, but I love the quality -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much better than a disposable quart bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I think id rather just buy an industrial sized box of zip lock bags, and do better with those.</li>
      <li>This one is more sturdy.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still able to use the bag.</li>
      <li>It is more like a woven fabric trim.</li>
      <li>You can pack some travel stuff in this!&lt;br /&gt;Heavy zipper, I will be able to reuse this item for many trips.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>and I was even able to add my toothbrush and razor.</li>
      <li>The bag is ok assuming you are buying it for the purpose of being a reusable TSA quart sized bag.</li>
      <li>What a great replacement for the normal zip-lock plastic bag!  </li>
      <li>Great idea for frequent traveler.</li>
      <li>edges are all squared and don&#x27;t come to a point like ziplock bags, meaning you can fit a lot more in this bag.</li>
      <li>The zipper is smooth and I feel like it fits more than the Flybag.</li>
      <li>what I need easily.  </li>
      <li>and it was very adequate for that.</li>
      <li>I bought this bag in February 2010 and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>This kit is pretty nice for travelers.</li>
      <li>Because of the shape of the bag and the stout zipper, can you cram slightly more in it as opposed a ziploc bag which will not close if the bag is too full.</li>
      <li>The zipper pull is great, the ring makes it easy to open and close.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s incredibly durable (the plastic and zipper are both heavy duty), and it allows me to stuff way more items in it than a regular plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottles that come with the bag are cheap, but the bag is durable to use over and over.</li>
      <li>This bag holds all the needed liquid items (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, moisturizer, lip balm/gloss, mascara, eye cream, hair spray, mousse/gel, etc...) and closes securely.  </li>
      <li>I have used this bag multiple times and it is still in great shape.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic travel bottles that DO NOT leak.  </li>
      <li>I have better bottles I prefer, but the bag alone is worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>The zipper is more strong and the plastic material doesn&#x27;t seem cheap and is real sturdy.</li>
      <li>Sure makes going thru Airport Security much easier.</li>
      <li>Nice that the bag is clear plastic</li>
      <li>Really sturdy zipper, so I can put way more gels/liquids into this bag than I thought I could</li>
      <li>The zipper makes fitting items in much easier.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it any more than the next guy, but this bag helped me get better organized.</li>
      <li>The quality of the zipper &amp; plastic are excellent - especially the zipper which is most subject to wear and water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the blue insert comically explains, in pictures, what you can safely take through security and what will get you some unwanted attention.  </li>
      <li>Pretty amazed the plastic hasn&#x27;t split!</li>
      <li>I bought this for an upcoming trip - and my first plane ride!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable and sturdy and the zipper is functioning just fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great little bag.</li>
      <li>my 5-star review is PURELY for the bag itself, which is a great product and the only thing I really cared about.  </li>
      <li>The extras in it can be nice, such as the sleeping mask, the earplugs, etc..</li>
      <li>I have no idea if the product is good, but \\&quot;TSA Compliant Toiletry Bag with Blue Bomb Insert\\&quot; has got to be the funniest/least appropriate name for this product possible.</li>
      <li>The bag holds a sufficient amount of personal items, appears to be satisfactorily made, and the ear plugs and sleeping mask are a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>I really question that this bag will last more than a month or so, and I can tell the zipper is going to rip/break fairly easily.</li>
      <li>Clear for easy vision.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and durable!</li>
      <li>Smaller zippers do always seem to zip better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>broke off the first time I tried to unzip it.</li>
      <li>traveling for the first time in years and years via plane.</li>
      <li>THis is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The lid didn&#x27;t break, but during my first trip with this product the lid on one of the bottles stopped locking shut.  </li>
      <li>Since we can only fly with 100ml/3.4oz containers of liquids and gels, and they must all fit in a fairly small bag, you have to make some sacrifices.</li>
      <li>Was surprised how much i could fit in it at 1st.&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Will probably wear out very quickly or jam in actual repeated use.</li>
      <li>I like the picture of the large cartoon-type bomb and brass knuckles.  </li>
      <li>This little bag effectively solved my problems with carry-on toiletries.</li>
      <li>and I would absolutely recommend this bag.</li>
      <li>Desciption lists \\&quot;real leather</li>
      <li>It seems very durable.</li>
      <li>Zipper and plastic is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Who really cares about N eye mask?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, and with a little maneuvering it will close just fine.</li>
      <li>I read the measurements, but thought surely it would be big enough.  </li>
      <li>sub-100ml liquids into this, instead of the plastic baggies I had been using, is a nice permanent solution, due to the apparent durability of this clear plastic material.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the little plastic bottles that come with it, but being able to stuff all my</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it a little credit, because it does hold more, but I ended up putting things in ziploc bags inside of this bag so they wouldn&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>I could even use it a few more times, and would when I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Handy item to have, but could probably find similar item for less in any store.</li>
      <li>Two out of the three were crooked and didn&#x27;t stand up right.</li>
      <li>A great purchase for people who travel a lot and are tired of dealing with zip-locks or something similar.  </li>
      <li>Only buy this if you are exclusively interested in the bag.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have no idea if the product is good, but \\&quot;TSA Compliant Toiletry Bag with Blue Bomb Insert\\&quot; has got to be the funniest/least appropriate name for this product possible.</li>
    <li> I like the product for traveling with the allowable toiletries but I don&#x27;t see the point in selling this product in the different colors as the only difference is the color of the cardboard insert that you&#x27;re required to remove according to the user instructions; once this is removed the contents are completely identical.</li>
    <li> This would have been a five-star review.  The product came as described, and it&#x27;s just what I needed... until the lid on one of the bottles quit snapping shut.  The lid didn&#x27;t break, but during my first trip with this product the lid on one of the bottles stopped locking shut.  It merely closes.  Unfortunately, that makes it useless as a travel bottle, and I now lack confidence in the longevity of the other bottles&#x27; lids.    On the plus side, the blue insert comically explains, in pictures, what you can safely take through security and what will get you some unwanted attention.  I like the picture of the large cartoon-type bomb and brass knuckles.  Who knew you couldn&#x27;t bring brass knuckles through airport security?  :-)    Update:  I went on second trip with the remaining bottles.  Both lids leaked because they also quit snapping shut and no longer \\&quot;lock\\&quot; closed.  Big &#x27;ole waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!  Thank you so much for making this invention-saves me time and hassle and makes me happy in security- who wouldnt have thought!!?</li>
    <li> If there was a 3.5 stars, that&#x27;s what I would give it.  It&#x27;s exactly as described.  The bag is tough plastic and comes with a few little items that you may or may not use.  If I ever need to order something similar again, I&#x27;ll just go to the store, get a similar bag and load it with stuff I&#x27;ll actually use.</li>
    <li> This item is good, but nothing spectacular.  Desciption lists \\&quot;real leather trim,\\&quot; but that is not the case....on the case.  It is more like a woven fabric trim. Handy item to have, but could probably find similar item for less in any store.</li>
    <li> Husband travels for job, was very pleased with how well made. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The bottles in it are horrible, I pretty much immediately threw them out. Its a nice gesture, but they are pretty bad. The bag itself is overall &amp;#34;just OK&amp;#34;. I really question that this bag will last more than a month or so, and I can tell the zipper is going to rip/break fairly easily. I think id rather just buy an industrial sized box of zip lock bags, and do better with those.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag in February 2010 and it is still going strong.  It&#x27;s very durable and sturdy and the zipper is functioning just fine.  A great purchase for people who travel a lot and are tired of dealing with zip-locks or something similar.  Well-worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE &amp; UPDATE: I threw away all of the bottles they give you.  They are garbage-- my 5-star review is PURELY for the bag itself, which is a great product and the only thing I really cared about.  For the bottles, buy Nalgene screw tops.  They are amazing.  Fantastic travel bottles that DO NOT leak.  Buy these, you will thank me later.</li>
    <li> definitely more convenient and durable than ziploc bags.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, traveling constantly, and I have no issues.</li>
    <li> perfect for traveling TSA checkpoints!</li>
    <li> What a great replacement for the normal zip-lock plastic bag!  You do not need to worry about the zip breaking/not closing or the bag ripping open anymore.  This bag holds all the needed liquid items (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, moisturizer, lip balm/gloss, mascara, eye cream, hair spray, mousse/gel, etc...) and closes securely.  I have used this bag multiple times and it is still in great shape.  I did not use the enclosed bottles (already had some with product in them) so cannot attest to their stability.  The eye mask and ear plugs are a nice bonus.   Recommend this bag to anyone.</li>
    <li> The accessories are junk and the zipper leaks. At least when I use a zipper ziploc bag, I know it won&#x27;t leak if one of the bottles come open.  Since I take this in my laptop backpack, it makes this a very questionable purchase.  I&#x27;ll give it a little credit, because it does hold more, but I ended up putting things in ziploc bags inside of this bag so they wouldn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> Great idea for frequent traveler. Zipper and plastic is very sturdy. Keep mine packed and ready to go for any short notice trips. Fits all I need.</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag is absolutely Perfect! Thanks so much! It&#x27;s just what I needed and at a great price too!</li>
    <li> My husband says it is not wide enough but would not let me return it</li>
    <li> The bag is ok assuming you are buying it for the purpose of being a reusable TSA quart sized bag. The plastic bottles are so hard, I can&#x27;t imagine getting product out of the bottles would be easy. Don&#x27;t buy for what&#x27;s inside, only for the size of the bag. Zipper seems durable enough,</li>
    <li> I had a provided toiletry bag provided by Delsey, the carry on have. I lost that bag and needed another one similar to that. I purchased this one and I then found the one I lost. This one is more sturdy. The zipper is more strong and the plastic material doesn&#x27;t seem cheap and is real sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone who travels a lot. I place my compact travel toothbrush inside, along with a small tube of toothpaste, one razor, one small travel size can of shaving cream and one small bottle of aftershave, plus a &amp;#34;throwaway&amp;#34; cigarette lighter. The bag came with 3 small plastic bottles to put liquids in. They are under the TSA 3oz. regulation and qualify for air travel.</li>
    <li> I got this item as an alternative to ziploc bags which were constantly being ripped. Because of the shape of the bag and the stout zipper, can you cram slightly more in it as opposed a ziploc bag which will not close if the bag is too full. The material is very thick and the zipper is heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reasons not 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Highly quality, but seems a little pricey for a zipper bag&lt;br /&gt;-- The zipper is a little stiff (this may loosen up over time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you travel a lot and are sick of ziploc bags ripping, this may be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The bottles are almost worthless. Only buy this if you are exclusively interested in the bag.</li>
    <li> Good size for traveling however the zipper ring broke off after one use. I&#x27;ve replaced it with a key ring and I&#x27;m still able to use the bag.</li>
    <li> This is the kit I use for toiletries going to the gym or traveling for TSA.  The quality of the zipper &amp; plastic are excellent - especially the zipper which is most subject to wear and water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Fits what I need easily.  Clear for easy vision.&lt;br /&gt;Feels substantial like quality construction.&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful about the size and this size works really well for a guy with limited liquids to take in a pouch which is substantial but flexible.  I also use the Humangear &amp;#34;Gotoob&amp;#34; containers for shampoo, soap, shaving cream - they don&#x27;t leak and are great for gym or travel.</li>
    <li> Sure makes going thru Airport Security much easier.</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag has served me well through countless security checks. The only qualm that I have is that the zipper is sometimes difficult to close. That might be just because the zipper is so big and durable. Smaller zippers do always seem to zip better. The bottle that I put shampoo in did leak a little bit once or twice, but I think that is because it somehow got pressed open. None of the bottles leaked during any of my flights otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this bag, but have just one minor complaint...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges are all squared and don&#x27;t come to a point like ziplock bags, meaning you can fit a lot more in this bag. Plus, the plastic is really thick so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being punctured. The included bottles are a little too firm to be useful, but I didn&#x27;t buy this bag for the included bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the zipper can stick a bit. It&#x27;s not bad, and with a little maneuvering it will close just fine. But it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; zip. Again, it&#x27;s a minor complaint and I would absolutely recommend this bag.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have much use for the extra&#x27;s.  Perfect size for the frequent traveler.  On my second bag after 5 years use.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, the plastic bottles that come with the bag are not very good. The bag holds a sufficient amount of personal items, appears to be satisfactorily made, and the ear plugs and sleeping mask are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> nice bag, has lots of room. Was surprised how much i could fit in it at 1st.&lt;br /&gt;has very tough thick plastic...don&#x27;t have to worry about this ripping apart like my old sandwich bags :-P</li>
    <li> Bottles are poorly made. Two out of the three were crooked and didn&#x27;t stand up right. All three were hard to squeeze. The zipper handle on the bag broke off the first time I tried to unzip it.</li>
    <li> Like this bag, took a trip to Vegas with my girlfriend and wanted to make sure I sailed through TSA without any issues. Perfect size and I was even able to add my toothbrush and razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this bag for dozens of trips all over the world, and it has gone through security without incident every time. It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s incredibly durable (the plastic and zipper are both heavy duty), and it allows me to stuff way more items in it than a regular plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have complained about the travel bottles, but I&#x27;ve never used them. I have better bottles I prefer, but the bag alone is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This little bag effectively solved my problems with carry-on toiletries. Since we can only fly with 100ml/3.4oz containers of liquids and gels, and they must all fit in a fairly small bag, you have to make some sacrifices. I don&#x27;t like it any more than the next guy, but this bag helped me get better organized. I don&#x27;t use the little plastic bottles that come with it, but being able to stuff all my sub-100ml liquids into this, instead of the plastic baggies I had been using, is a nice permanent solution, due to the apparent durability of this clear plastic material. It does what its supposed to, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Buy it for the bag, not the bottles! The bag is a good size and can hold about 6-8, 1-3oz. bottles - and maybe a couple of other small items. The bottles that come with the bag are cheap, but the bag is durable to use over and over. The zipper makes fitting items in much easier. Bought one for each of my family members.</li>
    <li> I got tired of using disposable sandwich bags when traveling with carry on luggage.  This bag is sturdy and well made.  The bottles that came with it hold product well, I had no leaks.  The zipper pull is great, the ring makes it easy to open and close.  If you travel with carry on luggage, you should give this bag consideration</li>
    <li> I bought the bag to use in my carry-on. The mask and earplugs are a nice addition.  I did not use the bottles (hard plastic) or funnel included.  The bag will hold a lot of little carry-on bottles.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an upcoming trip - and my first plane ride! I haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet, but I love the quality - It seems very durable. I also tried the mask - and it&#x27;s surprisingly soft!</li>
    <li> This kit is pretty nice for travelers. If you just don&#x27;t want to deal with ziplock bags as otherwise required by TSA these days, this is perfect. The extras in it can be nice, such as the sleeping mask, the earplugs, etc.. Nice additions. I bought this and used it for a week long overseas vacation and it was very adequate for that. I could even use it a few more times, and would when I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The provided bottles are REALLY hard to squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;The zipper on the bag is jerky and not very smooth. Will probably wear out very quickly or jam in actual repeated use.</li>
    <li> My husband travels a lot for work and loves this bag to put his bathroom stuff in</li>
    <li> traveling for the first time in years and years via plane. THis is exactly what I needed. Seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad bag, but the zipper was so sticky and difficult to zip that I had to return it. I ended up buying the Flight 001 quart bag and love it. The zipper is smooth and I feel like it fits more than the Flybag. It was also a few dollars cheaper. TSA doesn&#x27;t blink an eye at these bags. It&#x27;s so much better than a disposable quart bag.</li>
    <li> You can pack some travel stuff in this!&lt;br /&gt;Heavy zipper, I will be able to reuse this item for many trips.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I read the measurements, but thought surely it would be big enough.  NOT!  Too small for a normal size toothbrush without forcing it in catty-corner. Little bottles are useless in that you can&#x27;t squeeze them (plastic is too hard) so nothing comes out.  Nice that the bag is clear plastic but all in all, its useless as a travel companion.</li>
    <li> It would get 5 stars except I am tired of these bottles that may be more prone than needed to coming open during travel.  I&#x27;d like to have the option of buying screw-tops that aren&#x27;t latched in some other way.  I&#x27;m getting some of those, and then will substitute some of those into this bag.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I looked long and hard for the most efficient 3-1-1 bag. This is about the best one I could find and beat the pants off of the highly rated Lewis N Clark one that was nothing but a glorified, way overpriced zip-lock bag</li>
    <li> Really sturdy zipper, so I can put way more gels/liquids into this bag than I thought I could and I don&#x27;t worry about the zipper failing.  It&#x27;s a great little bag.</li>
    <li> I have had ~3 of these in the last few years, usually picked up from Wal-Mart or a drugstore on my way out of town. They all cost a little less than this, and they ALL break. I was shopping online for a new carry-on and this popped up at the bottom, so I clicked it, read a few reviews, and added it to my cart. I have used it on 2 trips to Canada and 1 to Houston, as well as several road trips. It is still in excellent condition, and the zipper is great, with a nice pull ring which makes it easy to open/close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeeze bottles are a little tough to squeeze, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint compared to having to deal with one that&#x27;s squished, leaving you a mess to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 Would buy again, but I doubt I&#x27;ll have to.</li>
    <li> Plastic is very hard and not pliable, zipper hard to work.  Bottles are okay but not great.  Who really cares about N eye mask? And you can get a bag of ear plugs in any pharmacy.  Not worth postage to return but wish I had not puchased it.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and durable!</li>
    <li> Has lasted me awhile now. Pretty amazed the plastic hasn&#x27;t split!</li>
    <li> Good size bag, holds everything i need when i travel.  The zipper is a bit firm, will probbably loosen up with use.</li>
