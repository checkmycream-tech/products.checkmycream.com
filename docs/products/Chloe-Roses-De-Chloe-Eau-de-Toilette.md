      <li>and has b sen for many years, so I was dubious about trying a new one, it is beautiful, a soft rose scent with still a hint of the Chloe essence in it&#x27;s top  notes</li>

      <li>This is very similar to Cartier Goutte de Rose, but I think I like this one by Chloe just a little bit more.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Even for a little bottle; it lasts a good  it,  even with a daily dab or two</li>

    <li> I love this perfume!  Here are a few comments from others:&lt;br /&gt;1 - My mom, sister, niece, and I did one of those wine/art events a few weeks ago.  I got there last.  I sat down next to my niece.  She said &amp;#34;Wow, you smell good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2 - In the grocery store produce section, the store employee asked me if I needed help as he was about to walk past me.  I said &amp;#34;no, thank you.&amp;#34;  As he got next to me, he said &amp;#34;Man, you smell GOOD!&amp;#34;.  I just laughed and said &amp;#34;thank you.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3 - I was out doing errands with my brother the other day.  I ran into a store to use the restroom.  The store employee was walking me toward the back of the store.  She said to me &amp;#34;Not to be weird, but you smell really good!&amp;#34;  I said &amp;#34;thank you.  I will have to get more of this perfume.  You&#x27;re the third person to comment on it lately.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more of this perfume.  Aside from the nice comments from strangers, I love it myself.  It has a delicate rose scent and is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I really not into floral scented perfumes, but this one here! Babbbbbyyyy, let me tell you! lol....its just great! its not too strong, light, and amazing!</li>
    <li> Great perfume and way cheaper than Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom!</li>

    <li> Decided to try something new that was not too strong, but just right. Love the scent!!</li>
    <li> Love it this roses smell</li>
    <li> It came in the mail as promised. The package was undamaged.i was disappointed to.find out that the item did not have the cellophane wrapper and.with a lot of finger prints on the shiny metallic head portion of the bottle. Iwhy did you not specify in your ad that it is opened or used. Disgusting.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Just as expected, thanks!</li>
    <li> The perfume is fake. The smell doesn&#x27;t last long and it smells differently compare to the same item from nordstrom.</li>
    <li> Gift. My daughter loves it. Shipping was great! And timely.</li>
    <li> I love florals, and rose florals are in the top five of my favorite scents.  Roses De Chloe does NOT disappoint this rose fragrance fan!  I have smelled some fragrances that were supposed to be rose scented, but they don&#x27;t even have the faintest whiff of rose in them.  This one by Chloe DOES!  Definitely meets my expectations.  This is very similar to Cartier Goutte de Rose, but I think I like this one by Chloe just a little bit more.  :o)</li>
    <li> not like rose perfume but a fresh batch of garden roses.  the guy who delivers my groceries looked around wildly at the yard and sniffed wildly with a look of ecstatic joy and said &amp;#34;I SMELL ROSES!!!&amp;#34;  He didn&#x27;t think it was my perfume….that was awesome!  Amazing perfume.  I hate white musk and it says it has some in there but I don&#x27;t smell it at all.  Joy perfume and Shalimar and Chanel #5 make me gag.  This is fresh and clean and rosy without being like a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman with her tea rose spray on.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Irresistible parfum! You can perceive the roses essence. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful rose smell with some other very pleasant smells.  Much cheaper than Sephora and other outlets.  So lovely</li>
    <li> love this perfume! smells EXACTLY like roses. Classic and timeless.</li>
    <li> This and the regular Chloe are my two favorites. This one smells so fresh and rosy. Such a pleasant smell. It makes me feel graceful and sophisticated. I even spray it onto my pillow when I sleep.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Not overpowering, very feminine!</li>
