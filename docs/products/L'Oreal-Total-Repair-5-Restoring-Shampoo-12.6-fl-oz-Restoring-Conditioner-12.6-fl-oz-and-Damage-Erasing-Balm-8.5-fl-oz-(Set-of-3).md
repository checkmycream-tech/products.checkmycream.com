      <li>Love this product I started using this since last Thursday and it made my hair soft and clean</li>
      <li>My hair is completely tangle free when I get out of the shower now, and my hair stays soft and clean for 2 days now between washing, which I could never do before with my pureology shampoo that costs 3 times what this does.</li>

      <li>Have been using for several months and have noticed significant improvement in the texture of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I  have the most over processed black hair on the planet</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tried the shampoo and conditioner the minute it was delivered and, boy, I&#x27;m glad I did. My gray/yellow hair was in terrible shape: dry and brittle. I could not believe the instant results. Went ahead and used the cream conditioner, too, but will probably use it on a weekly basis only. I cannot believe the shine! I have very fine hair and wish there was a body builder in this line of products. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 rating instead of a 5...</li>
    <li> These products are awesome! I  have the most over processed black hair on the planet and this has helped tremendously. At one point was using Pantene because I liked the way it made my hair feel and smell but after a while my hair started falling out bad from all the alcohol they use in their products. I had a chemical straightening done a couple years ago and wanted to find something to help repair my hair and tried this out..never going back to anything else! You can really feel the difference in your hair after one wash, never tried a better shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Best hair product you can get at grocery store. My hair was over processed and this brought it back to life. It&#x27;s gold and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  and it is so much reasonable on line</li>
    <li> In love with this set. If I had Wal Mart in this country I would have saved money and bought it there. I recently went honey brown and my hair needs lots of conditioning. This set provides it!</li>
    <li> Second time I bought these items. Reached my expectations completely. Highly recommended to dry and chemically treated hair. Execellent Loreal product.</li>
    <li> I took a chance giving this as an  extra Christmas gift. I was delighted to hear each gift was used and they all appreciated the opportunity to try it without having to purchase. All three reported using and had noticed an improvement in their dry winter hair. I would have liked a smaller gift pack to fit into a stocking. Thinking of using travel size products next year.</li>
    <li> I am an over processed blonde and thus have split ends and dry hair. I have been using neutrogena (over the counter) and kerastase crytaliste (from salons) and recently made the switch to Loreal after trying the brand at a friends house. The shampoo and conditioner is amazing. It left my hair silky soft and smelling great. My hair has never felt this healthy and after just one wash! Most importantly I have fine hair which can easily feel like it is over conditioned. My hair feels light and my frizz is well under control. I look forward to trying the balm this week.  Also check out the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;- it is not oily and heavy. I applied it once with my hair wet. And a little again after styling to help with the static of this dry Michigan weather.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.. I haven&#x27;t been this happy with my hair in years! I leave in the balm for 10-20 min after I shampoo and condition.</li>
    <li> Finally hair products that really make your hair look great, it repairs broken ends, dry hair, falling hair etc. L&#x27;Oreal is really great</li>
    <li> I was blown away with the results of these products and by the price. My hair is super dry and very long, and I need super moisture to make it feel soft. This is a super great product. It also has a clean fruity scent that is very pleasant. I do not have to use the leave in treatment after I get out of the shower because this product is so good. I do anyway, but my comb will run through my hair just fine without the extra products, that&#x27;s how deeply the conditioners moisturize my hair. I use the shampoo with the conditioner, and the cream I use once a week for super deep conditioning. I&#x27;m hooked on these products. If you have dry hair, you need to try this product line.</li>
    <li> I have long straight black hair, I love it and I like playing with it (curls, super straight, wavy) and this shampoo has helped me take care of it. My hair is much softer, the ends look much better. I use all the products of this line (shampoo, conditioner, damage erasing balm, restorative dry oil) and it really repairs.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and this shampoo/conditioner and damage erasing balm left my hair extremely dry and tangled.  I regret buying it and do not plan to use this product again.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to use this product when I saw the promos for it. However I was dissapointed. When I washed my hair with the shampoo it made my hair feel like straw. My hair became so tangled and hard to manage. The conditioner didn&#x27;t help to soften my hair as I expected. I used the product a second time just for a peace of mind and my opinions remain the same. Very dissapointed. But then again I knew better to stay away from anything that contains sulfur.</li>
    <li> Not for me. My hair felt greasy and not soft. I threw all of it away. Even my wife didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> This has been the best hair product I have ever purchased....I am in my sixties and have colored and highlighted my hair the last 20 years and have always managed to take good care of hair.... Most women know w/ meds. And coloring it has a tendency to dry hair some......WITH these products  it has replaced and done every thing it said it could do and my hair looks young again...&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this set!!! I have very fine, damaged hair, and ever since I (regrettably) permed it, it hasn&#x27;t been the same. Typically I have healthy, shiny, soft hair, and that&#x27;s exactly what this product gives me!!! The deep conditioner is amazing, really does make a huge difference in the texture and manageability of your hair. My hair is completely tangle free when I get out of the shower now, and my hair stays soft and clean for 2 days now between washing, which I could never do before with my pureology shampoo that costs 3 times what this does. This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Its scary to wash my hair once every two days.. but my hair feels nice &amp; soft and very very less broken hair when I run my fingers through them..I&#x27;ll wait for a month or so to see if this stuff really truly works.. so far so good.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for anyone with dry brittle hair.  Have been using for several months and have noticed significant improvement in the texture of my hair.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Did an amazing job bring life back to my daughters hair.  She had split ends and dry hair now its soft, smooth and healthy looking/feeling.  Think its going to save 3 inches of hair we thought we needed clipped. She is a much happier camper since the purchase and we haven&#x27;t even gotten through half the contents of the bottles.  Would recommended and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was perviously a red hair and I decided to go blonde in one shot. I wanted a new look not realizing the damage it would cause my hair. My hair has had a lot of breakage and it was very course. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, chopping it all off and growing it back virgin and back to dying. I needed something to bring back my curls and provide nutrients to my hair. I read a review on this and I decided to give the whole line a try. I have five products and one being the oil. The oil is amazing and in five weeks and five treatments, my hair is so lonely being restored and feeling much softer. Thank you L&#x27;Oreal for helpin me get my hair back.</li>
    <li> Love this product I started using this since last Thursday and it made my hair soft and clean</li>
    <li> I really like these products.  Being a woman, maybe I liked them because they&#x27;re new and I hadn&#x27;t tried them (typical female attitude).  Whatever, give them a shot.</li>
