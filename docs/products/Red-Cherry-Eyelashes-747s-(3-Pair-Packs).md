<li> they look natural</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t look natural to me that long.</li>
<li> The 747s are not made of natural human hair, so they feel slightly heavier on the lid.</li>
<li> Since I don&#x27;t wear them all the time, I might get the extra small ones for daily wear.</li>
<li> These fake eyelashes look lush and natural.</li>
<li> (they didn&#x27;t look like they were hitting my eyebrows!), without drawing too much attention to the fact that I was wearing fake lashes.</li>
<li> Glad to see these hold up well even after washing them from the annoying glue that gets stuck to them.</li>
<li> Sometimes I like layering two for a dramatic effect that still looks natural.</li>
<li> but I thought that they would be a little fuller (maybe I should have gotten the 747xs).  </li>
<li> These are my go to everyday lashes.</li>
<li> , I can&#x27;t imagine how small the 747xs and 747u eyelashes must be.</li>
<li> In a banker so my weekday makeup is usually a bit reserved</li>
<li> Lasts long and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
<li> I did the makeup for my sisters wedding and wanted a lash that would make her lashes pop without looking fake and without breaking the bank.  </li>

    <li> I received my shippment quickly.  I love the lashes but I thought that they would be a little fuller (maybe I should have gotten the 747xs).  I especially loved the price and I will order more from this supplier - the handwritten note was an added touch that really got my attention as well.</li>
    <li> The order came in on time. No broken seals of any kind.</li>
    <li> Not as short as I would have liked them. They don&#x27;t look natural to me that long.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!! Very natural looking! Will order again!!</li>
    <li> The 747s are not made of natural human hair, so they feel slightly heavier on the lid. They do look natural though, I can&#x27;t imagine how small the 747xs and 747u eyelashes must be.</li>
    <li> These were perfect! I ordered these and #415, trying to see which might be better for a formal evening wedding.

    <li> I did the makeup for my sisters wedding and wanted a lash that would make her lashes pop without looking fake and without breaking the bank.  Not only are they incredibly affordable, they are really natural looking.  They just really upped her eyes without being too over the top.  She looked like herself for her wedding.  Quality is great.  Stayed on all night.  I got a three pack and am excited to use them myself.</li>
    <li> These are my go to everyday lashes. In a banker so my weekday makeup is usually a bit reserved but I love the extra length I get with these. My colleagues all want these now. I intend to buy in bulk to share my new found lash love with them!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m new to applying false lashes and these were a good pair to work with. Glad to see these hold up well even after washing them from the annoying glue that gets stuck to them. I personally don&#x27;t like the way they shape my eyes but this was overall a good deal and even though I thought these would end up being a bit smaller they are still a good length overall.</li>
    <li> These ones are not crazy big false eyelashes and more normal looking, but gives a nice boost. Since I don&#x27;t wear them all the time, I might get the extra small ones for daily wear. These I would say are in between daily and night out eyelashes.</li>
    <li> The Red Cherry lashes are one of my favorite lashes! The band is thin which makes them more comfortable to wear and the fact that they are 100% human hair makes it even better! # 43 is one of my favorites! The price is great too for such a good product!</li>
    <li> very natural looking  I love the clear band</li>
    <li> These fake eyelashes look lush and natural. Sometimes I like layering two for a dramatic effect that still looks natural.</li>
