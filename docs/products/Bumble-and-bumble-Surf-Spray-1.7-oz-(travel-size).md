      <li>give me the best volume.  </li>
      <li>but I would look to Oribe if you are looking for a great beach wave hair spray!</li>
      <li>So if you are looking for something to give your hair some great texture, this is the product for you!</li>
      <li>One of my favorites, works great.</li>
      <li>and this gives me a great texture for the beach hair</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>Does not do anything for my hair but smells nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the Davines spray, and it&#x27;s more pricey.</li>
      <li>Loved this product - I am a blonde and it gave me the perfect beach hair that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
      <li>nice product, easy to use and produces nice easy wavy curls</li>
      <li>I have tried many thickening and volumizing sprays and this one</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love what it does...</li>
      <li>I love how this product works and smells.</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>I think it would work great on naturally straight hair.</li>
      <li>Very tiny container, but still great!</li>
      <li>That said, I love the results of every salt spray I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product of all time.  </li>
      <li>and she uses it more than I do</li>
      <li>There are comparable brands on the market that offer much better value.</li>
      <li>It does what it says for sure... which is all I ask for.</li>
      <li>Best product you can buy for your bob or long bob.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll have full, static-free hair!</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this provides lots of volume and waves.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic as well.</li>
      <li>a hair powder, redken or big sexy hair have a good one.</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased the travel size to test it out before paying for a large size.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t any good didn&#x27;t actually create any texture or volume</li>
      <li>&quot; but it looks cool.  </li>
      <li>I love the summer beach hair I get with this spray, but I actually use it more in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I live the travel size as well :-)</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, a decent amount, but it&#x27;s pretty fine.  </li>
      <li>maybe im not using it right...</li>
      <li>I find it works best when I plan to let my hair dry naturally and then put it up - as my heavy thick hair always seems to look best the day after its been washed.</li>
      <li>We first learned of this product when we were in Hawaii.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;beachier\\&quot; look, and looks much better than just letting my hair air dry without putting anything on it.</li>
      <li>Pure garbage for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight hair and this gives me nice beachy waves with little product use.</li>
      <li>The product came fast but it came in a huge box and was a lot smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>Also, turns out I don&#x27;t really like it much.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t do much to combat frizz from humidity but otherwise serves its purpose for beach like waves and volume.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend really likes this stuff</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I believe it&#x27;s very overpriced.</li>
      <li>This product really dries our your hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>It gives your hair a nice shine without making it sticky, greasy, or stiff.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to run your fingers through the waves so that they&#x27;re less defined</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars if it had a little more hold to it.</li>
      <li>it makes your hair feel super dry if you sprey to much in your hair</li>
      <li>My fine hair can get a little flat during the dry winter months, but this gives it lots of nice, natural volume.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the only thing I have bought consistently over the years.  </li>
      <li>My hair remains soft and not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and was hoping for texture with this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few different surf spray style products- oribe is still my favorite, thought I would try this out because it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
      <li>I sprayed it on and it made my hair feel stiff right away.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and this surf spray plus a blow dryer</li>

<li> I have fine thin hair and this surf spray plus a blow dryer</li>
<li> I was so excited to try this because of all the buzz behind it.</li>
<li> B&amp;B Surf Spray works well to give soft beach blown waves, but can leave your hair with an odd texture and feeling kind of dirty.  </li>
<li> I do have to spray quite a bit on to see the effect and for the price it won&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
<li> I spray it on towel dried hair and I blow dry with a large tooth comb.  </li>
<li> Not sure why others claim to like it so much.</li>
<li> The waves dont last too long</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s like a long bob, almost to my shoulders.  </li>
<li> but I dont feel it worked as well and wish I had spent the extra money for oribe.</li>
<li> This along with my dry shampoo</li>
<li> I would keep cutting it short because as it got longer it got more limp.  </li>
<li> I like this but only use very little</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s slightly overpriced.</li>
<li> I will still use it as I dont want to waste it</li>
<li> If you have thin hair, this will give you the texture you want for lasting volume!!</li>
<li> It adds texture to my hair and gives it the messy look I prefer.</li>
<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of money.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want my hair round</li>
<li> For me, it&#x27;s 3-stars because it&#x27;s a bit stiff.</li>
<li> like how it leaves my hair all stiff.</li>
<li> I expected it to smell at least half way decent, especially because of the price, but it smelt horrific and lingered for hours.</li>
<li> I got a lousy short haircut and was hoping to improve it with a tousled beachy look.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t able to even see if it worked because of how terrible the smell of this product is.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is \\&quot;beachy\\</li>
<li> With this product it becomes thick and textured.  </li>
<li> I could rub in amy dirt &amp; it would have looked the same, messy &amp; dirty &amp; impossible to comb/brush.</li>
<li> This just seems to be an awfully expensive way to get that salt air look.  </li>
<li> I was so disappointed.</li>

    <li> Used it up but didn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, works great. I live the travel size as well :-)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t any good didn&#x27;t actually create any texture or volume</li>
    <li> This just seems to be an awfully expensive way to get that salt air look.  It&#x27;s nice, but......maybe I can make sea salt water and spray it in.</li>
    <li> I love the summer beach hair I get with this spray, but I actually use it more in the winter.  My fine hair can get a little flat during the dry winter months, but this gives it lots of nice, natural volume.  Just make sure to run your fingers through the waves so that they&#x27;re less defined and you&#x27;ll have full, static-free hair!</li>
    <li> This just did not work on my hair. I have naturally curly hair and was hoping for texture with this product. I think it would work great on naturally straight hair.</li>
    <li> Best product you can buy for your bob or long bob. This along with my dry shampoo help me goes 4 days without washing!</li>
    <li> Pure garbage for my hair. I could rub in amy dirt &amp; it would have looked the same, messy &amp; dirty &amp; impossible to comb/brush.</li>
    <li> Does not do anything for my hair but smells nice. Not sure why others claim to like it so much. I am glad I purchased the travel size to test it out before paying for a large size.</li>

It adds texture to my hair and gives it the messy look I prefer. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s slightly overpriced. There are comparable brands on the market that offer much better value.</li>
    <li> Loved this product - I am a blonde and it gave me the perfect beach hair that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love what it does...I would give it 5 stars if it had a little more hold to it.</li>
    <li> This product really dries our your hair and scalp.  I would recommend their sift shampoo and conditioner over this product.  You can wash and it dries w the same effects w/ out the driness.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product of all time.  It&#x27;s probably the only thing I have bought consistently over the years.  I have fine thin hair and this surf spray plus a blow dryer give me the best volume.  I have tried many thickening and volumizing sprays and this one just works.  If you have thin hair, this will give you the texture you want for lasting volume!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, and sometimes I don&#x27;t want to take the time to style it into place and get all the waves to lie \\&quot;properly.\\&quot; On those days I use the Surf Spray. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;beachier\\&quot; look, and looks much better than just letting my hair air dry without putting anything on it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this provides lots of volume and waves. I would definitely recommend this product. I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I believe it&#x27;s very overpriced. I do have to spray quite a bit on to see the effect and for the price it won&#x27;t last long enough. Also doesn&#x27;t do much to combat frizz from humidity but otherwise serves its purpose for beach like waves and volume.</li>
    <li> Very tiny container, but still great!</li>
    <li> Was recommended ...don&#x27;t like it...makes hair stick together</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not summer until you have the B&amp;B Surf Spray going! I love how this product works and smells. Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, a decent amount, but it&#x27;s pretty fine.  I would keep cutting it short because as it got longer it got more limp.  I also have no interest in spending lots of time styling.  I&#x27;ve seen the ads for this product but could not seem to make my hair look like that with this spray.  I use it like a styling spray and it&#x27;s amazing.  I spray it on towel dried hair and I blow dry with a large tooth comb.  I don&#x27;t want my hair round, it&#x27;s like a long bob, almost to my shoulders.  With this product it becomes thick and textured.  What I&#x27;ve always been looking for.  I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; but it looks cool.  I also follow up with a hair powder, redken or big sexy hair have a good one.</li>
    <li> I like this but only use very little it makes your hair feel super dry if you sprey to much in your hair</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and this gives me a great texture for the beach hair look.  It makes my hair very coarse, but that is what I was wanting.  So if you are looking for something to give your hair some great texture, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> Bought because of brand name and it doesn&#x27;t do anything that I  can tell. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> am constant buyer of this product. I absolutely love it! I have stick straight hair and this gives me nice beachy waves with little product use. My hair remains soft and not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling. It&#x27;s my definite summer go to hair product! The smell is fantastic as well. It reminds me of the ocean. This product gets an A+</li>
    <li> maybe im not using it right... i dont like how it leaves my hair all stiff. The waves dont last too long</li>
    <li> Could have been water in there for all I know. Who sends a liquid product out like that? Don&#x27;t buy here.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really likes this stuff and she uses it more than I do so I gave it 4-stars.  For me, it&#x27;s 3-stars because it&#x27;s a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> B&amp;B Surf Spray works well to give soft beach blown waves, but can leave your hair with an odd texture and feeling kind of dirty.  I find it works best when I plan to let my hair dry naturally and then put it up - as my heavy thick hair always seems to look best the day after its been washed.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different surf spray style products- oribe is still my favorite, thought I would try this out because it&#x27;s cheaper but I dont feel it worked as well and wish I had spent the extra money for oribe. I will still use it as I dont want to waste it and it works okay, but I would look to Oribe if you are looking for a great beach wave hair spray!</li>
    <li> The product came fast but it came in a huge box and was a lot smaller than I thought. Also, turns out I don&#x27;t really like it much.</li>
    <li> It does what it says for sure... which is all I ask for.</li>
    <li> nice product, easy to use and produces nice easy wavy curls</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  I got a lousy short haircut and was hoping to improve it with a tousled beachy look.  This didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would do what the description says. I wasn&#x27;t able to even see if it worked because of how terrible the smell of this product is. I expected it to smell at least half way decent, especially because of the price, but it smelt horrific and lingered for hours.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this because of all the buzz behind it. I was so disappointed. I sprayed it on and it made my hair feel stiff right away. Felt like I had put a bunch of hairspray in my hair. Not the manageable beach wave look I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> We first learned of this product when we were in Hawaii.  It gives your hair a nice shine without making it sticky, greasy, or stiff.  It makes your hair look like you just came out of the ocean.</li>
