<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tried product on lower arms &amp; a bit on face. Seems to work, takes long for mole to drop off &amp; hoping discoloration where molds were disappear soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed an item before but this deserves it. I have successfully removed 4 moles and 1 skin tag from my chest and arm. I give it 5 stars just for the simple fact that it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> i like it it actually help me remove 2 moles from my body so i think it works thanks dermatend</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! First big mole, it worked completely 1st try and 3 weeks later no scarring or anything. 2nd big mole took 3 treatments but still worked great!</li>
    <li> Had a very large skin tag. Took 5 applications and 10 weeks but the skin tag is gone. No pain at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for three weeks now, but it has not removed the mole.  I hope it well still work perhaps in another week. ---posted June 22, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Continued on July 5, 2013).  I have been using DermaTend for over six weeks now.  It has brought no positive results as far as removing the mole in this length of time.  The product is advertised as being able to remove moles in as little as eight hours.  I am into the 7th week, so I believe I have given it sufficient time, and I would not recommend it to any one as a way to remove a mole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was even more disappointed when a representative of the firm told me the product which they sent was defective and they would send another tube which would do the job.  I have not received the other tube!  This lack of action on her part has served to make me even less happy with DermaTend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing --- I want to commend Amazon for crediting my account immediately after my first complaint about DermaTend.  I will purchase through Amazon whenever I have opportunity in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry M. Pence</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised.  If you want to remove anything, you will get better results going to a professional.  What a shame! I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This does what it says -- it works. It is more difficult to use than is described in their information -- you have to &amp;#34;file down&amp;#34; the tags you want to dissolve, which is hard to do by yourself when they are on your back or places in the backs of your shoulders. But once this is accomplished, a simple dab on the lotion and it does its thing over time. I didn&#x27;t bother putting the &amp;#34;healing lotion&amp;#34; on after a few days -- and it just did its thing. I was quite amazed actually.</li>
    <li> When I first decided to try dermatend , I was a little uncertain about if it was a good choice for me. The worst case scenario would be to have my mole surgically removed, which I had been thinking about for years anyways.I always tend to prefer to be able to treat my own physical/ health needs myself, so this product was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I did do some research though. I read every review that I could find and I felt safe enough experimenting on myself by the time I ordered the product. I&#x27;m a tattoo artist, so perhaps I&#x27;m less squeamish than some people. Anyways the procedure was very straight forward. I used the filing board that was included with my dermatend package, but instead of using the sterile toothpick to further rough up the area, I poked my mole about 30 times with a sterilized sewing needle.I really wanted to be sure that the process worked the first time as the mole was in such a visible spot. Initially my mole turned kindof white and then it turned dark brown and slightly scabby. I think I probably left the product on my skin a little longer than recommended, but I really wanted that mole gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were and are great. The unsightly mole on my chin, that over the years was looking more and more like a wart, is totally removed. I am so relieved not to have to see that thing every day when I look in the mirror. There was some redness around the mole before it came off as a scab. It wasn&#x27;t too unsightly, though I did put a small circular bandage over it for the first couple of days, mostly so I wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to mess with it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I am very happy with the results! What a relief!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve removed loads of mole using this stuff, way more than the bottle says it should. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that just scratching the surface of the mole before application won&#x27;t work, you really need to take a lot of skin off the mole, if it doesn&#x27;t bleed it wont work.  Also forget about using the abrasive stick and toothpick they supply you with. The abrasive paper takes off too much surrounding skin, and a toothpick is a bit primitive, I thought surely they could have don&#x27;t better than that. I&#x27;d recommend using a hypodermic needle to scratch the mole, but I didn&#x27;t have one so I used a new blade for a carpet knife sterilized with IPA.  Once you apply the product there is a very mild stinging sensation, then within a day a scab forms. About 3-4 days later the scab will fall off leaving a pretty big hole where the mole was, but within 2 weeks it fills up and looks normal again.  The quick healing balm is also a bit of a joke, you&#x27;re much better off using neosporin or something like that.  In summary the product definitely works well, but you need to be willing to scratch deep into that mole, its relatively painless but a little gruesome, and throw away the balm, abrasive and toothpick. The little added cost of buying neosporin and a hypodermic needle will pay off in the end.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptic about this product, and was reluctant to invest so much money on something that could completely fail, but I had a few moles I wanted to get rid of and just the time needed to go to the doctor (a few times including diagnosis, tests and removal) plus the horrible experience the one time I had to get a mole removed surgically (it actually didn&#x27;t hurt but it was really scary) pushed me to try it.  I started with a big protruding mole I had in my shoulder. Due to friction against clothes it had become a little bit rough, but given its location I figured out I had little to lose if it left a scar. I started by scratching the mole with the included file and then applied the product. I didn&#x27;t feel any sting when I applied the paste and nothing happened within 24 hours so I figured out my mole was a bit sturdier than normal due to its hardened skin. I decided to bring up the artillery and took my wife&#x27;s dremel-like pedicure kit and tried with that. It worked much better (especially considering the awkward location of the mole), really getting to the point the mole felt soft and I could even see tiny dots of almost-blood on the surface (without actually making the mole bleed). I tried again and this time I DID feel the stinging sensation I was expected to feel.  Sure enough, just 24 hours later, a scab had formed. I made a commitment not to touch it or rip it off. It took six days for the scab to fall. But it did fall. And man, I was AMAZED! Where the mole had been, there was just slightly irritated skin. No scar, no hole, no nothing. Just a bit of reddish skin which went away in a few days. I couldn&#x27;t beleive it, skin is not supposed to heal so quickly!!!  So encouraged by these early results I decided to go for a few other moles I had. I went first for a bunch of very small red, slightly protruding dots I had on my chest. I didn&#x27;t know how much to scratch them since they were red and somewhat soft to begin with, so I used the tool I had used before forsome light filing. It stung when I applied the product so I guessed it was working. The three moles did form a scab, but after a few days they hadn&#x27;t fallen off. One of them did fall off but just to leave a just slightly smaller version of the original red mole below! I reapplied the product on this one (without any extra filing, and it stung) and it again formed a scab.  After over a week of waiting for the scabs to fall I became impatient and started pulling them off. They did go off, and sure enough the moles were gone, but they all left a tiny hole in my skin. Nothing scary though quite deep. A few days later, the holes started to close, and two weeks later they were gone, but a tiny round \\&quot;scar tissue\\&quot; mark was left. Applying the healing balm included with the product didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference (I tried with and without for some sort of comparison, no noticeable difference). Skin is also red around the area, but I guess the red will be gone in a few weeks. In all, these went out well, but the tiny scars are not something I would like on my nose or my cheeks. In any case they look much better than the moles they replaced and may go away with time.  Then I decided to try with a bulby mole I had in my armpit and a similar one my wife had on her neck. These are the kind that you can pull and twist, round, soft and nasty, the sort you would be tempted to chop out with scissors if you didn&#x27;t know it would be the most painful thing you&#x27;d ever experienced. They were VERY difficut to file since they moved around when scratched, but the pedicure kit made it a bit easier. Applying the product was also a bit difficult since their shape and bulbiness made it difficult for the product to stay in place. But I think I must have made a good job since the next morning both had blackened somewhat and one day later they were hard as a rock. The one on my wife&#x27;s neck went kind of weird since half of it scabbed and the other half didn&#x27;t, which made me wonder about the final results, but we decided to file a bit more and add a bit more product on the unscabbed part and wait. The one on my armpit started shrinking and becoming blacker and harder, and in a few days it was definitely dead tissue, but it wouldn&#x27;t fall off. Given its location it felt a bit uncomfortable, so at one point I decided to pull it off. It was certainly dead tissue, so there wasn&#x27;t much downside, right? Big mistake. Pulling it off actually damaged skin around it. It sort of ripped off some healthy skin, leaving a nasty scar. A week later the mole is 100% gone, but the skin is still healing. I have some sort of a crater where the mole used to be. I guess it will completely heal with time, but it will most likely leave a scar. After doing some research on scarring and skin healing I&#x27;ve found that the scabs themselves promote some chemical processes that help the skin to regrow as normal skin, so not only pulling them off damages skin but leaving them in place helps the underlying skin heal better. The product active component itself (based on Sanginaria Canadiensis root extracts) basically kills the cells that absorb it, which causes the body to get rid of them. Once dead, they should fall naturally. If you pull the scab, you are ripping off part of you halthy skin and will produce damage.  That&#x27;s probably why the first one went out so well.  So, lesson learned, don&#x27;t pull the scabs off. Ever.   As for the one on my wife&#x27;s neck, half of it fell off on its own, leaving a skin flap. But the skin flap fell off two days later, leaving almost no mark behind. It&#x27;s been three weeks since, and the mark is almost completely gone already. She&#x27;s amazed with it, where a very nasty, uncomfortable mole once was, there&#x27;s now almost perfect skin.   So with a better understanding of the results we decided to go for all the remaining ones. A large, protruding one above my ear, under my hair; a few smaller red dots in my arms; a flat, dark one in my chin; a prodtruding, squarish one in my wife&#x27;s cheek and a flat, apparently deep one in my wife&#x27;s ear lobe. Yes, it became sort of addictive to remove moles with this thing.     Long story short, all of them went away, but with varying results. All the bulby ones simply fell off, leaving perfect skin below (other than the one I ripped off). The prodtruding ones also went away, leaving no mark. The one on my wife&#x27;s cheek actually didn&#x27;t fully go away the first time, leaving a smaller, smoother mole in place of the original one after the scab fell off. But we tried the process again, and this time the whole thing disappeared. Instead of a mole, now she has a small, sligtly darker patch of skin, which is apparently going away with time. My wife is a bad scarrer, when she has surgery it always leaves nasty scars behind, so I guess this mark is much better than what she expected and orders of magnitude better looking that the mole it replaced, even if it never goes away.  The one under my hair simply disappeared. No mark, not even a red spot. No damage to the hair either. I had acquired the tendency to scratch it while thinking and now I find myself scratching the empty spot!  I tried the product with only one skin tag, also in my armpit. It fell off without leaving a mark in just three days. Just disappeared on its own. I don&#x27;t know if I could have scratched it well-enough with the provided file, but with the pedicure kit it was easy and apparently good enough.  Then there&#x27;s the flat ones. Those that go deep into the skin, that usually have hairs. We tried on three of them and they didn&#x27;t go as well as the others. Two of them actually went away, but left a deep hole where they were. The holes are scarring well but after two weeks deep marks are still there, and I guess they will leave the sort of mark you wouldn&#x27;t want in your face. Also, the bigger the mole, the deeper the scar, so you might want to avoid using the product for flat, deep moles in your face. The third deep mole didn&#x27;t go away, just got a hole in the middle, which is scarring in tissue which I still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal skin or mole-like tissue. Will probably try again in a few weeks.  So, the veredict? Excellent products, but it needs to be applied well and your mileage will vary depending on the type of mole.  For hard, witch-like prodtruding moles, it gives excellent results. It just gets rid of them, leaving almost no mark behind. It needs some work on the filing and application, but the results couldn&#x27;t be better. And compared with a surgical removal the process is less painful, easier and yields much better results.  For skin tags and bulby, flappy moles, equally amazing success. Go for it. They will just die and fall off, leaving no mark as long as you leave them to fall on their own. DON&#x27;T PULL THEM OFF!  For small red dots it might work well but you need to leave the scabs alone. Don&#x27;t pull them off. If the moles are in your face you might want to do a bit of testing with similar moles in other parts of your body before going for the face.   Finally, for the flat ones that go deep into the skin, leave them alone. There might be a trick to make the product work better there, but I haven&#x27;t been too successful in removing them without leaving a scar behind that&#x27;s almost as ugly as the original mole. Even if the results improve with time, I don&#x27;t think it is worth for this sort of mole, which in generally don&#x27;t look as bad to begin with.  As for the product itself, it is good for quite a few moles (I am guessing it should be enough for maybe twenty large moles if you use the product carefully) but there are four improvements I would suggest:  1) Replace the filing with some chemical peeling. It would probably give better results and be easier to use.  2) If not possible, include some electric \\&quot;dremel-like\\&quot; device to do the filing. Yes, it would increase price, but at the current price point it shouldn&#x27;t change much, and it would give much better results. The manual filing just doesn&#x27;t cut itunless your moles are very protruding and in easy to reach places.  3) Include some adhesive, perforated \\&quot;templates\\&quot; to apply around the mole, so the product doesn&#x27;t extend beyond the mole. In some cases (especially in the moles that were hard to reach due to their location) I ended up spreading the product beyond the actual moles, which somewhat damaged surrounding skin. Surrounding the mole with some adhesive template that covers all surrounding skin while leaving the mole exposed would make application easier and it should produce better results.  4) Add an applicator. A siringe like thing would work best, but the fact is that none is provided and the consistency of the product makes it difficult to apply with a swab or a stick. At this price point, something should be provided.    Even with that, amazing product, which I highly recommend for anything other than the deepest moles.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as advertised for me.  I prep-ed and applied as recommended on the web site (no printed instruction included with product), and no joy.  Areas grew back just as before.</li>
    <li> I would give a 4.5 stars rating only because I do have some reservations regarding this product; after all, scratching your mole with a toothpick is quite the contrary of what any dermatologist would tell you, and in general, they do not provide any medical advice/warnings that one should be aware of before using it (such as, you should definitely check with a doctor whether the mole is malignant, etc.). However, the product does work as advertised. I removed several moles, and they all came off. Sometimes I had to apply the product twice, but never more than that; it does usually leave a small crater where the mole used to be, but that disappears after a few weeks. After the application, the scabs usually needed 3-5 days to get off. Just to note, Neosporin really helps to quicken this process; when I did not use it, it took more than a week. However, I did not notice the same effect with the \\&quot;quick healing balm\\&quot;, which comes with the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, after a year or so, they have grown back. Without exception. So maybe this thing does not work really.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a try since most people said it worked for them. I removed about 6 moles, one of which was pretty large and the stuff really works. The large one took two applications and a skin tag that I tried it on took two applications, but the rest came off with one try. As everyone has said, if you do not sand the mole with the file they give long enough, so that when you put the product on that it stings, then you have not sanded enough and it will not work. The key is to have the product form a scab and it will not do that unless you sand enough to make the product sting when you put it on. I also learned to leave the bandaid (I used the small circle ones you can buy at the store) on for 3 days before taking it off. The mole would usually fall off in the shower the next day. It leaves a pink spot on your skin where it fell off, but it would leave a mark if it was removed by any other method anyway. I am sure with time the mark will go away.</li>
    <li> A good product in theory but the moles came back so its thumbs down from me (believe me i tried three times to remove the same moles)</li>
    <li> This product really works. I had two large skin tags which it removed. What it actually does is chemically or with natural products burn the skin off. I was left with two scabs (like cuts) which in turn took about a week to heal and then another 2-3 weeks for the dark marks to fade (I have dark skin).</li>
    <li> I just got extra strength dermatend in the mail today and im going to see if it works. i applied it on a skin tag i had on my neck that really bothers me, it makes me feel old, since i see these on older people and im only 27. I also applied it on a mole i have on my knee. (i have others on my face but im afraid to try it if i dont know what the outcome will be) ... so im a real person, i will let yall know the results in a couple days! im excited to see how well this turns out, if not you better believe im returning it with their 90 day money back guarantee!!  so far it stung when i applied it, i will update yall at the end of the week...</li>
    <li> i have to tell you i had skin tags for a long time and i didnt think this little tube was able to the job. it proved me wrong. i had a skin tag the size of a penny on my back for years i wanted off and this stuff just ate it up.  it turned black but the only thing that sucks is pulling the scabs it hurts a little but this stuff works after like 4 th day it really does</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really works. I applied as directed on a larger mole, and after it did its work I have a much smaller mole. I will reapply to see if it will disappear completely.  I am very happy with the experience so far. Just use as directed!</li>
    <li> so far has not done much cream because where I wanted to remove a mole, but not dropped everything and already I applied like 3 times and as nothing is making DermaTend cream ....</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first.  It seemed a little too good to be true.  The included scrapers don&#x27;t really work too well.  I&#x27;d use something harder, like a needle or something.  I was able to remove about 5 moles so far.  When I first used it, I saw little change in the mole and assumed it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  A few days later, I realized the mole had actually turned into a scab, and it just peeled off naturally.  I was really amazed.  This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had two (I&#x27;ll describe them as protruding delicate moles) on my face, one near my temple and one just below my lip on the side of my chin.  they were approx. 3/16 in size and elevated about the same. One had very light tan pigment and the other no additional pigment just a fleshy mole.  After a visit to the dermatologist and an estimated $600 removal bill and talk of incisions, I decided to take my chances with Dermatend. Application was easy, although you really need to follow the directions as I can see where it might not work if not done correctly. Within a week I no longer had the moles and only slight scabbing.  Scabbing healed completely with in two weeks for the one at my temple and the other (the one with no additional pigment) I am still experiencing some slight pink discoloration from the healing but it&#x27;s so much better than the mole itself (one month later). This mole experiment was on a whim and was successful for me.  I was concerned about the \\&quot;wateriness\\&quot; of the product at first, but then found that I needed to kneed the tube first.  i.e. mix the product up a little within the tube.  So once the product was at it&#x27;s correct thickness and applied properly to the moles I had success. Bottom line -  If you follow the directions the product will work, maybe not the first time but do more research and give it another chance.</li>
    <li> Need more experience with applying the Ex Derma Tend Ultra as first application did not do what it needs to do.  It was rather awkward to get the skin tags ready due to the location, so did not get them roughed up enough to absorb the ointment.  Plan to do it again tonight and hopefully will scab over like the instructions say they will.  If it works, I will change my rating.</li>
    <li> I had 2 large moles on my face and one hanging on my ear.  I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would work at first but I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It did work miracle but you have to do it right.  My first try didn&#x27;t work so well cause I didn&#x27;t scratch it hard enough.  The second time I used the needle head to scratch all around the moles before  applying the medication (Make sure you cover more than just the mole if you want the entire mole to come off nicely).  4-5 days later the moles came off completely with big holes.  I applied antibiotic ointment and 3 days later the holes filled up nicely.  It did not leave any scar but brownish circle where the moles used to be.  I then applied whitening cream to the areas and now I can&#x27;t even tell where the moles once were.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  If it doesn&#x27;t work the first time, keep trying until you get it right.</li>
    <li> The tube of Dermatend that I received is much smaller than it appears in the thumbnail describing this item. At first I was very bothered by this, and felt ripped off because the product was expensive. But after using the product and finding out how extremely potent and effective a single drop of this stuff is, I am no longer concerned about the size. Here is my quick review in bullet points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;The product absolutely obliterates moles, raised or flat. When you use this product on an unraised mole, it will kill like two layers of skin beneath it. Expect to have a scab there for like 4 to 5 weeks. At first I was skeptical regarding whether this stuff would work. It absolutely will kill skin that has been scratched up. If that skin happens to be a mole, then that mole will be killed. There is absolutely no question about that. You may be tempted to remove a scab after a few days to see if there are any remnants of the mole left, but don&#x27;t bother, you are only prolonging the healing processes, and you will only find a gaping hole and bleeding wound.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a red mark and or scar after healing.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very dangerous&lt;br /&gt;Product is too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Tube is smaller than pictured in product description.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not very careful to only scratch the mole in the initial steps, you could really damage surrounding skin and be left with a bad scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product on your face. Unless you have used it on several other areas of your body with similar marks and are satisfied with the results after complete healing, which will probably take up to 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Wash off with soap and water after 30 minutes as per instructions. I left it on without washing and it seemed to do more damage to surrounding skin as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to really rub the top of the mole raw with the emory board that is included. Then scrape it with the toothpick. If the area you apply the productto does not seem like it has been rubbed raw, the product will not work on it.&lt;br /&gt;Apply neosporen to the scab daily</li>
    <li> I removed 6 moles and I&#x27;m happy to say they are all gone! Yay! It is really important to follow the directions when they say do NOT scratch off the scab while it is healing. Let it fall off on its own. You can still see where my moles were located but I know with time it should lighten up. I think that was due to me scratching the scab before it was time. Great product!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me on skin tags. I tried several times, but it just turned them harder and darker.... However, they have given me a full refund and it was an easy process.</li>
    <li> I have different size moles, all raised.  My smaller size raised moles had the quickest results.  My larger raised moles took just a little bit longer.  I used very little of the product and it worked exactly as the instruction pamphlet stated.  Instructions were very easy to understand.  Be patient because it took a few days to see results.  The price seems steep, but it saved me money since my health insurance does not cover cosmetic mole removal.  I&#x27;m so grateful for this product...it has helped my self esteem.</li>
    <li> The product works.  All you need to do is follow the directions and sit back and watch as your mole or skin tags disappear...the key is to get a good base to work with and to do that you need to really scratch the surface of your mole or skin tag; once you have done that then knead the product to a paste and apply a small amount to cover the mole or skin tag.  You should then feel a slight stinging sensation on the applied area; then you should be good to go.  The product takes approximately 3 weeks to remove the mole...skin tag not so long.  All in all I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wishes to remove their mole or skin tag.</li>
    <li> I spent $40 on this product instead of paying the dermatologist $120. After six applications (and days of band-aids and scabbing after each), the growth continues to come back. Now I will go back to the dermatologist and will have spent $160 by the time it is done right.</li>
    <li> It faded the color of my many moles but did not totally remove them from my upper shoulders. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Yes, it did work but took a lot longer than I expected.  Maybe I had moles that were more resistant to the ingredients in Dermatend.  I just had to be dedicated to the ritual of applying the Dermatend to the moles.</li>
    <li> I used it to remove 4 skin tags. after about a week they fell off if you follow the instructions this product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Works well didn&#x27;t expect much but it truly does what it&#x27;s made to do. If you follow the instructions then there should be no problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff is medical grade! Works exactly as claimed which is unusaul now a days however some skin tags can be tough just be patient &amp; follow the instructions EXACTLY &amp; it will work.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was skeptical about this product. But I figured there is a money-back guarantee, so why not try it? And I am so happy that I did! I have used Dermatend to remove two moles from my neck. It is amazing, and I love it! Thank you so very much!</li>
    <li> Ok, I was all ready to get an appointment with a dermatologist and I decided to give this product a try. I followed instuctions exactly and I am on my 4th day and still no progress with any of the 3 spots I tested. One was a little brown spot. Though surely, I get some results on this. Nothing but a little redness. No scape not even close. The main spot was a thickened area about the size of a small mole. No results here at all. Pretty disgusted. I am on line now researching how to get my 100% refund. I have not given up. Instructions say be persistent. I will resubmit a review if these results start changing.  Right now I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> I did get a refund, but when I consulted with a dermatologist, I was told this is not a safe product for my skin. While it&#x27;s tempting to try to get a quick fix, the risks for me just did not outweigh the possible benefits. It MAY work for you, but it could also cause some pretty bad scarring or just not be permanent.  I did get a prompt refund however and they do have a 60 day guarantee.</li>
    <li> I found the product to work with incredible results. I read most of the reviews before I made my purchase and was willing to give it a shot. I followed the directions to the T and waited patiently for scab to shrink and fall off...after 2+ weeks my mole was gone. Very minor scaring ( which is more tolerable than the mole itself). If one chooses this method of removal I would suggest not to pick scab at all, and after the first scab is removed, there will be a secondary scab that forms. Do not pick at it, use quick healing balm all the time and that should be adequate. Don&#x27;t waste any more time becoming self conscious about a mole or blemish... which in my case was on my forehead. Give this product a try and you might be surprised. Your self esteem is worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter&#x27;s mole, we used it a couple times, it does seem like the mole is shrinking, but haven&#x27;t seen any immediate signs of cure.. I am going to give Dermatend another chance to see if it really helps... Also, I thought the \\&quot;money back\\&quot; guarantee was 60 days and I was actually going to return it after the first use, but then saw that the window had already expired earlier than what I had thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I first tried it 2 weeks ago on 4 moles, 2 on my face and 2 on my back, it took about 5-10 days for the scabs to fall off and when they fell off it left me wit small crators and some scaring around it, I think its because I scratched too much. I did two more on my face last week but this time I didn&#x27;t scratched too much and it looks better there&#x27;s still some scarring, but I been using mederma. Hope the scars go away. :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this but bought it based on good reviews. I tried it on four moles. The smallest one disappeared completely leaving a slight red mark, one disappeared but grew back, one was replaced by a VERY noticeable red mark, but the largest one was the real test, and so far it&#x27;s failed...well, kind of. The mole was about the size of a pencil eraser. Now it&#x27;s about half the size that it was, but that took approximately 10 applications. It also turned from brown to dark red. I&#x27;m still working on it hoping that it will eventually be completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very important not to pick at it, and the scratching is the secret. You need to scratch the entire mole or only part of it will be removed. I think that&#x27;s why I have all the red marks. All in all despite very mixed results, I gave it 3 stars because it does what it says, but be aware that unless you&#x27;re just removing a small mole, you may just be replacing it with a red mark that&#x27;s just as noticeable.</li>
    <li> The product did removed some of my moles, a couple of them reappeared so I had to treat them again.It&#x27;s been a month since my scabs have fallen off and I still had these huge red/purple holes in my skin which are 100% uglier than my little moles.  So it&#x27;s up to you buyers what do you prefer a mole or a scar?</li>
    <li> I applied Dermatend Ultra on 2 moles on the face about a month back. Both moles, one small, one medium size, were gone with the first application, after a few days. I did not pick on the scab and applied the healing balm regularly. Both moles are gone but on the larger one, I have a cigarette burn like mark even after 1 month that looks worse than the mole.</li>
    <li> I tried the product on two moles (one large and one small) and a skin tag with absolutely no results.  Very little sensation and no scab ever formed.  I contacted the company (very nice) and they suggested using the whole tube if necessary, which I did.  I will be requesting a refund because the product is way too expensive to just let it slide.  I&#x27;m not saying the product does not work at all, I&#x27;m just saying the product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical towards the positive results here, but it really moved the freaking ugly mole on my chin which has stayed there for almost 20 years. It works way faster than you may think!!</li>
    <li> This product works!!!!  I have applied to 9 moles and 3 have dropped in one week.  Waiting for the rest to drop.</li>
    <li> I have followed all the directions and the only thing that has happened is that my skin tags got swollen, but nothing more. I will be requesting my money back!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth to waste money first I was excited to get rid of my moles and the tube was water kept rubbing it looking for paste nothing but watery substance and then I used it the scum never formed and kept repeating I had a huge mole on cheek still there actually more prominent cause this thing made is pigment type waste of money and hopeless don&#x27;t waste ur time and money</li>
    <li> I had a large mole on my face growing up that really bothered me and affected my self esteem.    I felt that people wouldn&#x27;t look into my eyes, just look at this mole.    That&#x27;s no longer the case!    Dermatend worked overnight for me! the scab formed as promised. (I sure didn&#x27;t expect it to happen that quickly. maybe 3 or 4 days...but not overnight!)    The scab took about 4-5 days to fall off and the little redness from the scab took about another 2 days.    Now it looks perfect! Like nothing was ever there. Amazing. I will tell everybody about this.    Actually, I kind of have to because the people that knew me pre-mole removal ask where it went!    Thank you Dermatend!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  I bought the \\&quot;large tube version\\&quot; which was $20 more that the other Dermatend advertised.  I just received it in the mail and is 34 oz or 10 grams.  A second look at the other Dermatend advertised on Amazon and it is exactly the same size for $20 less.</li>
    <li> My girl friend used it for a good result. She was happy so I was very happy. I will give it a try my self.</li>
    <li> I chose five stars as this product delivered results exactly as promised. Thus far, I have removed 8 moles, all slightly raised, since last Monday. Some of those were on my face, and some were on my body. As the instructions stated, they fell off on their own, usually in the shower or while I was washing my face. A few weeks prior to using the product, I increased my Vitamin C and protein intake to facilitate quicker healing. This of course is not medical advice, and I would advise you check with your MD prior to increasing Vitamin C or protein intake. A few things to keep in mind: follow the directions exactly, larger moles may need more than one attempt to completely fall off, keep the areas clean and apply the healing balm or an antibacterial ointment twice daily. Also realize that while the product is working and the scabs have formed, they will look ugly. However, they can be covered up with makeup to improve their appearance to some extent prior to falling off.  I am very satisfied, thank you Dermatend! You have increased my confidence!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of this product. The 1st one worked better. It removed a rather large mole on my chin. I tried this newer product on some skin tags and a mole, neither of which were removed. The cream does help keep my skin from stinging so much after the product is removed. I&#x27;ll keep applying and hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a month to post a review, really wanted to use the product first.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise it really works. The part that is best of all \\&quot;even better than going to the doctors office\\&quot; is the fact the area heals without the normal large white scar you have from going to a Dr for removal.&lt;br /&gt;I have been to the doctor several times for removals, all those places leave a small white circle that never really tans and is always slightly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This product really works and the skin heals back without the scaring normally seen.&lt;br /&gt;Shocking, but it does work. Amazing product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Holy moley, they&#x27;re all gone! I&#x27;ve had moles all over my face and neck for my whole life. Finally I came accross this product and decided to try it out. I tested it out on one mole and it came off in about three days. It healed pretty quickly, so I decided to do the rest all in one go. The rest were off whithin a week. Now I feel confident about wearing my hear up and I&#x27;m no longer afraid of accidentally snatching a mole off, like I was before. Dermatend is fantastic and it really does what it claims to do. I had all types of moles (over 15) in all shapes and sizes and now they&#x27;re all gone. I would definitely recommend Dermatend to anyone wanting to get rid of their moles. Make sure to put plenty on and leave it on for a couple of days at least. That way you can be sure that the cream has penetrated. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Used product. Followed directions. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Both tubes of cream ruptured at base of tube, and were so tightly packed it was impossible to work the tube around to mix the contents in the tube as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with this product considering the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing good that I can say is they guarantee it to work. I will now test that guarantee to see if they refund my money.</li>
    <li> I really was amazing with the result of the product, it work very fast and you can see the results day by day.</li>
    <li> I was only able to remove 1 skin tag  after many tries. I followed the directions as directed. I bought the bigger bottles as I need to remove 10 other skin tags.  For the money paid to remove only one skin tag is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work. A joke at least.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not remove any moles!!!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, the product works!&lt;br /&gt;But... now it&#x27;s been 5 months since the mole fell off, I have a &amp;#34;divot&amp;#34; where the mole once was. It almost looks like a small volcano crater. I have to admit that it&#x27;s still better then having the huge mole on my face.&lt;br /&gt;If this were to be used on another part of the body then I would have no problems endorsing this product. But, if you&#x27;re looking to remove a mole on the face, you might want to try something else.</li>
    <li> 3 months of hassle with no results at all. Tried it on different moles. Can&#x27;t even form a proper scab, some dark blemishes in the middle that stay there forever. After applying it stung so I thought it&#x27;s working. One mole got lighter though that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m out of cream. By the way zero effect on flat moles. I now use apple cider vinegar with some good results and it&#x27;s 2$ for a bottle funny heh?</li>
    <li> Working like it says it would so far, but don&#x27;t do what I did! I used the emery board too harshly and scratched my skin and caused big red scabs. Then I put an excessive amount of dermatend on and got it on my skin as well as the moles. The dermatend burned my skin and worsened the scabs, but that was my own fault. The scabs came off along with the moles, so now I&#x27;m just waiting for it all to heal completely. A couple little red holes were left behind but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll heal. I&#x27;d rather have the small holes anyway</li>
    <li> This product does the job if you have the patience to follow its instructions. It is not complicated, but it takes a little time. I bough the large tub, which in reality is not bigger than the small finger, and used very little of it since I did not need it extensively. I did not use the soothing cream at all.</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying I have NEVER reviewed a product before. DermaTend worked great!  I followed the directions and I have taken off 3 skin tags.  It does sting a little but its not that bad.  The only con I can think of is that it took longer to fall off than I thought it would.  I did try another product before this and it did nothing at all so I was extremely excited when DermaTend did what it said it would.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Incredible product, my moles are gone, it took  10 days to remove them. I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I had 2 mole-like growths for over 10 years.  Neither were visible, so I never bothered to go to the dermatologist, but they did bother me when I happen to notice them (one was under my breast and the other near my armpit). I decided to try Dermatend on them. They were stubborn. I had to reapply 3 times, but eventually the scabbing happened and a couple days later they were both gone! Woohooo!  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Has worked on a few moles, guess the others need more treating.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I do not like about the product is that it needs to be on&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes but some places need to be covered.  It needs a time to&lt;br /&gt;treat when you won&#x27;t be \\&quot;disturbed\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this - on regular old flat moles, I&#x27;d give it a 5, but for skin tags I&#x27;d give it a 1.  It&#x27;s wayyyyy to hard to try and use that file on a skin tag!!  But on the regular type of mole, it did exactly what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On big icky thick moles, it&#x27;s gonna take a few times - and it&#x27;s gonna come off in layers.  The mole I hated the most is half-gone, but I&#x27;m on my 3rd abrade-apply-scab cycle.  So no real complaints there either, just be aware you&#x27;re gonna walk around with what looks like leprosy for a while - and of course, mine is on my face so the kids in school have many many questions....  whatever.  It&#x27;s fun to gross them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: don&#x27;t use this for skin tags, but use for regular moles.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quickly this product works.  A mole on the back of my neck was driving me nuts.  I put the product on and within 1 day, the mole fell off  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i bought dermatend a little sceptical after reading so many reviews on how it doesnt work and people writting about the company pays to have people say it works. but i was kinda desprite sooo i bought it.... figured it would be worth a try. well i did everything the directions said ( by the way i would say order it from the direct website.  not amazon. just cause so many people were saying they didnt get directions. plus when checking out they give you a couple diffrent offers to buy or upgrade ur order. but anyways..... )i used it as directed and nothing happend, so 24 hrs later i tried it again,( make sure to scratch the heck out of ur mole. ) and this time it took. it created a scab like it said it would, and flattend, acouple days later the scab fell off. sorry it all sounds kinda gross but just trying to say it how it is. the spot where the mole was is still a little pink and is getting lighter by the day. its been 6 days since i applied it. soo id say its worth a try. hope this helps anyone who is kind of on the edge about it all. good luck.</li>
    <li> Worked...kinda surprised. But took two times to completeley get rid of one mole which is why i only gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> I am sorry folks.  I used this product, \\&quot;Ex DermaTend Ultra Mole &amp; Skin Tag Removal System\\&quot; for two weeks.  I applied it as instructed each day to a mole on the backside of my right shoulder.  The mole is still there.  \\&quot;DermaTend\\&quot; did not remove the mole.  I was forced to rate this product \\&quot;1\\&quot; star or my review would not be seen.  I actually do not rate any stars for this product.</li>
    <li> I just not happy with the product. I try to put on my mole over ten times every night as direct on the label but my mole still there. I feel so disappoint.</li>
    <li> it didnt work for me. I tried using on four different small spots.  i also found it difficult to apply too.</li>
    <li> Umm for me it seems as though it wants to work but it isnt finishing the job. On my moles, like half of it scabs up and i try to aply it to the other have and it just isnt happening. They say its supposed to just fall off but so far i am 0 for 3</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does EXACTLY what it says!&lt;br /&gt;One week and tags were gone.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this!</li>
    <li> Did not make any difference after 3 applications. Scabbed over just like it was supposed to but my mole just came back and now it looks like some scarring may occur. I would like a refund</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and used the product daily.  It did not do anything.  Now my moles and skin tags are larger because of all the scratching.</li>
    <li> Totally worked!!! Was pretty skeptical... after a week the moles I wanted to get rid of fell off in the form of little scabs.  Stoked for sure. Follow the instructions - scrub the growth you want to remove with the included emery board really well.  Apply, wait 45 minutes, wash off.  Worked great with one application.</li>
    <li> My moles fell off within 3-5 days. This stuff works! Its still&lt;br /&gt;In the healing process but you cant even tell they were there</li>
    <li> This. Product. Did not. Work. Had to go tothe doctor to get. Removed this  product did nothing. For  me at all.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly as specified in the mailer that came with the product. I also left the wound heal by itself and waited for the scab to heal and drop off but even after dropping off,the mole was still there!</li>
    <li> Will not work for everyone even if you follow the specific directions to the letter. Multiple applications is usually necessary. This product gets 5 stars due to the outstanding customer service that comes with the product. The 60 day money back guarantee is absolutely for real.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true: if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, they don&#x27;t want your money. Try it! You&#x27;ve got nothing to loose!</li>
    <li> Did everything as instructed and didn&#x27;t work.  Maybe it was a bad tube as most of it was dried out and came out in clumps.  Highly disappointed as i will Return.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as described. Product was old. With the solid separated fromthe liquid.  I dont recommend this product</li>
    <li> It works well on small skin tags (gone in 2-3 applications). Still working on a large skin tab after 6 applications.</li>
    <li> It did nothing!  I was really disappointed since this product was so expensive.  Very let down.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in any moles.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely serious and it works.  The facial moles have fallen off.  However, it did leave a few blemishes.  I&#x27;m treating it with the medication treatment included and tea tree - but the dark spots on my face are disturbing.  I think it will heal overtime.  So, don&#x27;t use the product if you don&#x27;t have time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a solution I&#x27;m using concealer. All is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for helping me remove the moles.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works really fast.  I recommend it to everyone who has always wanted to get rid of moles.  It works great if you follow the instructions correctly.  You really have to grind the surface of the mole really good. IF IT DOES NOT STING A LOT AFTER APPLICATION THEN YOU HAVE NOT FILED DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE MOLE ENOUGH. The strong sting goes away after 5 minutes of applying the product). I recommend an electric grinder to scratch the surface of the mole a lot faster.  It seems a scary process but it really is not all that bad. The mole will look ugly (a black scab crust forms on top of the mole and the skin around the mole becomes red &amp; irritated no matter how careful you are in applying it) for about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks if it is a large mole. I was scared to apply it to my face but I did it anyway and am thrilled I did. It has only been 1 month and I only have a red tiny circle left behind in place of a big round boulder of a mole.  As the days pass you will see the crusted mole become flatter and flatter.  YOU WILL BE VERY TEMPTED TO REMOVE THE SCAB BUT DON&#x27;T DO IT.  If you do, then you will get a deep crater that will be bright red and noticeable (I know because I couldn&#x27;t help myself and  I removed the scabs on my side and that is what happened). The scab helps the skin heal beautifully if you let it fall off on its own like told in the instructions. I purchased the size they claim removes 15 moles but it removes a lot more than 15 moles.  Save money and buy the smaller size.  I still have about 1/4 of the tube left and between me and my spouse we removed a good 20 MOLES TOTAL between the two of us. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO APPLY THE HEALING BALM GENEROUSLY that comes with it.  I use to apply it 3 times a day on each mole because the scabs are very sensitive to the touch so when clothing or bra strap sits on top of it would feel irritated and bothersome. I read reviews after reviews because I was scared to use it on my face.  The truth is I so prefer a tiny tiny red dot as it continues to heal than to have the tall mole every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used DermaTend and it worked as promised.  The new Ultra formula doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I returned the first batch I got because it was extremely liquid even after minutes of mixing.  They sent out a new batch and it still barely works.  It only removes layers of the mole, not the mole itself.  This is after numerous applications of it.  It&#x27;s sad when the Ultra formula doesn&#x27;t work and the original did great.</li>
    <li> I had a small skin tag right at my t-shirt neckline that bothered me.  This product was easy to use and the tag is completely gone.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. It is definitely worth the cost. I tried Tag Away fro about 8 weeks and it did nothing for my skin tag. I used DermaTend on 1 skin tag &amp; 1 mole. I applied 5 applications over a 7 day period and both the skin tag and mole were gone. The healing for the skin tag taking a little longer than the mole. There is no trace of the mole left on my skin. I know when the skin tag is completely healed there will not a trace of it either. I will take 7 days over 8 weeks any day.</li>
    <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions, repeat the process (if necessary) and bingo---moles/skin tags are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this stuff on 3 different types of moles/ skin tags and it worked on each one.&lt;br /&gt;*I did have to repeat the process on the largest one I tried it on*, but did have success.&lt;br /&gt;I would &#x27;definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried many times and the product was useless. At first it was coming out as a liquid, then later it was a thick paste which tells me it seperated inside the tube. I tried every morning to knead it, without results to properly mix. A small jar might have corrected this. But, I still do not know if it would have worked. I cleaned the skin tags and sanded them as instructed with no results.</li>
    <li> My only experience with the product was when I gently massaged the tube before opening (per the instructions), the tube burst open with force enough to land product all over the mirror and vanity and everything on it.  I&#x27;m not sure that what is left is still good...it seems very watery.</li>
    <li> This was a somewhat hard product to use and it took out the middle of the mole. I looked disgusting after and it took a while to heal, even with the healing balm, I still have an albeit light brown dot on my face, but I guess it&#x27;s better than before.</li>
    <li> I was able to successfully remove 2 skin tags .  The smaller of the two took two applications to remove, the larger took several,&lt;br /&gt;however, the steps were simple and painless , You must follow the steps, which I did. but the outcome is worth it . I will,not&lt;br /&gt;hesitate to use this product again , should it become necessary ,</li>
    <li> Purchased it for My Mom because she does have lot of moles. Actually, she followed direction on how to apply it. Did not work at all. Only thing it did make the moles look worse. I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> Not impressed with some of the tools used .. could be a little more refined for the cost but the end product does work.</li>
    <li> Very fast shiping and happy with product, over all satisfied totally A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+</li>
    <li> Does not work? Sorry to say I tried this product and it really is no good not sure why it&#x27;s allowed to be sold?</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff on three moles on one of my legs. That was 4 months ago and I still have dark spots and holes where the moles were - Part of one mole is still there. I also have other dark spots now on other areas of my legs away from the moles areas and I am pretty sure it came from the cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try on 2 skin tags and 3 moles. 3 out of the 5 were pretty tiny. Worked wonderful on my 1 large skin tag. All that is now left is a little scar. 1 mole and 1 skin tag, after 3 attempts, is still halfway there. But they are smaller in size. 2 little moles were not  phased at all after 2 attempts. I made sure I was penetrating deep enough, there were all actually breathing a bit. I wish it worked for all of them but I am happy with the changes it did give.</li>
    <li> I tried and tried and tried, didn&#x27;t see any effect. waste of money. Still trying to figure out how to get rid of my mole.</li>
    <li> I bought a groupon for this and was skeptical but figure I would give it a shot.  This stuff really works!  I used it on 4 moles so far.  The day after the first application, all of the moles had scabbed up.  4 days later, the scabs have fallen off.  There are red marks there so I&#x27;m using neosporin and can&#x27;t comment yet about scarring.  Someone commented about when to use bandaids because the directions don&#x27;t mention bandaids.  You have to leave the dermatend on for 30-45 mins, so I put a bandaid over it to keep it in place.  Once they scab up the moles are pretty ugly, so I used bandaids to cover their ugly appearance.  I am also using bandaids now after they fell off to keep the neosporin on.  I would not use it on my face unless I had about a week off where I wouldn&#x27;t have to see anyone, but that&#x27;s just me.  Also, if you have moles on your back you will need someone to help prep and apply for you.  Be sure to put Vaseline on the healthy skin around the mole.  I had one that was a little irritated on the skin around but the dead skin just peeled off.  I have pics of each step in the process, but can&#x27;t figure out how to post them.</li>
    <li> This worked like magic removing several moles.&lt;br /&gt;However, one it made far far worse... leaving a red scar.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t do it on any highly visible part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;The ones it did take off it left a slightly paler skin behind.</li>
    <li> It was amazing, within a week my mole was gone.  The instructions were simple and the results are very satisfying.  I will use it again.</li>
    <li> After repeated trys there was absolutely no change! Would love to return for money back. Thank you very much for your attention to this matter</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. My husband and I being in our late 60 have these little things pop up and we rough up the surface. ...put the ointment on and cover with a bandaid. Walla....in a few days the skintag or mole is gone. That little tube goes a long way. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Follow the simple directions and watch this product do as advertised. Just wait a few days and the mole is destroyed. I had a very large mole that took 3 applications. My doctor had said there&#x27;s nothing he could do except refer a dermatologist who could freeze and remove it by scraping if off with a knife. When i asked him about recommending Dermatend he hadn&#x27;t even heard of it. There was nothing to lose by spending around $35 on this product but to have it work so well was totally unexpected. No pain, no mess, no side-effects except being highly satisfied. I&#x27;d highly recommend Dermatend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of time any money.I applied product every day for 14 days without results.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and bought the product expecting it to work but I was a little skeptical.  I had a skin tag that stuck out over a  quarter of an inch.  I applied the product as directed and it was gone within a few days.</li>
    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. Does leave a small scar if you have a deep embedded mole, but other than that product does what it says.</li>
    <li> Excellent results.  Works just like advertised.  I highly recommend to anyone with skin tags which is how I used it.</li>
    <li> If what you&#x27;re looking for is fairy dust that makes moles go away magically, don&#x27;t buy this stuff. You&#x27;ll only end up writing a review saying that it doesn&#x27;t work because it took a bit of figuring out and you weren&#x27;t into that much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re willing to work with it, this stuff really does make those bad uglies go away. Truly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try this on skin tags, because those are too easy. Get a pair of very sharp thin scissors, cut them off, put some neosporin and a band aid on it and you&#x27;re done. Might sting for a few seconds but big deal. Don&#x27;t waste the time and effort it takes to use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for moles, it&#x27;s a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, forget the little nail file and toothpicks they send you to scuff up the moles with. It&#x27;s a silly waste of time. Amazon sells a little Dremel wire brush for $2.45 or get one at the big box. Scuff the mole up good. The instructions say &amp;#34;almost until it bleeds&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s even possible to figure out when you&#x27;re at that point,. Just rub the thing raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The put this stuff on, wait 45 minutes and wash it off. Then, in a couple of days, when nothing has happened, do it again only get really rough with the scuffing. When you&#x27;re willing to get nasty with them and get them nice and abused, the stuff in the bottle really stings for a few minutes. When it stings, you&#x27;ve done it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, piece of cake. Put NeoSPorin and a round Band Aid on each spot, wash and repeat every day and in less than a week the mole is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the site clean, keep NS and BandAids up for another week or so, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy, it smells and it hurts a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works. Ignore the people who weren&#x27;t willing to work at figuring it out.</li>
    <li> I did a review a while ago for the smaller sized bottle.  This stuff is very expensive and I do not like their bottle and application method as it seems a lot gets wasted or is hard to target on hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have probably 100+ moles on my back and the dermatogist wanted $300 each one to remove, with this stuff it works pretty well but it does take some time.  As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the key with this stuff is scratching the dickens out of the mole and then letting this stuff sit on there a while... You should feel some stinging - if not then you are wasting it and need to scratch it up more so it can do anything.  If you feel the stinging and let it sit long enough it should make a scab - the scab seems to be what makes it work.  If you peel off the scab or even let it come off too early on it&#x27;s own (hot showers for example) then the mole will come back.  I find it takes maybe two applications on many moles to get them fully removed, and for the face it isn&#x27;t ideal but for the price it works well enough...  just hard to leave scabs on your face for a week or so and let this stuff do it&#x27;s thing.</li>
    <li> only have used it on one mole but it fell off in three days... i&#x27;ve hated that thing since i can remember.... thank you dermatend!!!</li>
    <li> I had a pretty large skin tag/mole in a private area that I wanted to get rid of for cosmetic reasons and to make shaving a little easier.  I bought this product, and the bottom line is that my blemish is gone as the result of the product&#x27;s use.  So, yes, this product works.  But, do not expect to put a little dab on and, voila, there&#x27;s nothing left of your blemish.  You have to abrade the mole/skin tag pretty harshly.  They give you an emory board and a couple toothpicks.  Because of the sensitive area of mine, I was a little too gentle the first couple times.  I ultimately had to repeat the abrading and application procedure about 7 times.  The last couple I gave up on using their suggested methods of abrasion and used some coarse sand paper instead.  After you abrade the area, once you put on the product, it stings.  If it doesn&#x27;t sting, you didn&#x27;t abrade hard enough.  Then, you put a waterproof band-aid on the area.  (Using a waterproof one keeps the product sealed into the area.)  If you did it right, it will scab in about 24-36 hours and it will itch a bit.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.  If you look closely, there is still a pink discoloration where the blemish was, but it is 99.9% less obvious than it was before and certainly doesn&#x27;t interfere with my shaving now.  I definitely recomend this product to people who don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations for results and who are willing to follow directions and be persistent.</li>
    <li> I received Dermatend faster than promised and was satisfied with the condition of the product. I have several moles and skin tags that I want to remove without going to the doctors. I started on two skin tags that were bothering me because they were located under my breast where my bra was rubbing. It took about a week for the first one to fall off and two weeks for the second. The second was stubborn and was larger. Both spots are red but healing nicely. It is a little uncomfortable while the product is working but is worth it. I am getting ready to start Dermatend on some of my other moles soon and have faith they will come off faster.</li>
    <li> I got my Dermatend on Saturday, July 10th, and followed the instructions included exactly.  Nothing happened. Nothing at all.  And I thought that if I spent that kind of money, I&#x27;m not giving up that easily, so I went online, and found instructions that differed slightly, and tried it again Sunday in the different way.      This time, it stung.  Not a horrible sting, more of an itchy annoyance than anything.  It took 3 applications before it scabbed (Sunday, Monday night, and then Tuesday night, but Wednesday the 14th I had a scab).  The scab is NOT a typical scab, it was darker and tighter and uncomfortable.  There was a bright red ring around the scab as well, but they say that&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s hard to explain.  Anyhow, the scab fell off today, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to have a scar. It isn&#x27;t just reddish and \\&quot;new skin\\&quot; like they say.  I have a small hole where the mole was. I did not pick at it, I did not play with it, I left it alone the whole time.  So, I&#x27;ll give it a while and see if it fills in.  Either way, this small hole is better than the mole.    So, yes, it will work.  But get the instructions online and expect it to take a few applications.  Expect it to be ugly, and expect to itch.  Also, go in to this expecting a small scar.  I&#x27;m happy with the result either way, but I&#x27;ll be happier if this hole fills in.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. The main reason I bought this product (besides removing my mole) was because they claimed that it wouldn&#x27;t leave a scar. Now that I look further a lot of the reviews show that they do end up with a scar after using this. The product is all in all, just a big pain. I am trying to remove a mole on my face, and I&#x27;ve tried twice already on the same mole with absolutely no results, I got the stinging after application and saw everything I was supposed to, but the scab was totally superficial and didn&#x27;t remove the mole in any way. I&#x27;m not going to try again, because I&#x27;ve spent about a month now with a large scab on my face or band-aides to hide it. It&#x27;s more of an inconvenience than anything. So, since it&#x27;s going to leave a scar anyways, I&#x27;m just going to see the doctor tomorrow to have it frozen/cut off. Instead of waiting for it to do it&#x27;s magic and fall off and then heal, I&#x27;m just going to get it cut off and let it go straight into healing. I suspect it will be much faster and much less of a hastle. Would not recommend this product for anyone, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> After I received the DermaTend tube and healing balm, I started messaging the DermaTend tube and the closed end pop open, loosing part of the fluid, then I taped the open end but the product got too dry and did not hold on the skin. So I cut open the tube and place it in a little glass with a cover. With a limited liquid mix it was still hard to use but I was able to removed two small moles successfully after two applications. I am still trying to remove larger more resistant moles but the DermaTend is getting too dry without the fluid mix, (can I use water, alcohol as a mix? ) I am also running out of the healing balm.&lt;br /&gt; I would like to know what to use as a fluid mix for DermaTend and as a healing balm so I can continue to use the system.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt; Andre Roberge</li>
    <li> Great product will recommend.</li>
    <li> The product worked pretty good. 1 mole, 1 tag and 2 small warts were gone in 4 to 5 applications. However, the mole and 2 small warts became slightly infected. Hydrogen peroxide and Neosporin fixed that. No problem with tag removal. All smooth now!!</li>
    <li> My Sister really likes this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work! Surprising!!! Just really nick your mole!</li>
    <li> I have had a mole right next to my eye for the past 30 years and I have always considered having it removed but was scared of the possible pain and scarring it would leave since my face is involved. The mole is black and raised above the skin&#x27;s surface so did not think that removal would be simple. Laser removal sounds intimidating and I have heard horror stories of failed attempts.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product by chance and noticed it was natural...it also came with 60-day money back guarantee. Why not? The directions are clear and you just follow them. To be honest, after the first day, I was skeptical and figured I would be asking for my refund but I had to give it more time. I applied the product to the area every night for a week and the mole fell off! It kind of freaked me out in astonishment. I applied a couple more days to get rid of the surrounding raised skin area. It came off and now I am using the healing balm. I do not believe this will leave any trace of a scar.&lt;br /&gt;It does not hurt as it is a tingling sensation so you know the product is working. It is in the privacy of your own home and you decide when you are going to treat the area (I chose right before bed) and you cannot beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;I barely used any of the product and I have the entire tube left. And to think I wasted the past 30 years having this skin blemish when it could have been removed so easily!</li>
    <li> Not impressed with product. Didn&#x27;t work as promised in advertisement. Skin tags didn&#x27;t go away like product reviews stated. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend product</li>
    <li> I purchased DermaTend Ultra because I had a rather large/prominent mole on my back that has been there since childhood. Since I have lost a significant amount of weight, the mole seemed to protrude more and I was becoming self conscious about it. Plus I found that my clothing rubbing against it was quite irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that come with the kit are quite clear that the DermaTend may take more than one application for more stubborn moles and this has been true for me. I have repeated the application of the product 4 times (immediately re-applying the product as soon as the scab falls off  from the previous application) and my mole is almost completely gone at this point. I did what will most likely be the final (5th) application today and asked for my husband&#x27;s help for the first time. He was quite shocked at the difference and that the mole was actually gone. At this point, there is only a vaguely rounded area remaining which should be taken care of with this final product application. I know this seems like a lot of product applications for one area, but this mole stood out so far (at least 3/8 inch) that I think it really had to be taken off in layers. Plus, it was in an extremely hard to reach area....between my shoulder blades...so I think my first application was not as successful as it could have been if I had asked for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually quite surprised that this product really does work, but thought I&#x27;d give it a shot before calling a dermatologist and I&#x27;m very happy that I did. I will be using the remainder of the product on some smaller moles that I expect will only need one application to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the healing balm, it really did seem to help the area heal quickly/help the scab fall off faster than would seem normal. This has made the repeating process much faster than expected. Also, I felt very comfortable that the company would stand by their money back guarantee as they sent me an email reminding me about the guarantee and stating that they would remind me again 2 weeks before the deadline. Clearly I won&#x27;t be needing to ask for that.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff 7 days ago, and it is pretty impressive.  I targeted three skin tags and a mole.  The three tags are gone (and I&#x27;ve one of them for nearly 40 years).  The mole is still a work in progress.  It stubbornly remains, but the instructions do state that some moles might take time.  I&#x27;m impressed with the product really.  It&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper than going to a dermatologist or even a general MD for removal.</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> DermaTend Ultra:&lt;br /&gt;Your ad said that it worked in 8 hours. This is false advertizing. Now you send an email stating that it takes 7-10 applications before it works. If so I would rather go to a dermatologist. I am returning the product.</li>
    <li> It did work. Once. It burned but the 3 moles of varying sizes did fall off HOWEVER the tube of product totally dried up within the month I was waiting to see the results... thus when I went to do the rest of my moles I then needed to purchase more. I want to believe this was &#x27;defective&#x27; however contact with the seller provided absolutely no resolution. To get your value, mark and use the entire product all at once even if that means doing 20+ moles... or be prepared to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Some of the mole was removed. I may have to do it again. I feel it only removes layer upon layer.&lt;br /&gt;I have a deep mole that it why it will have to be done again.&lt;br /&gt;The product does work not as strong on deep moles.</li>
    <li> if you have the patience of Job and a complete inability to smell anything&lt;br /&gt;this product may work....no one in my family had either, so we can&#x27;t recommend this</li>
    <li> Extra Strength Dermatend Mole Removal is awesome! Follow the directions exactly as described, and this product must be mixed well before using. I am very impressed with the results. Dermatend saved me $40.00 dollars for each mole removal process fee at the Dermatologist. Dermatend is easy to use, and worth the effort and price. :)</li>
    <li> The darn stuff is hard to use but dang it works!  I read some other postings where customers said it didn&#x27;t work.  Well the first time I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work.  Then I looked very closely at the directions and did everything they said and PRESTO the darn moles turned black and fell off.  I would definitely recommend the product to friends.  I would tell them to take plenty of time to read the directions and plenty of time to apply the product.  Rushing &#x3D; bad results.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure if this thing would work but I decided to purchase this after reading the reviews. Let&#x27;s get to the point: I tried it. It worked. You really have to read the instructions and follow them if you want it to work. For me, there were no side effects so I actually loved it. Thinking of purchasing it again sometime soon.</li>
    <li> it is NOT WORKING!!!!! apply 2 times.. make it moles darker..fill like ...waste money!!!!Very disappointed.....cost a lot and do nothing///</li>
    <li> So far I have treated three large brown moles one on the neck, two in the collar area.  The neck mole was the thickest and deepest.  I treated that one first.  It took twelve applications, but that mole is completely gone.  There is a shadow there, but compared to the way it was it is a 95% improvement.  If the shadow doesn&#x27;t completely go away, it won&#x27;t be because the product didn&#x27;t work.  After time may have to use a blemish removal cream.  The other big moles gone with five to seven applications.  Also used product succesfully on two smaller moles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow directions just as on the brochure that comes with the product, you will see results if you are patient and stay with the program for a few days.  Be precise with the the application, as it will redden the area surrounding the mole if you are not careful.  But, that too will heal given time.  Use the salve that comes with the product liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reservation would be for someone who has such a mole or moles in the facial area and is very sensitive about thier appearance.  While the product is working they may not be happy with how they look.  If that&#x27;s all that stopping you, though, take two weeks off and treat the mole.  You&#x27;ll be much happier in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For effectiveness, i would recommend Dermatend without reservation.</li>
    <li> The product definitely works, took about two weeks for full results and had to repeat dose once. I was very happy with the results no scarring at all.  Unfortunately both tubes exploded and I only got to use a small amount of the product, I would have had enough for several applications. So beware the cheap plastic tubing it comes in. I didn&#x27;t even get to massage it to mix like the directions said to do. It was a mess. So in my case not worth the price since most of the product ended up on my bathroom counter and mirror :(</li>
    <li> Was unsure if this was really going to work, but used it as directed and it worked.  It is now about three weeks after removal, I have an area that is a little red scar.  I&#x27;m sure after a couple months that will slowly fade away.</li>
    <li> Dermatend removed 7 moles- both flat &amp; raised.  When the scab for a large, raised mole fell off, there was a small hole in my skin.  However, this healed.  I&#x27;ve had a few moles cut out by a doctor &amp; these leave large scars.  Dermatend removed moles leave a small pink scar too, but it improves greatly with time.  It also helps to keep the scabs out if water as water made them fall off too soon.  Dermatend has blood root.  This can burn through skin, so just be careful not to keep any on healthy skin &amp; keep out of reach of kids.  My suggestions would be to label this product with a caution warning.  Also, a better filing tool or perhaps an electric filing add on purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this brand to get rid of her moles.  She inherited an extra amount of moles from my side of the family.  She brought this little tube and a tooth pick to a family reunion and  decided we were going to have a mole removing event.  I was totally ok with taking my moles off because I saw her results.  She was so courageous!  We prepared 4 moles, all on my face.  First they were red and tender, then they made  scabs, then one day the scab was gone.  The skin was pink like new skin but after about 3 weeks you would not believe the results!  Perfect!  I ordered my own tube, and just like my daughter I  had a mole removing event with 2 of my sons and my best friend!  They had the same results as I did!  Perfect!  Does it hurt?  A little bit.  Is it worth it?  YES!!!&lt;br /&gt;GO for it!&lt;br /&gt;Mole- less in the North West!</li>
    <li> Really did not do anything. Applied according to directions but nothing happened. Will be requesting my $$ back. Maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and did about 5 applications.  I will definitely use it again if needed.  Thank you much</li>
    <li> I have hated this mole for years!  If I had known it would be this easy to remove it, I would have done it years ago!  ExDermaTend is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> it does not work  .i follow the instructions an nothing happens .is really a waste of money.don&#x27;t fall for it</li>
    <li> I just received my dermatend and healing balm today, comes with 60 days guarantee but hold on... Expiry date 03/2014!!!! I have 15 days to use it?! I have requested refund - thanks amazon! (Still haven&#x27;t received the refund) if it works? Well I don&#x27;t know!! Product is very watery (maybe expired?) also accessories are a bit primitive</li>
    <li> With a little bit of effort, this product works.  I had to apply procedure more than one to each mole, but was able to successfully remove 5 moles so far.  I have 2 more to go.  My moles were very stubborn, and had to be ruffed-up to the point that they bled, but i did not suffer any adverse effects (infections) from this procedure.  My Doctor&#x27;s office wanted almost $400 to remove the moles I wished removed.  DermaTend Ultra costs a fraction of what my Doctor charges, works, I didn&#x27;t have to travel to have the procedure done and I was happy to pocket the money I saved.  All-in-All I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was really skeptical this would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple trademark beauty marks/moles on my face, one on my upper lip and one on my cheek, they are a nice pair.  But, 6 months ago, another mole developed in between them.  Not an attractive look on my face, looked like the handle of the big dipper.  Went to my dermatologist to get it removed, clearly for aesthetic reasons.  He removed the mole but a flat dark discoloration remained.  I was really bummed.  I got this product as a last effort.  I tried it on a mole on my arm as a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; but then decided to just go ahead and use it on my face too.  A day later, a scab formed and a couple days after that, the scab fell off and the dark discoloration from my old mole was gone!!  If the product doesn&#x27;t work, try again.  Nothing happened with the mole on my arm.  You really have to use the toothpick to scratch the skin but not too much where it&#x27;s bleeding, just enough to break the top layer of skin so the product can penetrate.  High recommend this product.  Really wish I would have used this before going to the dermatologist, would have saved me hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> I purchased the DermaTrend Ultra Mole Removal System and the first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t sure at all that it worked even though I felt the stinging after application, so the next night I agitated the mole more and put more removal product on it. It worked! It was clear after the second day that this very large mole was going to drop off, as advertised, unfortunately I think I put too much on and it burned the skin around the mole.  I tried the natural healing balm included in my purchase, but it didn&#x27;t help, the good news is with some Neosporin it is healing well after only one week. I am THRILLED! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally deleted question - active ingredient appears to be Sanguinaria Canadensis (commonly known as bloodroot)</li>
    <li> Worked on one still trying to remove more having trouble removing more</li>
    <li> Product is overrated. The additional balm added for that price makes it worse</li>
    <li> The bottom line is the tag just turned black and nothing else happened. I followed the instructions to the letter but nothing happened other then discoloration. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This just did not work for me. I tried it on three separate occasions and nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just going to keep it short and sweet this works! as long as you follow the directions like it says it works and i&#x27;m a sceptic on just about everything i order it twice so that should say it all!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Skin tags were removed within 3 days.  I would certainly recommend.  I previously had 10 skin tags removed by laser for $1,000 or $100 per skin tag. Using DermaTrend I removed 7 skin tags or $10 per skin tag.  I saved $630! And I still have some DermaTremd left.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me but on day 60 I received an email reminding me this is my last day.  Requested a refund and received in a couple hours.  The growth I tried this on was not normal and nothing else has worked.  If you have any doubt I recommend you try there is no risk.  I also received many emails with helpful tips and encouragement.  Thank for all your help!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with the results of this product.  I had a mole on my face that grew and I could see it protruding when I looked down. I used the Dermatend as directed and in three weeks the growth dried up and the scab came off.  The balm really makes a difference with the healing process.  There is a very small smooth \\&quot;dot\\&quot; where the growth use to be but I am thrilled with the way it looks now.  It does take patience and self-control not to pick at the scab.  I still use the Healing Balm hoping it will contiue to heal the area where the spot is.</li>
    <li> I have used Dermatend on several moles. It made the moles that did not scab over and fall off completely free of the brown or dark brown coloring which was fine for me.  You do indeed have to use something to &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34; the top layers of the mole so the Dermatend can penetrate the mole surface.  You will know pretty quickly if it penetrated because the mole will start tingling, almost a burning sensation.  That let&#x27;s you know for sure it is working.  I did not like or use the &amp;#34;salve&amp;#34; that comes with the Dermatend: it was stinky and did not seem to sooth the treated mole.  Follow directions and it should work for you, too :)  I am ordering more to try removing several skin tags.</li>
    <li> It works!  Had reservations about whether this could do all it says it can do; but I am impressed.  You can remove a far greater amount of moles than is specified.</li>
    <li> Have an above surface mole, first treatment seemmed to work but mole returned. 2nd treatment nothing better. spent a lot of money. found out my dermatologist would have charged the same amount to remove.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews that had already been posted, I still decided to purchase the product. Although some reviews had complained about the small size of the product, I found a little goes a long way.  I was very meticulous about following the instructions.  I initially tried to used the flat emery board they provided to rough up the mole, but found the small electric manicure attachment worked better. When I dabbed Dermatend on the mole, it stung, so I knew that was a positive indication the product was working.  I left it on the full 45 minutes, and washed it off.  As advertised within 24 hours, a scab had formed.  At that time I continued to keep it clean and applied the healing balm a few times a day.  Within a week, the mole fell off.  Great product.  The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it took 10 days to arrive from the time I ordered it.</li>
    <li> 20 words minimum about the product.  not to worry.  it&#x27;s a big rip-off.  $80 bucks down the toilet.  did not work at all.  followed instructions exactly.  angry and very very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0010AZ3TM Extra Strength Dermatend Advanced Mole Remover, Remove Your Moles Naturally With Dermatend Mole Removal Cream. Now With FREE Healing Balm!]]</li>
    <li> I have waited to write this review but I would recommend this to anyone with moles. Its amzing how well this works.  Just follow instructions and in a week or so your mole will be gone!</li>
    <li> I have tried it and it leaves a little brown spot, but I think that will go away if I keep on using the cream. One of them fell off in 4 days.</li>
    <li> They sent a little teeny tiny tube, and a tiny jar of creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it actually works, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay for this stuff (that seems to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced) for the teeny quantity they ship. I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture makes it look like something you&#x27;d buy in a store. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen anything this tiny in any store (and nobody would probably buy it if they saw it in a store because it&#x27;s so small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind feeling like a sucker after you see the size of what they shipped you (and what you paid a ton of money for), maybe it works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> After following the application instructions precisely multiple times, there was absolutely no effect on old or recent moles or skin tags. Thinking perhaps I did not have the right angle to scratch and apply the ointment to the moles on my back, I even asked my husband to do the honors one time. There was no reaction to his procedure either. I will be claiming a refund, which can not replace the time and effort that my husband and I expended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also questioning the veracity of all the reviews that I read before ordering DermaTend. Either they were paid to give successful reports, or I was given a different quality of product. Most disappointing!</li>
    <li> This product really works. In 24 hours after applying I had a scab. In one week the scab is gone.</li>
    <li> Once I got a hang of how to use the product correctly, it worked great. It did leave a small scar.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on three moles on myself  for 4 times each. the result was absolutely negative Moles started looking infected  and red instead of fading away and disappearing. I  had to stop treatment, and sent the product back.for a refund . the product was also very expensive  especially since it did not work at all I would not recommend this.  it was a total waste of time.  and money.</li>
    <li> My son had a mole/tag on his face for years.  We tried many methods to remove.  ExDerma Tend worked and his mole/tag is completely removed!</li>
    <li> After (skeptically) pushing the button to order this product, I had mentally resigned to make an appointment with the dermatologist to have one mole and a skin tag cut or burned off.  WOW!  Am I glad I pushed the button!  Derma Tend absolutely worked better than I ever expected, was easy to use (depending on the location of your mole), and quickly took care of the problem - without any side effects or scarring whatsoever. The growths were simply \\&quot;gone\\&quot; and healed in less than 6 days, with no pain or residual scarring. Every time I look at my shoulder I am 1,000% amazed and happy.  It works.  It REALLY does, just as described.  I am a believer, a fan, and a \\&quot;user\\&quot; with a success story.  As an added bonus I&#x27;m THRILLED to have saved the hundreds of dollars it would have taken at the doctor to remove the two growths; and, am more than THRILLED to have ZERO scars left over!</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon but am a huge fan of Amazon and love the reviews it provides. I thought I would write a review for the simple reason that I was truely a sceptic but tried Dermatend and to my surprize it actually worked. I have only done two of my moles but they are gone. This product REALLY works!! I think that perhaps the people who had problems maybe did not follow the directions properly. I did not have any scars and it has only been a couple of weeks but I certainly hope they don&#x27;t grow back. I really don&#x27;t think they will. I am so excited about this. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It really works for sure. It takes a while and patience to learn to treat moles or skin tags correctly before applying Dermatend on them effectly.</li>
    <li> The Dermatend was awesome. Did everything it said it was going to do and in the short time that we desired ! My boyfriend had two huge mole on his head that he was very self-conscious of - I ordered the product here for him, received it and 2.5/3 days later the moles fell off ! He&#x27;s says the healing balm is a great ointment also ! Super Cool Product!  I was a little skepty after ordering it, Then reading the reviews ! But the way I watched this product work on my bf&#x27;s massive moles ! Shuts down any negative reviews !</li>
    <li> I have been using the product ExDerma Tend Ultra for over a week and it has not worked to remove a skin tag or any of my moles.  I had high hopes for this product and I am very disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> this product has worked successfully on the first try with my tiny little tag moles and on another mole i had that was flesh colored and about 3mm in diameter.  i also have some &amp;#34;old lady warts&amp;#34; as i call them, that i was hoping it would also work on.  they are raised places on my skin that are either flesh colored or brown and kind of crusty.  i&#x27;ve had them checked by a dermatologist and they are not cancerous and they said there was nothing they could do about them.  unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem to work on them.  in fact, it left a little hole and a red area around one of them that is on the front of my leg.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from warts of my feet for quite a few years.&lt;br /&gt;I was told by UK doctors their was no treatment and to leave them alone. They never went.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few treatments (freezing, acid and this) none worked.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I tried a foot specialist (in the US) and after 2 treatments (4 visits total) they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;The treatment he applied seemed like the same thing described here but stronger (and it actually worked) - I can&#x27;t be sure.&lt;br /&gt;This treatment on the other hand, did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend seeing the specialists, it is more money (around $300 for me), but if it works it&#x27;s &#x27;infinitely&#x27; better value!</li>
    <li> I am using it on skin tags, not moles. I have plenty of small skin tags after pregnancy. My neck is almost clean now. Yes, the tube is small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. The only thing I wanted to note - it looks scary, unless you do some random ones. So, be sure, you&#x27;ll be able to cover it like with turtleneck or something like that. But it definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Addressed a mole almost the size of a dime and about 1/8&amp;#34; thick on my head. After two applications it&#x27;s completely gone! This stuff definately worked for me! The only issue I had is it was quite difficult to get the product out of the tube in a condition where it could be used. Despite kneeding the tube, shaking it, etc. it was still tough to get usable solution (vs. simply liquid) to apply. Still, for getting rid of moles, I&#x27;d positively recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I am 62 years YOUNG! I don&#x27;t need those stupid skin tags all over my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Derma Tend actually removes them PERMANENTLY and painlessly.</li>
    <li> Tried this product on a mole i had near my jaw and few moles on my body, didn&#x27;t do anything even after reapplying. Waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I wanted to get rid of a few moles on my face but decided to try it on my chest (not so cute with moles in the cleavage) first; just in case there was an adverse effect.  The product removed the moles on my chest but left a more unsightly scar; I traded one blemish for another--ugh!  It started working after the third application, so I decided to try it on my face.  I got the tingling sensation each time but it never worked; I didn&#x27;t keep trying especially after the scarring on in my chest area.  I should have just paid the money to see the dermatologist in the first place.  As the saying goes, &amp;#34;pay now or pay later&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> After several applications done as directed on a skin tag, I saw almost no difference at all. A trip to the dermatologist would cost about the same.</li>
    <li> I found this product elsewhere and when I need more I am ordering it here. I tried another, less expensive product and it did nothing.  This worked immediately and removed both small and larger tags.</li>
    <li> Product works but not as fast as they make you think it would.  It was hard to massage the tube to mix the ingredients to make it pasty.</li>
    <li> The first time I used DermaTend I was very impressed as I eliminated one flat mole and 2 protruding moles on my chest area.  The flat mole was kind of small and so were the protruding moles but they scabbed up and fell off in a week.  After that I&#x27;ve had mixed results as I&#x27;ve removed a small flat mole on my arm but I&#x27;ve had trouble removing a larger protruding mole.  I&#x27;ve scratched it and even poked holes in this protruding mole before applying DermaTend and waited for it to scab up and fall off on it&#x27;s own but the mole will not go away.  I&#x27;m in the process of treating it for the 3rd time so I&#x27;ll know more after that time.  I think part of this is knowing exactly how to use this product and being patient.  I still can&#x27;t give the product 5 stars but I&#x27;ll give it 4 simply because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than having to go to a doctor to have this done and it can and will work on at least some of the moles.</li>
    <li> Well, after the Dermatologist took a couple of my moles off for multiple hundreds of dollars... I was ready to find another way.  Bought the Dermatend a month ago and have successfully removed 8 of the 9 moles/skin tags I&#x27;ve tried it on.  The active ingredient is Blood Root.... works really well.. 1st you use an emery board to roughen up the mole/bump, wash with hot water.. apply the paste to the bump.. wait 45 minutes and wash off.  It is a bit uncomfortable roughing it up, and it burns just a little bit when you apply the paste... but I&#x27;m a wimp and did fine!  I&#x27;ve removed 8 bumps for less than $50.</li>
    <li> I wanted to make it work; directions takes months to work;  after a month, it does not even get close to work</li>
    <li> I had several very large moles on my back...net very attractive sounding I know...but this worked phenomenally.  The directions are very detailed and it is important that you follow them exactly.  Just an FYI where you put this stuff will look pretty scary for a few days but after a few weeks the mole(s) will be completely gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for a good product but the Ex DermaTend Ultra Mole &amp; Skin Tag Removal System did not work as I understood it would or as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Treid once and it worked pretty well, but once it has been opened forget it.  A ridiculous waste of money!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great if you follow the directions.  I&#x27;ve been hiding a mole on my neck for 30 years.  It&#x27;s down to a little red bump now.  It burns like hell, looks like hell for a week, but is well worth it.  Going to the dr. would be easier, but this is relatively cheap DIY.</li>
    <li> I feel this doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using a month now and not much has happened to my mole. I feel it will not work in due time and I feel the info I read is all wrong</li>
    <li> I had my doubts at first, Ive had a mole since I was in my early teens and now Im 20. Just started to be a big confidence drain because it was a big 3D mole that stuck out on the side of my nose. Of course I felt like everyone looked at it but just assumed over time people ignored it. I saw an ad in Skymall magazine when i took a flight and checked it out when I got back home. I read all the reviews I could because I was extremely doubtful some stuff that comes in a tube for $70 would safely and effectively work on removing such a big nasty mole in a sensative space on my face. Reading some bad experiences in reviews scared me at first cuz i didnt want a nasty scar or a worse mark than the mole on my face. But I just figured I had nothing to lose, either cough up $350 for a dermatologist to do it or give this stuff a shot and i thought if it did mess me up then I could just go to a dermatologist as a back up. You really have nothing to lose with the money back guarantee, this company must know people are worried about the product messing them up worse than before and want you to be fully confident that there is nothing to lose. Either keep the mole on you or give this a shot, all it comes down to. So I bought the ultra that comes with the healing balm. It came with instructions and everything you need to perform the job. I waited until spring break so that I wouldnt be seen with a bandaid on my face or the big black dot that replaces the mole. Thursday afternoon I scratched the mole(enough that it bled on accident) and applied the cream. Let it set for 45 minutes and washed it off, i felt the tingeling like it said you might. I made sure to keep it protected and applied the balm as much as possible with a bandaid. I ended up with a black scab over the mole(which honestly didnt look much worse or noticable than before)it did seem a little red tho. But I treated it like a scab and just kept it clean with hydrogen peroxide, a little antibacterial cream here and there.And idk if it was from the taking a lot of showers or what but within 2 days i was able to pull the mole off without much force at all. It didnt hurt or even bleed alot, felt just like pulling a scab off that was pretty much healed. Of course since it was a mole that stuck out I had this scary crater in my nose. That was when it became more noticable but idc with all the years of having the embarrassing mole I just thought whats a few weeks of healing. I was just excited for the end results. Its now wednesday of the next week after and I have just a little indention in my nose where it used to be. No nasty scars or hideous red marks or pits. The healing balm seems to work magic at night with a bandaid when I go to sleep, when i wake up and pull the bandage off its a new amazement everyday, just gets better and better so I fully recommend spending the extra money to get the balm unless your a shut in and dont need to worry about people seeing you in public. Dont let money, doubts, or bad reviews stop you from getting this product, trust me it works and I couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> there are already many positive reviews about dermatend out there which I can confirm now. for my part I found it a little difficult to scrub away the uppermost layer of skin. that abrasive device worked but I prefered to use a razor blade to scrub, not to cut, away the first layer. rest of the approach as advertised. results vary from total removal, though the new skin is still a bit pale but that I reckon will align, to partial removal, where the mole got lighter and smaller. though some moles might remain because they seem to deep and I wouldn&#x27;t like to be too aggressive.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a month and not seen results.  The moles seem to be affected and turn red but nothing else. The reply email address for company was removed from their emails so I don&#x60;t know what to do if I am still not satisfied at the end of the 60  day &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34;. Any ideas.</li>
    <li> OK - Who believes stuff like this?  I tried it.  Holy Batman, it worked.  Takes a week.  Then just gone.  No damage or scars or anything negative.  Get it!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it said it would do. No 6 weeks of treatment 3 times a day like other products I tried. The dermatologist said I needed a surgeon, but within 4 days a dark, annoying skin tag, I had for years was gone.</li>
    <li> So I recently bought the item and let me tell you...waste of time and money! First off..they sent my package late and without the healing balm! So after several attempts of calling in to reorder the balm I finally got it and started the process ....well the \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; did occur and everything was fine but nothing happened after that...no scab nothing !...I tried it a second and third time and I am still experiencing no results ...don&#x27;t waste your money people!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on people&#x27;s comments.  When I used it, it not only removed my mole, but did it in less time than advertised!  I felt no discomfort (which made me fear it wasn&#x27;t going to work.)  The mole turned into almost a scab, shrunk, and fell off in 3 days.  I have no scar at all (and it was on my face!)  I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for multiple large moles, and it works very well (all have been handled in just one application) and there is definitely more in the tube than just enough for 15. BUT be warned, the wound created is actually quite deep, and it takes several weeks to heal (don&#x27;t mess with the scab at all beyond using the balm, it needs to heal on it&#x27;s own!) and it leaves quite red scars, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise using anywhere a bad scar would be terrible! But I used this on my back and stomach where I felt the moles were more of an eyesore than I thought a scar would be, and I do expect the redness to fade (I don&#x27;t go into the sun much, so I am not too worried about how the scars would look if I got tan at all) I am over all pleased with how it works, and it costs less than going in and having them removed (which also leaves a scar.)</li>
    <li> The product worked about  50%of the time on 5 tags. I continued the application until I ran out. So I am partially pleased with the results. Thinking of buying another product over the counter at less cost.&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate you inquiry,&lt;br /&gt;RRM</li>
    <li> Been using as directed and so far nothing has happened on most of skintags purchased for.  Am going to seek a refund.</li>
    <li> Bought it and used it on a mole on my face,  within 3 days the scab fell off prematurely, and another scab form but smaller now. After 2 days it fell off and all i can see is a pink small crater. After 1 week the crater is still visible but better then a black mole.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes of removing some moles and skin tags.  Followed the instructions to the letter and nothing was removed.  One mole appears to be less prominent, but it&#x27;s still there.  Would not recommend this to anyone and I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have used the Derma Tend product for 6 days, and my tags look the same as they did before I used the product. You have to use a emery board on the tags/mole before using the product. This is part of the preparation.  My tags are sore, and I&#x27;m disgusted with the product. I don&#x27;t know whether I should continue, or stop using Derma Tend. The $69.00 cost, is supposed to remove 15 moles/tags. I only have a small amount of the cream left, and I still have the 7 tags on my neck. How can I remove 15, when I can&#x27;t even remove 6? Janet  p.s. There is a guarantee on the product? What should I do?</li>
    <li> I used Dermatend. After four days of applying it my moles were still there. I had to quit because the emery board was causing my skin to bleed. I thought that if I scratched my skin any more days to apply the cream, it would just cause my head to bleed more.</li>
    <li> I bought a one-tube quantity earlier from a different retailer, and decided to get a triple dose this time because it worked very well.  MS has bedridden me for five years, and my caregiver asked if I could give her some.  The delivery arrived well before its delivery date, but only one 5-gram (.17 fluid ounce) tube was in the package.  I do not know the net weight of the first package, so I do not know if this is the right amount.  It does not really matter; skin tags and moles are dropping off on both of us, and that is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for an unsightly mold that was in between my eyes. It was very dark raised and made me very self conscious.  I used dermatend and the mole fell off in exactly 4 days.  I was left with a gapping hole that I had to cover with make for about 3 weeks.  I think the hole was left becuase I was inpatient and pulled the scab off.  The stinging I expected from  reviews that i read was that of a lemon squeezed on a cut--I guess it depends on the level of pain you can tolerate.  I felt no sting at all, the sanding part hurt just a tiny bit but  nothing big.  My mole did return and I retreated it, this time i let the scab fall of and the scar was smaller.  My skin scars easily so I think that also was the reason I still have a scar after 6 months. I am planning on retreating it since it seems my mole is returning, it&#x27;s tiny and bearly visable-I am very happy and would recommend Dermatend.  The only thing that did upset me is that my Derma Tend did not come with directions and instead of washing it off after 20 minutes I left it on longer the first time.&lt;br /&gt;My son removed two of his moles and was very pleased with the results, he also still has a scar, kind of like a blemish scar, even though we bought the Healing Balm and used it.  So just be aware that you might be left with a blemish like scar if you tend to scar easily.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work to remove moles.  I read the positive and negative reviews and decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions, using the nail file, and when I put the paste on the mole, there was a stinging sensation.  The mole did seem to get red and puffy and I was hoping a scab would follow but it did not.  I am very disappointed in the time and money I spent and will be returning this.</li>
    <li> After reading a couple of reviews, I was hopeful yet cautious about the product delivering the promised results. I can assure you that this product works AS PROMISED, at least in the case of skin tags.  It did take a couple of apps for some of the more stubborn ones as you have to make sure that you follow the instructions to the letter and make sure you scuff up the skin on the skin tag with the included emory board so that the medication can sink in, but they were gone within a week and you can hardly tell they were ever there.  And so you know, you will feel a burning situation if you do it correctly, not one that hurts, but you can definitely notice it.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t even know when they fell off exactly, but just noticed that they were gone after a few days.</li>
    <li> I was very optimistic about whether or not this product would really work. I read the easy to follow directions, applied the product, and three days later my skin tags fell off....if you are bothered by skin tags, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product...it truly does work...Donna Larson</li>
    <li> Have used it twice so far and some moles look worse. Most of the moles never even scabbed up like they are suppose to. Now my moles are very noticeable because they have red around them. I have read the directions many times. Since i have paid for this product, i am going to try it again.</li>
    <li> Anyone that needs to rid themselves of mole should definitely buy this product you will not forget this AWSOME product at all. Thanks</li>
    <li> After trying both laser removal and nitro glycerin type methods, I was desperate to find a method that would remove my facial moles and skin tags (I have a whole lot), but would not leave dark scars that are sometimes even harder to cover.  As an African American femaile, i was told to \\&quot;expect\\&quot; scaring.  I even bought fade cream that I planned to use after the Dermatend.  Dermatend gave me results better than I could imagine.  I tried it out on one rather large tags first that was right next to my eyebrow.  After reading all the tips about application, I used the advice of really scrubbing close to bleeding.  I followed the instructions that came with the package completely, and within a few days, the tag just fell off....and the most important part...NO UNSIGHTLY SCAR!!!  After a day, I couldn&#x27;t even tell where it used to be (I kept applying the healing cream for a while after it fell off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got so excited that I tried it on a couple more and got the same results.  The reviews are correct in that you really need to scratch it up good and use the healing ointment afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works!</li>
    <li> I found this product awesome! I was not confidence at all with the wart which suddenly popped up on my forehead between my eyes. Within a few weeks it grew bigger and bigger. After I had applied dermatend advanced mole remover on the wart, it was then gone completely within a few days and there&#x27;s no spot left over after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to apply this product to another wart on my bottom. And again, it worked amazingly! Thank you so much Dermatend advance mole remover! I got my confidence back now!</li>
    <li> Used this product for months and it did not remove even the smallest skin tag.&lt;br /&gt;Was a total waste of money.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Does not work, no effect on skin tags in spite of using as directed for 3 weeks and applying everyday. No color change of the skin tag noticed.</li>
    <li> The moles on my face is gone, the system works perfect in 2 days the moles is gone for good, i really want to say thank you, Wow the system really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you.</li>
    <li> I used this for skin tag on genital area and a smooth mole on stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked on both, did leave a scar though.</li>
    <li> Very Expensive, but awesome!  I removed several moles and it did what it said, but it is really really expensive</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought this WITHOUT reading the fine print...the picture leads you to believe that what you are buying is actually a tube of the product that is much bigger than the the small jar of the free stuff. WRONG!! Read the product details...you are paying $70 for a tube that is .34 oz!! AND the shipping weight is listed at 4.0. so you are paying shipping for a product that weighs far less than the stuff they ship it in. This is very disappointing...I intend to try the product and will post another review on the efficacy of the actual product. However, the picture is misleading. I think consumers should see EXACTLY what they are paying for and not a misleading picture.</li>
    <li> It hurt bad and burned. It only removed very small tags. I wasn&#x27;t able to go back to back days on treatments due to the pain. Not worth the money. I was using it oin skin tags.</li>
    <li> I have applied this stuff 5 times on two different areas; following the directions, went back and read all reviews and tried the suggestions.  Stuff did not work.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I gave it a try ONLY because i believed all of the positive results i read... and i was a bit desperate!!! i have some skin tags on my chest area i want off-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, i tried 3 times.... i even made one of the skin tags bleed (because i made sure i filed it enough)- NO RESULTS. and it was too late to get my money back :( i wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I had a bunch of moles of various sizes all over my face, arms, chest, and back. I thought it was something I just had to live with, until Dermatend came into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have the smaller bottle that they say removes 4 moles, and they have the bigger bottle that they say removes 15 moles. I researched and read different reviews all over. Some people were able to stretch the product and remove more than twice the moles Dermatend suggests you can remove by only using a tiny pea-sized amount of product. That is exactly what I was looking for because I have a lot of moles and this stuff is expensive, so I want to get the most out of it that I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the bigger bottle that can remove 15 moles. I purchased it direct from their website towards the end of October, it was almost $80. Now it&#x27;s the beginning of December and I&#x27;m totally mole free! I still have some scabs/raised scars that need to heal and will fade over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is prepping the skin for application. They give you a tiny nail file and recommend to lightly scratch the surface of your mole. I&#x27;ve read reviews where people have said they really had to scratch the hell out of it for Dermatend to take effect. I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances, so that&#x27;s what I did. I used one of my 180 grit nail files and scratched until it bled. I know, gross. For some reason this stuff only works when it&#x27;s applied to an open sore. All the moles I scratched and applied Dermatend to were removed, so it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to stretching the product is first mixing it up in the tube. When you first get it it will be a little watery. Start by unscrewing the cap and press lightly on the bottle, let the product come to the top without spilling over. What you&#x27;re doing is removing the air in the bottle. While you&#x27;re still pressing the bottle screw the cap back on. Now you can press and roll the bottle between your fingers. You really want to take your time here and make sure you mix it as best you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready to apply the product, squeeze the product up a bit, the consistency of the product should be a lot thicker, and with a toothpick pick up a teeny amount. Release the pressure you have on the bottle so that the product goes back inside, you don&#x27;t want any of it to go to waste. Now that you have a tiny bit of product on your toothpick, lightly dab it in the center of your bloody open sore just once. It will string and burn for 30 second like nothing you have ever experienced. When that subsides you can manipulate the product and pull/spread it across to cover your mole. When it is covered, leave it alone to dry. Give it an hour or two then cover it with a bandaid. Let this stuff work its magic. The product should dry to the surface of the sore, some of it might crumb and fall away. Within a few hours your mole should be blackened and swollen like it&#x27;s bruised. The next day or two it should fall off and you start the long process of healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the trick I mentioned to stretch the product, not only have I removed way more than was suggested by Dermatend but I also have more than half the product left over. I could continue removing more if they pop up or return. Which none have. I have a few little baby ones I might take care of but as of right now, I&#x27;m totally mole free!mix it as best you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready to apply the product, squeeze the product up a bit, the consistency of the product should be a lot thicker, and with a toothpick pick up a teeny amount. Release the pressure you have on the bottle so that the product goes back inside, you don&#x27;t want any of it to go to waste.

    <li> This product did nothing for me.  I followed the directions completely and absolutely nothing happened except I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> dermatend really works and it does exactly what the product claims to do. I would highly recommend this product because it saved me thousands of dollars because I avoided going to the dermatologist. I got charged 500.00 to have a simple keloid cyst removed when I went to dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Larger skin tags may take several applications.  You need to really scrape the tag or wart to expose it.  After it turned black/brown it took about a week until it was gone.  It left the skin reddish but eventually cleared.  Overall I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> VIEW MY RESULTS! I&#x27;ve added a picture that shows four snapshots of the progress (from day 1 to today, 4 months later). the pictures are unedited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Dermatend about four months ago to get rid of a mole on the back of my neck. I followed the instructions, scraped at it with the included file, poked it with the toothpick, and then applied the gritty, brown paste. It burned pretty bad actually for the short time it was on my mole, but it stopped after I wiped it off and didn&#x27;t hurt any beyond that. The mole was a decently sized blemish on my neck, and I was sick of people (usually young people who don&#x27;t have the sense to keep their mouths shut) looking at it and commenting on it. I know moles are a natural part of being human, but sometimes it&#x27;s okay to be a little vain. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t feel like getting it removed by a doctor..mainly because I didn&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;d cost, nor did I feel like taking time off work for a cosmetic procedure. So I took to the web (Amazon first, naturally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the mixed reviews on the Dermatend kit but figured it&#x27;d be worth the try. Well it&#x27;s now four months later and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the investment. I&#x27;ve removed a few moles (no skin tags) with it and feel much more confident knowing people aren&#x27;t staring at blemishes on my skin. The process did take some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Having the paste on your mole/skin tag burns like heck (if you do it right), but you only apply it once and it&#x27;s over with quickly. No real change in appearance was noted during the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2-5: The area around the mole started swelling into a circular sore. The skin turned red and puffed out - a bit embarrassing I must admit. There was a little darkening of the mole itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6-10: The mole became very dark. The redness around the mole lightened slightly, but it was still very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 11-20: the mole started coming off in pieces before my very eyes! The redness started going down, and towards the end of the 3rd week the dark part of the mole had fallen off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 21-2 months: The mole was gone, the swelling and redness vanished, and all that was left was a small \\&quot;mound\\&quot; of skin...it looked like a flesh colored mole. I didn&#x27;t like that there was still a bump there, but was still happy the mole was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 4 (today): The bump is gone and there is no remnant of the mole ever being there! Yes it took time, but it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my final thoughts -&lt;br /&gt;- Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but think about it, if it works then it&#x27;s not that bad of an investment. Do I think the company has priced it to make a huge profit margin? YES! But hey, I don&#x27;t regret spending the cash for what I got out of it.&lt;br /&gt;- The process does take a while to work (at least it did for me), but it wasn&#x27;t that bad and the results are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;- It took several tries for one of my moles. I got very discouraged after the third application, but the final one \\&quot;took.\\&quot; If it doesn&#x27;t work the first time, really dig at it the next time (not too deep, but don&#x27;t be afraid to get at it!) and try again!&lt;br /&gt;- If I were you I&#x27;d go out and buy a $2 triple antibiotic cream and a $1 nail file and not even bother buying this kit. Just pick up those two supplies and save $30 by buying the cream by itself here on Amazon.down, and towards the end of the 3rd week the dark part of the mole had fallen off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 21-2 months: The mole was gone, the swelling and redness vanished, and all that was left was a small \\&quot;mound\\&quot; of skin...it looked like a flesh colored mole. I didn&#x27;t like that there was still a bump there, but was still happy the mole was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 4 (today): The bump is gone and there is no remnant of the mole ever being there!

Do I think the company has priced it to make a huge profit margin? YES!

    <li> Made it worst that I had ever imagined. I had to go straight to my dermatologist (after 2 weeks of trying) and they told me I had made a lot of damage to my mole and the mole was too large for them to remove, so I had to get it removed from a surgeon..... $$$$$ yup &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after trying tag away which is a joke. As advertised one small tag turned color and fell off in about 3-4 days. A few others, about the same size took a little longer but fell off in about 2 weeks. The real reason I purchased this was for one rather large one that continues to be stubborn. I have used the whole tube and it just will not touch it. Parts of it turn a little dark but that is it. I may either have it removed by a doctor or try your product again.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for my husband at all. We purchased the larger amount (up to 15 tags/moles). After the first try no scabs appeared at all so we waited a couple of days and tried again. This time only one small scab on the very end of one of the tags. After the third time trying this product still nothing.</li>
    <li> Not finished using yet!  I used this on a pretty good size skin tag and in 3-4 days it was gone.  I am  now working on a mole that I have had since I could remember have applied it 3x&#x27;s and it is smaller but may take a couple more applications and it will be gone.  This product works, we have tried Tag away in the past and it never changed at all.  This truly works!  Only problem is we ordered this through Amazon, which I love Amazon, but wish we would have bought this directly from the manufacturer as we received this with the bottom of the tube not sealed and some of it went in our sink and we lost it.  We couldn&#x27;t send it back to Amazon unless we wanted a full refund and we are using it (just have to take our loss on what went in sink and be careful when we squeeze tube to apply so it doesn&#x27;t come out the bottom) they wouldn&#x27;t just exchange the tube for one that was sealed....so that is the only disappointment with the product.  If we would have bought from Dermatend they would exchange it for us.  I would definitely recommend the product to anyone with skin tags and moles.</li>
    <li> I used the product to remove a fairly large Tag. I followed the instructions step by step. No changes has happened after applying the product for the entire week. I am going to try to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have successfully removed 2 skin tags, which left no scars and a mole.  Where my mole used to be, I do have skin discoloration.  I am sure it will go away eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tags fell off in 3 days, my mole in 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t burn too much when I applied it, it was a level 2 pain (out of 10) and it only lasted for maybe 5 minutes.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> There has to be a way to apply this without getting it on your skin, just one the mole you want removed.  It is messy and it didnot work for me.  I did return this and was refunded my money so that is the only good part that came out of this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Well, I was skeptical at first about all of the reviews and superlative testimonials about Dermatend but I have to say that so far, it works very well! I used it on a skin tag along my waist band that was about 18 inch long and annoying as hell!! After about 3 applications of Dermatend it started to turn black and 12 fell off, then after one more application, the whole rest of it came out and now all I have is a slight scab that is clear and healing nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use it on a mole that I have on my face next to see how it does here. I have a feeling these are easier to clear than the tags as they are flat and tend to not be so \\&quot;stalk-like\\&quot; in shape. I will update as we go!&lt;br /&gt;So Far, Dermatend is terrific!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  The first clue should be the tools they include with the product.....tooths picks and emory boards, SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!  Thank goodness Amazon was great about refunding my money!</li>
    <li> tried this 3 times on 3 diff. moles.  roughed it up, applied it, felt the sting, scabbed over, healed looking just like it did before I wasted $70.  Not at all happy with product and makes me wonder who is writing the above stellar reviews.</li>
    <li> This worked as advertised on small skin tags.  On a larger skin tag however it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  I followed directions and managed to burn my skin but nothing else happened.  I ended up using the dental floss method and the larger skin tag came right off in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Great item, I purchased for some tags, and the directions were more for moles but following the instrucitons it worked great. Would buy again</li>
    <li> So far I have removed 8 moles with this product. It is not easy. I found that it is important to really scratch off a good portion of the outer surface of the mole to have results. The file would not work well on some of the larger moles so I bought a Manicure Pedicure rotary tool to abrade the surface easier. That worked but I got some profuse bleeding on two of the larger more pronounced moles. After I got the bleeding to stop I proceeded with the application and got good results. I have found that the small brushes they sell with tooth whiteners to be the best for applying the solution.</li>
    <li> The product does work as I have successfully greatly reduced the size of a fairly large mole on my stomach.  It has, however, taken 4 or 5 stages so far to get where I am now having only a slightly raised area of light colored mole material remaining.  This mole has &amp;#34;scabbed over&amp;#34; each of these treatment stages (as I call them) but, only a fairly decent amount of top mole material fell off rather than the entire mole.  I do believe that in the next stage or two of treatment that the mole will be completely removed.  The advice I had read on the importance of filing the top layer of mole skin is very true and I did find that softening the mole with a fairly hot soaking of water was beneficial.  I think in the end I am going to be happy with the final result, I just didn&#x27;t expect things to take as many treatments.  I haven&#x27;t tried on my small skin tag yet so I may post an update once the large mole treatment is over.</li>
    <li> I did  expect better results based on the company write-up.&lt;br /&gt;Been working on 2 skin tabs with little luck. 6-8 applications have been applied.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been working on some moles and have made little progress on them but still working on them. 7-8 applications so far.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the healing cream yet since I have not got to that point yet.</li>
    <li> This product works well on skin tags and will remove moles, but it may leave a scar. Overall I am happy with my experience considering the available options to accomplish a simliar result at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> Happy to say that after a very short time my small mole and several tiny skin tags are either gone or disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;Once the Dermatend arrived I was very disappointed to read that prior to application I would need to use an emery board, I get squeamish easily and the thought of scrubbing the moles didn&#x27;t make me happy but I got brave and thankfully the process worked.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t remove skin tags. It just made my skin red. I got a bottle of 88% Lactic Acid, applied it carefully to just the skin tag, and in two days it was so dried up and dead, it fell off. And the Lactic Acid cost way less than this stupid product.</li>
    <li> Have been trying it every weekend for 4 times.  No changes.  I may have to send it back. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have used dermatend previously before, this is my second time ordering it ... I thought I would try the ultra this time, because it sounded more efficient and worked faster, well it doesn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy the ultra, it doesn&#x27;t work .. I switched back to the last of the original that I had, and it worked great. ... I would highly recommend the original dermatend. But definitely NOT the ultra.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful in the beginning that this product was going to work, as after a couple of applications there was no sign of my large  mole on my head going away.  However, after about another 3 applications, the mole started to disappear.  Now, its completely gone, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> the product does not work  , my moles are still present. After mutipule applictions. did&#x27;nt want the hassel of sending it back.</li>
    <li> This product did not work. Tomorrow I will be having the mole removed. All that happened was the mole got uglier than it was when I started,</li>
    <li> My final judgment still waiting. Even massaging tube , when I opened, stuff exploded out all over when I squeezed.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive to have to scrape it off mirror &amp; sink&lt;br /&gt;Quite difficult to work with</li>
    <li> Got got my product, was massaged the tube, after expelling some air, per the directions. When I went to squeeze out the product, it wouldn&#x27;t come out, so I squeezed a little harder. The sealed end of the tube broke open, and then I spent the next half hour cleaning up brown paste from all over my bathroom. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever find out if it works to remove moles or not. Not sure if there is any left in the tube, I just gathered it up with all the dirty paper towels and threw it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff before a few years ago and it truly works IF and ONLY if you follow the directions. The scratching of the blemish to increase the penetration of the product is the worst part. It can be a little painful but after that, I&#x27;ve rarely had a problem with it working. Sometimes you have to do it more than once but I&#x27;ve removed around 8 or 9 moles with this stuff, both raised and flat types. I&#x27;m happy it exists!</li>
    <li> Worked great!! I had several large moles on my face and had made an appointment with a plastic surgeon but decided to try this product not expecting a lot. The moles are completely gone, no real scarring and I cancelled my appointment.</li>
    <li> It worked well for a skin tag. It is one of the few products that I have tried that actually does work!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take them off. It did lighten them some I used the whole tube.It was easy to use. Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Have not used the product yet not sure if it really works. I have read a lot of good things about it though.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions for it&#x27;s use to the &#x27;letter&#x27; and it works great; otherwise it will not work. Most important step is the &#x27;roughing&#x27; of the skin imperfection sufficiently to allow the compound to enter the skin to form the scab on the imperfection.</li>
    <li> after seeing and reading about this mole and skin tage remover I gave it a try. After I used it on the same mole two times I have now know that it just will not work. Maybe the moles are to old, maybe the product is to old (seemed to not want to mix in the tube and needed to stick a toothpick into tube and move around product)it did make the top of the mole come off but that only made it harder for the next time, the moles is still there and I am not going to try again.</li>
    <li> Dermatend does work. I had several flat moles on the tops of my feet. Yes, they were resistant, stubborn moles. It took several treatments with the Dermatend, to get rid of them. They heal very slowly. Mine are tiny pin holes now after a month of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dermatend for your alternative product.&lt;br /&gt;In the spring I will feel confident to wear sandals and pretty pumps without stockings.</li>
    <li> Just follow the instructions and it works as promised!  Painless and permanent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. But worts come back.</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical at first, but when I heard my moles would cost appx $400 each to remove I decided to give this product a try. I started with the largest flat mole on my face. The application process is a bit unnerving, the stinging sensation was bearable (and let me know the product was working) and the next day I woke up with a scab over the spot. About 3 days later the scab came off. I am still treating the spot with the healing balm and vitamin E oil and the mole is gone! Unlike surgeries, I have no fear of scarring and the spot healed evenly with no indentions or significant discolorations. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought Dermatrend because I have a bunch of moles all over me, mostly on my back. I&#x27;ve had some&lt;br /&gt;removed by a doctor in the past a couple times. Sometimes they would heal and leave no mark. Other&lt;br /&gt;times they would leave scars that are about as bad as the moles themselves. So....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Dermatrend, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay such a high price for a dermatologist,  and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have a scar afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Well I tried it on about 5 moles. First one came back. so I tried it again on a different one, that once came back too.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried a small one on my arm, that one actually went away sort of, there&#x27;s still a mark its a little bit less dark then&lt;br /&gt;the mole that was there before. Then I tried one on my leg, That one looks really bad now, the mole is still there and its like this dark scar mole thing now... looks bad. At the same time I tried one on my back, That one left another nasty spot, not as bad as the one on my leg, but it looks like a big permanent spider bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be, look at the real problem, its self confidence. If your like me and you have a lot of moles, yeah its sucks, but life could be worse (and for a lot of good people it is). I even got in a car accident and have a large scars on my face too. Almost lost my eye sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way we look is important, but the way we feel about ourselves is even more important.&lt;br /&gt;It sucks going to the beach, and wanting to take my shirt off, seeing everyone else with clear skin, and feeling like you are&lt;br /&gt;different. But you know what, We all only have so many days on this earth. And as you get older you&lt;br /&gt;wont look as good, even the most beautiful people get old and eventualy ugly. So take off your shirt. Accept and love yourself&lt;br /&gt;because we only get one life. Beauty isn&#x27;t everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also people are usual more critical of themselves then other people. Most people are to busy thinking about themselves to even think twice about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus people who make fun of people have their own issues most of the time and are just trying to make themselves feel better by making you feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love yourself, life is a gift, your not the only one with moles, someone always has it worse than you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. what is more inspiring, A person who hides and covers there blemishes. Or someone who has accepts them-self for who they are and doesn&#x27;t care what others think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money or buy yourself something nice instead.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical myself, but my primary care physician wasn&#x27;t really paying any attention, and I was a bit worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a mole on my side that was definitely growing. I pointed it out to my primary care physician during a physical. The main reason I had scheduled the physical was so that I \\&quot;could\\&quot; point it out and hopefully get some input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, like most doctors, he pretty much ignored it and gave it only a passing glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product just to see if I could get some results on my own without having it burnt off etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product and left it on for 30 minutes. I didn&#x27;t think it did anything. I reapplied it the next day and left it on for 30 minutes again, and then figured I&#x27;d just wait and see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3-4 days later, the mole had dried up and just washed away in the shower. This mole was about the size of the fingertip of my small finger at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked amazingly well. Highly recommended. I&#x27;m just an average person with absolutely no connection to this product other than having used it.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the product, it did what it said it would. I had 3 large moles that i applied the product to and all of them are small enough where they don&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ve got a few on my back that I&#x27;m going to use the product on. Thank you! Cindy from Michigan</li>
    <li> Followed all details saw great results it turned into a scab then falled off, but my Birthmark grew back so not satisfied.... big disapointment.... bright idea but needs work...</li>
    <li> Works great.  Scrub the mole, put on the solution, it blisters up, scabs over and falls off.  All of this was within a few days.  Scarring is minimal.  I have even used it on my face.  I cannot see where the mole was.</li>
    <li> This was the second order I&#x27;ve placed for DermaTend. The first time, I ordered the small tube, and when it ran out, I had to get more so I ordered the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. I wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago when I had a doctor excise a mole (she did a rather poor job and the scar, though faded, is still there, uneven and unsightly 7 years later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some smaller moles were completely gone after just one treatment. A couple have required two or three treatments, but are now gone. Most of the new tissue has faded, and while a couple spots are still pink, they are all easily covered with concealer, and will likely fade even more with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The healing balm that comes with the larger tube is pretty awesome, too. In my experience, it has worked better than Neosporin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t praise this product enough. Seriously, it&#x27;s fantastic and performs better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Starts working in a few hrs vs Several weeks?</li>
    <li> Works 100% on skin tags but takes very long on birth marks however it will flatten it out especially on a bulging birth marks which is bother some, its will still leave tiny bit of mark if its very deep like a mark since birth, anyway that was the first try and will try one more time</li>
    <li> It took longer then expected for but it removed the mole</li>
    <li> Now before I go on to say that this product worked for me I feel it is important to note that the red area where the moles were is still healing up, took it off maybe 20 days ago. I also made sure that the mole was bleeding before I applied the solution and waiting 45 minutes before washing it off. I think making the mole bleed is a fairly important thing to do before applying the removal cream as it helps to penetrate deeper into the mole. A good method to get the mole to bleed is to repeatedly glance off of it with the supplied sandpaper. I know it may sound unpleasant but it gets results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who had a large mole on his scalp (he is bald) and it was gradually getting bigger and darker.  He has a tendancy to develop these \\&quot;growths\\&quot; especially as he gets older.  He has had them removed in the doctors office in the past but this time he tried this product and it seems to be working slowly but surely.  He has used it now for the past couple of weeks and the mole seems to be flaking off and has greatly diminished in size and color.  He says there is a little stinging when he prepares it for the treatment and until he washes the lotion off but this takes about 30 to 40 minutes and then he cannot feel it after that.  I would recommend this product to others providing they have been checked out by a doctor and they are sure that their growths are not cancerous.</li>
    <li> I spent $69.00 on this worthless product. There was a brown liquidy mud-like in the tube, a balm, a small nail filer, and a tooth pick. All were in a small blue plastic bag. There was no instruction slip on how to use this product. When you pasted on the mole and left it on for a while it became crusted and then the crusted dirt-like falls off and voila! the mole is still there, unharm, wouln&#x27;t budge. You dont even feel anything when you apply the product on the mole. It was literally like taking a mud, dabbed it on your mole and brushed it off or washed it off when the mud is dried. Unlike dry ice, you can feel it stings when your Doctor applied it on your mole. My suggestion; dont waste your money on Dermatend. Plenty of mud in your backyard.</li>
    <li> The product works!  and haven&#x27;t had any scarring  I would recommend to anyone who&#x27;s doc has told them the moles or skin tags are all fine, but insurance won&#x27;t pay for removal.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews here.  If you do your part of preparing the skin surface (really tear it up with some kind of sandpaper or something really rough untill it is just about bleeding), then this product will work great.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> not easy to use, they should have an easier method of using the product. You have to squeeze the tube back and forth to mix the ingredients and then it runs out as a watery solution. , and you have to scratch or sand the surface of the mole or skin tag before using the product. i  tried it three times on a skin tag and it had zero effect. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The following includes my process and results: I have several moles on my face, some large. I have had them looked at by a dermatologist and they were fine. I did have a mole on my neck that looked like it needed to be biopsied (spelling)and the so called trained dermatologists took a blade and hacked at my neck. I have a dark scar now in the shape of an apostrophe. So, needless to say, I did not want to go back to them again nor did I want to fork over big $$ for a surgeon to remove the ones on my face. I did research and read reviews for this product for nearly a year and the only real complaint that I read said that the moles sometimes reappear. That right there is not enough to scare me away. Who cares! So I bought this Dermatend product last April along with the healing balm. * I used a brand new unused cheap nail file (not the metal ones) and I rubbed at my mole. Not just the top, but I made sure to do all the sides (since it was a raised mole). I actually counted to ten with each side. Not hard! you dont want to make it bleed but you do want to rub it to kind of break the first layer of skin - thats the best way I know how to describe that. I immediately took a very warm wet washcloth to clean the mole. The heat stung the mole which let me know I did penetrate the skin. I applied vaseline to my skin surrounding the mole so the Dermatend would not get on my skin. I applied the Dermatend to the mole. I tried to apply it with a q-tip but it was easier with my finger. (Wash your finger immediately after). I felt stinging immediately. The pain is not unbearable. Im sure a child would not be able to stand it but they don&#x27;t usually like splinters removed either. I left the Dermatend on the area for 4-5min longer than the recommended time on the tube. I washed the dermatend and the Vaseline off of my face and applied the healing balm. Immediately you can see that the Dermatend has an affect on the mole. I applied the healing balm with a q-tip 2 to 3 times a day to the mole and the area around it because it appeared to be reddish in tint like it was irritated. I have very sensitive skin, so much so that I can&#x27;t use a lot of products. The mole scabbed up within days. It just looked like my mole was now black. The healing balm is shiny and to someone else it may look like you have snot on the area. I really didnt go out in public for the first week but you can cover it with a bandaid. Do NOT skip applying the healing balm!!!!!! On the 9th day, my scab fell off. I so wanted to pick it off but I know if i did it would leave a scar. Be strong! When the scab fell off there was a small hole that was whitish which led me to believe it was still healing. I kept applying the balm for 2-3 times a day. It has healed up very nicely. 2 - 3 weeks after scab fell off I switched to Bio oil because theyre good at preventing scars. It has now been about a 5 - 6 weeks since my scab fell off and it is healed and nearly the same color as the rest of my skin. there is a light pink outline of one fourth of a circle on my skin but Im still applying BioOil everyday and it should fade within the next week or so. Even if it doesn&#x27;t it is so small and so light I can cover it with makeup which is waaaaaaaay better than dealing with the mole that I had. I would definitely recommend using this. I had another mole I applied it to (it was actually my first mole), kind of an experiment in an inconspicuous spot. I did not use the file to all the sides so there is a raised area left. That is why with the 2nd mole (the process I described above) I rubbed all sides while counting to like 10 or 15. and it worked. It is a tad bit expensive but it works if you follow the directions. Its not difficult. There are even pictures in the small pamphlet. Well worth the money. Save up if you have to. I did and Im happier when I look in the mirror.</li>
