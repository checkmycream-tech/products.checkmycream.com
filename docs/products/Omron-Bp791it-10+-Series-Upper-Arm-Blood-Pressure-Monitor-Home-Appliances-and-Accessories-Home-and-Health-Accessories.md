      <li>and we&#x27;re very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since Omron insists that their driver is perfect and deflect all complaints to Microsoft, I have posted this information on the HealthVault user forum, in hopes that Microsoft will put pressure on Omron to fix their HealthVault driver so that it works on AMD hardware as well as Intel hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Accurate and trustable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product works as advetise, easy yo use and appears to be accurate. I would buy again and reommend to friends</li>
    <li> the only problem I have is the integration with Microstoft Health Vault, but this is mostly because of the Microsoft product not working very well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a very good product. recommended by users and doctors.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Easy to use (though you really have to have precise placement of the cuff).  Like that it will keep records for two people.</li>
    <li> It detects abnormal heart rates.  You can manage your records on your computer with the provided USB cable.  Easy to understand Manual.  2 Users and a Guest mode as well. Comfortable and has Battery backup.  Great product.  Using now for 2 months.</li>
    <li> Our old BP meter had gone bad. Looked at Consumer Reports for ratings on a new one. That&#x27;s why I chose the Omron meter.</li>
    <li> This unit seems to be accurate and has some memory capacity.  I bought it because I wanted to be able to download the readings to my compute and it does that relatively easily.  However, I find it very difficult to position the cuff correctly on myself.  I really need two hands; one to position the cuff and one to close the Velcro.  The other difficulty that I have is that the cords are all too short.  I have a hard time finding a place where the unit is safe, can be plugged in, and I can sit in a relaxed position.  The cord from the cuff to the unit is particularly short.  I will say that customer service is very good.  The first unit I ordered would not connect to my computer.  The vendor replaced the unit quickly and without difficulty.  My replacement unit works fine.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the unit. I have had no issues with it. Connecting to a web depository was simple and straightforward. This is my second Omron and both have been very accurate and easy to use. I took this into my last appointment it was right on with the reading I had from the nurse. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Este tensiometro de casa cumple con todas las espectativas creadas por el vendedor, es facil de usar y de programar, las funciones de memoria hacen muy facil controlar la presion en el tiempo, mis familiares estan encantados con el.</li>
    <li> Love the appliance/Blood pressure. Large bright display, accurate, quick, well made. Not much that is better as a pro-sumer product. The software however gave me a hard time to install. Not a straight through installation. Had to call support to step me through it (and I have been working with Software and PCs for 20+ years). I am sure they will fix it - and once installed, the software DOES work.</li>
    <li> It gives me the same readings as my doctor&#x27;s.  Only issue I have is the plastic insert to the pump line.</li>
    <li> Good Product but importing data in a windows 8 (even I tried with Windows XP PC) PC is real problem.</li>
    <li> Would have been better if it had an storage case.  I have to find something  to put it in, instead of just dropping it into a drawer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Omron Products: Pedometers: Heart Rate Monitors; and Blood Pressure Monitors. In my opinion, Omron produces quality products that I would purchase again. I measure my blood pressure twice a day and Omron&#x27;s blood pressure monitors seem to be as accurate as my doctor&#x27;s sphygomanometer. Omron&#x27;s pedometers are more accurate than any of the others I have tested. To ascertain the accuracy of Omron&#x27;s pedometers, I purchased a Stanley Digital Measuring Wheel. You&#x27;ve probably seen police using them at traffic crashes. Comparing the Omron to 4 other units, the Omron was the only one that produced the same reading as the Stanley Digital Measuring Wheel over a distance of 4-miles.</li>
    <li> After continually reading high on both readings. I decided to have it calibrated. Needless to say it was off be a substantial amount. After calibration it now seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> This blood pressure monitor is the best I&#x27;ve owned. It keeps track of two individuals, and it also has an option where you can allow guests to use it without it recording the readings. It has a built in calibration system and you can use it with batteries or plugged into the wall. The arm strap fits well and is said to fit most arms.</li>
    <li> This plus version is more sensitive to the cuff placement than the older version. The msft Health Vault software is a &amp;#34;cloud&amp;#34; service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t packaged well at all, just inside a box slightly larger. We don&#x27;t expect much longevity due to this.</li>
    <li> I recieved this just yesterday, 3/1/12.......and so far am quite pleased.  However, the readings are low as compared to my cardiologist&#x27;s readings, so, simply enough I will take this and synchronize it with theirs, hopefully, the calibration will be corrected.  This is an absolutely simple machine to use, LOVE IT!  I used it on my older kiddo...perfect reading, so, likely my Ca channel blocker dosage is too high.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Saw somewhere it was from China........how sad, wish it was AMERICAN MADE in the USA!</li>
    <li> Works as well as advertised!  I would consider this model for someone who needs to monitor their BP on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> Omron came up with with this in 2007 when I purchased my first one. With many advantages in comparison to all other monitors;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1... SOFTWARE; I download the report into my PC which then can be downloaded into MS Excel or PDF file,&lt;br /&gt;2... (PLUS +); All other monitors do not have this software. This is the reason why I got the (+) otherwise I would have got the cheapest one if I did not want to keep track of my record,&lt;br /&gt;3... Never use it with the battery although very good option,&lt;br /&gt;4... TWO USER; allows me to use the second setting when I do sports,&lt;br /&gt;5... Many, many other features like reports for Day or Evening. Reports by month or weekly and much, much more. It is so simple to look at my BP and pulse report for a week, a month or a year at a time which can just simply give me a very good indication of what has happened to my BP in the big picture so that way I get an idea if my diet or workout was effective for that period of year. An absolute necessity when I am so aware of all I do to improve my health. I purchased it for the above reasons, otherwise a cheap one would have done just fine. Very good customer service. Just insure that it is the PLUS since Amazon is selling so many different styles of these monitors which can be confusing. Off white colour finish is the old style and the black is the new style. Bravo.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve been using this about a month.  It is accurate, as checked with our doctor&#x27;s nurse.  It&#x27;s wasy to use.  I love that it tells you if you have it placed properly (or not).  I love that it can take a single reading or three and average them (that&#x27;s what my husband&#x27;s cardiologist recommended).  I love that it can keep track of both my husband and my readings separately.  You do have to plug it in or it will eat through batteries, but that&#x27;s okay with us.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had my Omron BP791IT for over a year. My wife and I both use it. Each time we take it with us to our Cardiologist and check it immediately with his blood pressure results. It has never been off more than one on the diastolic. We now use this machine to keep records on MS HEALTHVAULT through the included USB.  We keep all our health records and info on MS HEALTHVAULT now.  Thank you OMRON</li>
    <li> Not talking price, talking design - talking about blood pressure and this unit beats our old Omron.  Being able to download to computer is a big plus if one has fluctuations that the doctor would like to see.  Almost gave it a 4 star rating because of Omron&#x27;s software - which is small on the computer screen and can&#x27;t be enlarged (I know other ways to increase size, yet including CTRL +)  But the purpose of the device and the software is indeed met with enough variations in screen views to satisfy most needs.</li>
    <li> This device works great, much more accurate than a wrist device. Doctors prefer the arm method. The 3 measurement option only increases the accuracy.</li>
    <li> This is a great machine.  Fast accurate.  Better than in doctors office. Health is priceless.  Reasonable. Easy to use.  Don&#x27;t get stressed would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This machine is much more accurate than another brand I bought and returned.  The price is good, results very close to the doctor readings.  The cuff will fit both medium and large arms, is comfortable, and the machine itself is quality.  I do not hesitate to recommend you buy this monitor.</li>
    <li> The material is good. Looks durable and we like it.  Easy to read and easy to use. Good to have it in the house.</li>
    <li> We replaced our older version of the Omron monitor with this newer version. We&#x27;re very pleased with being able to track both of our blood pressures with the push of a button.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly to keep an eye on my blood pressure. I love the feature where it automatically checks 3 times to get a better reading. You can download all readings to your computer for more analysis if you want. the display is large and clear so you have no trouble reading it. The device works with batteries and comes with its own adapter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that it was worth every penny and I have already recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to get in the right spot sometimes, but otherwise is a great little device. Seemed to be off a bit from my doctor&#x27;s office when I took it in to try to calibrate, so I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it is.</li>
    <li> The blood pressure monitor I purchased works pretty well. It has a function I really like and that is it takes your blood pressure three times in a row, then shows you the average. I like that. I just don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t reading the same as when the doctor takes my blood pressure. But for comparison from one day to the next I guess it&#x27;s as accurate as it can be. I like that it does elmost everything automatically. It&#x27;s hassle free.</li>
    <li> This unit has been working very well from day one.  For me, it&#x27;s been pretty accurate.  I have borderline hypertension and it&#x27;s allowed me to monitor my ups and downs that are near or around the 130s / 80s.  Additionally, I&#x27;m able to connect with Microsoft health vault and keep a running list of my readings.  This way I&#x27;ll be able to share them with my PCP.  For the price this unit is just what i was looking for.  it&#x27;s allowing me to do exactly what I need and to monitor my health on a daily basis.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> excellent, light and quiet, plus ability to upload your readings and get a print out, plus add comments, is great. sturdy cuff. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Omron blood pressure monitors all work great.  This one downloads the information to my computer.  I can then take a print out with all details to my doctor.  No more writing.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I really like the ability to record my HR and BP by downloading the information to my laptop via the USB.  A great way to see how you trend.  My cardiologist will love having the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to install the program to capture the results.  Omron offers two options, through their SW or using Microsoft application.  Either works well on my older laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than other models, but the ability to download the data was a seller for me and in my estimation, well worth the slight increase in cost.  I have had zero reliability issues in the two months I&#x27;ve been using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and comparing it to the cuff that came in my Dr. bag for school. So far it has been right on.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Seems very accurate.  Large display is easy to read.  Like that it also can be ran on battery or electricity.</li>
    <li> I have been using a less expensive model that you put on your wrist for about 3 years, and it didn&#x27;t match what the professional BP monitors that my Doctor and Dentist use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Omron 10 Plus now for a couple months, and find that it matches the readings from my Doctors office. Maybe this is because the upper arm cuff is more accurate than the wrist strap. I don&#x27;t know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to use, and the A/B feature allows for my wife and I both to keep track of our own readings.</li>
    <li> I did my research prior to purchasing this brand.  This item is considered one of the best BP monitors on the market.  When compared to the doctors BP monitor, this one is spot on accurate and its very easy to read.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to operate.It has nice big numbers.&lt;br /&gt;The cuff is large enough to fit.&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back for me is that the memory is not compatible with my Apple computer.&lt;br /&gt;I have to go elsewhere to get my info with an App.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that the machine itself is great.Very accurate.</li>
    <li> It is accurate, fast testing, portable and could be used by self. Brought me and my husband security, convenience, and it has a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend it to anyone who blood pressure and heart beat need to be check.</li>
    <li> I am a retired RN.  I&#x27;ve had my battles with electronic BP Monitors and their unreliability and inaccuracies.  Of course, this one doesn&#x27;t have the frequency of use nor the multiple patients that those I used at work had, but it works very well for my home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to set up, learn to use, and is compact and easy to read, even if you aren&#x27;t a nurse.  I really like the data storage capabilities for keeping track of your (and a friend&#x27;s) blood pressure trends.  It can store 2 separate data banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly and was packaged well. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This blood pressure monitor is great, but it interfaces with Microsoft HealthVault only on some - not all - PCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two PCs, both running Windows 7 64-bit, with very similar software installed on the two (one started out as an exact clone of the other, but that was three years ago). The HealthVault Connection Center recognizes the BP791IT on the laptop but not on the desktop. (The BP791IT works with Omron Health Management Software on both of my PCs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why it works on one PC but not the other, but this fits with the fact that some people have problems with HealthVault and others don&#x27;t. I assume there is some hardware dependency that Omron hasn&#x27;t yet fixed in their driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could tell you what the difference is, but all I can do is tell you is that it&#x27;s a crap shoot: the BP791IT may work with HealthVault on your PC, or it may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I realized that my laptop PC that works with HealthVault has an Intel CPU, and my desktop PC that doesn&#x27;t work with HealthVault has an AMD CPU. I suspect that the Omron HealthVault driver has a problem with AMD hardware, which they need to fix. Since Omron insists that their driver is perfect and deflect all complaints to Microsoft, I have posted this information on the HealthVault user forum, in hopes that Microsoft will put pressure on Omron to fix their HealthVault driver so that it works on AMD hardware as well as Intel hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE January 25, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;Since Omron decided to save a few pennies and stop including a carrying case with this monitor (earlier reviewers who complained about the soft case didn&#x27;t know how lucky they were); and since the box it comes in is a non-square nightmare puzzle of interlocking plastic shells that is impossible to reassemble once unpacked; and since this thing has to live SOMEWHERE - especially if you want to take it to your doc for a checkup - I bought a series ofcarrying cases for it, hoping I&#x27;d eventually hit on one that worked. I did. It&#x27;s the [[ASIN:B004C0UNP6 eBags Slim Lunch Box]]. I got black, but it comes in many colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This monitor and the cuff fit perfectly in it, with a movable partition to keep the USB cable and the AC adapter separate; and there&#x27;s a big, full-width mesh pouch in the cover for the instruction manual and whatever else you might need to keep there. It comes with a removable shoulder strap, which I don&#x27;t need, so I keep it in the pouch with the monitor manual. Since it&#x27;s a lunch box, it has substantial thermal insulation and is lined with a silver waterproof material, but they just add extra protection for the monitor. I highly recommend it as as accessory for this monitor.</li>
    <li> Monitor has great features but unfortunately has proven to be dangerously inaccurate despite following directions precisely. Confirmed issue by comparing results at the doctors office. Consistently under reports my results by 15 to 20 points. Very disappointed. Would have given this 5 stars if it only done the most fundamental task correctly.</li>
    <li> This works well for me, but my wife arm (which is still in the limit) might be to small.  So it does not work for her.  i am trying to get a small cuff, but the one I ordered is not for this model.</li>
    <li> Very simple to use, and very accurate. Does many functions besides just BP. Will average BP readings for mornings and evenings.</li>
    <li> Nice device! It is really accurate and essential to have at home if you need to monitor your blood pressure. I recommend!</li>
    <li> This monitor is simple  to use and can keep the history for two people.  The instructions are explicit and the cuff easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Product works really well.  If anything is wrong, the indicator will show that there is an error.  I have confirmed it&#x27;s accuracy by taking it to my doctor&#x27;s office and it is pretty much heads on.  Would recommend this product.  Not a bad cost especially buying on Amazon.  I saved money ordering it and got free shipping rather than going to a local store (which I checked out three or four stores).  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the Cadillac of blood pressure monitors. Works great and for two people.  One small issue to us:  the line between the unit and the blood pressure cuff is too short, especially if someone is sick and laying on a bed.  Hopefully they will that fix soon.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, set up and read.  Also seems accurate.  It is much better than the older unit I had purchased from Costco.</li>
    <li> The instructions were easy to understand and it is easy to use and what I like the most is that it stores a lot of data and you can download your blood pressure information to your home computer.</li>
    <li> The BP791IT unit arrived in a sturdy package. The unit has three parts and the batteries. The parts assembled readily with the hose inserting into the main unit readily. The numerals read easily on the screen. The unit included getting started instructions which helped satisfy my intial curiousity of my bp measurement. The unit also had full instructions on additional measuring features and procedures to follow during measurement. Following the procedures makes a positive difference in my readings. The TruRead feature automates a triple reading which is easier than me remembering to perform the three readings. I look forward to a data download soon.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Easy to set up, Easy to use, Easy to shift between 2 people or even an occasional guest.  Very accurate in comparison to my Doctor&#x27;s office!  Haven&#x27;t tried downloading to computer yet.. can&#x27;t wait to see what the printout graph looks like.  Should be very good to carry report into Dr&#x27;s office!  Would certainly recommend to anyone looking to monitor your own BP at home!</li>
    <li> I could not use this Monitor from day one and called the Company to inform them that the cuff was too big for me.  It says that from 9 inches onward it should fit but not correct.  My arm  is 9.7 inches but it does not fit on my arm as it is big.  Thus a product is being sold on wrong information and specification.  The Suppliers have told me that  they will charge me 8.99 for shipping and  10% as stocking charges which is $ 7.20.  so I am supposed to pay  a fine of 16 dollars for no fault of mine.</li>
    <li> The Monitor works very well for us, with a very easy instant switch to alternate between 2 users. The readings are accurate, especially when using the 3 reading averaging. Applying the cuff seems a bit awkward for one-handed operation, but it is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PC application for the unit is not very good, but fortunately, we are able to use Microsoft Health Vault to store and manage the data.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a very reliable and accurate home BP system.  This is our 4th kind and is the best of the bunch but we get more error messages and mis-readings as we do good ones.  Can&#x27;t say as we recommend anything better than this one but wish there was as accuracy is key.  Someone out there needs to improve the technology.</li>
    <li> My grandma really loves this, it makes it really easy for her to monitor her blood pressure and then show the doctor the previous readings.</li>
    <li> I chose Omron because I wanted a high-quality monitor for my elderly parent; however, although the results are in large letters, they are not bright; the memory, etc., functions are on very small buttons, with tiny writing, parent was unable to use or read them; also, parent wanted the machine to stop when Stop was pushed, and didn&#x27;t understand why it repeatedly inflated  (auto stop is 2 minutes); I hope to return the product for credit.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mother.  The monitor is simple and the numbers are large enough that she can read them.  She brings the monitor to her doctor&#x27;s appointment and compares the reading to check for accuracy.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND IT WILL TELL YOU IF CUFF ISN&#x27;T ON PROPERLY. IT ALSO GIVES YOUR PULSE.&lt;br /&gt;GREATEST MONITER I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been debating whether to keep this monitor or return it, and finally decided to keep it. So I&#x27;m posting this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two other Omron blood pressure monitors. One I bought about 10 years ago. It has no bells and whistles, just a simple soft cuff, takes a reading quickly, reasonably accurate, not perfectly accurate, but very easy to use. The other is a wrist monitor which I use for travel. It&#x27;s less accurate but convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the BP7911T is very finicky and temperamental. It has a semi-rigid cuff that has to be positioned just so. Then you have to sit with your arm stationary and the cuff at heart level with your forearm supported on a desk or table. I&#x27;m sure this is all the interests of greater accuracy, but what actually happens is that I get many error messages: that the cuff is not applied properly, that it&#x27;s over or underinflated, that clothing is interfering with the cuff. The monitor has a feature of taking three consecutive readings automatically and then averaging them. Often reading #1 is fine, but I get error messages on #2 and #3, even though I haven&#x27;t moved at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent some time on the phone with Omron support to find out if I had a bad unit or wasn&#x27;t using it properly. Naturally the unit worked perfectly when I was on the phone with the support representative (I guess that&#x27;s the opposite of Murphy&#x27;s Law). Then afterwards I started getting error messages again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other major attraction of this unit is that you can upload readings to your computer. That way you have permanent records that you can also share with your physician. Much better, I thought, than the notebook I&#x27;d been using diligently to trancribe my readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two software alternatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omron Health Management Software: There&#x27;s no CD in the package, and the instruction manual gives a bad URL. After some time digging through the Omron website I finally located a link to the software and downloaded and installed it. It&#x27;s fairly primitive software but it works. The main problem for at least some of the users of the software is that it pops ups a small window and there&#x27;s no way to size it or maximize it. (The Omron support rep confirmed this.) So if you&#x27;re older with poor vision, this will be hard to use. The interface lets you toggle between a chart of all your readings, and a graph that gives it to you visually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other alternative is Microsoft Health Vault: This one&#x27;s even worse as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;m fairly techie and I&#x27;ve tried to connect the BP7911T to Health Vault on a couple of occasions and have never succeeded. Probably spent 2-3 hours total on this. Since the Omron software works, I don&#x27;t see the point of spending more time to get the Microsoft working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But both these softwares seem about 10 years out of date in terms of interface and usability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after all this, why did I decide to keep it? I often have to take multiple reading in a day, and I found I wasn&#x27;t recording them all in my notebook when I used my old monitor. This one will generally give me some reading, perhaps after a couple of false starts, and I will eventually have a lengthy record with graphics that can be reviewed easily by any doctor.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, plus it  has the options for keeping the blood pressure history for two different people -</li>
    <li> I researched different blood pressure products and this one seemed to be the best for the money.  I noticed that other reviews stated \\&quot;error\\&quot; message appeared often.  I found that to be true until I called customer service to find out what I was doing wrong.  Turns out that I had the arm band too far away from middle of my arm.  Half an inch made a huge difference.  Now it works just fine. I haven&#x27;t used the software to download to my computer but it was a selling point for me in case I need to in the future.  I also liked that I had electrical and battery backup although I bought rechargeable batteries to be safe.  I would recommend this product.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, poor software downloads ~ NO WINDOWS 8 OR MAC COMPATIBILITY ~ THEY HAVE NO PLANS TO UPGRADE SOFTWARE ~ USELESS AND NOT UP-TO-DATE ~ JUST USE IT AS A DOOR-STOP NOW.  WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER OMRON PRODUCT ~ BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BOTHER TO UPGRADE AND EXPAND THEIR SOFTWARE WITH THE ADVANCES IN COMPUTERS ~ AND WAS EXPENSIVE TO PURCHASE TO BOOT!  NO UPGRADES ~ DESPITE I WAS TOLD TO CHECK WEBSITE MONTHLY FOR ONE ~ UNTIL I SAW THIS:  OMRON WEBSITE:  &amp;#34;Omron Health Management Software (OHMS) v. U1.32: Compatible with Windows® 7/Vista/XP/2000. Not compatible with Windows® 8 and Mac products.&amp;#34;  Cons:  Software does not work on Mac and it has not been upgraded to Windows 8.  So, that is a great inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Quick Shipping. Works well. But dont rely on a single reading. Always take an average. Also your hand has to be straight for it to give accurate readings.</li>
    <li> Nice that it can take 3 readings one minute apart. Can upload info into their software or into Microsoft&#x27;s HealthVault.</li>
    <li> We love our Omron.  It&#x27;s accurate, easy to set up, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Plus we can download our results to a program that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best B.P. monitor available to consumers. My doctor recommended it. It find it easy to use, light weight, and accurate. It works on either AC power or on batteries.</li>
    <li> This blood pressure monitor has everything I wanted, memory, internet, ac/dc power, and the price was right. What more could you ask.</li>
    <li> Omron BP791IT 10 Series+(tm) Upper-Arm Blood-Pressure Monitor is an excellent vital signs monitor. I have been using the new monitor for about a month with perfect results. I love the download program onto my computer so I can print a hard copy before I take my wife to her doctor for cardiac issues. I had a previous Omron B/P Monitor for several years with excellent results. I felt that it was time to upgrade our B/P monitor as we use it every day, due to my wife&#x27;s heart condition. I think this monitor is an excellent health investment.</li>
    <li> I like this device very much.  It has many additional features that it&#x27;s previous model, the 790IT lacked.  It gives consistent readings, and is pretty much spot on when compared to the older model.  I have not checked the accuracy of the 791IT to a mercury column, but I believe that the device gives accurate readings.  I recommend this machine to those who need a reasonable blood pressure device at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> this is easy to use and i like that it has a memory function for two users. wish it had more though. I recommend this unit and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and  and would reccomend this machine.  Keeps track of  both my husband and I and we&#x27;re very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t see how you can get much better for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> Great, great item!  My Dr. wanted me to monitor my blood pressure for a month since I it was a little high the last time I went for a check up.  The design is SUPER easy to operate and I found the numbers to be very accurate.  I would also randomly test at a local Walgreens to compare, but stopped once I felt confident that this little system worked.  I would test in the morning and evening and the Omron system would store all my &amp;#34;highs and lows&amp;#34; so I could (and my Dr.) could easily get a snapshot of my blood pressure.  Overall I significantly brought down my numbers (while exercising and eating better) and felt that the easy monitoring this offered also gave me the motivation to get and stay healthy.  I now only monitor once a week or two and I continue to love its convenience even months later. - tony</li>
    <li> This is the best BP monitor I have ever owned.  It works exacly as described.  I love the features, especially the ability to set the individual to track, and I have found it to very accurate- close to what I get when  I visit my doctor</li>
    <li> 1. I bought an Omron BP791IT a month ago and tested with my family doctor and cardiologist. It is precise and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can upload your results into Microsoft Healthvault. I use my Windows 8 laptop to upload and share my results with my family doctor. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable price. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Just a 77-year old person who has to monitor blood pressure.  Have now done so religiously and am able to take a computer record of the &amp;#34;ups and downs&amp;#34; to show my doctors.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, easy to use, has a lot of features and the data can be transferred to the computer for printout.  I highly recommend it.  I have other monitors in the past and this one surpasses them all.</li>
    <li> Readings, when compared to those of other BP monitors including those at doctor&#x27;s office, appeared to be pretty accurate.  This monitor is easy to use, convenient AC adapter as well as cable to connect to PC to record readings.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR A GIFT FOR MY NEIGHBOR AS SHE HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND I WANTED HER TO MONITOR IT DAILY WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE 10 MILES TO THE WALMART TO TEST IT THEIR... THIS IS NOT ACCURATE AT ALL!! SHE WAS SO EXCITED WHEN SHE OPENED THE GIFT... I SET IT UP PER DIRECTIONS, AND WE TESTED IT... HER FIRST READING WAS ERROR, WE RESET THE ARM BAND, SECOND READING WAS 188 OVER 110 WOW!! SHE STARTED TO PANIC AND SAID THAT&#x27;S &amp;#34;ABOVE&amp;#34; THE STROKE RANGE!!!!!! SHE SAID HE HAD TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY!!! SHE TOOK IT OFF AND I WAS ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH HER WHEN I SUGGESTED WE MAKE A QUICK STOP AT THE WALMART AS THEY JUST OPEND FOR THEIR CHRISTMAS DAY SALE, I ASKED HER IF SHE FELT OK ENOUGH TO TAKE 5 MIN TO TEST IT HERE BEFORE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND HOURS AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM... WE WENT INTO THE WALMART AND MADE OUR WAY TO THE TESTER, AND WHEN SHE TESTED IT IT WAS 147 OVER 86!!!!!! SLIGHTLY HIGH BUT NOT &amp;#34;OVER&amp;#34; STROKE RANGE!!!!!!! WE WENT BACK AND THIS THING NEVER GIVES THE SAME READING TWICE EVEN IF YOU NEVER TOUCH THE BAND AND JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AGAIN AND AGAIN!!! DIFFERENT EVERY TIME!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION!! THESE THINGS SHOULD BE BANNED UNLESS AS ACCRETE AS THE DOCTORS!! SHE WON&#x27;T RETURN IT AS IT WAS A GIFT FROM ME... SO NOW IT SITS IN HER CLOSET!!! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> I recommend it 100%, to be a reliable, efficient and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very practical and meets all requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfied with the purchase. Thank you!</li>
    <li> BP Monitor is very accurate, the 2 persons memory user (me and my wife) plus guest user feature is the most convenient, the indicator gives the OK if the arm cuff has been wrapped correctly. Large display easy to read. I recommend to anyone. super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old meter (same brand) with this one.  This one is faster and more quiet.  The cuff is easier to put on the arm.  It has a lot of bells and whistles that I do not use much.  It just does what I want it to do quickly, quietly and accurately.</li>
    <li> Has all the features needed to get accurate readings.  Seems to be good quality and simple to operate. I like the being able to save 2 peoples readings separately.</li>
    <li> I received the Omron BPM on time. I have been using it for 4 weeks and that has included a check up with my cardiologist. I compared the Omron to the BP given by the nurse and while the numbers were a little low, the nurse was impressed with the accuracy of the Omron for a home BPM.&lt;br /&gt;The nurse stated that I will have no issues using this BPM on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the unit to be very easy to setup and operate. I have had no issues fitting the cuff unassisted and the fitment indicator on the BPM is great - letting me know if I have it fitted correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used all of the features of this BPM, but have made use of the memory function when showing my cardiologist the first few readings that were taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this unit to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using this latest version Omron with some success. I constantly use the 3 tests with one reading. I have tried it twice a few times just to check the averages. A few times the difference of the top number was greater than 8.What I did not like was when you chart your pressures, via the computer, the graph was different if the pressure when up or down. This was annoying when you want to read the graph for 2 weeks of testing. Other than these problems it works good.</li>
    <li> I really like this Omron projduct. This is the third I&#x27;ve owned. I like the comfort cuff. Really good for people with arms bigger than average. Would totally recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> Accurate and easy to use for simple BP readings. I love the fact that it stores settings for two people. The controls could be a bit easier to use around certain options and the memory storage features, though, and is all that kept it from the 5th star. As someone who occasionally exhibits \\&quot;white coat\\&quot; HBP, it was very reassuring to be able to check it at home and realize I&#x27;m fine. Beatifully made and so far quite reliable - I selected this model after finding an online rating of the accuracy of various home BP devices, and this was highly rated.</li>
    <li> I purchased this monitor to replace an old reliable unit we have used for years.  Unfortunately, with the new Omron unit every reading is different and the systolic pressure can vary by 30 or 40 mmHg between consecutive reads - not acceptable.  I compared it to another monitor a friend has and found that the Omron unit consistently reads low and also is inconsistent.  I&#x27;m contacting the manufacturer to see if they can help.  If it were accurate, I would love this monitor because it has a very nice easy to read display and I like the features including keeping a history of readings for two people.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this BP monitor and this one works much better.  The old one still works great and was given to my sister-in-law.</li>
    <li> So far it has been a very accurate monitor. It has a very clear display and easy to use arm strap. Good investment to take care of your health.</li>
    <li> My doctor said that I needed to record my blood pressure daily. This unit is simple to use and has a downloadable feature for record keeping. It&#x27;s very nice to use.</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you an indication when you don&#x27;t have the cuff on wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Readings can be downloaded to a PC.</li>
    <li> Really like this since you can monitor the blood pressure of two individuals. It&#x27;s accurate and easy to use. A great Buy!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It is simple to use and stores the results. The numbers are large and easy to read. The cuff is pre-fit so it goes on easily and correctly each time. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent BP monitor. The only downside for me was that the software for managing the BP data is not Apple Macintosh compatible. A spokeswoman for Omron sent me an email in response to my query about Apple compatibility, saying that Omron had no plans for implementing software for the Apple Macintosh computer.</li>
    <li> I had no trouble getting this up and running... though I did *not* try it with HealthVault.  Thought about it but once I installed the software it came with I just used that.</li>
</ol>
