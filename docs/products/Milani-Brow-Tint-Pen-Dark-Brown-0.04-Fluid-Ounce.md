      <li>And shipping was an issue at first contacted the supplier and one shipped out to me very quickly!!!</li>
      <li>I really love the Tent pens</li>
      <li>Anastastia&#x27;s brow marker is much better.</li>
      <li>I suggest that the people packing orders take more time to thoroughly examine the product code AND description.</li>
      <li>When I bought this product I thought it would be a bit more like an eyeliner marker.  </li>
      <li>Then just ordered 3 more.  </li>
      <li>I love the this product my eyebrows look on point with this item</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>The color is okay.  </li>
      <li>Nothing will ever take the place of real brows but this works great for me.  </li>
      <li>The color is perfect and it is very easy to apply but it can dry out.  </li>
      <li>Worth paying more for a better marker.</li>
      <li>This one is really a fine point</li>
      <li>Makes applying eyebrows easy and precise.</li>
      <li>I have black hair, olive skin tone, and this is perfect to shape my brows.  </li>
      <li>That means if you have light hair, do not use this brown pen.  </li>
      <li>The color was too light also.</li>
      <li>Originally, I ordered one to try it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried numerous brow liners and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I would only recommend this product if you&#x27;re like me, you have a good amount of hair in your brows and just want to fill in a spot or two.  </li>
      <li>The fine tip allows for a more natural looking brow as opposed to a pencil and it stays put after swimming.</li>
      <li>I like how quick it is</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t any kind of obvious drawn-on look or anything</li>
      <li>The Milani works much better than Anastasia pen and is considerably cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Went on nicely, but didn&#x27;t hold up through planting flowers outside.</li>
      <li>The time it will take to return it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much the first time I tried it, that I immediately ordered a second just to have on hand!</li>
      <li>It does take a few minutes to apply but after making the&lt;br /&gt;effort to obtain the best look possible, it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I have lost most of my eyebrows to an illness and this really fills them in well and makes them look natural.</li>
      <li>It works very much like a felt tip pen with a finer point.</li>
      <li>I have used another brand of marker very similar to this .. which I love ..</li>
      <li>When ur ready to blot, its never on the kleenex!</li>
      <li>Works very well!  </li>
      <li>You can draw in brows with great precision, and it seems to be very long lasting.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day but you can touch it up easily.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s an okay product, but I&#x27;ll try something new next time around.  </li>
      <li>The loose brow powder sold on amazon stays on much better.</li>
      <li>I have to really shake it up.  </li>
      <li>but when I go to remove my makeup, the color is really REALLY red/pink.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
      <li>I did not care much for this product.</li>
      <li>Works well with medium colored blonde hair, or even light brown.</li>
      <li>i had other ink pencils but they didn&#x27;t look good as the point was too big.  </li>
      <li>The color is called dark brown, but it is more like a medium.</li>
      <li>It does end up looking pretty natural though.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Use it every day to fill in my eyebrows, and the brown color is not as harsh, looks more natural.</li>
      <li>I have both the light brown and now the dark brown</li>
      <li>Thought it work better since I hardly have any eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The only product at a reasonable cost that stays on your brows.</li>
      <li>The Milani Brow Tint Pen gives me that natural look.</li>
      <li>It does stay on until I remove it at the end of my busy day.</li>
      <li>I was always looking for a product that would fill in with a natural look, and stay through the day.</li>
      <li>and I have bought  several different brands of powders, liquids and pencils to fill my eyebrows in to a natural look.</li>
      <li>and I much prefer the dark brown.</li>
      <li>but thought I&#x27;d try this one and it was just as good and a bit less expensive ..</li>

<li> It is hard for me to find though, and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean someday I won&#x27;t be able to.  </li>
<li> It does NOT budge despite my long hours at work and oily skin.  </li>

<li> it seems to be dry.</li>
<li> I had bought this when I saw a review on it from a guru on youtube and don&#x27;t regret it one single bit.</li>
<li> I use this dark brown one plus the lighter taupe one together, a few strokes of each gives a very natural look.</li>
<li> The pen was very dry and didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
<li> It comes out a bit watery, and not very opaque.  </li>
<li> But by the third day my eyebrows were a dark green color, not pleasing at all.  </li>
<li> This one has a little shorter felt tip .. which makes application a little different ..</li>
<li> I have very few hairs left</li>
<li> Only complaint is that sometimes the color seems to &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; spots on my eyebrow, could be due to powder being in place or oil on my skin though.  </li>
<li> Not worth the $$ wish</li>
<li> The color is truly dark brown, unlike the NYX eyebrow marker.  </li>
<li> tip down</li>
<li> I hope they fix this down the line</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tried several types of brow pens. I have sparse brows after chemo. I like that it goes on like a marker. Others were clumpy and crayon-like. I am a little shaky and it is somewhat forgiving and can be blended a little. It will stay on overnight unless I wash it off. Much cheaper than permanent/tattoo cosmetics and looks just as good!!</li>
    <li> Great product! My eyebrows have been diminishing because of age and my younger self over plucking. I was always looking for a product that would fill in with a natural look, and stay through the day. I have now found this product with Milani Brow Tint Pen. The pen goes on lighter but deepens as it dries. It does stay on until I remove it at the end of my busy day. The thin brush allows me to paint on thin hair like brush strokes. I love, love it! I ordered an extra and also put it in my continued order status. I will continue using this product!</li>
    <li> this is really great.  i had other ink pencils but they didn&#x27;t look good as the point was too big.  This one is really a fine point so you won&#x27;t look like like a clown.  I absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the this product my eyebrows look on point with this item so many compliments  !!! And shipping was an issue at first contacted the supplier and one shipped out to me very quickly!!! Love it !!!!?</li>
    <li> I did not care much for this product. Anastastia&#x27;s brow marker is much better. Worth paying more for a better marker.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that sometimes the color seems to &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; spots on my eyebrow, could be due to powder being in place or oil on my skin though.  Use it every day to fill in my eyebrows, and the brown color is not as harsh, looks more natural.</li>
    <li> Draws eyebrows on just the way you want. Makes applying eyebrows easy and precise.</li>
    <li> The pen was very dry and didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
    <li> First day, great, nice brush, color. But by the third day my eyebrows were a dark green color, not pleasing at all.  Sorry, will not buy again )o:</li>
    <li> Went on nicely, but didn&#x27;t hold up through planting flowers outside. NOT sweat-proof! I came in the house, and had no eyebrows, and brown puddles under my eyes! The loose brow powder sold on amazon stays on much better.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of marker very similar to this .. which I love ..but thought I&#x27;d try this one and it was just as good and a bit less expensive .. so I would recommend it.  This one has a little shorter felt tip .. which makes application a little different .. but good results.</li>
    <li> Thought it work better since I hardly have any eyebrows. Have eyebrows tattooed, but are starting to fade thought this would help, but not really. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to hold up during my sweaty work-out, but this barely even goes on and looks very fake.  Back to my go-to brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a Henna dye that was permanent.  This was watery and rubbed off in a few hours</li>
    <li> I use this with an eyebrow stamp and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous brow liners and this is by far the best. It works very much like a felt tip pen with a finer point. You can draw in brows with great precision, and it seems to be very long lasting. The color is called dark brown, but it is more like a medium.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! Works well with medium colored blonde hair, or even light brown. The fine tip allows for a more natural looking brow as opposed to a pencil and it stays put after swimming. I loved it so much the first time I tried it, that I immediately ordered a second just to have on hand!</li>
    <li> This is the only brow pen that I use anymore.....what an amazing product.  It is hard for me to find though, and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean someday I won&#x27;t be able to.  I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> A big disappointment. I only got to use it twice. The color was strange and it washed off the same day. Reapplying daily would not be a problem, but then pen itself dried up immediately, so now I cannot use it all!!  A waste of money - and the product is not eligible for return.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and it is very easy to apply but it can dry out.  I try to store it tip down but I usually carry it in my purse.  When I go to use it I have to really shake it up.  I hope they fix this down the line becasue it really is the best pencil i have used.  I have lost most of my eyebrows to an illness and this really fills them in well and makes them look natural. I am not good at makeup and dont know what I am doing so if I can do it this pencil is easy and good.</li>
    <li> Never aware such a thing existed.  I have very few hairs left so I tried it and was amazed how well it worked.  Nothing will ever take the place of real brows but this works great for me.  It does take a few minutes to apply but after making the&lt;br /&gt;effort to obtain the best look possible, it is worth it.  I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> It does not stay on my skin and rubs off easily, was very disappointed. The color was too light also.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pen, but received a pencil instead. The time it will take to return it isn&#x27;t worth it. I suggest that the people packing orders take more time to thoroughly examine the product code AND description. I only had this ONE item on my order. I&#x27;m totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this and stays on!!! Perfect color</li>
    <li> Useless, didnt stay on me for more than 2 hours.</li>
    <li> milani brow pen excellent for brow</li>
    <li> I previously used Sephora (discontinued) and Anastasia brow pens.  The Milani works much better than Anastasia pen and is considerably cheaper.  The color is truly dark brown, unlike the NYX eyebrow marker.  Unfortunately, after looking up the ingredients in EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database, I probably will not repurchase any of these brow pens again.</li>
    <li> Wears all day without smudging! When ur ready to blot, its never on the kleenex! Doesn&#x27;t make you look drawn on!!! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> it seems to be dry. .A little disapointed</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I thought it would be a bit more like an eyeliner marker.  It comes out a bit watery, and not very opaque.  It does end up looking pretty natural though.  I would only recommend this product if you&#x27;re like me, you have a good amount of hair in your brows and just want to fill in a spot or two.  If you have thin eyebrows and want them to look thicker, this isn&#x27;t the right product for you.  I like how quick it is, I usually use an eyeshadow and brow gel.  Sometimes I just do not have that kind of time.  The color is okay.  It isn&#x27;t any kind of obvious drawn-on look or anything but when I go to remove my makeup, the color is really REALLY red/pink.  That means if you have light hair, do not use this brown pen.  I have dark brown hair, and it&#x27;s hard to see anything.  I think it&#x27;s an okay product, but I&#x27;ll try something new next time around.  I haven&#x27;t met my match yet :(</li>
    <li> was what I wanted, very easy to use</li>
    <li> I use this dark brown one plus the lighter taupe one together, a few strokes of each gives a very natural look.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Originally, I ordered one to try it.  Then just ordered 3 more.  On trick, just before using it, hold it by the handle (with the cover on) and shake it a couple of times ... But not too hard.  This forces the liquid out to the felt applicator tip.</li>
    <li> The only product at a reasonable cost that stays on your brows. This is my 2nd order and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good pen, great price.</li>
    <li> Hate it! Not worth the $$ wish I could give it zero stars!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brow pen!  I doesn&#x27;t look harsh or dark in any way.  I have black hair, olive skin tone, and this is perfect to shape my brows.  I have OILY skin.  I work 12 hour shifts, 7 days a week and this stays put no matter what.  It does NOT budge despite my long hours at work and oily skin.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time finding a product to fill or shape your brows.  It is a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> This tint pen is wonderful ,it fills in you&#x60;re brows so well. I will be ordering them,.I am just afraid that they will quit making them. I really love the Tent pens</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t give you a hard line on your brow.</li>
    <li> I always use this product but it is hard to find consistently in the store. The dark brown is dark enough for effect but not so dark that you will look crazy. The tint pen lasts all day until I manually remove it, unlike pencils. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have both the light brown and now the dark brown and I much prefer the dark brown. It doesn&#x27;t last all day but you can touch it up easily.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are very thin and I have bought  several different brands of powders, liquids and pencils to fill my eyebrows in to a natural look. The Milani Brow Tint Pen gives me that natural look.</li>
    <li> I had bought this when I saw a review on it from a guru on youtube and don&#x27;t regret it one single bit. The only problem I had with it is that it dried out really fast. But you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Brow tint pens are the way to go if you don&#x27;t want smudges throughout the day.</li>
