<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been using the MyFacePillow every night for almost a year now!  It has trained me to sleep on my back. I wish I had this 10 years ago and now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Incredible, unmatched customer service!</li>
    <li> I have never slept better!  I had to buy another one for my husband who kept trying to take it away from me.  This is an A+ product.</li>
    <li> Your product is wonderful! I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different wrinkle-prevention pillows, and this is the first one that actually works!</li>
    <li> This little face pillow is wonderful.  I have noticed my eyes are less puffy and at times, not puffy at all when I wake in the morning.  As far as wrinkle relief, I cannot honestly address this topic.  I can say MyFacePillow is extremely soft and feels soothing on my face. I also might add that it is expensive.  At any rate, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> great pillow been using this for months and it is one of the best on the market. holds you head in place very comfortable. love it keeps you cream on</li>
    <li> I love my face pillow and use it every night. I highly recommend it and it also works well for me using the high peaks when I sleep on my side.</li>
    <li> Sent me 2 silk pillowcases when my original case split open!  So nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely satisfied with the MyFacePillow. I&#x27;ve tried a few other pillows in the past: the Vasseur pillow, the \\&quot;Save My Face\\&quot; pillow, the Vanity Pillow that range anywhere from $50 to $185. I always found them to be too firm and putting an uncomfortable amount of pressure on the lower jaw and neck. I had a hard time getting used to them and was never completely satisfied. The MyFacePillow is excellent, great quality. I had absolutely no trouble getting used to it. It is made out of memory foam, so it&#x27;s very soft and comfortable. It is wonderful at supporting my head, preserving the moisturizer I apply on my skin and simply giving me a good night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the obvious anti-aging benefits, it&#x27;s been extremely useful after my recent dental surgery. I had a bone grafting procedure and the MyFacePillow was a must during my recovery. I&#x27;m buying one more pillow for travel, the best part, it takes no space in your luggage. I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I wanted to say Thank You! for the great product and wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> The pillow felt so comfortable that I fell asleep shortly.  And the courteous service from the seller exceeded my expectation.</li>
    <li> I found this pillow did in fact keep me from turning to my side  (which was resulting in added wrinkles). It does take a bit of time to get used to it, but is definitely worth it. I would recommend this pillow for it&#x27;s intended use!</li>
    <li> I have purchased  pillows before that claimed to help you sleep on your back, and reduce the &#x27;slept in\\&quot; look my face used to have with ordinary pillows. Most were too big, too hard, and uncomfortable.  This does the trick!  It can work with any other pillow, its great for travelling as its quite small and very light. Highly recommended if you want to wake up looking fresh and without those cross hatch lines under your eyes.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;BEEN WAITING SEARCHING WROLD OVER FOR THIS PILLOW!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOT it here and tried last night!  I am disabled and sleep in chair on my back and my head for 3 yrs leans to left side SO WHOLE LEFT Of face and eye was Getting Suished and wake up to HORRIBLE DEEP SHEET LINES AND CAUSED A PERMANT WRINKLE Where pressure of leaning had squished eye over time to form a wrinkle I never HAD BEFORE. The right ETE IS WRINKLE FREE no Crows FEET AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ASKED plastic surgone about my issues with this dilemma and he said STARs USE THESE TO NEVER EVER GO THROGUH WHAT I GO THRU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TRIED FOR NAP This afternoon and NO WRINKLE formed or any squishing , its liekmemory foam on either side that keep head in one position so you don&#x27;t tilt to side in sleep causing eyes tp smoosh into blanket or pillow etc. CAN B used for side sleepers ot stomach sleepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im buying 2 MORE PILLOW TO NEVER RUN OUT OF !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am with SAG actor /model and WISH I knew of Smoothies and thi sPillow , would&#x27;ve saved me thousnands in BOTOX injections ! LOL</li>
    <li> I’m in my early thirties and started to notice some deep wrinkles on my face every morning as soon as I woke up . I researched about it and came to the conclusion that it was my sleeping position that had caused this and immediately started to shop around for a face pillow. After looking at several (sleeping  or beauty pillows)I decided to purchased my face pillow because of  all the great reviews. Let me tell you that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PILLOW! If I could give it a 10 star rating I would!!! I will admit that it was a bit hard to get used to it at first because I like to sleep on my back,but I adapted fairly quickly. I’m not  the type who leaves reviews, however for this item it was a must! The last thing I want to mention is the quality of their customer service, they are amazing!!! If you have any questions in regards to the product  they will answer them ASAP!!</li>
    <li> Takes some time to get use to if your a stomach sleeper but I love the pillow its very comfortable!    Also, awesome customer service i received from this company.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Better than any pillow I&#x27;ve ever had... I hate sleeping on my back UNTIL I GOT THIS PILLOW!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought my MyFacePillow on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. The MyFacePillow is one of the most comfortable pillows that I&#x27;ve ever slept on. It does keep my head upright once I&#x27;ve gotten used to sleeping on my back. Also, my neck doesn&#x27;t feel stiff at all when I wake up.</li>
    <li> Has trained me to be a back sleeper.  Very comfortable as well.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow, it has helped me immensely.  I ordered it as I am normally a belly sleeper so my face takes a beating when it comes to wrinkles.  The pillow keeps me from rolling over as much, it is so comfortable, I sleep so peacefully on it.  When I do tend to want to roll over (out of habit), I stop and stay in place and voila, I get a better nights sleep and my face does not show the lines as they used to when I slept down on my other pillows.  Love that I can wash the outer cover when I need to and replace it when done.  I recommend gentle wash cycle and air dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this pillow. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Thank you for a great product. Marilyn</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim, actually was pretty surprised at how comfortable it was. Has helped with my acne.</li>
    <li> I am always researching about beauty products, methods and treatments just to avoid looking older than my age. Yes, I am convinced that a good night rest is the key but I used to wake up looking wrinkled (eyes and laugh lines), I tried Frownies and it worked but I couldn&#x27;t sleep well with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I think a good beauty pillow would solve my problem and I purchased \\&quot;MyFacePillow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pillow helps me to fall into deep sleep and wake up refreshed as it is comfortable and prevents me from squashing my face while sleeping. It lessens frictions and ceases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search is over for the right pillow. Thank God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus for this product is Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> As a 50-something dermatology physician assistant, I try to prevent as many facial wrinkles as possible! MyFacePIllow still allows me to sleep on my side without creating sleep creases.  The pillow is super comfortable and I am recommending it to all my patients!  Thanks for creating such a great product that I use nightly!  S. Kurts, PA-C, Colorado.</li>
    <li> Exchanged the pillow twice because it didn&#x27;t have the two pillow cases it states they come with ..well no luck .. But the pillow is comfortable .. but soon after the CEO of the company reached out to me and corrected the issue and I received the two pillow cases... success ! This is an awesome pillow , I Love My Face Pillow !!!!! Thank You , Max!!!!</li>
    <li> I discovered the MyFacePillow from an article online about acne. Intrigued I searched for it on Amazon and reading all the great reviews convinced me I needed to try it. I have tried many, many different molded memory foam pillows and never found one worth keeping until now - the MyFacePillow is awesome! First, as a stomach/side sleeper I really needed to retrain myself to sleep on my back for my acne and wrinkle prevention. The MyFacePillow is helping immensely with that. It was comfortable from night one, just the right curvature for my neck that I never woke up uncomfortable or in pain, which is also helping the with migraines I was waking up with on a regular basis. In addition to all these benefits - I can already tell a difference in my skin. I now longer wake up with puffy bags under my eyes... which I just thought was a permanent thing. I had no idea my previous pillow was causing this situation. Also, since I&#x27;m sleeping more on my back... less skin contact with pillow &#x3D; no drooling (sorry to be gross but true :) and improved acne. This is the BEST pillow ever!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your incredible customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I love the silk case and combined with the pillow I am very satisfied with your products. The pillow is comfortable and even helps with some neck pain I struggle with. I think this pillow is a great value compared to others on the market. I want to combat wrinkles and morning sleep face so this pillow, combined with it&#x27;s silk case (sold separately- contact seller for purchase) helps keep me on my back. I was perfectly comfortable using it and I&#x27;ve noticed a less-tired appearance in my face in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow its just what I was looking for. It has really good benefits. Its keeps my head in a nice relaxing position and its help keeping the side of my cheeks free from anything giving me a smooth relax position without adding any pressure on it.  one more thing that I like about this pillow  is that I can take it with me anywhere if I&#x27;m traveling since its the perfect size and weight.</li>
    <li> It took me a few nights to get use to sleeping with the MyFacePillowm,&lt;br /&gt;but now I&#x27;m able to sleep through the night on on my back using it, and&lt;br /&gt;when I wake up I feel totally refreshed and rested, and&lt;br /&gt;YES....FEWER SLEEP WRINKLES!</li>
    <li> Update:  I had my pillow for a little over a year and just left it at a hotel by accident.  I tried to sleep for two nights without it and it was a miserable night sleep, and I woke up with sleep wrinkles on my face.  I ordered a new one and could not be happier.  This is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving my new pillow. I bought it because I was getting &amp;#34;sleep&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles&amp;#34; and they have almost disappeared. Great product!  I will definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really love this amazing pillow! I tried many  types of pillows; however, none of them were good except this comfortable pillow. The pillow&#x27;s quality is very good. I strongly recommend this wonderful pillow to anyone who needs to sleep on the back.</li>
    <li> I finally slept my first night last night with my new pillow!!!  It was the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years!!  My neck was so comfortable - the angle was perfect!!  The pillow was plush and soft and did not have any heavy &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; or foam odor</li>
    <li> I had a neck lift and I&#x27;m so glad I found this pillow. It&#x27;s really helped me to sleep on my back and keeping my neck in the proper position. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> I like the pillow. It keeps me from tossing and turning trying to find a comfortable spot on my pillow. I am definately sleeping better.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I think your product is wonderful. I really do!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable, both the materials of the pillow as well as its case.  It&#x27;s a little wider than I thought, so even though I try to sleep on my back, there&#x27;s plenty of room to roll over to my side as I have been accustomed to do.  Even if I start by laying on my back and have a sound sleep, I still manage to be sleeping on my right side when I wake up.</li>
    <li> Pillow is exactly as described. The most exceptional customer service I have ever experienced on Amazon...or anywhere else for that matter!</li>
    <li> I bought this pillow to train myself to sleep on my back more. I saw similar pillows and now that I&#x27;m nearing 40 like the idea of something to help with side sleeping wrinkles and also because I feel like it&#x27;s better for posture. I really like the pillow! I find I am sleeping on my back a majority of the time (occasionally I&#x27;ve found myself veering more towards my side - it is a foam material so it&#x27;s possible). I do have some issues with staying asleep throughout the night (I wake up a lot) - I had hoped the pillow would help, I do feel more restful though. Its too early to tell about the wrinkles but all in all it&#x27;s a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is I do wish it came with the satin pillowcase that some folks mention. It comes in a velour one and you have to buy the satin one separately which is like $19.99 when I looked. Yikes - I mean the pillow itself is expensive enough!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my new pillow.I have enjoyed laying on it as it is soft and the side supports seem to be sturdy so far. Also, this pillow has really forced me to lay on my back which has eliminated my back/neck pain that I would occasionally get from laying on my side.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow and customer service!</li>
    <li> Very high quality product!  Perfect firmness is achieved for the memory foam fill.  A  luxuriously, soft pillow cover makes putting your face on it feel fabulous.  I&#x27;ve washed the pillow cover numerous times and it comes out good as new every time.  A high quality zipper makes taking the pillow cover off and putting it back on easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have started noticing that I wake up some mornings with puffy eyes and &#x27;sleep line&#x27; creases on my face.  I usually sleep on my side.  Depending on which side I sleep on, one eye is slightly puffier than the other.  MyFacePillow helps support my head while comfortably training me to keep my face up.  Took me a bit to get used to it, but ever since I  have, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without MyFacePillow.  Now, I wake up without puffy eyes or &#x27;sleep line&#x27; creases.  Amazing find!  I&#x27;m ordering more for my family who gave the pillow a try and loved it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or concerns the customer service is stellar!  They are passionate about their product design, aim to please, and welcome your feedback.</li>
    <li> I found MyFacePillow being the only effective product on the market, because I think you have to sleep on your back if you want to prevent sleeping wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The memory foam is nice and soft but gives enough support to make it&lt;br /&gt;comfortable yet hold your head in place. The business was represented by great support and along every step of the way to shipping on the other side of the world, the owner made every attempt to expedite shipping and ensure I was more than happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought another one for a friend and have told a number of people about the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to sleep on my back, but it&#x27;s hard to stay there (I&#x27;m normally a side-sleeper).  This is a great pillow.  Just got it yesterday and slept on it last night.  I slept on my back all night.  The little side pieces aren&#x27;t high enough to block air circulation - which I was kind of worried about  - but they are enough to remind me not to flip to my side.  Good design!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and good quality product</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I adore it...had to buy another one&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PILLOW! This pillow is PERFECT!! And most importantly it does give ALL the benefits exactly as it states it does! I am a professional model and this pillow is a Necessity! A Great gift as well for anyone whom has neck stiffness and easily transportable (as I always take mine with me) I have gifted several to my fellow models and friends, family and they ALL LOVE their Face pillow.</li>
    <li> These pillows are so comfortable and they really do help me sleep on back. I&#x27;ve always slept on my side but this truly helps me train to sleep on my back. I still roll over occasionally but my face can sleep on the edge easily so that it&#x27;ll help prevent me breaking out. I had bought this for my boyfriend as well and lets him get a full night&#x27;s sleep. I love it that we can wash the covers (I don&#x27;t have to toss the whole pillow in the wash all the time) which helps keep it sanitary too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The support should save us a lifetime of neck pain which can really only help us out-- I think these pillows are a good investment over all.</li>
    <li> Great idea but to squishy for me. All of the built up support was to squishy and just flattened when I laid on it. And the pillow overall is just too flat. Plumper and firmer and this would be an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love the pillow.  It is helping me refrain from sleeping on my stomach and is helping me from squishing my face!!!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this pillow. Very confortable</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product. I found it easy to get used to it , it&#x27;s very smooth and comfortable. Fulfills its purpose</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am extremely happy with MyFacePillow!!! It was worth the wait. The pillow is absolutely great and it took me no time to adjust to using it. I have some neck issues so it is great to have a pillow that supports my neck. Thank you so much! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great pillow, keeps your head and neck aligned.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I really like my new MyFacePillow, and it will be my travelling pillow and also when I am at home&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I liked it enough to buy two more as gifts!&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I had been using it for years but&lt;br /&gt;better late than never!</li>
    <li> I have only had the pillow for two days now, but I can very happily say that both mornings I have awaken with no swelling under eyes at all.  I have allergies and sinus issues and swollen eyes are an issue I deal with daily if I turn my head on either side on normal pillow.  It is definitely worth a try for anyone who deals with this issue.</li>
    <li> Thanks for replacing product</li>
    <li> This pillow is AWESOME! It&#x27;s relaxing, comfortable and has helped make the transition to sleeping on my back a whole lot easier. I would highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Soft and comfy but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t provide me enough support. I was expecting it to be the more supportive foam(polyurethane) but it&#x27;s really viscoelastic like and it goes almost flat when laying on the side. I have woke up with it upside down. I tend to go all the way to my side, the rails don&#x27;t stop me or wake me up and then I find my whole face is off the pillow and I have no neck support. I gave it a week but I&#x27;m waking up stiff and with headaches. I&#x27;m still on the search for the pillow that works for my neck and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this warrants one. I have tried for years now to stop sleeping on my side to no avail. I have spent a lot of money on pillows. This pillow is the first and only that actually  for me. I wake up still on my back!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this pillow!!! It has helped me to train myself to sleep on my back to keep the wrinkles at bay!!!</li>
    <li> Very good neck position, but like another reviewer mentioned, the side-rails are soft, and if you are trying to convert from being a stomach or side sleeper to being a back sleeper, which is really difficult to accomplish, they sometimes aren&#x27;t sufficient to stop you from rolling over them.  I was pleasantly surprised, though, that it doesn&#x27;t totally destroy my hair.  I used a regular pillowcase, not satin, yet my hair was reasonably in place in the morning.  While not foolproof, it&#x27;s the best pillow/device I have found in my effort to not further wrinkle my skin by sleeping on my face each night.</li>
    <li> Customer service is wonderful, I received an email asking about how the pillow was working out for me and if I needed additional neck support without even inquiring.  I have neck related issues and have always had trouble finding the right pillow ergonomic or otherwise so I was grateful when the seller told me they would custom make a neck support for me free of charge. Customer service is lacking in most company&#x27;s this is definitly not the case here!  The memory foam is quality foam and the pillow has zero scent.  It is compact enough that it would be great for travel as well as daily home use.  A standard pillow case fits the pillow as well.  For quality assurance this is a terrific company!</li>
    <li> This is a great pillow. I usually sleep on my side, but this pillow makes sleeping on your back very comfortable, much more so than a down pillow. You can still sleep on your side, and the shape of the pillow allows you to do this and not get crease marks on your face.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very soft french terry cover that zips on and off easily and washes well.</li>
    <li> I bought the product from its original website and brought it to Turkey. All i can say is the product helped me to have the best sleep in my life so far and helped preventing wrinkles in a very relaxy way. Customer service is also great i have to mention. Highly recommended.  Update: Years later i bought the second one, but this time the pillow is much larger, i think the old one was better to carry around, still a great pillow and nothing like that in the market(Trust me i spend hundreds of dollars on pillows up to now). İ still just dont understand why they changed the form of something already great!</li>
    <li> I love how comfortable this pillow is.  I bought this because I have developed horizontal neck lines.  I believe they are due to using a thick memory foam pillow for years that would cause my head and neck to bend forward.  My Face pillow doesn&#x27;t position my neck in that way.  Between religious application of a neck firming cream and this pillow allowing me to sleep properly, I am hoping that eventually these neck lines will diminish.  I will have to give a follow up review after a few months to report on my lines.  At the very least, I know they won&#x27;t get any worse!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to train myself to sleep on my back to help with breakouts and because I have always heard it is better to sleep like that for aging.  I could not do it without this pillow! I felt a little funny ordering a face pillow but I&#x27;m seriously glad that I did. It is very comfy and helps keep me on my back at night.  You can roll to the side a little and it is still very comfortable.  I think this is a great product. I haven&#x27;t tried any other products like this so I cant compare but just looking at the design this one really makes the most sense.</li>
