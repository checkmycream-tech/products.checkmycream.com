### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>- it&#x27;s just not going to happen, even with the best manicurist.</li>
      <li>Beautiful nails.  </li>
      <li>These are great fir a one day wear.  </li>
      <li>The shine is great..</li>
      <li>They crinkle very easily, I have used nail stickers for awhile and I would consider myself good at applying them</li>
      <li>they looked nice when I put them on...</li>
      <li>Also note that the package tells you to remove them by soaking in warm water.</li>
      <li>I love these nail polish stickers....</li>
      <li>Every time I washed my hands, they would peel up from the edges more &amp; more.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>but these weren&#x27;t that easily applied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for matching up for a certain look you may be going for.</li>
      <li>They look really cool when on.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I wanted the true, shiny chrome look</li>
      <li>It looks good in pictures, but when you do apply it, even if you are as careful as can be, you end up with wrinkles, bubbles, scratches, etc.</li>
      <li>When I tried applying a top coat, it completely ruined the metallic effect, so I couldn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty and shiny, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stretch to accommodate the nail and when you file off the ends you end up with very frayed edges.</li>
      <li>Also, once the top edges are filed, the finish is rough.</li>
      <li>Wrinkles to easily and hard to get edges to stay down..impossible to get smooth...</li>
      <li>I am very experienced with doing my own nails, including doing complex designs and wraps, and I found these impossible to use.    </li>
      <li>Pretty but, not a lasting Manicure.</li>
      <li>They are a very cheaply made product, and if your expectation is to have something to play around with (maybe to cut into other designs, or to use for a few hours for an event) they might be fun to try.</li>
      <li>They crinkled on the sides no matter how hard I tried to smooth them out.</li>
      <li>so it is hard to get a proper fit.</li>
      <li>Despite all the negative reviews that I read, I decided to give it a try, after all it was cheap enough to try.</li>

<li> Also, the glue on the back has really poor adhesion even on very clean, very dry, buffed nails.</li>
<li> And they weren&#x27;t flat</li>
<li> , I couldn&#x27;t even use them, they are like normal stickers, not &#x27;nail stickers&#x27;, they don&#x27;t stick the nail properly and you can&#x27;t shape them even though you manage to put it because they are so thick.</li>
<li> Every little imperfection shows due to the highly reflective coat.</li>
<li> Even when applied very carefully, you will get bubbles and lines.</li>
<li> but if you want to wear them for longer then don&#x27;t waste you time</li>
<li> Even though I have read the other negative reviews I decided to try them, I applied them one night</li>
<li> The edges peel up, and the wraps themselves have very little bend</li>
<li> They could probably be used to cut out small shapes to decorate your nail, but I haven&#x27;t tried that so idk if that would even work.</li>
<li> but I revived them in a small envelope labeled  as &amp;#34;phone case&amp;#34</li>
<li> however when I received mine they were in a thin envelope that had gotten folded so a few of them were unusable because of the creases....</li>
<li> Not a good idea</li>
<li> ; with no instructions at all which was really weird... hope they work though I&#x27;ll probably check YouTube to see how to apply.</li>
<li> Poorly packaged and bent all over when I received them!</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s impossible to wash your hands</li>
<li> and they look so bad on her nails .</li>
<li> So bad....</li>
<li> DISAPPOINTED</li>
<li> hated these, they didn&#x27;t even come with instructions like the description said.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used nail wraps before and these are terrible.</li>
<li> These are terrible!</li>

    <li> hated these, they didn&#x27;t even come with instructions like the description said.  Poorly packaged and bent all over when I received them!</li>
    <li> I am very experienced with doing my own nails, including doing complex designs and wraps, and I found these impossible to use.    Even when applied very carefully, you will get bubbles and lines. Every little imperfection shows due to the highly reflective coat. Also, the glue on the back has really poor adhesion even on very clean, very dry, buffed nails. The edges peel up, and the wraps themselves have very little bend so it is hard to get a proper fit. Also, once the top edges are filed, the finish is rough. Ultimately, I threw the rest of mine away.    Also note that the package tells you to remove them by soaking in warm water. So it&#x27;s impossible to wash your hands (don&#x27;t even think about washing your hair!) with these on without them falling off, even if you do manage to get them on looking half-decent.    All of that said, you get what you pay for with these. They are a very cheaply made product, and if your expectation is to have something to play around with (maybe to cut into other designs, or to use for a few hours for an event) they might be fun to try. But do not buy them with the expectation of getting the picture-perfect results you see in that photo - it&#x27;s just not going to happen, even with the best manicurist.</li>
    <li> Despite all the negative reviews that I read, I decided to give it a try, after all it was cheap enough to try. Not a good idea, I couldn&#x27;t even use them, they are like normal stickers, not &#x27;nail stickers&#x27;, they don&#x27;t stick the nail properly and you can&#x27;t shape them even though you manage to put it because they are so thick. So I threw them away without using them. I would not give any star if I could. I would not recommend this product to anyone, buy a cup of coffee instead with that money...</li>
    <li> Even though I have read the other negative reviews I decided to try them, I applied them one night so I could wear them the next day at a party. They don&#x27;t stay on what so ever. They crinkle very easily, I have used nail stickers for awhile and I would consider myself good at applying them but these weren&#x27;t that easily applied. I would not recommend buying these</li>
    <li> Not shiny like the picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty but, not a lasting Manicure. The price is right. It&#x27;s nice for matching up for a certain look you may be going for.</li>
    <li> Not at all! I ordered this because I wanted the true, shiny chrome look but what I received is a brushed look.  I can already get that with a nail polish I have.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even use them but my mom did and they look so bad on her nails . I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again .</li>
    <li> Not a mirror finish. DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet but I revived them in a small envelope labeled  as &amp;#34;phone case&amp;#34; with no instructions at all which was really weird... hope they work though I&#x27;ll probably check YouTube to see how to apply.</li>
    <li> like it. hope it last.</li>
    <li> Beautiful nails.  Easy to apply</li>
    <li> It looks good in pictures, but when you do apply it, even if you are as careful as can be, you end up with wrinkles, bubbles, scratches, etc. It looks pretty and shiny, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there. They don&#x27;t stretch to accommodate the nail and when you file off the ends you end up with very frayed edges. Also they peel off as soon as you look at them.</li>
    <li> These are great fir a one day wear.  The will not last any longer then tha .  They look really cool when on.</li>
    <li> The stickers do not apply as shown in picture. They crinkled on the sides no matter how hard I tried to smooth them out. When I tried applying a top coat, it completely ruined the metallic effect, so I couldn&#x27;t even do that. Every time I washed my hands, they would peel up from the edges more &amp; more. They could probably be used to cut out small shapes to decorate your nail, but I haven&#x27;t tried that so idk if that would even work.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stick kept peeling off use a lil glue</li>
    <li> It took over two months to get here. And they weren&#x27;t flat</li>
    <li> Not reflective its just a metallic blurry sticker</li>
    <li> So bad.... No durable</li>
    <li> I wish I could post a photo of how my nails looked after I applied the stickers.</li>
    <li> The shine is great..but I would not buy this again. Wrinkles to easily and hard to get edges to stay down..impossible to get smooth...no stars on this product</li>
    <li> I love these nail polish stickers.... however when I received mine they were in a thin envelope that had gotten folded so a few of them were unusable because of the creases.... but there are enough in the package to do all nails</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out how to use them</li>
    <li> These are terrible! I&#x27;ve used nail wraps before and these are terrible.</li>
    <li> Wish there was instructions included in the pack, coz even any of the manicurist in the salon where I went didn&#x27;t have any idea on how to apply it.</li>
    <li> Lumpy, bumpy....hard to apply.  Back to standard polish I go.</li>
    <li> they looked nice when I put them on...but they only lasted like a hour. If u need them for an hour then get it but if you want to wear them for longer then don&#x27;t waste you time</li>
