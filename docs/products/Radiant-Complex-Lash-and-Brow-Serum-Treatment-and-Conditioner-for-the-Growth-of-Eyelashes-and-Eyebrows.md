      <li>I would say density has increased by 50% or more.</li>
      <li>The money back guarantee is also awesome!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work</li>
      <li>Not wanting to go the Minoxidil route just yet, the fact this was geared towards both the eyebrows and lashes made me choose this one over the many of others on the market.</li>
      <li>I think what I like most</li>
      <li>and I really love that.</li>
      <li>You have to try it to love it</li>
      <li>and i really love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used it every morning for a month and can&#x27;t see any difference??</li>
    <li> By the time you realize this product does NOT work..and is basically worthless..you will have exceeded the time allotment to return this crap. Do yourself a favor and spend the $45 on dinner with someone...NOT on this. Apparently the positive comments were made as an exchange for the product BEFORE the product results could be given truthfully and accurately.  That is WRONG marketing.</li>
    <li> First time user to take care of my thin eyebrows. I have to say it works. As mentioned in the product and previous user feedback, it takes some time to see the improvement. For me, it takes about some subtle changes. It has been 6 weeks and it is clearly thicker. It also grows at the tail of my eyebrows, where has almost nothing.</li>
    <li> I never had this before and I hope this will work out.... I can&#x27;t wait to try it as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural blonde with with fine eye lashes. I&#x27;ve always admired women with thick, full lashes. Nothing I tried has ever seemed to work. I&#x27;ve spent so much money (and time), and hadn&#x27;t found a solution until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is incredibly easy and takes no time at all. That&#x27;s a huge plus as I barely have 5 minutes to myself as it is. Ah the life of a mother of 5 (beautiful chaos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid 5 stars for the product, as well as the seller!</li>
    <li> Very nice, although I was a little afraid the first couple of times about putting it so close to my eyes. No worries though, it stayed in place and dried fast. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my eyelashes. I haven&#x27;t tried this on my brows, as they&#x27;re already alittle on the crazy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are longer, thicker, and darker. After only a short time I can see new lashes growing inbetween several lashes throughout my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So excited. Who doesn&#x27;t want full sexy eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m deeply embedded in my 30s, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as when I was younger, so I gave this a go. I&#x27;m always highly skeptical about these types of products, but I thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try. I haven&#x27;t had it long and already I&#x27;m impressed. My lashes are fuller already, both in length and volume. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to a lot of products, and this is good on me. I haven&#x27;t reacted in any way, which I do with many, and it doesn&#x27;t burn when you get it in your eyes (if you&#x27;re clumsy like me). I think what I like most, is this feels like a luxury treat that I&#x27;m giving myself. It&#x27;s not an absolute necessity, it&#x27;s one of those products that you get, and you&#x27;re excited when it arrives and you feel kinda special using. This is now a staple in my make up/skin care arsenal.</li>
    <li> I have spent countless amounts of money on other serum&#x27;s that just don&#x27;t work for me. Then I ordered the Radiant Complex Lash and Brow Serum and everything changed for the better. I have been using this as my daily routine and I can already start to see a difference. My eye lashes and brows are starting to be more fuller then they once were. Now that I finally found this magic in a bottle I will always use it no going back to wasting money on ones that don&#x27;t work. I didn&#x27;t realize how thin my lashes and brows were until I started using this. I would highly recommend using the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! As soon as I receieved it I started using it. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work but I started seeing results after 2 weeks. I really needed a product to help grow my lashes and everything I tried didn&#x27;t work until now. If you want thicker and longer lashes this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Love this Eyelash &amp; Eyebrow growth! Very easy to apply and use. Doesn&#x27;t clump on and hasn&#x27;t smeared yet. I have noticed more fuller lashes. My eyelashes to begin are thin and short. It&#x27;s sad when your son has longer and fuller eyelashes than you do. I love that my eyelashes and brows are more enhanced. I use this product in the morning before leaving the house. It can be worn with your everyday makeup. I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my makeup bag so I can keep everything together.</li>
    <li> This eyelash and eyebrow serum works very well. Feels very nice going on and my eyelashes have been itching less since I started using this product. Definitely a plus for me because I could hardly wear mascara with my eyelids itching at the place where my lashes meet. So nice to Fi ally have some relief from the itching.</li>
    <li> This works!!! Love my lashes!</li>
    <li> This eyelash serum has been great, I tried it for a month now. It did not irritate my eyes, really light. I hope it will continue to function, as I have a think lashes. I will continue using this product until I get the best result. I receive this eyelash serum during promotion for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> At the beginning I was, skeptical. I must say that I am thrilled with the results I have gotten from consistently using this. I am definately impressed with this product. I saw results after just 4 weeks. I mainly noticed my lashes begin to curl on their own. When I put mascara on, the lashes stay curled the entire day. My lashes have been stiff and on the brittle side and I have noticed that they are softer now and look healthier.  I recommend this product. I am a BIG believer!</li>
    <li> Ussd for a little over a month 2x/day and saw an itty bit of growth... But not much. Trying a different product now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago and have been using it as the  instructions say. I&#x27;m not going to tell you that this is a miracle product  and that I&#x27;ve got thick, full lashes and brows all of a sudden.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the past few days I have noticed that my eyebrows are filling in a bit faster than they normally do and that the hairs are softer than they usually are when they grow back.&lt;br /&gt;I  am hoping that with continued use of this product the results will continue to be more noticeable and that my eyebrows will fill in a bit more.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to see the kind of results that others who have reviewed the product have had.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate it on doing what it claims because I don&#x27;t feel I was able to use it long enough to see good results because it irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 8 weeks and got little to no result. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Product is OK. Does not do everything as described and for the price...that&#x27;s not too great.&lt;br /&gt;Did it make my lashes longer? Slightly, I notice some length at the edges and corners.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker? NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;I did not apply makeup for literally 6 weeks...not once and applied as directed (twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;The nice customer service reps did send me another one though because I ran out at my third week which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;I so wanted this to work but it just did not deliver.</li>
    <li> Today will by my 32nd day of using this serum on my brows and I can&#x27;t believe how well it is working.  The product states that results will be seen within 6 weeks but already I can tell.  I agreed to review this product because my brows were never very thick to begin with but over the years, they have thinned out a little and just aren&#x27;t as nice looking as they once were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this serum twice a day, I can definitely tell that my brows are thicker.  I am going to move to a once a day application now for my brows and I am going to start a twice a day regime with my eyelashes.  I&#x27;m hoping that I get just as good results there and am looking forward to thicker lashes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to this product and I did not have any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at products to thicken your eyelashes or brows, this is a good one!</li>
    <li> I used this today and have not had any issues as far as eye irritation or the feeling of needing to rub my eyes. I will continue to use this and I am happy that I received this product.</li>
    <li> If you are anything like me you&#x27;ve tried every mascara out there... Department store brands, drug store brands... Whatever has the most alluring packaging that tells me my lashes will look longer, thicker, fuller - STUNNING! I&#x27;m there. I&#x27;ve bought it. Yup. Then into the &amp;#34;circular file&amp;#34; it goes.&lt;br /&gt;So what they hey I think. Why not I wonder. Well it was an added bonus to get a coupon to try the product cheaper in response for me to tell you how I feel about it. I don&#x27;t get paid. I won&#x27;t get famous. I&#x27;m just a girl telling you this is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; - for me it&#x27;s all about being able to slow down and do things for me. I used to spend all day in a salon and LOVED it. Well now that money goes somewhere else...&lt;br /&gt;So this routine ~ It&#x27;s calming. It&#x27;s relaxing. It&#x27;s uplifting. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I think part of this routine is feeling good and how that makes you look good - If that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, visibly there&#x27;s an improvement to the fullness and length of my lashes. Would my guy notice? Probably not.  But my girlfriend at work did. - That&#x27;s a compliment that we can never hear enough of.&lt;br /&gt;The solution dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or anything which I worried about.&lt;br /&gt;Make it part of your process.  You&#x27;ll be glad that you did.</li>
    <li> Actually helped grow back my eyebrows! Great stuff if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on Latisse.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this eyelash serum. It is now my 7th week and I have seen no results. In fact, this serum has caused my eyelashes to thin out where many have fallen out. I have less eyelashes now. I have used many eyelash serums in the past 3-4 years, but this one really doesn&#x27;t work. Do not waste your time on this eyelash serum.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I can&#x27;t wait to see the full result. So far I have a great experience using the serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I can see some progress with my lashes already. No eye irritation at all. It&#x27;s very safe to use.</li>
    <li> Within 3 days I noticed a difference in my lashes! It&#x27;s easy to use, just apply a thin layer at the lash line right before bed and let the magic happen. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction to this product!</li>
    <li> Its too early to see results from using this lash and brow serum, but I have used some similar to this and it has worked, so I am hoping for the same prom this brand! I was amazed at the size of the bottle. Its huge!! It will last a very long time and is definitely worth the money, if you purchase instead of receiving it as a promotional product like I did! The packaging is great, and so is the formula. It is very easy to apply and has no scent! It also does not cause eye irritation if used correctly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lash serum for a few weeks and am seeing good results!  It&#x27;s a quick process to incorporate into your routine, if you can remember to use it twice daily like the instructions say.  I have not experienced any irritation,  but sometimes get a tingling sensation which I think might be from the Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root (licorice) extract. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is NOT colored, it is a lash and brow serum to help with growth. It should be applied on clean skin, so I only applied it at night since I was unsure if makeup put on top would inhibit it&#x27;s effects. I have yet to notice any growth or thickness in my lashes or brows, however I have noticed a slight tingling sensation at the application sites, sometimes it gets as strong as a burning sensation on my upper lids.  Since I don&#x27;t have as much of a lash issue as much as a brow issue, I think that I will just abstain from applying this to my lashes in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using this about a week and  half, twice a day. I have very light and thin eyebrows and when taking a picture it looks like I have none. :(  So when I saw this I thought it might be worth a try, However I see NO difference so far. Thus the 3 stars. I will keep trying this for another few weeks and see if it makes any difference, but thought that I would see some change by now.  4/1/2015 - Here we are over a month later.No real difference at all! Did not Work for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for two reasons. First, I have thinning lashes and second, I have a thin right eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product twice a day for the last 7 days. (It states in the directions to use it twice a day for the first weeks.) It seems to make my eyelashes a little more firm and they do seem a little thicker. I am hoping that I will continue to see results as time goes on. I was worried about using this since I wear contacts but as long as I use it the correct way, I have no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few days, can already tell a difference in my eyelashes.  Easy to apply.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how great my eyelashes look after a few weeks!</li>
    <li> It took about 2 weeks to see any type of difference, but it has started working for me now over the past few days. I love my lashes already but my eye brows really needed this, they just werent very think and I was having to fill them in all the time. This is pretty awesome to get the hairs growing, it takes a little time, but it has been worth it so far. I would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> WOW What a wonderful Product, I started using this weeks ago and I see a total difference in my Eye lashes, They are Longer and fuller, I even had someone ask me what Mascara am I using and I had none on AMAZING, Goes on smoothly no clumping , no mess, Non sticky, Just pure heaven</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have only been using this for over a week and I have notice some improvement. I like that the serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and is easy to use. I use it on brows since I have thin and want more thicker ones, and I like when I apply a mess. If you&#x27;re looking for a brow&amp; serum try this one it very reasonable and works well. When I have used it longer I will update you on my progress!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week and I can already see a difference in my eyebrows and lashes. Will post pictures once I reach one month of use.</li>
    <li> If you are anything like me, you have sparse eyebrows that have to be filled in each morning and eyelashes so short and straight that even mascara can&#x27;t save them. I&#x27;ve considered temporary eyelash extensions and even Latisse, but the high price tags for these items always turned me off.  Thankfully, I was offered this product for the purposes of honest and unbiased testing and reviewing - and it has proven to be a huge game changer. I have used this product for a little over 4 weeks now; the first couple of weeks did not yield significant results, but since then, there have been definite improvements to the length of my lashes and brows.  Pros: - More affordable and just as effective alternative to Latisse and extensions - Easy to use and apply - Makes brow hair and eyelashes longer and fuller within a couple of weeks - More natural appearance than fake eyelashes/filled in eyebrows - No irritation despite my highly sensitive skin. I have also gotten some into my eyes before, and my eyes did not burn even though I wear contacts  Cons: - This serum is not an overnight miracle worker, so results will definitely take time, and even then, the hairs grow longer but not much thicker. Not a huge issue however, as it has been big enough of an improvement for my lashes to look much fuller with mascara.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s not powerful as pharmaceutical grade Latisse.  But it&#x27;s OK for the price. My eyes get irritation though..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month...too soon to expect great results yet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this review specifically for girls who lost their lashes for one reason or another. I had SUPER long and very thick natural lashes prior to getting lash extensions.(See first photo) But, being a girl who ADORES long lashes, I figured why not try lash extensions and go even bigger right? Wrong. As the lashes started to fall off, they took my natural lashes with them. In the end... I had lost 90% of my naturally long lashes, and was left with extremely sparse, very short lashes. (See second photo)  I was mortified, and was convinced I had ruined my lashes forever. So in a panic I purchased this product and I am SO happy to inform those reading this who are in a similar situation that there is hope for your lashes! Within a few weeks, the short lashes I had left began to lengthen, and the bald spots where I had lost all my lashes completely began to fill in!! Now, its only been about three weeks so i&#x27;m definitely not where I started, but I once again look healthy and my lashes look completely normal! (See third photo. Lashes appear wet because I had just applied the radiant complex) In fact, though they have a ways to go as far as getting them back to the length they were.. I actually think they are growing in THICKER than before! I&#x27;m so happy this product is helping to reverse the damage I did to my lashes, and I highly recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My lashes feel fuller and thicker thanks to this. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received a discounted item for this product testing and review purposes. I am so picky about using this kind of product on my eye. But this Radiant complex lash &amp; brow Serum made me confident to apply on my eye lashes. I didn&#x27;t feel irritation on my eyes or whatever weird feelings few days ago from applying it. I loved it, and i trust the product because it is paraben free and  not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try something on your eye lashes that makes you feel confident and safe from the hazardous chemicals on it, try this Radiant Complex Lash &amp; Brow Serum.  It works for me, and pretty sure will work for you as well!</li>
    <li> I had forgotten I had this product and stumbled upon it while cleaning. So I have been using it ever since I would say probably 3 weeks now and have seen a difference in my lashes they are a bit longer and look a lot fuller! So I can only imagine the results in another 3-4 weeks, I am extremely happy with this product</li>
    <li> This is a must buy! I used a product in the past that required a prescription. It was extremely expensive because insurance of course would not cover. I wish I had known about this product before I wasted so much time and money. This product is amazing and works better than what I was using before. My eyelashes are thicker, fuller, and much darker. I&#x27;m very pleased. Will definitely order from this seller again. Quick delivery. Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this product in return for a review. I was not sure that I would like this product but once I started using it I realized quickly that I really do like using it.</li>
    <li> While results take a bit to show, this product definitely helped me to grow more lashes! I especially realized it when i stopped using it for a couple of months. Continuous use is key.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product at a fraction of the cost to review and give my honest opinion.  i have been using this serum for more than a week now and i like that it has not caused me any irritation. it applies smooth and dries without flakiness.  i have not seen any results yet but will continue to use it and will follow up with my review in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased Radiant complex lash and brow serum in hopes of rapidly growing back my over plucked eyebrows. Within the first 5 days of use I noticed new grow appearing. This product actually works!! I can&#x27;t wait to test it on my lashes.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that my skimpy eyelashes started to grow.  There were patches that disappeared on my left side because I pulled them by accident with a poor eyelash curler.  It is going to take time to have my eyelashes back, but hopefully they will return to what they used to be.  I hope that this product continues to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I did order another product for growing eyelashes, etc., and it never came.  I will check the order and see if the product is still on the screen and perhaps I have to finalize it.</li>
    <li> good product and have seen results that make me smile!!!</li>
    <li> Used it twice a day for three weeks and nothing. No growth at all. I&#x27;m switching back to Rapid Lash. This was a little cheaper. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Used it for 3 weeks mornings and evenings with no results.  I guess I&#x27;ll try rapid lash next.</li>
    <li> Due to the great reviews, I had high hopes for this product.  I used and still used it twice a day for lashes and brows, but have noticed absolutely no difference.  I apply it extremely liberally, it just isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing in 2 days I could see results. After 1 month awesome.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long, but so far i&#x27;m very pleased! it&#x27;s a really light gel formula so it stays put where it is places, and dries rather quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any smell or fumes that come off of it- I was so worried that it would and that it would run into or burn my eyes but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t at all! The packaging is nice and you get a ton of product, it&#x27;s going to last me forever! I am going to keep using it and will update my review in a few weeks. But so far i&#x27;m very pleased with this product and hopeful to see great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for two days and so far I like it ok.  I&#x27;ve noticed a slight tingly irritation, more like an itchiness, that is bearable. Otherwise I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far.  One thing I will say is I&#x27;m slightly confused on the application of it, but hopefully I&#x27;m doing it right. Will update in a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I absolutely love this product!! I have noticed a difference in both my brows and lashes, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m very pleased.  My eyebrows have had some odd spots where the hair just won&#x27;t grow, especially my left eyebrow, I don&#x27;t know why; and the hair hasn&#x27;t completely come in but it looks fuller and much better than it use to look. I am so excited to see how it will look after 6 weeks.  I will admit there have been days when I forget to put it on twice and/or where I just don&#x27;t get much time to put the serum on, but I am going into week 4 with this product, and again I am happy with the results and will be looking to get another one when I run out.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t believe the length of my eyelashes!! I have noticed dramatic results in just a couple weeks! Easy to apply, once a day. Had no irritation or discomfort. I am happy to have received this product for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and even though I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it I have already seen a difference. Not a drastic difference but a definite difference. I cannot wait to see what kind of long term results I get with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple lash serums now as the older I get the less lashes I have. Super Annoying! This Lash serum is very easy to use- exactly like using a liquid eyeliner- in fact I think it&#x27;s the same brush. It&#x27;s a small tube- but the product is pretty liquid so it should last a while with 2 applications a day. Don&#x27;t over apply though- I did that a couple times and it leaked into my eyes. It does burn a little- don&#x27;t let this scare you though- its just a matter of not applying too much. As far as the results- I have used another product with similar product with a very similar ingredient list and it worked well so I am expecting similar results here. I will update my review here in a couple weeks to see how its actually working.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have been looking for something this great for a long time! A must try!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this at night on my very thin eyebrows and lashes for about a week with no results. I will reevaluate after another week or until/if my results change. I would also suggest to the company to put directions for use on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excited to start seeing results! I have heard great things about this product.</li>
    <li> I got this serum to review and i really love it. I have used other lash and brow serums before and usually you can barely tell if you even have any product on the brush. I normally have to dip my brush in like 5 times to get enough product on there. With this one, you can actually see the product on the brush and I really love that. The brush is the perfect size too, it goes on eyelashes really easy and does not burn! I only have to dip my brush 1 time for each brow. I can already see a difference with the growth rate of my brows and lashes!</li>
    <li> For some unknown reason I never kept up with using lash serums, trying many over the years, and decided to look for a new, more natural one. Last month in particular it really became apparent how wispy my lashes had become thanks to multiple lashes falling out on a daily basis. Not wanting to go the Minoxidil route just yet, the fact this was geared towards both the eyebrows and lashes made me choose this one over the many of others on the market. That and the natural ingredients themselves which looked promising.  In particular, the rose water which has had a very long history of conditioning lashes and Eyebright which has been traditionally used for an inflammation condition found in the base of lashes. This also has peptides, green tea, Hyaluronic acid and Allantoin along with hydrolyzed wheat protein. That last one is often found in hair thickening products as it coats the hairs cosmetically. What I found interesting is how castor oil seems missing from this product. It would have been nice if it was in there as I have personally seen beneficial results from it.  The Radiant Complex serum came in a substantial black tube as pictured and was very fresh when I opened it. The serum itself is a thick, clear gel that feels nice and applied easily to the base of my lashes and through brows. Much the way you would apply liquid eyeliner it has a very soft and thin brush that allows for precise application. There was zero burning or stinging and because of the thick gel texture it stays in place and does not run into eyes or down the brow bone.  Due to the applicator style and ingredients I&#x27;m concentrating this serum on my skin and not the hair itself. The most apparent effect I&#x27;ve noticed with this serum is today not a single fallen lash. My eyes themselves feel less dry and itchy as well which is really welcome. Brows look the same but the clear gel does have the benefit of keeping hairs in place. What seemed to be an unnecessary extra step in my daily routine might have been crucial after all so I&#x27;m interested in seeing what will happen in the coming months.  I&#x27;ll come back and update when the tube is finished with further thoughts and results.  UPDATE: As promised I&#x27;m back with an update a few months of daily use. Did this work? Yes! I now have some of the fullest eyebrows I ever have. I would say density has increased by 50% or more. My eyelashes seem fuller and I see new growth were there were wide spaces in the lash line previously. Judging by the ingredients label and my past experiences with lash serums I was really skeptical but I&#x27;m really pleased with the results and the tube has lasted longer than they projected. So glad I took a chance with this.</li>
    <li> Radiant Complex Lash &amp; Brow Serum works to thicken your brows and eye lashes. Listed as a an eye lash lengthener as well, this product should work to do that. Due to a thyroid condition, my eye brows fall out often, leaving unsightly bald areas. I did find this serum to work amazingly well to help my brows thicken to fill in these areas quite quickly. I didn&#x27;t notice any huge change in my eye lashes, either in length or thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this lash &amp; brow serum for the benefits it&#x27;s provided to my brows. Reviewing this product proved beneficial. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It is very easy to apply. It has helped my eyelashes get longer and I love them!</li>
    <li> What I Love about Radiant Complex Lash &amp; Brow Serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- thickens my eyelashes and brows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- hair growth is definitely noticeable even without regular 2x/day application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- recommend 2x/day application for best result!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after being curious and looking at different serums  for eyelash growth,  I was very fortunate I got a discount and I promise to review honestly for others like me looking for a good quality product for their lashes or brows.&lt;br /&gt;I would not apply just any product on my eyes but this here is a magical high quality serum you must try.  I have been applying it twice daily for the last 4 days and I see a big difference already in my lashes.  I will post pictures after I am done with the product.  You have to try it to love it</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! I started using this about a month ago and the results are amazing. My lashes are so much longer and also thinker. I have gained lots of volume in my eyelashes and I&#x27;m super happy about that. It&#x27;s so easy to apply too. I literally swipe it across my lash line and it&#x27;s done within 10 seconds. I only use it on my eyelashes currently but I assume it will work just as well anywhere else because the brush is so small. Sometimes I go about my day without mascara and no one notices! I really like this product and recommend it for all women- everyone needs some beautiful lashes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks but I see no change</li>
    <li> Been using this product diligently (twice per day for five weeks) and have not noticed a thing. I should have saved the $45 I spent on this and used it toward Latisse instead. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see any change (it&#x27;s been about 5 weeks) and the serum irritates my eyes a bit.</li>
    <li> I got this serum about 2 weeks ago and have been applying it in the morning and at night. It seems to work really well! My eyelashes have already gotten longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALMOST NON-EXISTANT EYE LASHES.  I THINK I CAN ALREADY SEE A LITTLE DIFFERENCE AFTER ONLY A WEEK!!</li>
    <li> There are many eyelash serums on the market, and some of them help, however Radiant Complex Lash serum does more than &#x60;help&#x27; - it works with rapid visible results, without any stinging or eye irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us have had to deal with the loss of eyelashes, and for a variety of different reasons such as age, health problems, medications, eye lashes that have been plucked out, burnt or broken, as well as those who have very short, tiny eye lashes that can hardly be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest question is &#x60;will they grow back?&#x27; and the answer is YES, they grow back just like normal body hairs, and a most effective way to is to use Radiant Complex eyelash and brow serum, first because it works, and also due to the fact that Radiant Complex eye lash serum is Paraben FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now in my fourth week of usage and I am seeing both longer and a thicker density of lashes. I have applied this serum twice a day, mornings, and evenings and I am receiving astonishing results. My lashes are filling in especially in the corners where they were both scant and short, they are growing in longer and thicker. When I receive, my previous length, I will then apply my Radiant Complex serum just once a day, in the evenings. Then after the density has returned, I will use the Radiant Complex serum at least twice a week just to maintain my healthy long lash results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through &#x60;eye lash loss&#x27; due to age, illness, medications, aside from the normal rubbing of tired eyes, and I have found that Radiant Complex eye lash serum is giving me the fastest and best results over the other serums that I have used over the years. In the meantime, during my loss of lashes, I had done some research and I would like to share some of the facts regarding eyelash growth. I think that it is important to understand the eyelash growth pattern in order to have realistic expectations and this will help explain why some &#x60;seem&#x27; to receive faster results than others...it all depends on which growing stage your lashes are in when you start an eyelash serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Research:&lt;br /&gt;It takes about a week before lashes start to grow, then approximately 7 to 8 weeks for eyelashes to reach their full length and the most effective way for rapid results is to use an eyelash serum, namely Radiant Complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stage of eyelash growth is the anagen phase, which lasts between 30, to 45 days. Throughout this phase, they grow continually without shedding, unless some rough treatment forces them to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second phase of growth is the catagen phase. This is a transition stage when eyelash growth stops, the outer root eyelash sheath shrinks and attaches to the hair root. This stage lasts for about 2 to 3 weeks and the eyelash will not grow back during this stage if they fall off, therefore there is no replacement until this stage is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third stage is the tolegen phase. During this phase, the eyelash will rest for around 100 days without falling. Afterwards, they will start to fall or shed, and even a slight pull, will cause them to loosen and fall off. However, during the tolegen stage, you can expect the lash to grow back faster than during the first or second phase since this is part of the normal circle of hair replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, the exact duration for eyelash growth is dependent on the stage at which they fell off, so it could be from a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on the stage they were in when they fell out. This should help to explain why some people receive new, longer, and denser lashes faster than others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are various reasons for the loss of lashes; during the removal of makeup, applying mascara, medications, illness, harsh eye makeup, and lash curling are a few explanations. In order to speed up the eyelash growth process, a balanced diet or at least a multivitamin is required, Vitamin A and E, fish oil, and Biotin willrapidly and naturally increase their growth. This will provide internal health and speed up results at the same time as applying the Radiant Complex serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes need conditioning to ensure that they are supple, healthy, and soft, this will promote longer lashes and help to reduce damages from eye makeup. I use a variety of oils, castor, almond, walnut, emu, whatever oil I am presently using on my face, and I apply the oil on my lash base after the removal of all eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Avoid wearing mascara every day, and waterproof mascara is notorious for loosening lashes during mascara removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Eyelash curling tends to weaken and break delicate lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Resist from using false and fake lashes, they tend to inhibit eyelash growth and increase eyelash loss during both wearing and removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Avoid rubbing eyes and do not pull lashes while wearing, applying or removing eye make-up. Instead, use a cotton pad soaked with a gentle eye make-up remover, and pat rather than rub the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Never, go to bed with eye makeup on. Remove all eye makeup and moisturize your eyelid. This will encourage the growth of longer eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Avoid using permanent eyeliners and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Lashes need aeration, therefore whenever possible, skip both eyeliner and mascara. Both eyeliner and mascara weakens lashes, and they need time to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Avoid rubbing your eyes, this will promote longer lashes, the rubbing will weaken them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Do NOT use any old or dried out mascara. Mascara only lasts for 2 to 4 months, and then it needs to be disposed, even if it still looks okay - IT IS NO LONGER GOOD - IT HAS EXPIRED, and it will harm the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review has helped to explain the stages of eye lash growth, how to speed up the process, and receive the best results. Radiant Complex eyelash and brow serum is an effective way to regain those lost lashes, and maintain both length and density. It will also help to give positive results in lengthening and density for those who have very short and tiny lashes that are barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Radiant Complex Serum was provided Free for an evaluation, and the testing results, research, and opinions are my own.he same time as applying the Radiant Complex serum.

    <li> This product seems to be working. My eyebrows are a little patchy. They have never been very thick. My eyelashes are so so. The serum comes in a mascara bottle. It has a little fine brush for the applicator. The serum is clear. I was really worried about trying to apply this without getting it in my eyes. I was worried that it would really burn. Well, I did get some in my eyes when I first tried it, but it didn&#x27;t burn. That was such a relief. I have tried other products that claim to help growth of eye lashes or my eye brows and they burned very bad and irritated my eye. This was easy. I put it on in morning and night. Applied it to clean eyelashes and let it do it&#x27;s work, I have noticed some new growth on my eye brows. I am going to continue to use this and let you know how the final outcome was</li>
    <li> This is one so wonderful and great item. This item conditions my eyelashes so they feel so much softer which I totally love. Also with this serum I started using on my eyelashes and believe it or not slowly they are starting to get longer and longer all the time. It is a wonderful item because I always wanted full eyelashes and with this I am finally getting them. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
    <li> I put 1 star, because zero stars is not an option, to my knowledge. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Latisse, and it works wonderfully. This has shown no results after more than six weeks of twice daily application......</li>
    <li> It burns my eyes. However, I received a prompt response from Radiant Lash refunding my money. I really appreciate that. I am thinking now that it may have been my allergies since my eyes are still bothering me and I haven&#x27;t used the product lately.</li>
    <li> Used this for a month and see the difference almost immediately.  Love this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months, but have seen no lash growth.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because it was on sale, and saw all the positive reviews. You do have to be patient with it but I can say that after 2 months of using it I have seen significant results! My lashes are twice as long and twice as thick! I don&#x27;t find it as effective on my eyebrows which was a disappointment but I am still happy I bought it. I would recommend using it twice a day for the first month like they say. I&#x27;m ready to order my second tube!</li>
    <li> I gave it a shot. I have broad but thin eyebrows and I wanted them to grow in thicker. I applied twice a day and used the whole product and I would always wake up with irritated eyes. I could live with that if it worked but I saw no improvement so I will have to report that this had no visible effect on me.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical whenever I purchased this lash and brown serum, but I have been pleasantly surprised! After using it for 2 weeks I started to notice that I had new lash growth. I have been having the problem of my lashes not growing like they are supposed to, so I was excited to see the change! It has been amazing to see the change in my lashes! I recommend this to anyone that has a problem with areas of their lashes or brows that do not grow evenly or at all! I promise you&#x27;ll see a difference!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it really works~! I love it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting longer, fuller lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My lashes seem thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use for my brows but I use for my eyelashes and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t burn or make my eyes tear.</li>
    <li> This serum is easy to apply and dries clear.  I was using it twice a day.  After about a week I have noticed that it does cause some itching.  I cut down to just at night and that has helped.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice full results, but I am hopeful.  It seems to be a good product.  I need to mention that my eyes are very sensitive so I don&#x27;t blame the product alone for the irritation.  Happy with this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and I do notice my lashes getting a little thicker. It&#x27;s very easy to apply. This is  great product and I would purchase it again in the future,</li>
    <li> I wanted faster results</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love using this on my lashes!</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled with how great this product works. My lashes are longer, thicker, and darker. After only a short time I can see new lashes growing inbetween several lashes throughout my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients this is made from. It makes me feel confident that I am doing right by my eyes. Going to be using this for a long time</li>
    <li> Well so far so good. I say it this way because I know using this serum isn&#x27;t going to generate results overnight. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for about a week now. I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve had no irritation or problems. The skin area around my eyes tend to be susceptible to irritation and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions. After reading up and researching eye serums, I&#x27;m confident that I will experience a growth in my lashes. The only reason that I&#x27;ve not given a full five stars yet is that I need to give this product more time to show results.</li>
    <li> It HAS worked a little bit.  But you have to use consistently or hair loss starts again.</li>
    <li> got this in today and put some on...i have really thin lashes that you can barely see so i am hoping this helps,,,excited to see!!</li>
    <li> This Mascara is incredible!!! Looks like I have false eye lashes on all day!It&#x27;s Easy to wash off! I will definitely buy this mascara again!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lash and brow serum for about a week now and I can already see a difference in my lashes, My lashes are very short and thin, but I can see that they are starting to fill out a little. With more use I can am sure the results will be dramatic, I will keep using, the directions state that it may take 6 weeks to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the serum is very easy to apply along the lash line. I only applied to my top lashes. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all with the serum and I plan to keep using it to get the best results. I have tried sparingly to my brows simply because I really don&#x27;t want them to get too thick and have to get my brows done again.</li>
    <li> I will admit that I hate putting on any makeup and eye makeup in particular so I am not an expert by any means on this topic, but this seemed to be easy for me to apply compared to just the mascara I usually use from Clinique when I am forced to use something.  I know that I need to learn how to apply it better so I don&#x27;t have to reapply it, but I can&#x27;t see myself using it every day as I should to get the full benefits of the serum.  I&#x27;ve gotten to a point in my life though where I didn&#x27;t think it would ever happen but my eyebrows and lashes are disappearing.  So based on the reviews of the product I thought this would be handy to have to use on those occasions where I do need to look like the southern lady I was brought up to be.</li>
    <li> Before this, I tried a different brand that bothered my lids a little and I saw no results. At least this brand does not smart as much but I have not noticed any difference yet. In the past I used one that requires a Rx and that did work so I know it is possible for me to grow longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my results in a few weeks</li>
    <li> I bought this serum to thicken and strengthen my lashes. I appreciate that it is cruelty free and not tested on animals. I&#x27;m highly sensitive and frequently have reactions to ingredients in products, so the fact that this serum is free of parabens influenced my purchase. I&#x27;ve been applying twice per day and my lashes are visibly thicker and longer after only a week!!</li>
    <li> Great lash serum im seeing results in the past couple days . lashes are coming thicker and fuller. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this was just a hoax but After a couple of weeks I noticed a difference and not just a little difference but a difference that even my friends noticed. A Big Thumbs Up for this product.</li>
    <li> My lashes are fulore and thicker. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. I received this to review.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I used as directed.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Radiant Complex Lash &amp; Brow Serum for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it! To me, my brows seems thicker and healthier and my lashes too! My lashes seem longer, easier to curl and darker. I am going to continue using this daily :)</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and I did not experience any irritation. I am using it for my brows and I have noticed some growth. I have thick eyebrows but I am using this product to fill in spots where I am missing some hair or wish to be more tame. This product should last a couple months as you need a little to get it to work.</li>
    <li> I really like this product I just started using it two days ago so I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference yet. I do love how easy it is to apply and I doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Makes my eyebrows feel healthier!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. You know that it is gong on your lashes/brows because it leaves your lashes damp/glossy. Also, I mostly got this for my eye brows. I apply it first thing in the morning and at night. My eye brows are still a little spotty (missing hairs here and there) I am very happy so far with the product and can&#x27;t wait to see what it is going to do in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other eyelash serums, and I found this one to be fairly on par. I&#x27;m well into my 4th week and have noticed my eyelashes thickening some which I&#x27;m thrilled with, because I wasn&#x27;t blessed with babydoll eyelashes. I wonder how things will look at week 6? A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m excited! The money back guarantee is also awesome! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I never guarantee a positive rating.</li>
