    <li> It is an magic product! When I open the package, the mask immediately started to warm up. And my eyes feel very relaxed and comfortable. Also there is a very light lavender smell, not strong. That is why I love it. I don&#x27;t like a strong smell which may cause headache to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy the same thing at a local japanese store which priced about 21 dollars. The online price 14 is good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> It really relax for my eyes I love it i will buy it again later!</li>
    <li> Very relaxing... I like it !</li>
    <li> I had about 10 sample pieces from a road show. When I was in Singapore and fell in love with the lavendar one immediately! Didnt fancy the rose scented one much. Bought another box while transitting in Japan and finished yday night. On nights when I felt extra tired but find it difficult to fall asleep, or when I had a bad sleep the night before, or just feel I may have a bad sleep due to stress, I&#x27;ll put it on. 9/10 times I sleep within minutes and woke up very rested and relax the next day. I just moved to US and was sad I may not find this product here. So happy now that its on Amazon. Yay!!! - Germaine</li>
    <li> My fiance loves these!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! lavender smell</li>
    <li> It works and heats up as described, and smells good. However, this product does NOT have expiration date on the package. Probably you want to think about it before make an order.</li>
    <li> I love these puppies.  My friend from Japan introduced me to them and I am hooked.  It&#x27;s too warm for california summer nights but I will use them often when it gets cooler.</li>
    <li> Love this so much that I will order boxes of it !!!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. The scent isn&#x27;t over powering. I&#x27;d get again.</li>
    <li> It steams up. I want to recommend this mask to every of my friend. :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years, I love it, it always makes me relax and comfortable and easy to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> the lavender smell is a little too strong for me. it&#x27;s not quite compatible with a good night&#x27;s sleep. i like the scentless ones better.</li>
    <li> Significant improvement of sleep quality and relief of tired eyes. Also perfect for lunch break and it won&#x27;t mess up eye makeups</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent of these eye masks!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to these eye masks! I put one on every night at bedtime and immediately, the warmth and scent of lavender has me drifting off to sleep in minutes! As a bonus, they are so lightweight and comfortable that I wear them all night which blocks out light and helps me sleep all night.</li>
    <li> Keep your eyes warm and very cofortable. Help make sleeping easier at night!</li>
    <li> I just love the lavender smell of the eye mask. But the steam does not last too long, and it sometimes cools down before I fall in asleep.</li>
    <li> They are incredible, but the unscented is better. These smell like a musky incense shop.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time using this product, as everything was what I ever expected. This mask is really comfortable and especially soft on ears ( I have problems with other eye mask products that the straps go around the head make me uncomfortable and I kept tinkling about it presses down my hair and it will look flat). I actually wear this one to sleep at night, it blocks the light, and it is extremely comfortable and the lavender relaxes me. I usually wear it when I am on a flight, the smell comforts me and makes me easier to fall asleep on the plane.</li>
    <li> When using these masks for the first time, I enjoyed the lavender scent, but was shocked by how warm the mask actually warms up! I had eye cream on my eyes and could feel my eye area almost &amp;#34;steaming&amp;#34; and feeling damp from the heat. Besides that, these masks are perfect for headaches and relaxation!</li>
    <li> I love it. Helps me sleep. And the scent is really helpful and smells sooooooo good!!</li>
    <li> Love these for tired eyes!  My eye doctor recommended I use a hot wash cloth to help my eyes - I have dry eyes, but don&#x27;t need prescriptions to help.  She said a hot wash cloth would help stimulate oil glands that will help tears last longer.  When I cannot use a wash cloth (at work, airplane) I use these!  They work very well to relax the eyes and they smell great too - not too strong.  I also use these at bed time or when I want to relax without a wash cloth on my face.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a gift from a friend (re-gifted from a Japanese exchange student). I was excited when I finally found them on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried lavender as well as chamomile and both smell great. These are packages of one time use, warming eye masks. I try not to use them too often but they help me to relax and go to sleep. A real treat if you&#x27;re feeling stressed or when you have a headache.</li>
    <li> I wish the scent is less strong, but overall it feels comfortable and relieving.</li>
    <li> I use the steam mask a lot when I have tons of midterms or finals coming up and feel stressed. It helps reduce the dark cycles and the lavender scent is relaxing. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> works great. relaxed my eyes every time I didn&#x27;t have a good night sleep and made me feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> I probably like the lavender sage scent more so than the yuzu. It is much more relaxing and calming - great if you&#x27;re having trouble sleeping. The orange one seems more rejuvenating, whereas the lavender one seems more functional as a sleep aid.</li>
    <li> Bought these from a different seller and they are amazing, headaches dont last long. My mom then bought these for me as a gift but the ones we recieved were already open and missing three.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent, almost like a scent whisp rather then a strong smell and very soothing.</li>
    <li> Great, calming scent. The warming sensation felt great on the skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> My three daughters and I love this.  Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Love these eye masks! The warmth is very soothing and relaxing and helps me fall asleep at night.</li>
    <li> It helps to reduce dark circle and makes your eyes relaxed. I love the yuzu scent better.</li>
    <li> Scent is too strong. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product! Great to use on the plane or after a hot bath.</li>
    <li> I love it! very comfortable! smells so good!</li>
    <li> love these! I like this better than the other scents. And they really help my headaches</li>
    <li> These masks will change your life.</li>
    <li> Very good product, though i am not a big fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> This steam eye mask is very convenient. open the package, put it on your eyes, and relax for 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;It does not create too much steam so dont worry about your makeup, though I would not recommend using it if you do not use water-proof eye makeup/mascara et al.&lt;br /&gt;One more interesting thing: my boyfriend has allergy, and the other day, he has itchy watery eyes. guess what... some eye drops and this eye mask help him to get some temporary relief.&lt;br /&gt;So I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who need a relaxing 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this has any benefit to the skin around the eyes.</li>
