      <li>It is not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Peppermint Toothpaste, and so I figured I might as well throw in some of this \\&quot;Cool Mountain</li>
      <li>mouthwash tastes good for the entire minute of swishing.</li>
      <li>This is terrific mouth wash at a good price (subscription price).</li>
      <li>product does not seem to be approved from the ADA (American Dental Association), and it does not seem or claim to promote healthy teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth need calcium and fluoride to stay clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>No bad aftertaste or texture and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t be buying any Tom&#x27;s products in the future, you can be sure of that!</li>
      <li>Fresh Breath  </li>
      <li>The Wicked Fresh mouthwash leaves the nastiest aftertaste that you can never get rid of.</li>
      <li>Husband and I agree that it leaves your mouth feeling chalky and does NOT taste wicked fresh.</li>
      <li>I like that it is natural and healthy.</li>
      <li>it tasted like minty fresh gravy.  </li>
      <li>My mom raised me on their fennel toothpaste and still makes me smile, to this day.</li>
      <li>my mouth taste wicked fresh after gargling and rinsing with this product?</li>
      <li>fresh &amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s knows how to do it right.  </li>
      <li>and I actually find this product does a better job than the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Leaves funny after taste.  </li>
      <li>then the combination is pretty terrible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great tasting mouthwash and all natural, buy in bulk and save a few $$</li>
      <li>Good taste, refreshing and no alcohol or weird additives.  </li>
      <li>Gotta go, the monkey wants more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Please e-mail and post comments on Tom&#x27;s website letting them know that we want the truly natural, whole earth, environmentally friendly, and chemical free products back!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I used the older stuff and it left my mouth refreshed and clean, the new stuff leaves a sticky residue and overly sweet sensation on the gums.  </li>
      <li>no one wants it.</li>
      <li>I feel like my breath is fresher and my whole mouth just feels much cleaner longer.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think that I was picky about mouthwash</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s products are excellent and we like that they are all natural, without dyes and artificial flavors.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>But irrespective of many of these chemicals being naturally derived, Tom&#x27;s products now contain a chemical cocktail just like all the other hygiene products out there.</li>
      <li>Be sure you don&#x27;t swallow this mouthwash - especially, on an empty stomach.</li>
      <li>for a quick scan of who I am; I&#x27;m sixteen years old and Russian.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need the fluoride or any of those other additives, since brushing and flossing is what&#x27;s important to oral health.</li>
      <li>For the life of me, I can&#x27;t understand why Tom&#x27;s discontinued the old baking soda mouthwash!</li>
      <li>The previous formula was fine.  </li>
      <li>The other reviewer said it tastes like liquid gravy, which is funny, yet pretty close.</li>
      <li>I have bottles of the old and new product and upon comparing the ingredient list find that the organic products have vanished and been replaced with a couple of new chemical</li>
      <li>I have a monkey on my back and it wants Tom&#x27;s Wicked Fresh Mouth</li>
      <li>I got one of Tom&#x27;s other fresheners, but it is syrupy sweet.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much, this past order is my third</li>
      <li>The wicked fresh formula isn&#x27;t as bad as Scope or Listerine, especially as studies show greatly increased risk of oral cancer from the alcohol in both.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ingredients (in order): water, glycerin, sorbitol, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, propanediol, xylitol, natural flavor, benzoic acid, zinc chloride, menthol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>natural mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is about as natural as you&#x27;ll find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> had a nice bottle of this, then bought six from Amazon and the batch (or a different formula) was horrible. Unusable, super-astringent. Use baking soda and peppermint oil and make your own.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash.  I have sensitive teeth due to my gums receding, and this mouthwash actually helps to heal my gums.  On top of that, it has a nice taste that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a cleanser to help advance my hygiene - it is tic taks on steroids.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much, this past order is my third and I&#x27;ll keep buying it 6 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint. Hate &amp;#34;Wicked fresh &amp;#34;. Husband and I agree that it leaves your mouth feeling chalky and does NOT taste wicked fresh. Annoying that Amazon cannot keep Peppermint in stock but always has this. Um, Amazon, you can&#x27;t sell this be ause no one wants it. We want peppermint!!!</li>
    <li> I like Tom&#x27;s.  I tried it when it was on sale at the drug store.  I have now purchased it through Amazon.com.  It has a bite to assure me it is working. :D  It is not too sweet.  I got one of Tom&#x27;s other fresheners, but it is syrupy sweet.  I like that it is natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used the Natural product from Tom&#x27;s for a while and loved it.  I trusted Tom&#x27;s products and so when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual Natural mouthwash product I bought the new \\&quot;Wicked Fresh\\&quot; assuming that it would be great.  Wrong!  I really didn&#x27;t think that I was picky about mouthwash but this was awful - it tasted like minty fresh gravy.  I gaged but still not convinced - it had to be me.  So I tried it a few more times with the same result. Ultimately I just had to pour it down the drain.</li>
    <li> Why would they change a product that was just fine.  So many times companies change their product and ruin it.  It has happened again.  Will never buy this garbage again.  Disgusting taste, does nothing to freshen your breathe, utterly useless.  COMPLETE RIPOFF.  The previous formula was fine.  Don&#x27;t know why you would do this Tommy my friend!!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s has made good stuff for years and will always impress. Try out the toothpaste also. Everything made in maine is good.</li>
    <li> I like this flavor.  Not too strong, but still refreshing.</li>
    <li> Did you know that in the US, there is no legal definition for natural?  You can put the word natural on anything you want.  That is what is happening to Tom&#x27;s.  Since their buyout by Colgate, the quality has taken a dramatic plunge.  I have bottles of the old and new product and upon comparing the ingredient list find that the organic products have vanished and been replaced with a couple of new chemical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the flavor is awful.  I used the older stuff and it left my mouth refreshed and clean, the new stuff leaves a sticky residue and overly sweet sensation on the gums.  If you rinse with mouthwash before brushing (you should) then the combination is pretty terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please e-mail and post comments on Tom&#x27;s website letting them know that we want the truly natural, whole earth, environmentally friendly, and chemical free products back!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s may not burn, fizz or perform other pyrotechnics, but it has the right things in it to help you keep your teeth while being smoochable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A kindly dentist taught me that xylitol is not just to make the product taste sweeter, it is a sweetener that deters cavity formation. The glycerol tends to make you salivate -- less dry mouth means happier gums. Alcohol has been linked to an increase in mouth cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying 6 more bottles.</li>
    <li> Product arrives as promised. Tastes great! Made in USA</li>
    <li> I love this product! The flavor is nice and mild. It keeps my breath fresh  for longer than any other mouth wash. I&#x27;m mostly attracted to it because of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could. \\&quot;Peppermint wave\\&quot; is misleading since there is no peppermint in this product at all. The other reviewer said it tastes like liquid gravy, which is funny, yet pretty close. It tastes putrid and does not freshen up the taste in your mouth. I tried adding a few drops of peppermint essential oil to it hoping to improve the flavor, but still ended up pouring it down the drain.</li>
    <li> I had used up my bottle of Dr. Ken&#x27;s relatively more expensive mouth wash and was on the hunt for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this up at a recent trip to the drug store. I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s of Maine products (toothpastes) before and loved it. This was a lot cheaper than Dr. Ken&#x27;s mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not containing alcohol doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it won&#x27;t dry your mouth. Case in point, this mouthwash, dried my mouth. Using it before bed, I woke up with an icky mouth feeling I only get when I forget to brush my teeth at night- feels as if i had not brushed/ rinsed my teeth the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that Colgate bought out Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> We all use this mouthwash at our house.  It is mild flavored, effective and doesn&#x27;t burn the gums and tongue.  Tom&#x27;s products are excellent and we like that they are all natural, without dyes and artificial flavors.</li>
    <li> It has a very mild flavor. No burn not horrible after taste much better than I though it would be.</li>
    <li> This is the most refreshing mouth wash! It has no sting, no unnecessary dye or syrup feeling like traditional washes.&lt;br /&gt;I can never go back since trying this! I feel like my breath is fresher and my whole mouth just feels much cleaner longer. Great value online, can&#x27;t beat the price in stores.</li>
    <li> Great fluoride-free mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Super mouth watering fresh and after brushing and flossing this just feels awesome.  Tom&#x27;s knows how to do it right.  No alcohol so your mouth doesn&#x27;t feel weird, just feels naturally refreshed and ready to go.</li>
    <li> If you like Tom&#x27;s mouthwas (I do) this product is going to surprise you.  It contains a zinc compound that leaves a metalic flavor in your mouth for hours after you used it.  I used it at 7 this morning and I still have this astringent metalic feel and taste (it is now 11:45).</li>
    <li> The Wicked Fresh mouthwash leaves the nastiest aftertaste that you can never get rid of. It tastes like the cough syrup from hell. For the life of me, I can&#x27;t understand why Tom&#x27;s discontinued the old baking soda mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I was saddened to see that so many people were disappointed with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long Lasting Wicked Fresh Cool Mountain Mint Mouthwash. My early recollections of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products take me back to the early 1980s, in my formative years. My mom raised me on their fennel toothpaste and still makes me smile, to this day. What makes this mouthwash so invigorating? Natural mint and zinc compounds - hence, the reason some complained of a slightly \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; aftertaste that lingers long after your initial one minute gargle session.  Zinc is great for killing swelling and sore throats, which I recall gargling with whenever I got sick. Be sure you don&#x27;t swallow this mouthwash - especially, on an empty stomach. Zinc is commonly known to cause upset stomachs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does my mouth taste wicked fresh after gargling and rinsing with this product? More fresh, than wickedly so.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the previous reviews, seems like a rival company is a little jealous that this brand holds the title of #1 natural mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash tastes good for the entire minute of swishing. No bad aftertaste or texture and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
    <li> Seems to help with bad breath.</li>
    <li> Blech.  Leaves funny after taste.  Why did I buy 6???</li>
    <li> Tried this and it definitely has synthetic sweeteners in it. Odd taste. Going back to Desert Essence mouthwash.</li>
    <li> definitely does the trick! Love that it does not contain alcohol or harmful ingredients. tastes great and leaves a great minty feel!</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6 bottle pack. This is my favorite and this is a great price. After becoming accustomed to this, I cannot stand the alcohol infused stuff....hate the burn. Don&#x27;t need the fluoride or any of those other additives, since brushing and flossing is what&#x27;s important to oral health. This is all natural, tastes great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. comes in pack 0f 6 and size of bottle works perfectly to take as travel mouthwash with the 16oz size. Also leaves nice fresh breath without the run of the chemical mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is about as natural as you&#x27;ll find. It has a pleasant taste and is surprisingly effective. Like others, I do miss the sting of regular mouthwash, but not the bright green color or terrible ingredients. Price was excellent when I ordered and I actually find this product does a better job than the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing--not what one would expect.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is a lot milder tasting than a lot on the market but the only one that does not give me a gluten reaction.</li>
    <li> The only way to describe this mouthwash is HORRIBLE!  If you don&#x27;t have dry mouth to start with you will after using this product only once.  Very disappointed!  I am a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine and feel that a lot of their products are great, but this mouthwash is just plain AWFUL!  The taste is tolerable but the way your mouth feels during and after use is extremely dry gritty and plain uncomfortable.  I would not suggest this for anyone!  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I started using this product 4 or 5 months ago..it leaves a refreshing mint feeling inside the mouth.Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is terrific mouth wash at a good price (subscription price). No crazy chemicals and tastes good. Does the trick without tasting awful and like chemicals.</li>
    <li> Indeed the mad scientists at Palmolive have been busy adding franken-ingredients to Toms product since they bough it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name  Purpose  Source&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water  Consistency  Maine aquifer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin  Skin moisturizing  Vegetable oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitol  Moistener  Corn (Zea mays)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis&lt;br /&gt;leaf juice (Organic)  Soothing feel  Organic aloe (Aloe barbadensis) plant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;propanediol (vegetable derived)  Consistency  Corn (Zea Mays)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol  Flavor  Birch trees or corn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Flavor  Flavor  Natural oils derived from the leaves of mint and other aromatic plants&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzoic acid (natural)  Preservative  Apples or Cinnamon leaf/bark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc chloride  Fresh Breath  Derived from purified zinc from the earth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menthol  Flavor  Brazilian cornmint (Mentha arvensis) oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And looking at their other baking soda mouthwash variety, it now has POLOXAMER 335, derived from oil and natural gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERDICT: The wicked fresh formula isn&#x27;t as bad as Scope or Listerine, especially as studies show greatly increased risk of oral cancer from the alcohol in both. But irrespective of many of these chemicals being naturally derived, Tom&#x27;s products now contain a chemical cocktail just like all the other hygiene products out there.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is the best mouth wash.</li>
    <li> Great alternative if you need an alcohol-free mouthwash. Pleasant flavor. Minimal longevity, but it&#x27;s much more palatable than some of the store brand options. This mint flavor is the most authentic I&#x27;ve tried of the major brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Peppermint Toothpaste, and so I figured I might as well throw in some of this \\&quot;Cool Mountain Mint\\&quot; mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Just for a quick scan of who I am; I&#x27;m sixteen years old and Russian. That&#x27;s just to relate/compare with others, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets go over what the bottle claims:&lt;br /&gt;1.) helps stop bad breath - It did this a bit, I asked my sister what my breath smelled like a few hours after rinsing with this mouthwash and she claimed it smelled like mint. The first time I used this product was at night, so when I woke up, I was surprised to notice I had minimal morning breath than usual. I&#x27;ve been using this product two times (day and night) a day for about a week and this same effect hadn&#x27;t happened again, sadly. Breath still smells the same.&lt;br /&gt;2.) no burn - I have to disagree. While rinsing with this product, I notice a burning sensation on the insides of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;3.) long-lasting - It lasts maybe a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;4.) natural - We&#x27;ll go over that in the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;5.) great taste - Ugh, no. You&#x27;re left with the taste of metal in your mouth due to the zinc chloride, and it doesn&#x27;t taste too minty at all. I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying it&#x27;s like a gravy, that I can&#x27;t agree with. The taste is overall not that great, but I could bear with it. Smells unpleasant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (in order): water, glycerin, sorbitol, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, propanediol, xylitol, natural flavor, benzoic acid, zinc chloride, menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine claims that they list every ingredient and the purpose on their website. This is quite the lie, as they don&#x27;t even mention propandediol. \\&quot;Propanediol can be formulated into a variety of industrial products including composites, adhesives, laminates, coatings, moldings, aliphatic polyesters, copolyesters. It is also a solvent and used as an antifreeze and wood paint.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not seem to be approved from the ADA (American Dental Association), and it does not seem or claim to promote healthy teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth need calcium and fluoride to stay clean and healthy. This mouthwash provides neither of those two ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, who designed this idiotic cap? It&#x27;s the most ridiculous and frustrating thing to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to waste product, so I&#x27;ll just use this until it wears out (and maybe pour it bit by bit down the drain), and never ever buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great tasting mouthwash and all natural, buy in bulk and save a few $$</li>
    <li> I used the peppermint flavor for many years, which was quite pleasant.  It seems to have been discontinued, so I tried the closest-sounding flavor I could find on Amazon, this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed.  The flavor is very unpleasant, and it feels like it is burning my mouth, leaving it feeling rough and uncomfortable, not clean and fresh like the old flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a dilemma... do I suffer through all six bottles in the pack, or toss it and find something else?  I hate to waste products, but I&#x27;m not sure I can suffer through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying any Tom&#x27;s products in the future, you can be sure of that!</li>
