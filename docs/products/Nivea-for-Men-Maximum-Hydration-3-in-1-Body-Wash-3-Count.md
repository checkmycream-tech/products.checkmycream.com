      <li>Since he was so enthusiastic about Nivea Men, I decided to try it myself and also loved it.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I would eventually perfect the right amount per serving, as it were, but for now it seems wasteful.</li>
      <li>However, this product is very good, and I like this fragrance over the more soapy cleansers that are available.</li>
      <li>However, it is also a really nice body wash.</li>
      <li>Nice body wash for men (or women).  </li>
      <li>great job of getting you clean.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it lathers up richly and has a pleasant</li>
      <li>Fresh smell, great consistency, and two shots did the job.</li>
      <li>I liked the feeling that it was still cleansing and refreshing</li>
      <li>The scent is gender-neutral and smells really good &amp; clean.  </li>
      <li>but it has significantly more ingredients for hydrating your skin ... making it ideal for someone like me who wants to use body wash to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good clean feeling with no sticky residue.</li>
      <li>The scent is okay but definetly not my favorite.</li>
      <li>and I feel that the consumer will be using more body wash per shower, thus buying more.</li>
      <li>I love Nivea lotion anyway</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I typically love Nivea products.</li>
      <li>nothing more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the equivalency in bars of soap would be, but it seems to me that I get more use out of a bar of soap</li>
      <li>It cleans better than any body wash or shampoo I have had my husband use.</li>
      <li>think that if you enter into this product thinking of it strictly as a body wash, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and easy to rinse.</li>
      <li>For the record, LOVE Nivea&#x27;s original skin cream and have used a variety of their products over the years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the product cleanses well and has a light fresh/clean scent, which is very nice because it&#x27;s powerful enough to make one smell good</li>
      <li>soap lathers well and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>some men&#x27;s body washes is when they leave a strong cologne scent afterwards.</li>
      <li>With a not-so-overpowering scent and decent lathering, this is a good option for a body wash.</li>
      <li>but it is a fine body wash.</li>
      <li>soap is just so much more efficient when it comes to a quick shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He was pleased with the way it lathers and how refreshed his skin felt after the very first usage.  </li>
      <li>That one is available on Amazon as well.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and pleasing, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by this 3-in-1 claim.</li>
      <li>It leaves you with a distinct moisturing feel, but I&#x27;ve used some moisturing products that are geared toward women that have a more lingering and stronger moisturizing sensation.</li>
      <li>I am perplexed by the hydration claims ...</li>
      <li>It has such a great manly smell to it.</li>
      <li>Again, it&#x27;s not a bad scent at all, nor is it strong, but it does linger for some time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one that has used bar soap (all varieties) for the past twenty years and was impressed that the aloe in this body wash does in fact sooth the skin without drying it out.</li>
      <li>I still feel clean, though.</li>
      <li>Provides a great cleansing affect that doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
      <li>A bottle reminds you of an oil can a bit for extra manliness, but let&#x27;s be honest, as with most body washes, it can be used by women and kids as well.</li>
      <li>It rinses off cleanly and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>This body wash leaves my skin feeling clean and</li>
      <li>3-in-1: Shower, Shave and Shampoo, but instead this is 3-in-1: Clean. Hydrate.</li>
      <li>Scientific proof not withstanding, Nivea&#x27;s body wash cleans all the right spots (pun intended).It has a nice spicy/citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>Basically it is very convenient to use one body wash from top to bottom to clean everything.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
      <li>On the front of this product, it has the words “Maximum hydration” which my husband claims to be true.  </li>
      <li>This smells pretty strong.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, fresh fragrance that reminds me of products used at my barber shop.</li>
      <li>Many years ago, I had a friend who&#x27;s mother use to have numerous magazines around her living room, many with cologne and perfume samples in them.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re as particular as me, I doubt most people would be bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though it is labeled &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; the scent is fairly mild.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad they make this because I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a mild soap.</li>
      <li>Not a bad scent by any means, just memorable... and apparently pretty unique, since I thought of that living room for the first time in twenty years when I opened the Nivea body wash for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I liked this wash and the smell.</li>
      <li>He used this one last night and really liked it.</li>
      <li>It was a joke on his part but definitely showed how much he liked it.  </li>
      <li>starters, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s economical.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and refreshing, it lathers well enough, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any sort of noticeable residue.</li>
      <li>Compared to other brands’ mens body wash, it is definitely more moisturizing on my skin and have to shower felt good and soft.</li>
      <li>It definitely does refresh you with a very clean and light scent, so it does the job.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t get excited about shampoos, body washes, etc.</li>
      <li>The size is just right for the gym bag.</li>
      <li>This has a neutral scent that I like - not strong at all; in fact, I would have liked a more recognizable scent.</li>
      <li>Overall, it feels good, smells nice, and is convenient, but I wish the scent lasted little bit longer.</li>
      <li>It takes just a little to get good lather.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re OK with buying a 3-in-1 product that is only really a 1-in-1 product, then this is worth trying.</li>
      <li>I was a bit worries when I first got this.</li>
      <li>I know we will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use shampoo on account of being bald, but this worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>It does not leave any sort of film or sticky coating, and rinses off pretty well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does work at cleaning just as well, getting off motor oil from my hands, which would normally take a bit more work with my old Dove</li>
      <li>This is my first body wash...</li>
      <li>It has a light and masculine scent, almost like a cologne, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that the scent is not too strong, but when I finished drying myself, I could barely smell the scent.</li>
      <li>such a large bottle, I would have preferred a pump over a flip top squeeze.</li>
      <li>But Nivea does make a multi-purpose product for men if you are interested in a real multi-purpose product.</li>
      <li>I started using body wash instead of shaving cream to shave in the shower, but the problem with that is that most body washes dry your skin</li>
      <li>I understand that this is better for avoiding dry skin, it is still a bit of a nuisance to feel as if I&#x27;ve never fully rinsed the product off my skin.</li>
      <li>The product does seem to own up to its selling point which I appreciate, however as all body washes, they are more expensive than a bar of soap</li>
      <li>The creams, lotions, and body washes are very moisturizing and nourishing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Once in a while I try different body washes for my husband. He used this one last night and really liked it. Men don&#x27;t usually care about hydrating, but no one likes their skin feeling tough, dry, or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about some men&#x27;s body washes is when they leave a strong cologne scent afterwards. This wash is not like that. It leaves just a very faint scent, and it smells more like a fresh, clean scent, nothing heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, we both like this one. Nivea in general does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Scientific proof not withstanding, Nivea&#x27;s body wash cleans all the right spots (pun intended).It has a nice spicy/citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and moisturizes very well. I&#x27;ve been using this now for over a week, and noticed my skin is less dry. Anyone that has ever lived in the high desert, knows that dry skin is par for the course, however with using Nivea&#x27;s a moisture body wash and and additional body lotion helps to keep the dry skin at bay. The description states it&#x27;s Dermatologically tested, but it doesn&#x27;t mention if it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, so if you have sensitive skin, test on a small area before using on your entire body.</li>
    <li> I got this soap for my husband. He&#x27;s an instant fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mild soap. The fragrance is light and pleasing, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband tends have problems with dry skin during the cooler weather. Twenty-four hours after showering with this soap, he tells me his skin still feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers well and rinses off easily. While it leaves the skin soft, there is no residual oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I was a little confused when this arrived. I thought 3-in-1 meant this product  would serve as a multi-purpose shampoo-conditioner-bodywash like many other products that tout 3-in-1 capabilities. In this case, 3-in-1 means it cleanses, hydrates, and refreshes...thus this product is meant only as a body wash, and not as a shampoo or anything else. Cleanses, hydrates, and refreshes, don&#x27;t we expect that from our regular body washes already? The use of 3-in-1 here is a bit of a stretch for me. Minus one star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such a large bottle, I would have preferred a pump over a flip top squeeze. Minus one star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product cleanses well and has a light fresh/clean scent, which is very nice because it&#x27;s powerful enough to make one smell good but it does not assault your senses with overpowering fragrance like some other brands of products for men do. I suppose my skin feels less dry after use. But that is definitely marginal and perhaps even imagined based of my expectation of the product. Whether it provides any moisturizing benefits or not, it definitely does not moisturize enough to bypass the extra step of putting on lotion afterwards. But I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It&#x27;s a good body wash. No stars deducted here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re OK with buying a 3-in-1 product that is only really a 1-in-1 product, then this is worth trying. But Nivea does make a multi-purpose product for men if you are interested in a real multi-purpose product. That one is available on Amazon as well. This product did not win me over as a 3-in-1 but it is a fine body wash. Nivea makes good products and you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this if you know before hand that you are just buying a bottle of body wash.</li>
    <li> Creamy, soft lather, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you put on perfume!!  The smell is unisex, the lather is great. It takes just a little to get good lather. No stripped skin, you feel soft and hydrated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be marketed to men but this is a product both of us can use happily. I love Nivea lotion anyway and I&#x27;m glad they make this because I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Nivea for men is a 3-in-1 body wash.  Do not get it confused with other similar 3-in-1 products as I originally thought this was 3-in-1: Shower, Shave and Shampoo, but instead this is 3-in-1: Clean. Hydrate. Refresh.  It definitely does refresh you with a very clean and light scent, so it does the job.  It is milky white in color and creates a moderate lather.  A bottle reminds you of an oil can a bit for extra manliness, but let&#x27;s be honest, as with most body washes, it can be used by women and kids as well.</li>
    <li> This has a neutral scent that I like - not strong at all; in fact, I would have liked a more recognizable scent. But given the choice, less is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t lather up as much I like - I still feel clean, though. It does not leave any sort of film or sticky coating, and rinses off pretty well. Still other reviews say it DOES lather up a lot, so I guess my preference is outside the mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel refreshed or anything. And I&#x27;m not sure my skin feels moist or not. That takes longer-term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use shampoo on account of being bald, but this worked pretty well. Good clean feeling with no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I typically love Nivea products. The creams, lotions, and body washes are very moisturizing and nourishing. The scent is okay but definetly not my favorite. My biggest gripe was about the residue. It left some residue after rinsing it all off and that made me subtract a star. I wish we could give half stars because this is on the fence between 3.5 and 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Have been a life long soap lover.  Ivory actually, but was eager to try Nivea&#x27;s Maximum Hydration Bodywash because I am very dry indeed.  Used in the shower with a microfiber towel.  Poured wash into towel, and it lathered some, but not all that much.  Pleasant fragrance and found the formula non irritating (have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as \\&quot;maximum hydration\\&quot; goes, can&#x27;t say my skin was any softer or more moisturized than compared to using soap and then lotion all over afterwards, as is my usual routine.  In fact, after showering with this body wash, applied lotion all over, and could discern no difference whatsoever.  For the record, LOVE Nivea&#x27;s original skin cream and have used a variety of their products over the years.  This one though did not wow me.  Not even a bit.</li>
    <li> Provides a great cleansing affect that doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. I&#x27;m one that has used bar soap (all varieties) for the past twenty years and was impressed that the aloe in this body wash does in fact sooth the skin without drying it out. The product does seem to own up to its selling point which I appreciate, however as all body washes, they are more expensive than a bar of soap and I feel that the consumer will be using more body wash per shower, thus buying more. However that is the life of using a body wash. Overall it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bar soap person, but my son and I gave this product a try over the last weeks. I like it well enough, although I&#x27;m not crazy about it by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s economical. I don&#x27;t know what the equivalency in bars of soap would be, but it seems to me that I get more use out of a bar of soap then I do out of an imperfect squeeze or two from this bottle. Yes, I would eventually perfect the right amount per serving, as it were, but for now it seems wasteful. Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t rinse as clean as I prefer, which again is a product of my lifelong preference for bar soaps, which usually rinse pretty clean (unless you are using some beauty bar with a lot of moisturizers). I understand that this is better for avoiding dry skin, it is still a bit of a nuisance to feel as if I&#x27;ve never fully rinsed the product off my skin. This is something that I&#x27;d probably never get used to. On the plus side, it lathers up richly and has a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: the price and the personal issues would prevent me from buying this instead of bar soap. If you are a fan of body washes, I think this will be a good product to try. But if you are considering moving from bar soap to body wash, like I was, then you may not be happy with the end results. Personal preference makes the difference, and for me, I&#x27;ll return to my bars of soap when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> With a not-so-overpowering scent and decent lathering, this is a good option for a body wash. However, the potentially misleading &amp;#34;3 in 1&amp;#34; designation (just a body wash with three difficult-to-prove claims than a shampoo-conditioner-wash as competitors advertise) and questionable price point makes this less compelling. Nivea products, in general, have never disappointed - especially the Sensitive line; this one wont disappoint you either, but know what you are buying - it is a body-wash. nothing more. nothing less.</li>
    <li> Winter is coming and forced air heat and electric blankets tend to dry my skin, so a hydrating body wash is welcome. I like the smell, and that as advertised it does not feel greasy. After I&#x27;ve used it the scent that remains on my skin becomes very faint, almost to the point of becoming unnoticeable, and what scent there is does not smell like soap. This body wash leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container has a flip-top cap and this product is made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> I used it at the gym yesterday. I love it. Fresh smell, great consistency, and two shots did the job. I&#x27;ll buy it again. The size is just right for the gym bag.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Nivea Men&#x27;s 3 in 1 wash. It has such a great manly smell to it. It cleans better than any body wash or shampoo I have had my husband use. Definitely switching to this for all the time.</li>
    <li> This is my first body wash... I&#x27;ve been using the same bar soap (Dove unscented) for over 25 years. A few months ago I noticed my skin had been getting too dry and I found myself itching a lot. My wife had picked up a moisturizing bar for me, which I can&#x27;t remember the name of, but it barely worked, was expensive, and lasted only a few days. I gave Nivea body wash a try just recently..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day, I was wishing there were instructions for this... the stuff didn&#x27;t seem to want to rinse off, leaving a soapy film on my skin. Being new to this type of soap, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was suppose to be that way, so I spent an extra 10-minutes washing the slick film off me. Over then next 24 hours, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all, so after thinking about it a bit, I decided not  to work so hard to rinse off the body wash. The second day, quite frankly, was rather unpleasant... stepping out of the shower feeling like I had skipped rinsing off entirely. The filmy feeling was gone after drying off. Over then next day, I noticed a considerable difference as my skin didn&#x27;t feel as dry, barely itching. Since then, I&#x27;ve been following the same procedure and found that as a moisturizer, it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work at cleaning just as well, getting off motor oil from my hands, which would normally take a bit more work with my old Dove bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, but not as well as my Dove bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the scent... there&#x27;s no mention of the name of the scent for this body wash, but oddly I can place where I&#x27;ve smelled it before. Many years ago, I had a friend who&#x27;s mother use to have numerous magazines around her living room, many with cologne and perfume samples in them. I remember the living room vividly as it always smelled like a mixture of all the samples together. Not a bad scent by any means, just memorable... and apparently pretty unique, since I thought of that living room for the first time in twenty years when I opened the Nivea body wash for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a big fan of the scent, as I prefer more subtle scents from my soap. Again, it&#x27;s not a bad scent at all, nor is it strong, but it does linger for some time. Unless you&#x27;re as particular as me, I doubt most people would be bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have to say I find soap far easier and quicker then body wash, which is probably my biggest complaint about this stuff... I can&#x27;t hold the bottle in my hand the entire time, so picking it up and putting it down over and over gets irritating... soap is just so much more efficient when it comes to a quick shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it cleans well, and has been a huge help to my dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle when this one runs out. It&#x27;ll depend on whether I get use to stepping out of the shower feeling like I forgot to rinse off, and how long this bottle lasts compared to my Dove bars. I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple of weeks...</li>
    <li> Overall this is a perfectly fine body wash -- certainly no worse than the many other body washes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the claim of providing \\&quot;maximum hydration,\\&quot; its moisturizing abilities seem no better than other bar and liquid soaps that don&#x27;t make such bold claims. So yes, that&#x27;s all marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is that generic \\&quot;sport\\&quot; male deodorant scent.</li>
    <li> great,leaves skin feeling great</li>
    <li> Excellent, refreshing in the shower!</li>
    <li> Nice body wash for men (or women).  The scent is gender-neutral and smells really good &amp; clean.  It lathers well and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after drying off, nor does it feel sticky or greasy.  Great wash for fall/winter with the heat drying us all out!</li>
    <li> On the front of this product, it has the words “Maximum hydration” which my husband claims to be true.  He was pleased with the way it lathers and how refreshed his skin felt after the very first usage.  He has problems with dry skin that eventually causes him to have a skin rash and this product has made a big difference as far as this problem.  Since he was so enthusiastic about Nivea Men, I decided to try it myself and also loved it.  I liked the feeling that it was still cleansing and refreshing once I was out of the shower.  When I went to use it again, I discovered my husband had hidden it from me which I can understand since it is a men’s product.  It was a joke on his part but definitely showed how much he liked it.  I know we will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t get excited about shampoos, body washes, etc. That being said, I really like this body wash. It has a light and masculine scent, almost like a cologne, but not overpowering. Lather is great. As I get older and have developed occasional bouts of dry skin, I have learned to appreciate products that help keep my skin hydrated. This body wash does just that. I would definitely buy and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I started shaving during my morning shower (while I&#x27;m still in the shower) rather than shaving before or after my shower. The biggest problem I ran into was dealing with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most shaving creams don&#x27;t respond well in a shot shower and either wash off before you&#x27;ve finished the shave or just short of fall off your face because of the humidity in the shower. I started using body wash instead of shaving cream to shave in the shower, but the problem with that is that most body washes dry your skin and I was left with very, VERY dry skin after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try out Nivea for Men Maximum Hydration 3-in-1 Body Wash because the &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34; part of the name made me think it might be just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, it was. This body wash works just like any other body wash / liquid soap but it has significantly more ingredients for hydrating your skin ... making it ideal for someone like me who wants to use body wash to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I switched to this body wash I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is much smoother and my skin is softer after each shave ... a big difference from the dry, flaky skin I had after shaving with regular body wash.</li>
    <li> I have mildly dry skin. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of a body wash, but after using it for a few days my skin did show some improvement and so I am impressed. Even though it is labeled &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; the scent is fairly mild. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash, it has a clean subtle scent and leaves you feeling clean and not smelling like a girl. Moisturizes the skin and helps with the itchy skin I get as the weather turns colder.</li>
    <li> This is very good body wash made for men. It has a great smell that isn&#x27;t to overpowering. The smell also isn&#x27;t too fruity or flowery. It smells like it was made for men and it was. The wash lathers very well and does s great job of getting you clean. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin like some soaps do. Overall I liked this wash and the smell.</li>
    <li> As the name indicates, this is a product geared for men. The fragrance reminds me of an unnammed moisturizing after shave cream I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is a clean, fresh fragrance that reminds me of products used at my barber shop. The product performs extremely well as a body wash. It rinses off cleanly and does not leave a greasy feeling. It leaves you with a distinct moisturing feel, but I&#x27;ve used some moisturing products that are geared toward women that have a more lingering and stronger moisturizing sensation. However, this product is very good, and I like this fragrance over the more soapy cleansers that are available.</li>
    <li> This smells pretty strong. I was a bit worries when I first got this. But the result is very good. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and easy to rinse. It&#x27;s a bit bottle that should last a while. Between this and the Old Spice 3-in1, B00186GGK8, they are pretty similar. The convenience of 3-in-1 when one travels is hard to beat, and both of them tend smell like a night out, instead of morning work routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hydration, it indeed doesn&#x27;t feel dry, but I would still use lotion.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by this 3-in-1 claim. Basically, this is a body wash ... pure and simple. However, it is also a really nice body wash. The scent is light and refreshing, it lathers well enough, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any sort of noticeable residue. My skin was left soft, but not sticky or slick. I am perplexed by the hydration claims ... maybe because I often use a moisturizer, my idea of hydration is slightly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the design of this bottle was &amp;#34;upside-down.&amp;#34; Especially with a body wash, one often has to leave the bottle upside-down in the shower anyway (or be wasteful and toss it too soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you enter into this product thinking of it strictly as a body wash, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> This body wash has minimum to medium strength scent and left my skin feeling a little less moisturized than other moisturizing body washes. I like the fact that the scent is not too strong, but when I finished drying myself, I could barely smell the scent. This scent is semi-similar to Old Spice&#x27;s men&#x27;s body wash, but it is slightly soft. It also worked well on my short hair as a shampoo and a conditioner. Basically it is very convenient to use one body wash from top to bottom to clean everything. Compared to other brands’ mens body wash, it is definitely more moisturizing on my skin and have to shower felt good and soft. Overall, it feels good, smells nice, and is convenient, but I wish the scent lasted little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Very good product,&lt;br /&gt;about the only bad thing would be the size..about a pound!&lt;br /&gt;Almost too heavy to keep in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;But a good body wash.</li>
    <li> My son and I both have used this, and both like it.  The scent is subtle and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it turns out that &amp;#34;Intensively Moisturizes&amp;#34;, as it says on the bottle, means &amp;#34;leaving a layer of moisturizer on your skin that makes you think you haven&#x27;t completely rinsed yet&amp;#34;.  Now that I realize that&#x27;s a feature and not a flaw, I can accept it and move on.  But if you like to wash with something that feels like it has rinsed off when you are finished, you might be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like using this product.  I shave in the shower, so it&#x27;s &amp;#34;3 in 1&amp;#34; property works for me.  It seems like they are always out of stock at the stores in my town, so I am very happy Amazon carries this product.</li>
