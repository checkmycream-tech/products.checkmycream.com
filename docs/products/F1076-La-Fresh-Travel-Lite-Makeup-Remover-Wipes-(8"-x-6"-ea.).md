      <li>These are like a moist cloth, nothing more.  </li>
      <li>We have a boutique hotel and the longer rectangular size worked better in how we displayed the product for our guests.</li>
      <li>And better than the others.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient and great at removing even waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>Those do remove eye makeup beautifully, much better than Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>The cheap drugstore Neutrogena makeup remover wipes work much better than these.   </li>
      <li>First used these while staying at a hotel on a family vacation and got as many as we could from the cleaning lady!.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the effectiveness of the wipe I used that the hotel provided, which had the exact same label.</li>

      <li>However I also ordered some samples of the La Fresh Waterproof makeup remover wipes.  </li>
      <li>La Fresh Makeup Remover.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used LA Fresh Makeup Remover Wipes for quite some time since being introduced to them as a &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; on one of my motel stays.  </li>
      <li>Buy the La Fresh Waterproof makeup remover wipes instead if you wear mascara or eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Another bonus is that LA Fresh contains vitamin E.  </li>
      <li>When staying at a motel I received them everyday and really liked them, they clean your makeup and mascara and do not leave your face sticky !</li>
      <li>I first used La Fresh towel wipes while on vacation.  </li>
      <li>When these are gone I will definitely purchase more.</li>
      <li>The ones I used in the hotel at Embassy suites were in a different wrapper and were much better.</li>
      <li>Although the wipes can be pretty pricey, there were a &amp;#34;steal&amp;#34; at your price for 200 packets.  </li>
      <li>I have used these wipes for several years and have always been pleased with the way they removed my makeup and how they made my face feel after using.  </li>
      <li>Europe typically doesn&#x27;t have wash cloths so these are a great substitute for traditional make-up remover potions.  </li>
      <li>They removed my eyemakeup very well as well as face makeup and with zero alcohol.</li>
      <li>They feel very oily and leave a greasy residue on my face.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and these wipe do not bother me and take off waterproof eye makeup without issue!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Only problem is that you have to order them from the La Fresh website and pay for shipping.</li>
      <li>Then as I used them more and more I realized they were all stale and old.</li>
      <li>They do not dry out your skin, they completely remove your makeup and since they are in  individual pkg they are easy  to travel with.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how only one wipe will take all my makeup and not leave any on my face like other wipes.</li>
      <li>Other wipes may cost less but they aren&#x27;t nearly as effective.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Gave them a try, and was completely hooked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought some of the regular makeup remover wipes and found they could not remove my normal eyeliner and mascara.  </li>
      <li>I even use these, on the days that I am bare faced.  </li>
      <li>It works better on my hard, dry feet than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out your skin but does the job.</li>

    <li> I stumbled across this product while vacationing at Holiday Inn Suites.  I loved how it removed all of my makeup; so I decided to look it up on the internet to purchase it in order that I could continue using the product while at home.  It does not dry out your skin but does the job.</li>
    <li> They are the best makeup remover I have ever tried. They do not dry out your skin, they completely remove your makeup and since they are in  individual pkg they are easy  to travel with.</li>
    <li> Buy the La Fresh Waterproof makeup remover wipes instead if you wear mascara or eyeliner.  I bought some of the regular makeup remover wipes and found they could not remove my normal eyeliner and mascara.  The cheap drugstore Neutrogena makeup remover wipes work much better than these.   However I also ordered some samples of the La Fresh Waterproof makeup remover wipes.  Those do remove eye makeup beautifully, much better than Neutrogena.  Only problem is that you have to order them from the La Fresh website and pay for shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Nordic Care Foot Care Cream since my nail technician introduced me to it.  It works better on my hard, dry feet than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;ve even introduced my podiatrist and massage therapist to it.  There is no better cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used LA Fresh Makeup Remover Wipes for quite some time since being introduced to them as a &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; on one of my motel stays.  Although the wipes can be pretty pricey, there were a &amp;#34;steal&amp;#34; at your price for 200 packets.  Other wipes may cost less but they aren&#x27;t nearly as effective.  It takes two of another brand to equal one LaFresh.</li>
    <li> These are not the same that hotels carry.  The packaging is also different.  The ones hotels provide are excellent for makeup removal.  These are like a moist cloth, nothing more.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> These were an amenity in the hotel we stayed at. They removed my eyemakeup very well as well as face makeup and with zero alcohol. Another bonus is that LA Fresh contains vitamin E.  I was impressed and ordered some online to have at home.</li>
    <li> I discovered these makeup wipes in the hotel I stayed at when I went to the beach. I absolutely love how only one wipe will take all my makeup and not leave any on my face like other wipes. I will be set for a year with this amount.</li>
    <li> Great product, no alcohol in it.  Keep selling these.</li>
    <li> I found these in the bathroom of our hotel in March 2013.  Gave them a try, and was completely hooked.&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear waterproof mascara, but I do wear eyeliner, and at times heavy eye makeup.  Along with a \\&quot;stay\\&quot; foundation, blush, and at times, a bronzing powder.  Not to mention, either lip stain, or infinity lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are amazing!!  They take it all off!!&lt;br /&gt;No longer do I have to hold a wipe under my eye trying to remove mascara.....no longer do I have to get the tooth brush out and \\&quot;scour\\&quot; my lips.  No more baby oil to dissolve eye makeup, no more cold cream or daily exfoliating to scrub off long wear foundation.  Just a nice moist wipe does it all.  And better than the others.  I have tried many....many!!  I even use these, on the days that I am bare faced.  They leave my face feeling clean, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan here.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
    <li> When staying at a motel I received them everyday and really liked them, they clean your makeup and mascara and do not leave your face sticky !</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting different packaging with description in French</li>
    <li> I ordered these to take when traveling and to use occasionally at home. When I used the first couple they had a weird smell.  Then as I used them more and more I realized they were all stale and old. They didn&#x27;t stay moist long enough to get my makeup off. The ones I used in the hotel at Embassy suites were in a different wrapper and were much better.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife after she tried several provided for us in a 5 star hotel room. She absolutely loved them and this is an opportunity to purchase large quantity at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Best makeup wipes! I have very sensitive skin and these wipe do not bother me and take off waterproof eye makeup without issue!</li>
    <li> Stumbled across this product at a hotel that provided it as an amenity with the toiletries.  Used it and fell in love!  I use it primarily to remove my eye makeup without any skin irritation.  If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> La Fresh Makeup Remover. Used it at a hotel and loved it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love these things! I use them for travel and camping. Europe typically doesn&#x27;t have wash cloths so these are a great substitute for traditional make-up remover potions.  Also, you aren&#x27;t packing an additional liquid so you can bring something nicer along through TSA.</li>
    <li> I first used La Fresh towel wipes while on vacation.  I came home and did a search where to purchase.  I purchased a case of 200.  When these are gone I will definitely purchase more. Found them listed on Amazon but sent from the company.</li>
    <li> When my daughter&#x27;s supply is low, I send her another case. She is so appreciative, using it every night to easily remove any makeup.</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t as effective as the wipe I used at a recent hotel stay. I am a little disappointed in the fact that I purchased 200ct. I was very impressed with the effectiveness of the wipe I used that the hotel provided, which had the exact same label.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and great at removing even waterproof mascara.  I didn&#x27;t need to bring make up/eye make up remover, toner or moisturizer, which freed up room for other things.</li>
    <li> First used these while staying at a hotel on a family vacation and got as many as we could from the cleaning lady!. Works great!</li>
