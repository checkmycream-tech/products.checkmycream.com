      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had healthy nails</li>
      <li>I did not want a refund, I wanted this product to use after nails got stonger also the postage cost way more than the product.</li>
      <li>You can also come up with your own routine to fit you needs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly satisfied with Xtra from Nail Tek.</li>
      <li>What more could a customer ask for?</li>
      <li>So, I work at a University and I love experimentation and research.</li>
      <li>a friend in Albuquerque told me about the brand - her manicurist uses it and my friend pays a lot more than you will pay for it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have recommended to others and some liked the product, other were not as impressed as I was.</li>
      <li>My nails break easily, since i have been using this product they have become stronger</li>
      <li>Keeps them strong.</li>
      <li>They also no longer hurt when I use warm or even hot water.  </li>
      <li>Even slightly warm water on my nails sent me through the roof and hot water was unbearable.  </li>
      <li>I expect them to show damage until they have fully grown out, but this is HUGE progress.  </li>
      <li>not use anything else and it is so much more economical through Amazon.com than ANYWHERE ELSE.</li>
      <li>Finally they are growing nicely!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this nail strengthener first before buying another brand</li>
      <li>It is almost as though the layers of the polish filled in and sealed over my nail to promote strength, growth, and overall optimum health.</li>
      <li>In our fast paced world.....faster is always better....  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t it worth all that, since the original shipping fee was almost the cost of the product.</li>
      <li>nail peeled almost at the quick.</li>
      <li>I have always had soft nails that crack and peel and have never been able to grow them.  </li>
      <li>worth peals off at one time.  </li>
      <li>and then this clear polish/product on top of the foundation.</li>
      <li>It looked more like a kit but was just a bottle of clear polish.  </li>
      <li>I apply a fresh coat each day and remove with non-acetone polish remover every week.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, this product has always worked and is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>a top coat, it dries fast and has shine - I would highly for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Overall, my nails were still were peeling and short from them breaking, and I was upset because I had intially thought I had found something great.</li>
      <li>I use the Nail Tek matte foundation product first</li>
      <li>With the appropriate thinner, a bottle lasts several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>NailTek Xtra really is better than the regular strength!  </li>
      <li>It never fails to harden my nails and let them grow.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>wet)&lt;br /&gt;The gloss/shine on top of my current nail color</li>
      <li>This stuff really does work!  </li>
      <li>and I literally have to file my nails with an acrylic nail file because they are so long and strong!  </li>
      <li>on my nails and then a topcoat of Quicken,  I am ready to go quickly and know that my nails will look nice in just a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>THe price was good and the product dried fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought two bottles because I believe I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
      <li>right handed, the nails on my left hand is way longer than my right hand since I have to hold my instruments on my right hand.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to add a new coat daily.</li>
      <li>You long for healthy, strong, long nails from the inside out</li>
      <li>Have not noticed any difference after using a whole bottle.</li>
      <li>But I saw real differences in two weeks.  </li>
      <li>The product is great for thin nails.</li>
      <li>Also, the nail polish has the standard nail polish handle you see in stores, not the huge, wide cylindrical top that is shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It either chips off the tip or the whole nail&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I received my package in the mail, strangely enough, it didn&#x27;t come in its original box, which meant it didn&#x27;t come with directions.</li>
      <li>I clean my hands multiple times a day at work, often with an alcohol based sanitizer, which wrecks havic with my nails.</li>
      <li>I love how long natural nails</li>
      <li>Nothing special, nails still fragile.</li>
      <li>It dries super fast and has not only helped with growth and strength, but the ridges are gone!</li>
      <li>Most likely a total loss.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
      <li>My nails are definitely looking better, especially my left hand.  </li>
      <li>I do a lot of gardening and even though I wear gloves, my right hand is coming along much more slowly.  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
      <li>Buy hard as nails instead which is effective and cheaper..</li>
      <li>The treated hand looks much smoother, shinier, and professional.</li>
      <li>One particular thing that bothers me is that it clearly states on the box that this product has been proven to cause cancer in California.  </li>
      <li>It &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; (same way with the same results as you would get with a layer of regular old nail polish) because it&#x27;s a layer on top of your nails to protect it from scratches and it does really keep things glued together to prevent chipping, but that isn&#x27;t what you want.</li>
      <li>This is the last product that I tried but it should have been the first.  </li>
      <li>I was going to order a new bottle and saw the EXTRA by Nail Tek which made it sound like THIS product would REALLY repair previously unreparable nail</li>
      <li>I just hoped I hadn&#x27;t been ripped off and someone sent me clear nail polish in the Nail Tek bottle instead.</li>

    <li> My nails break easily, since i have been using this product they have become stronger and they are growing i have used other products and they work at the beginning but my nail start breaking again. I buying this product again. On 7/2014 i bought this product again and beside using it to to help my naills grow and it&#x27;s also agreat top coat. I ran out of my top coat and decide to use these instead, it work better then the real top coat.</li>
    <li> A few mounts ago I had an accident, my foot toe and middle finger was broken, after a treatment and other very unpleasant teraphy, my doctor find that my toe nail is \\&quot;dead\\&quot;...  2 mounts later nail fail off and... BUT now I am using this product with combination of other 3 of the same line from the same producer, and ¾ of my nail is back and its normal, pink and clear...</li>
    <li> I have always had soft nails that crack and peel and have never been able to grow them.  I had acrylic nails for about 1 year, had them removed and my nails were even worse. It took about 3 months but I now have nails of my own.  My nails no longer bend and crack, they are hard and have grown over the tips of my fingers.  You must follow the directions, apply another coat every day, and remove and apply new at least once a week.  I never thought I could grow my own nails, but with Nail Tek I can and it costs a lot less than having acrylic nails done every two weeks!  I greatly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Okay this product will forever be in my nail care regimen! If it wasn&#x27;t for this product, I wouldn&#x27;t know how it feels to have long natural nails! My nails grew so long in like a month and a half that I was so shocked. I also apply under my nails. I haven&#x27;t had a breakage yet! Since I&#x27;m a hygienist and Im right handed, the nails on my left hand is way longer than my right hand since I have to hold my instruments on my right hand. Anywhere I go, ppl compliment on how long and beautiful my nails are and ask if they&#x27;re fake, I&#x27;ve never worn fake nails in my life</li>
    <li> NailTek Xtra really is better than the regular strength!  If I quit using NailTek products, I can&#x27;t grow my nails at all!  Thank goodness a friend in Albuquerque told me about the brand - her manicurist uses it and my friend pays a lot more than you will pay for it on Amazon.  Highly recommend for papery, thin, peeling, weak nails - - even if you take supplements as I do: biotin, gelatin, special nail and hair formula vitamins, etc.  They might help, but I must use NailTek, also.  When I stopped using the product to \\&quot;test\\&quot; the vitamin/supplement only way, all of my nails started flaking and breaking again!</li>
    <li> Perfect and about 1/2 the price of a salon purchase.  I love this product.  Just took acrylics off and needed to strengthen my nails.</li>
    <li> Who needs fake nails with Nail Tek? This set can reverse the damaged done by years of using acrylic nails. Stop wasting money and invest I. This stuff. It works!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, nails still fragile. Dry time longer than expected. DId not perform as I though, and had hoped, it would</li>
    <li> I bought and used Nail Tek Formul II for about a month and a half. The product thickened up so that I couldn&#x27;t really use it because it took so long to dry. BUT it DID work and my nails WERE getting stronger! I was going to order a new bottle and saw the EXTRA by Nail Tek which made it sound like THIS product would REALLY repair previously unreparable nail issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some and used it for about 2 weeks. BIG MISTAKE!!! It actually MADE my nails peel SO MUCH WORSE than EVER before!  I bought some of the Nail Tek product that thins out the polish that thickened up and I took off all the EXTRA and replaced it with the origianal NAIL TEK FORMULA !! . AHHHHH...SO much better. I will NOT be using EXTRA again and will order another bottle of Formula II</li>
    <li> this nail protector is very hard and durable and helps protect my weak nails from the normal shredding I experience.</li>
    <li> Call it biorhythms or just plain clumsiness, but once a year my nails all break.  Like now.  Help is at hand (pardon the pun) with this great nail topper that doesn&#x27;t look as though you are wearing polish. It makes nails hard, evens out the surface and just feels so much tougher and safer so my nails won&#x27;t crack and split and it gives them time to recover from endless seasonal baking.</li>
    <li> This product really makes a big difference for my nails.</li>
    <li> This does nothing for my nails. It peels off the same day I paint them. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m certainly satisfied with Xtra from Nail Tek. After using it as directed for 1 week, when I removed all the product to start over, I noticed that my thinnest nails were noticeably harder. Its regimen also protected the nails during the week, for the most part, although some of the nails on my right hand were impossible to keep covered with Xtra because of the tip wear--I had to file these back.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAD VERY THIN PEELING NAILS.  THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU NEED STRONGER NAILS.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this specific product from NailTek but it seems to be helping.  Package arrived intact and quickly so no problems.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I have had good reports on it.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have (or had)  fingernails that peel off in paper-thin sheets. It&#x27;s caused by an autoimmune disorder, and I&#x27;ve spent several hundred dollars on &amp;#34;The Answer to Your Problem&amp;#34; products that didn&#x27;t work. I take a lot of Biotin (pharmacist recommendation), which does make a minor difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But NailTek XTRA treatment works. After five years, someone said, &amp;#34;Did you get your nails done?  They look great.&amp;#34;  I almost fainted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, you have to follow these rules:&lt;br /&gt;1. DON&#x27;T buy the regular NailTek treatment, which often comes 2 for 1. NOT the SAME thing. Don&#x27;t buy the 3 bottle kit. NOT the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy the NailTek thinner. Because you add a layer daily, it gets thick in the bottle very fast. Don&#x27;t try to thin it with polish remover or laquer thinner. Won&#x27;t work. With the appropriate thinner, a bottle lasts several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3. Read the directions and follow them. The regime takes under 5 minutes a day, but it&#x27;s the regime that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a two-day turnaround, you won&#x27;t find it. But I saw real differences in two weeks.  And don&#x27;t forget to wear the ugly kitchen gloves in soapy, hot water.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I use for taking care of my nails. They use to have nail polish, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, a licensed beautician, turned me on to this several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use anything else and it is so much more economical through Amazon.com than ANYWHERE ELSE.</li>
    <li> It works well to strengthen the nails, you just have to be religious about applying it. The item came without a box and leaking over the bubble wrap. Not good. I contacted the seller about a return and they asked for a picture which I sent them, the offered to exchange it, if I sent it back...but  would have to pay postage. It wasn&#x27;t it worth all that, since the original shipping fee was almost the cost of the product. I took a risk and used it anyway...janky, I know. So, good product, bad seller.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin, peeling nails that would never grow past the tip of my finger.  I tried every product on the market when I was younger.  I finally gave up on my natural nails and have worn nail tips covered with gel glue for over 20 years.  Due to some impending surgery, I had to remove the tips and go cold turkey.  A couple of my nails were so thin, they hurt when the tips and glue were left off.  Even slightly warm water on my nails sent me through the roof and hot water was unbearable.  I was skeptical that anything would help but hoped the polish-like covering would decrease the pain at least.  I have been using Nail Tek Xtra for 3 weeks now.  I am amazed with the results.  I apply a fresh coat each day and remove with non-acetone polish remover every week.  Even after just the first week, my nails felt stronger and harder and aren&#x27;t peeling.  My nails are still in bad shape and show white spots where they are damaged.  I expect them to show damage until they have fully grown out, but this is HUGE progress.  They also no longer hurt when I use warm or even hot water.  I&#x27;m glad I bought two bottles because I believe I will be using this for a long time to come. So if you have nails that you thought were unsalvageable, give this a try.</li>
    <li> This product helped protect my nails so well I actually had visible length.  I&#x27;ve never had healthy nails so I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products and this is one of the best.  I have recommended to others and some liked the product, other were not as impressed as I was.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: As of 2016, I&#x27;ve since made the switch to natural nail alternatives, so that meant no more nail polishes/products with strong chemicals. I stopped using Nailtek a week after I started because although my nails seemed stronger and to be peeling less. The smell was off-putting, and after a week&#x27;s use nailtek&#x27;s effect seemed to plateau and if I stopped using it my nails&#x27; health plummeted--peeling and breaking within a day or two. Overall, my nails were still were peeling and short from them breaking, and I was upset because I had intially thought I had found something great. Nailtek was like a glue that sealed the cracks in the dam of my issue. It &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; (same way with the same results as you would get with a layer of regular old nail polish) because it&#x27;s a layer on top of your nails to protect it from scratches and it does really keep things glued together to prevent chipping, but that isn&#x27;t what you want. You long for healthy, strong, long nails from the inside out like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a nail oil mixture (jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, etc) in a nail polish bottle that I cleaned out with acetone. It has worked wonders as you can see from the pics! In the pic, I had just trimmed and applied the oil to them. I actually had to trim them because they were so long!&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in orchestra for three years in high school, so my nails had to always be short. With them always being short, I never cared about the peeling because I couldn&#x27;t wear them long. Now that I no longer play, and I want long nails. My nails usually peel in sheets, and eventually they will tear off or they just looked so bad that I have to cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or at least these used to be common issues before using this xtra maximum strength treatment. My nails are now harder and longer. Before using it, I had about five nails that had peeled badly and noticeably along the tips, but I just brushed this treatment right over them (didn&#x27;t sand away the peeled, rough tops of my nails or cut them down or anything), and now it has been literally 2 days, and I can&#x27;t even see where and which nails had the peeling! It is almost as though the layers of the polish filled in and sealed over my nail to promote strength, growth, and overall optimum health. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this nail strengthener first before buying another brand I say here on Amazon for $19.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my nails are long enough, I won&#x27;t ever use nail polish again: I only wore nail polish to make my hands look more feminine than short, stubby nails made my them look. I love how long natural nails look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package in the mail, strangely enough, it didn&#x27;t come in its original box, which meant it didn&#x27;t come with directions. I just hoped I hadn&#x27;t been ripped off and someone sent me clear nail polish in the Nail Tek bottle instead. (FYI: I just apply one coat every day for a week, remove all the layers on the 7th day, and start all over, repeating this cycle. You can also come up with your own routine to fit you needs. I just wouldn&#x27;t go crazy and apply it five times a day.) Also, the nail polish has the standard nail polish handle you see in stores, not the huge, wide cylindrical top that is shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic product, does what it promises, and I&#x27;m happy. What more could a customer ask for?</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in my area. The product is great for thin nails. I put several coats on one each day during the week and remove on Saturday and start all over.</li>
    <li> So, I work at a University and I love experimentation and research. Thus, I applied this product to one hand as directed for the last two weeks while not using it on the other. I painted both the same (one color change after a week) and used all other products the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treated hand:&lt;br /&gt;Nails are solid&lt;br /&gt;No Chipping&lt;br /&gt;No breaking&lt;br /&gt;When I push on them from the tip they feel solid.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to darken the polish a bit (like it&#x27;s wet)&lt;br /&gt;The gloss/shine on top of my current nail color ( [[ASIN:B008V1I3P4 Essie&#x27;s Leading Lady]] ) makes my nails looks like Dorothy&#x27;s Ruby slippers in Wizard of Oz. The treated hand looks much smoother, shinier, and professional. It&#x27;s the one people see and compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untreated hand:&lt;br /&gt;One nail peeled almost at the quick. Total loss.&lt;br /&gt;Another nail is peeling. Most likely a total loss.&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish is chipped like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually annoyed at myself for doing this experiment because my untreated nails suffered unnecessarily. :(  I will buy this again. I would like to see someone try to stop me. ;)</li>
    <li> Has not done what was promised yet, though I have been using it for at least a month.  One particular thing that bothers me is that it clearly states on the box that this product has been proven to cause cancer in California.  Why only California is named mystifies me and if it has been proven to cause cancer and they have to state that on the box, why is it still on the market?</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced this product to me and I&#x27;ve never used anything like it.  After having acrylics one time, they destroyed my nails, nothing worked and I&#x27;d given up.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and I literally have to file my nails with an acrylic nail file because they are so long and strong!  Be sure to wash/clean your nails before applying, it helps the polish stay on.  This is just amazing, I&#x27;ve ordered it for friends and relatives and no one can believe how well it works.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. This product is not worth the hype. Buy hard as nails instead which is effective and cheaper..</li>
    <li> My nails peel between layers, and tear across. This is the only product I have ever found that allows the nail to grow out. Just be sure to add a new coat daily.</li>
    <li> This product got great reviews.  The manicurist I go to also recommended this product.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if product works for me.</li>
    <li> My fingernails have been &amp;#34;rotten&amp;#34; for years and nothing I did made any difference.  Until Xtra For Previously Unsalvageable Nails.  I have been using it now for about a month and not one single fingernail is peeling or breaking off.  I hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> My nails are definitely looking better, especially my left hand.  I do a lot of gardening and even though I wear gloves, my right hand is coming along much more slowly.  At least my nails aren&#x27;t breaking when I fold laundry any more.  What I like best about it is that it dries really fast.  I also bought some of level 2 stuff and it takes forever to dry.  My objections are that it won&#x27;t stay on.  It either chips off the tip or the whole nail&#x27;s worth peals off at one time.  The directions are very limited and I don&#x27;t know if I can use a base coat with and have it work -- do some ingredients bond with my nail?</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past for about 5 years and it&#x27;s terrific.  It never fails to harden my nails and let them grow.  However, when I placed my order this time I ordered 3 bottles.  I received 3 bottles, but did not check each individual one when I received them (my fault).  I was traveling at the time.  When I inspected the other 2 unopened bottles 2 weeks ago I found that one bottle was broken and completely empty of any product.  This must have happened during shipping or before it was shipped, because there was no product on the shelf where I stored them.  Otherwise, this product has always worked and is worth the money.  Buy it on-line, as it&#x27;s much much more expensive in a salon.</li>
    <li> Works great. After a couple of layers, the shine &amp; thickness remind me of gel nails. So far, no peeling or nail breakage. I clean my hands multiple times a day at work, often with an alcohol based sanitizer, which wrecks havic with my nails. Finally they are growing nicely! Fast delivery, great price!</li>
    <li> Yes my nails are bad, but that is why I bought this. Didn&#x27;t help at all and felt weird on the nails as it seems to fuse with them. But my daughter also uses this and likes it so maybe it depends on your nails.</li>
    <li> This. Is a great product when everything on the market doesn&#x27;t work for you. Learned about it from a nail tech and she used it on me until I begged her to tell me what it was</li>
    <li> My nails peel, are so weak the bend without breaking, and can&#x27;t grow without being ripped off. I have tried everything at the drug store to try and strengthen my nails, nothing worked! This works, even after the nail polish was removed, my nails were still hard. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This works just like it say, great stuff</li>
    <li> Was anxious to get this product because of other reviews.  One by one every nail broke.  I used this product for two weeks and never saw any improvement.  I ended up throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! Only thing that works. I work in the ER wash my hands and alcohol multiple times all day. Have to file my nails-don&#x27;t break unless they get too long. My sister and mom use this too-</li>
    <li> Nice product. I use it with the Foundation II.  Seems to be working well though i am not sure what the difference between this and the intense therapy II.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work!  It&#x27;s the only product that ever made my nails grow.  I don&#x27;t understand why Nail Tek doesn&#x27;t make headlines everywhere because it is amazing!!  Product arrived on time and in good shape.  I would definitely do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Ordered two bottles of Xtra For Previously Unsalvageable Nails, NK14000, and one bottle of Nail Tek Xtra Maximum Strength Formula Nail Strengthener.  Instead I received three bottles of Unsalvageable product. I contacted the seller immed.  Reply asked me if I wanted a refund. I did not want a refund, I wanted this product to use after nails got stonger also the postage cost way more than the product. They told me both products I ordered were the same?? I don&#x27;t see how this is.  Both discriptions are totally different also prices are different.  So now I have three bottles of one product. Product was not in a box, so I had no instruction as to how to use. I had to e-mail three times before I got an answer and even at that it sounded like a guess. (Use 2/3 days) So now I am guessing myself.  All that said, the poduct is really good and my nails are becoming strong again.</li>
    <li> While this works better than anything you can buy at the drug store, it&#x27;s not the best for growing your own nails.  Liquid protein has me the most in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a top coat, it dries fast and has shine - I would highly for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have brittle,paper thin nails that layer and peel. This is the only product that has helped me. I use the Nail Tek matte foundation product first and then this clear polish/product on top of the foundation. I have followed the recommended directions for best results.</li>
    <li> It looked more like a kit but was just a bottle of clear polish.  It does help some.</li>
    <li> The name of this product described the condition of my nails.  I thought there was no hope for my nails until I tried this product called &amp;#34;EXTRA&amp;#34;.  It really goes the extra mile.  When my nails were growing out from acrylic nails, they needed all the help they could get.  This is the last product that I tried but it should have been the first.  With&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA on my nails and then a topcoat of Quicken,  I am ready to go quickly and know that my nails will look nice in just a few minutes.  In our fast paced world.....faster is always better....  I will always use Nail Tek products and never be ashamed of my nails again.&lt;br /&gt;Leigh Martin</li>
    <li> Good product, dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference after using a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Made my ugly nails look nice and was protector for peeling. THe price was good and the product dried fast.</li>
    <li> I have had weak nails with ridges for years do to some health issues. They have always peeled and cracked as soon as they grew just a bit above the nail bed. My nails look better than they have in years! It dries super fast and has not only helped with growth and strength, but the ridges are gone!</li>
    <li> excellent. Growing nails like I never could. Keeps them strong. No more need for fake nails. Thank you for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Lately I have been having problems with my nails peeling and spliting.  So I have just tried this product and hope it will help my nails.  It seems to give my nails strength so I will keep using the Xtra.  Only time will tell.</li>
