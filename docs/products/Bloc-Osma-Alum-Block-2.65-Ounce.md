      <li>but it is nice to have.</li>

      <li>Also an extremely effective under arm deodorant (unscented but your armpit will remain that way for the remainder of the day)</li>

      <li>This is a perfect size and works great makes the bleeding stop instantly and leaves your face smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>

      <li>Works great, is cheap, and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>This is a good sting, and goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Smooth and effective.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself any more.</li>
      <li>I think I had to by it from a British online store the best I remember.</li>
      <li>for the love of god</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much more to say about an alum block.</li>
      <li>I love these blocks and have used them for many years.</li>
      <li>Outstanding stuff.  </li>
      <li>I get razor burn/bumps/ingrown hair on my neck every time I do more than one pass.</li>
      <li>You will feel tons better and your skin will thank you.</li>
      <li>Love the alum block.</li>
      <li>so much better than styptic pencils.</li>
      <li>I use a plastic lid from a shave gel can as a holder, but I think something designed to hold a bar of soap would work better.</li>
      <li>The quality is noticeably better.</li>
      <li>Man I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this product is great!</li>
      <li>but i guess it works well :)</li>
      <li>Then the styptic pencil works better.</li>
      <li>The upside is that it does a great job after my shave, tightening and toning, makes aftershave not sting as much.</li>
      <li>I prefered this brand to the &amp;#34;Shavex 125g Alum Block in plastic case&amp;#34; product; it felt much more dense, anyway.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I should have researched more first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more can I say</li>
      <li>This Block is very smooth and glides easily over the face with no noticeable roughness or dragging.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
      <li>The alum is a great report card as well as natural astringent.</li>
      <li>Good indicator of how well you&#x27;ve shaved by how much it hurts (work on your lather or change your blade if it hurts a lot).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My face feels very smooth after shaving and sometimes don&#x27;t use an aftershave with no bad effects.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is very smal (one) block.</li>
    <li> Big help with sealing the face after a shave.......</li>
    <li> My wife uses this as an alternative to deodorant and I use it as an after-shave and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> ...it&#x27;s alum. What more can I say</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend this as your first alum block. Works great, is cheap, and is very easy to keep clean. Must have for any new shaver.</li>
    <li> I prefered this brand to the &amp;#34;Shavex 125g Alum Block in plastic case&amp;#34; product; it felt much more dense, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I dropped it and ended up trying another brand; I&#x27;ll definitely be returning to Osma after either breaking or using the rest of my current block.</li>
    <li> If you are prone to nicks while shaving (my Adam&#x27;s Apple is my shaving challenge area), you simply wet the stone and rub over the area. It burns a little, at first, then soothes, stops the bleeding, and keeps down the red burn.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty excellent alum block. The only thing that would make it better is if it came in a plastic case.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great, tight, cool.  Can sting a bit on any areas you shaved or nicked, but also helps teach you where you&#x27;re using too much pressure when you shave.  Highly recommend this.  This block will also last a very long time.  Have been using for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve used it at all.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as a styptic pencil. Doubt I&#x27;ll be going back to Alum.</li>
    <li> After you have shaved, run a little cold water over the block and rub on your face. The sting will let you know how well you did.</li>
    <li> Practical and sensible way to seal up your face after a rough shave.</li>
    <li> I use this after I do a full shave, or just shave my neck. It replaces my aftershave splash, but I&#x27;ll still use a balm or lotion. There is definitely a stinging when you pass over any razor burn or cuts, but it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty small but that ends up being just fine. There isn&#x27;t much more to say about an alum block. It works. I wish it had a plastic case or some other kind of protector like other alum blocks I&#x27;ve had, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I bought it to stop bleeding and it works. The price was right what more can I say it works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know I bought this...guess my husband did. it looks good!</li>
    <li> Nice little travel sized block.</li>
    <li> The crystals are large and relatively clear. That&#x27;s a sign of a chemically pure, high quality substance. It works great. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of storage medium, so you need to figure out a way to store it yourself. I use a plastic lid from a shave gel can as a holder, but I think something designed to hold a bar of soap would work better.</li>
    <li> I use it for every shave.  I like to apply it and then rinse it off after clean up, then apply whatever aftershave.  Works just as described</li>
    <li> Very good great price but wish it was larger.</li>
    <li> Heavy and smooth. This feels absolutely great after a shave. I&#x27;d been using a Classic brand block for years before picking this up; I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this brand. The quality is noticeably better.</li>
    <li> 3 Stars because my block came with a broken corner, quite significant in size.  The upside is that it does a great job after my shave, tightening and toning, makes aftershave not sting as much.</li>
    <li> Using alum instead of aftershave has cleared up the in-grown hairs i get around my adam&#x27;s apple.  I also like that it is fragrance free, so you can still smell the shave soap.  I hear it&#x27;s also really good in some sauces!  heheh</li>
    <li> tightens as it sits.  the longer it stays, tightens skin longer.</li>
    <li> Works great for shaving and lasts a shockingly long time. Also an extremely effective under arm deodorant (unscented but your armpit will remain that way for the remainder of the day)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s of little consequence.  I use it every time I shave regardless of whether or not I&#x27;ve nicked myself or have weepers.  It works great and has a little bit of a bite to it; nothing crazy.  I&#x27;ll buy another one of these when the time comes.</li>
    <li> If you use a straight blade, or a safety razor, to shave and you dont have one of these, you are doing it wrong.</li>
    <li> Man I love this stuff.  Got it a while ago and it still has about 90% of it&#x27;s life left.  I use it twice a week.  I never deal with shaving cuts for more than half a day.  It works great for if you get a papercut or something.  Once you start using Alum Block you will never go back to aftershave I guarantee it.</li>
    <li> This is the only alum bloc I use. Works great and is a great value. Use it after my morning shave.</li>
    <li> First off, these things last forever. This is only my second bar in a few years, mostly because I dropped the first one and it broke - but I still used it until the pieces were too small to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this astringent bar really helps reduce effects of razor burn and seems to have prevented additional effects such as acne due to pores becoming infected or clogged. Using it right after shaving sometimes stings, but it is completely worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is very, very tough and I absolutely hate shaving because of irritation. Using an alum block has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to try this, understand it *will* sting if your face is easily irritated or you&#x27;re prone to razor burn. That&#x27;s ok! Let it sit for about 1/2 a minute until it stops, then rinse in cool water. You will feel tons better and your skin will thank you. Finish with a decent moisturizer (not alcohol based), and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I needed it but it is nice to have.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a Alum block on the recommendation of a friend. He had been using one for awhile. I have always battled razor burn and have pretty sensitive skin. I have decided that the Alum block does help, after shaving just wet the block a bit and rub on your face. It has a slice burn but that fades quickly and it helps to reduce long lasting burn and redness. I use it nearly every time I shave now.</li>
    <li> While still learning to whet shave or even switching  between different razors/blades, alum blocks sting more where your shave was worse. This is a good sting, and goes away quickly. Does not stop bleeding from major nicks but I have a styptic pencil for that. DO NOT DROP!</li>
    <li> Not really much to say.  It&#x27;ll close up your face and neck pores and even small weepers.  Wash it off after you&#x27;re done.  Stings a bit of you&#x27;ve got too close</li>
    <li> Very good and effective. Simply run it over your wet face after shaving let it sit for 1 or 2 monitors them cold rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pimples or razor rash.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a quality block of alum! Some other companies (not going to say who) use cheaper sources that eventually degrade... This product is great and will last a long time even with daily use!</li>
    <li> Bad stuff first: 2.65 ounces is pretty small. There is no plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff: it&#x27;s a pure block vs. compressed. It&#x27;s much cheaper than anything I could source locally. It works very well. Seriously well. I get razor burn/bumps/ingrown hair on my neck every time I do more than one pass. Part of the reason is that my neck is very sensitive, part because I have a hurricane growth pattern below my Adam&#x27;s apple. But two well executed passes followed by a cold water rinse &amp; alum block seem to remedy this. I still follow up with some G F Trumpers skin food - but it appears to be the alum block that has finally tamed my sensitive neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product were a touch larger. (Say 3.0 ounces) or came in a plastic case, I&#x27;d rate it a 5. That said - this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> I am still a user of an old-time Gillette double-edge adjustable razor. I use good soap and a brush to work up a nice lather, but I can still irritate my skin. Rubbing the alum bloc over my face can ease the little dings shaving causes. My bloc arrived broken into three pieces, two of them large enough to still be usable, but this was the fault of Amazon&#x27;s lousy packaging.</li>
    <li> If you shave then you should be using this right after. This has become an essential part of my shaving routine and it&#x27;s so cheap that it will always be.</li>
    <li> This Alum Block works fairly well as long as you do not have a &amp;#34;real bleeder&amp;#34; cut. Then the styptic pencil works better. The alum block provides a refreshed feel when using on whole face after a shave. Prefer the bloc, but still use the pencil when necessary.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal, no joke it does ex</li>
    <li> From some of the other reviews I was expecting to put this on my face and it feel like I pressed my cheeks against the doors of hell.  There was a slight sting but nothing like when I slap on the ole aftershave.  This is a small block of Alum which makes it easy to handle/maneuver around the contours of your face.  It is a lot smaller than I expected.  I wish the item picture would have also included a banana for scale.  This Block is very smooth and glides easily over the face with no noticeable roughness or dragging.  I will definitely purchase this item again.  I gave this item 4 stars because this is my first alum block and I have nothing else to compare it too.  If it hopped out of its place of rest and rubbed itself on my face it would have 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used many blocks of alum but this last the longest</li>
    <li> Not sure what it does but i guess it works well :)</li>
    <li> Some places sell the same size alum blocks for four to five times the price.  There is no difference between a boutique branded alum block and this one.  I love the tight, tingly feeling I get when I apply the alum block to my face after a close shave.  Makes my skin feel great and I know it protects my skin at the same time.  No razor bumps or or shave-induced pimples when using this.  This is a must-have for all wet shavers.  At this price, it&#x27;s a disservice to not buy this.</li>
    <li> If you like me like the sting that alcohol aftershave does but at the same time are concerned about dry skin this is your product.</li>
    <li> This candy tastes weird.  Also, the name looks like Osama which I don&#x27;t think is cool.  But it&#x27;s cheap and I can suck on this thing forever it seems.</li>
    <li> When I first started shaving with a straight razor I anticipated that I&#x27;d probably cut the hell out of myself while I was learning how to use it, and I figured an alum block would be a good investment to help close some of those nicks. Sure enough, I was right on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, I figured an alum block is an alum block, and bought some cheap piece of trash. Since it was the first one I&#x27;d ever used and I had nothing to compare it with, I thought that alum blocks in general were just little porous crystals that would disintegrate and scrape up your face if you weren&#x27;t careful due to all the small air pockets in it creating potentially sharp edges, doing more harm than good. That first block just recently broke in half due to the massive air pocket in the middle, and I decided to try out this brand. It&#x27;s like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous one is now in the trash where it belongs, and I&#x27;ll never skimp out on an alum block ever again. The dollar or two I saved was not worth the months of irritation (both psychological and epidermal).</li>
    <li> This is another one of those where you may want to order a few of them.  The rock is very fragile, and if you drop it at all it breaks.  Mine fell from the ledge on the vanity and broke.  Order a few.</li>
    <li> This thing is small. It&#x27;s like a really thick box of matches. It&#x27;s smooth, and it&#x27;s made of alum. It closes nicks and it helps calm your face after shaving. My wife uses it on her legs and loves it.</li>
    <li> I no longer use alcohol based after shaves because I no longer have too. After my shave I rinse well with warm and then ice cold water. I then lightly glide the alum block over my still wet face and leave it on while I rinse my brush, razor and clean up my sink area. The alum is a great report card as well as natural astringent. You&#x27;ll know exactly where you got too heavy handed with your razor. I then rinse the alum off with ice cold water. When my face air dries I use a non alcohol based Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with aloe. When that dries I use a non-alcohol aftershave moisturizing balm. Alum is a natural soft stone and is extensively used in traditional wet shaving. Another example of why the old time guys had it right.</li>
    <li> Works great for small cuts.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, kind of stops little nicks from bleeding, burns a little though, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, and tastes horrible if you get it on your lips! I like to use it when going to work so I don&#x27;t smell like aftershave!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shave. Let it sit for a few minutes then cold water rinse it off before I slap on my after shave liberally.</li>
    <li> Just received my second block of this stuff. First one was from a different vendor. This one is cracked and crumbled into several unusable pieces. I&#x27;m very disappointed. The first one I bought, and this brand, was rated to be the best quality and formed as a single piece. Not pressed together like some cheaper brands pass off to you. I know have a 2/3 size usable portion and have to throw out the other third due to the small sizes and dust it was made up with. Plus the box appeared counterfeit. Again, not the same material as the other one.</li>
    <li> Really like the Osma alum block for nicks. Just wet it and rub where needed. Now, I&#x27;ve had a couple of deeper cuts that it won&#x27;t seal but those required special attention. For normal nicks and small cuts this is perfect. Much cheaper than what you will find at the &amp;#34;shave specialty shops&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I used this item one time and I am very pleased with the result. After shaving I wet one end of the bar and run around face and neck. It tighten the skin . Then use after shave product.So far so good. With the use of other shave products I got a very close shave.  Will reevaluate  in the future.</li>
    <li> Good for the price and it&#x27;s chemical composition. Takes a little learning and patience for it to stop slightly  larger shaving nicks.</li>
    <li> This product works great after a shave.  It feels kind of like a cooling sensation.  I usually use this immediately after a shave, and a few minutes later I&#x27;ll apply a post shave balm.</li>
    <li> When I got this,  only to find it completely smashed into chunks.  I am not going to bother to order another block unless it is in some sort of protective case and not just a cardboard box with a zip lock bag taped around it.</li>
    <li> At first the idea of rubbing alum on my face seemed strange, but This has become part of my daily after shave routine. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Wow. rubbing this on your face post shave may sting, but it has helped my skin quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought this, it really helps to prevent bleeding from a nick or cut after shaving and to identify if I could have shaved a little closer next time.  This block looks like it could last me forever, I just wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> It is the size of a sampler soap. I have a problematic mole that gets nicked every now and again and seems to bleed for an hour. This stopped the bleeding right away. Stung like a....stinging thingy real bad for a few seconds, but it worked. Rather have a little sting than be called toilet paper face or band aid neck by people with an elementary school sense of humor.</li>
    <li> This product is what it says it is - a block of alum.  It has an attractive little paper box/wrapper.  It works well in stopping any weepers after a shave, but won&#x27;t stop bleeding nicks very well.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a better rating is that it seems to be considerably more expensive than other alum blocks and is the same product.  Guess I should have researched more first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I only thought this block of Alum was expensive.  That is because I had never heard of the brand Art of Shaving.  They sell a similarly priced block for about $20.  Yeah, I guess this is moderately priced block after all.  The block served me well until I dropped it.  Then it, like any other alum block would, shattered on the floor.</li>
    <li> I came across the &amp;#34;alum block&amp;#34; while reading about shaving tips online and decided to try it out so I purchased this one from Amazon.  It works as advertised and now I never shave without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Cons: easily shatters when dropped</li>
    <li> Wet your face and wet the block before you use this! A lot of people seem to disregard/miss this piece of advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this to be much larger -- like the size of a bar of soap -- because of the size/resolution of the picture. I see now if I had paid attention to the product dimensions, I wouldn&#x27;t have made that mistake. The picture is misleading though; it&#x27;s 1/4 the size of the picture (on my screen anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the utility of the product, I was quite surprised how well it works. It works really, really well. However, it burrrrrrrns! The bigger the cut, the bigger the burn. I throw aftershave on immediately after using this to mitigate the burn with the cooling sensation the (menthol) aftershave provides. Even if I didn&#x27;t have the aftershave, I&#x27;d still use it though -- it&#x27;s worth the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your own research in regards to potential health issues; for me, it sounded like hogwash.</li>
    <li> Good quality, durable and does the trick perfectly.  Highly recommended, especially for those getting started with double edge or straight razor shaving.</li>
    <li> After switching to a safety razor, I became obsessed with obtaining the closet shave, and that shave needed to be razor bump-free. The combination of witch hazel and an alum block right after the cold water rinse and before the aftershave moisturizer does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This alum block by Osma works like a charm; it&#x27;s ease of use and effectiveness has solidified its place in my personal grooming routine.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t exactly read up on grooming tips or share secrets with my bros.  I suppose I was missing out on something, as until I discovered this I messed around with less than ideal solutions for nicks after shaving.  This simple (though smaller than you might expect) block delivers quick and remarkable results.  Magic!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the same reason most people do. To treat nicks and cuts from shaving. When I received this block it was shattered into several pieces so I did return it. I also used a little chip on my face and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;  I am not rating this based on the condition it was in when received because that would not be fair. Too bad it was fragmented but it is still a good product. Hopefully your order arrives in one piece?</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product and I can&#x27;t return it.  It is very small and the price paid with shipping was over $10. Not a good buy from the provider.</li>
    <li> Saw this and wondered about it it, read others reviews, thought I would give it a try. Amazing!!! Will reorder these when needed, no razor burn not a bump. Love it!</li>
    <li> Seems sufficient.  I don&#x27;t possess the experience to greatly gauge its usefulness.</li>
    <li> works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> Its an alum block. How can one get that wrong? It&#x27;s a block of potassium alum. It works well but I think the price is just a little steep. I prefer the &#x27;Allume di rocca&#x27; by Naturale or the &#x27;Razorock&#x27; alum. Both of these come on a little base that is also a handle. Of these two, I like the &#x27;&#x27;Naturale&#x27; allume di rocca best. I think I had to by it from a British online store the best I remember.</li>
    <li> xxxxxxxxxxx sorry too much typing for me............&lt;br /&gt;so i will complete the required # of words&lt;br /&gt;i wish i hadn&#x27;t started this</li>
    <li> Great product, slightly expensive. Not sure if the perceived premium is for the brand name as its just another alum stone.</li>
    <li> Great alum block, works as intended. Nick those nics before they bleed out. I love these old school high quality items.</li>
    <li> It is the first time that I use this product and I am very happy about it. I am a women, so I use it after shaving my legs, which can become really dry with the shaving. It helps a lot, and I can see my legs being smooth again, and my hair growing slower now.</li>
    <li> Works well as expected.  Bar received broken and have to use pieces of the bar which is annoying and difficult</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice enough, dropped it once and it shattered into a dozen pieces.</li>
    <li> This little block of alum... really works! Just wished it came with a plastic container though. Other than that... this alum works as advertised... should last a long time...</li>
    <li> Excellent alum bloc.  Smooth and effective.  Quite attractive wet or dry on the bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size and works great makes the bleeding stop instantly and leaves your face smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
    <li> I recently started &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaving with a DE safety razor. I have for almost a decade NOT SHAVED due to many botched teenage attempts at modern shaving &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; that left my skin raw, extremely irritated and razor burned, all while causing painful ingrown hairs. I opted instead for hair clippers which worked great, but could only shave as close as a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Well, that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t fly with my current employer, who implement a strict daily shaving rule. *sigh* Anyway, using this product along with my DE safety has made me not only a believer, but also an enjoyer of shaving every day! Looking back, the first few days I tore my face all to hell haha but this product saved me! Now, it DOES STING on areas that you go over too close or any nicks, but once you get your technique down, you&#x27;ll notice less and less stinging areas when using this product. Also, it keeps a nice &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; barrier on your face all day, even in severe conditions...I&#x27;m a line chef at a very high end, very fast paced country club (read: hot, sweaty, abrasive). Within two weeks I was down to ONLY 10% of my original face irritation after using this product. OSMA Alum block saved my face!</li>
    <li> Alum is alum but this is well shaped so it doesn&#x27;t have any real sharp edges and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Good alum block for use after shaving. Good indicator of how well you&#x27;ve shaved by how much it hurts (work on your lather or change your blade if it hurts a lot).&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep the block dry and wet only one end by wetting one hand and rubbing it against my palm. Then I gently rub on my face to close the pores and sooth the skin. Feels great!</li>
    <li> This small Alum block works exactly as advertised.  It holds together well and is very easy to apply after shaving.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a better buy than some of the cheaper offerings (such as the ones with the generic green or orange label). The others were hollow and roughly surfaced.  This is a little larger, solid all the way through, and feels smooth as glass on my face.  The others lasted me about 3 months before they started to crumble, due to being hollow.  I expect to get at least twice that life out of this one or better.</li>
    <li> Great price and lets you know how you DE technique is.</li>
    <li> I keep it in its cardboard box (rip the opening end off) and press it against any little cut I get shaving.  Cooling, tingly, and germ-killing, the bleeding is rapidly stanched for all but the deepest of cuts.  No wonder this stuff has been used for decades.</li>
    <li> Spend the money, you get what you pay for. This one is far better block than Art of Shaving one....</li>
    <li> Great alum block. Not much you can say about it, it stops bleeding and makes my face feel better if I screw up shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using alum for my underarms for 20 years.  Never realized that it works for after shaving too.</li>
    <li> Nice little block, good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE if you plan on using a safety/straight razor. Covers up nicks, lets you know any spots you may have missed (you can feel the grit on the block)... totally worth picking up.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot about alum over the years and I finally decided to get a block. My only regret is that I waited so long. It is easy to use and really soothes my skin and eliminates razor burn.</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors, and enjoy shaving in this style.  As I get better and better at my technique I find little things that make it better.  This Alum block came in one small block.  I have it in a soap box I bought at Target for .97 cents.  I can&#x27;t find this product any where in my my town (razors either) so I had to order on-line.  Item came fast and works like a charm on my face after a shave.  I wash my face put some hot water on it, wet the block and rub it gentely on my face and neck, feels good.  recommend to anyone who enjoys a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using styptic pencils for the past year to remedy the small nicks/cuts during shaving. The thing I didn&#x27;t like with styptic was the white powdery residue left over and their relatively short life. I purchased Bloc Osma a month ago. I use it almost daily, but it still looks like the day I opened it. It&#x27;s also very effective in soothing my skin post shave. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Works great for stopping nicks and reducing redness. Small bit of rock lasts forever as well. I gave 4 stars b/c mine arrived broken. Still works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have been using this after almost every shave and it absolutely stops the blood from come out of those nicks and scratches...&lt;br /&gt;Stings a little when applying - which no one seemed to mention, but I still use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Used it once, it made my bumps even more red and it did not even stop the the cuts that aren&#x27;t even visible at the first but slowly ooze a tiny amount of blood.  It did sting a bit so I assume it was doing some astringent action which is the only reason I give it a 2.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot you can say about an Alum Block. Alum is a naturally occurring mineral and this is a block of it. It works really well after a shave to clean the face and seal in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, if you shave, you need to get an Alum block to rub across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it stings a little bit if you had a rough shave but it helps keep your face soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this Alum block is a little more than other manufacturers. It works well but I think it could be a little cheaper. You will get years of use out of this Alum block if you don&#x27;t drop it, as they can sometimes shatter.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a new safety razor, and was recommended to purchase a alum block. This one works great, just get it wet under the sink or in the shower and rub it all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Smooth&lt;br /&gt;Does what it is suppose to do&lt;br /&gt;Hand made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No other storage container other than the cardboard box that it comes in&lt;br /&gt;Little pricey for the size</li>
    <li> Great item for the wet shaving man or woman. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and read a lot of reviews on this product. So nice to use after a sharp safety shave. Small in size, but big in comfort. A must have for wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Never even knew about Alum, but it works great after a shave. Pretty cool that wetting this stone and rubbing it on your face does a better job than drug store after shave</li>
    <li> Outstanding stuff.  I just wish I could find a case for it.</li>
    <li> Use it minor nicks, a quick wipe across the face and the weepers are gone. If I have hard to seal nick I grab the septic pencil. I have no complaints about the size, I have large enough hands to palm a basketball, I feel the it is sized right for getting in the crevices and dimples</li>
    <li> I use this after every shave to prevent razor burn, and it seriously works. I haven&#x27;t had razor burn since I bought this. The block lasts a very long time too. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year, and it still looks new.</li>
    <li> It works! Little bitty thing, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If you shave with a double edge or straight razor, you need one of this.  You will use it. Trust me !!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s made to do. I do wish it came with some sort of storage container like other Alum Blocks but thats no big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Just started using a DE safety razor last month, this alum block soothes any burn on my neck or weepers on my face.  Gets me ready for the aftershave lotion.  Prime 2 day delivery rocks, as usual!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me for post shaving. I had some doubts but bought it as an add on purchase and I&#x27;m glad I did. This little block seals any nicks and soothes razor burn. I wish I knew about this years ago.</li>
    <li> This works great to stop bleeding from nicks when shaving. It is a clear stone. I use it with wet face and wet stone after shaving and it does work quite well to immediately stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> Ladies, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to stop razor burn.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve tried lotions, sprays, creams...everything! My shaving routine now includes the alum block every time!  You simply wet the block and rub it on the shaved area.  Be careful, if you drop it the block it shatters.  I keep the block outside the shower but within reach to help prevent it from falling inside the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a great block for an after-shave treatment.  Helps close small nicks or cuts and lets you know if you shaved too close in areas.  Wet it and glide it over shaved areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also, believe it or not, a great underarm deodorant - wet the stone generously and apply like normal deo; leaves no scent but prevents odor all day, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Bloc Osma Alum Block is very nice product. i like it. But it is very small and doesnt come with plastic cover.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a block of alum, so that isn&#x27;t the issue - the issue is that the product is packed in a very minimal cardboard box, which, if it&#x27;s not further protected, makes the product highly susceptible to breakage. Mine came in a box of a number of items (none of which were very heavy and all of which arrived intact), but the block itself was shattered into pieces, thus making it 100% unusable. The largest piece was about an inch square, but it&#x27;s too tiny to use effectively. The rest of the pieces were tiny shards and dust.... I ended up throwing it all away in disgust. As this is a simple mineral product, I&#x27;d say steer clear and purchase a different block... a simple search will reveal plenty of options. The ones that have worked for me all were marketed as being packaged in plastic boxes.</li>
    <li> Works well. I recommend keeping it in a soap dish or something similar in order to allow it to dry</li>
    <li> This Alum block is fantastic, definitely exceeded my expectations. This is my first Alum block so I didn&#x27;t exactly know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. It really helps any sort of irritation after your shave and gives you a nice little sting that lets you know everything is clean. It helps for those who are new to classic shaving as the areas where it burns more, you can tell that&#x27;s where your were too aggressive with the blade. Overall, this product is great! It lasts an extremely long time and does exactly what It is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for years but never knew what an Alum block was. However, I started DE shaving with my granddads vintage safety razor and with the learning curve and my lack of technique I was butchering my face. After searching the net I decided to try this Alum block and I find this alum block is a MUST HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my neck and head after a shave and I find calms the burn down and IMO is a miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique has improved and no longer experiencing razor burn but find I still use this product after every shave as it just finishes the job and my face and head feel nice! Tightens the skin a bit and is a strange feeling but wow it just works. This product and a must have for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great to use after shaving. If you&#x27;re prone to nicks or cuts, an alum block will help remedy the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use. After you shave, rinse the block under and apply it to your face gently massaging it against your skin in a circular motion. Let it sit for 30 seconds, wash it off, and apply aftershave, if you want.</li>
    <li> Any shaver knows what an alum block is, and that they&#x27;re all pretty much the same. It&#x27;s a mineral, so it&#x27;s like comparing table salts, right?  This works great. I don&#x27;t have any reason to replace it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Works great to close cuts and sooth irritation, as well as prevent any break outs.  Does dry the skin out and will cause momentary redness.  Just use it inc conjunction with a good after shave moisturizer and you should be fine.  It would be nice if the size was a bit bigger, but for the price I think it is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and am glad to say it was money well spent! It tightens and conditions your face after shaving. It will help small nics stop bleeding as well as a stypic pencil if not better. My face feels very smooth after shaving and sometimes don&#x27;t use an aftershave with no bad effects.</li>
    <li> Started with using on my face after shaving (sometimes my bald head too).  You get that little sting initially, nothing crazy, and then no irritation, no in grown hairs - you can feel the skin tighten up a bit, throw on some lotion and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, started using a second bar as a &#x27;deodorant crystal&#x27; and love how it&#x27;s working.  Apply the wet block to cleaned under arms after a shower and let it dry before you apply any other conventional deodorant or antiperspirant.  I&#x27;ve been loving the effect of the combination and I think my body is responding well.</li>
    <li> A MUST when you shave, makes your face feel so fresh and seals off any nicks you have.</li>
    <li> so much better than styptic pencils. Much easier to use with similar results. Has lasted a very long time (a year or so)  of shaving every 2-3 days with no signs of becoming too small to use anytime soon.</li>
    <li> If you shave and you&#x27;re not using this, you should.  Clears up knicks easly and leaves my skin over all feeling refreshed after a shave.</li>
    <li> The product is great and works. I do remember my father using this in my early childhood saying it is salt and it stops the bleading. However as I have progressed with my wet shaving I don&#x27;t cut myself any more. And therefore I do not use the block as much, it does dry your skin a little bit. Overall it does the job and does it well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t lick it&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia says it&#x27;s sweet tasting&lt;br /&gt;but for the love of god&lt;br /&gt;please don&#x27;t lick it&lt;br /&gt;ugh&lt;br /&gt;horrible</li>
    <li> A must when you are learning to use this type of shaving system, this product works fast! Should last a long long time!</li>
    <li> I had no idea of what this was going to do. My mate put me onto this and it is great to use on all nicks. Amazing</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin. I use the alum after shaving instead of  using after shave, and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts so far. I find that alum can dry my skin a little too much so I leave it on my face for a few minutes before rinsing off and following with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to break out after using any kind of after shave (even the non alcoholic ones) because they contain skin irritants like peppermint or strong smelling scents. I&#x27;ve been using this for six months and haven&#x27;t broken out once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small block of alum but lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for 6 months and I&#x27;ve probably only used 1/4 of it. I think this may last me a year or two.</li>
    <li> I love these blocks and have used them for many years. However the last batch had broken and shattered crystal blocks. I did not open them when first received so I could not return them. These are great just make sure you check them when they arrive and send it back if broken in pieces.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fragile, but it really tightens things up after a shave. I use it after applying witch hazel and before aftershave.</li>
    <li> Love the alum block. It stings slightly when I apply it to cuts (still learning how to use a double-edge razor) but it does the job of helping stop the bleeding. Small, but I can see it lasting years (assuming I don&#x27;t drop it and break it).</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. So far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Never used this stuff or a styptic pen before. Accidently grazed my leg shaving and my husband gave me his alum block for the cut. Took a couple swipes and it did sting but sure enough it did the trick better than any bandaid.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like rubbing a hard block on my face after shaving, but this thing has me hooked now. Leaves your face feeling nice and fresh while helping to deal with little nicks and cuts. It lasts a long time too considering how much you pay for it. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 5 months now and have only recently noticed it getting thinner.</li>
    <li> After completing a 3 pass shave this stuff is excellent to soothe your skin.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this to stop nicks.  It also helps me prevent razor burn. Wish amazon did not have a work minimum on reviews.</li>
    <li> The block is cheap but the quality is high. Much better than the off brand versions from the third world.  Just as good as the various hyped brands.</li>
    <li> Works great on small cuts.  Not so great on the big ones.  I would say it works on 98% of my cuts.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Def. recommend. closes pores and stops and bleeding.  Also lets you know where you were shaving incorrectly as it will give a small amount of burn there.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than the small details!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. I&#x27;d recommend buying one of these and it should last years</li>
    <li> Block is good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be aware it may arrive smashed to pieces.  I got a refund and ordered a second one which was also smashed to pieces.</li>
    <li> Does stop bleeding quickly, however I really don&#x27;t see any other benefits.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s a block of alum. Do you need alum? This is a block of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best after shave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Would love it if a case were included for this small block of Alum. Nice value though for this solid piece. Gives you feedback on how well you&#x27;re shaving and what irritation you&#x27;re causing on the skin that you cannot see.</li>
    <li> the alum block works well,great astringent.it does eliminate any razor burn.</li>
    <li> This alum is great! Does a great job calming your face down after a straight razor shave. It also seems to clear your skin from acne due to it being a slight antiseptic. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Great way to close pores at the end of a shave.  The alum block isn&#x27;t a substitute for a styptic pencil for closing nicks but works well on small weepers.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic to use after a shave. You simply wet your face and rub the Alum where you shaved. This will cause any small nicks or cuts to clot and seal up. Unlike Stypic, you won&#x27;t be left with chalk-like marks on your face. It stings a little bit, but I believe it has antibacterial properties which are helpful to keep away razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me walk you through my post-shave routine to give you an idea. First I rinse my face with water to remove any remaining lather. Second, I clean my face with Witch Hazel in order to reduce inflammation and to really clean the shaved area. Then I wet the Alum and apply it. Once my face is dry, I apply my aftershave and I am good to go. It seems like a bit of a hassle, but my face feels fresh and clean for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid addition to any shave routine, and it will definitely help you reduce post-shave complications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
    <li> Great alum block to seal up and disinfect those nicks during a wet shave. Just the right size and has lasted quite a while - this has become my go-to quality alum block. Beware of other alum blocks that start to get coarse after some use.</li>
