      <li>not as easy to use as described</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you peel it off.</li>
      <li>I tried it, and as I peeled the mask off, it pulled the fine hairs.</li>

      <li>Works great but takes sometime to dry.</li>
      <li>This stuff works to clean out oil-filled pores in my forehead.  </li>
      <li>they pull out some impurities, but for the most part, they aren&#x27;t really doing anything that a mud mask wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
      <li>Came quick.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that has worked amazingly.</li>
      <li>It does hurt some when you start pulling around your mouth, but it&#x27;s worth the couple seconds of pain.</li>
      <li>totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It left my skin really soft and worked great at cleaning my pores.</li>
      <li>The mask was very fun to use and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Peels right off</li>
      <li>but jesus blesses you with a bootyfull face right after the pain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super fun &amp; even better, it actually works.</li>
      <li>while that I get from Sephora, not only is this one much, much cheaper it far more effective.  </li>
      <li>My face feels so soft and clean after one use!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was also very fast.</li>
      <li>Not sure how much better this is to other masks but looks cool on ur face lol</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset !</li>
      <li>Will definitely get more when this runs out.</li>
      <li>There are no instructions included, but if you read the product information on-line it tells you to use after a hot shower.  </li>
      <li>And then 45 after a hot shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
      <li>It was very satisfying(in the weirdest/ickiest way) to look at all the gunk that was pulled out!</li>
      <li>Makes my skin clean and soft!</li>
      <li>I washed my face with my normal Philosophy cleanser and applied an inexpensive Korean cucumber fabric face mask to calm and moisturize my skin.</li>
      <li>I have searched for so long for something to get rid of my blackheads on my nose,the top of my cheeks and on my chin from scrubs to pore strips</li>
      <li>It does pull the plugs out of your skin, but you need to be sure to apply a thick enough amount so it can get a good hold.  </li>
      <li>this certainly sticks to your face.</li>
      <li>in 20 when I finally just washed what did not dry off with warm water.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you put a very think layer and wait for it to completely dry, (avoid your hairs!)</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for blackheads.</li>
      <li>I recommend not using on the whole face, just target areas.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t really suck out the clogs in your pores as they suggest.</li>
      <li>I really like this one</li>
      <li>works really well, but you have to put a lot on to make it easier to remove it</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really get all the blackheads</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t extract any kind of back head or white head, dirt ext.</li>
      <li>It feels as if I&#x27;ve used the sea breeze deep clean.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take out every clogged poor but it did a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>From black heads to pores that had to many hairs.</li>
      <li>The trick to this mask is to exfoliate face before and open the pores (either in s hot shower or a hot towel).</li>
      <li>Friendly tip: make sure to put it on thick!</li>
      <li>Have to put a very thick layer on for good results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to products on my face but have not had any issues with this mask at all.</li>
      <li>But when I and a friend tried this, it only REALLY hurt!</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft after I use this!  </li>
      <li>Once you take it off your skin is very soft and feels very tight and clean!</li>
      <li>The postive was it made my face really soft.</li>
      <li>It made my skin soft though.</li>
      <li>It made my face really soft.</li>
      <li>I have just used this face mask once so far</li>
      <li>which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My face has gotten really soft and my face looks brighter and cleaner than before.</li>
      <li>Still worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>First one layer and let it dry completely.</li>
      <li>I used two layers and let the first dry before adding the second</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> they don&#x27;t really suck out the clogs in your pores as they suggest. just made my hands turn black. they pull out some impurities, but for the most part, they aren&#x27;t really doing anything that a mud mask wouldn&#x27;t do. I guess you get what you pay for! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for blackheads. VERY VERY VERY painful to get off once it dried. Painful to the point of washing it off with water. The postive was it made my face really soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff SUCKS ! It broke my face out ! I&#x27;m very upset !</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really get all the blackheads but it picked up the dead skin and dirt. It made my skin soft though.</li>
    <li> Removes small hair out of the nose only. Not effective, messy and takes nothing of the skin.</li>
    <li> This beats the biore strips. It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you peel it off. I use it all over my face and it picks up all sorts of blackheads and whiteheads. I use it once a week and it keeps it free from blemishes.</li>
    <li> The mask was very fun to use and the shipping was fast. I used it with my daughter , and she loved it . It made my face really soft. However, it didn&#x27;t take out any blackheads from my nose like I thought it would.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to using the biore nose strips for my blackheads.</li>
    <li> Because the item description was difficult to understand, I decided to read the reviews of other customers who&#x27;ve used the product. I have to say, the product does work!! I took a hot shower, pat dried my face and applied the first thin layer. I waited between 10-15 minutes before applying the second thin layer and then waited between 30-45 minutes. My face felt stiff and the outer layer was thoroughly dried. I began at the sides of my face and chin to peel of the mask. I began by peeling the edges first and then pulling very slowly, sort of letting the mask raise off the skin. Then, after peeling off the entire mask, I saw the white and black heads that were there. Really gross! I finished with a toner and moisturizer. My skin was visible red, nothing that a few minutes of air didn&#x27;t relieve. The trick to this mask is to exfoliate face before and open the pores (either in s hot shower or a hot towel). Then pat face dry and apply a thin layer. Please be patient!! Allow the mask to be able to be absorbed into the pores.</li>
    <li> hurts like hell when you take it off. but jesus blesses you with a bootyfull face right after the pain. PAIN IS BEAUTY my brothas so watch on out!</li>
    <li> Very nice, smells great and works great, I will be buying more soon :)</li>
    <li> Everything is good, thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!! Yes, it takes 2 coats to be able to peel off, but this mask pulls out all the gunk &amp; crap many other masks don&#x27;t (even the super expensive ones). It does hurt some when you start pulling around your mouth, but it&#x27;s worth the couple seconds of pain. I use this at least once a week &amp; my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. Don&#x27;t even waste your money. If I could give it less than 1 star I would.</li>
    <li> Still experimenting and looking for results.</li>
    <li> Pulled all my black heads out. Friendly tip: make sure to put it on thick!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Works great!  Make sure you slab it on though!</li>
    <li> so sticky, it slip to my mouth when i put on my nose</li>
    <li> I have always terrible blackheads on my nose and large pores on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried pore strips, exfoliants and even the expensive Glam Glow Super Mud. I bought this on a whim because of the price point. I figured what did I have to lose. It&#x27;s basically a dupe for the $30 Boscia black face mask. I read a bunch of reviews and applied it as recommended from other buyers. First one layer and let it dry completely. Then a second layer and I let it sit for about 30 minutes. Yes it hurts to pull off, but seriously suck it up. It&#x27;s not that bad. I could not believe how much dead skin and junk was removed. My nose looked better than it has in forever! I did notice I had quite a few breakouts right after pulling it off. I don&#x27;t know if it was just irritation, or sometimes when all the crap comes to the surface your skin explodes before looking better. I washed my face with my normal Philosophy cleanser and applied an inexpensive Korean cucumber fabric face mask to calm and moisturize my skin. I will definitely be using this in my skincare routine!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;d have better results sticking duct tape to my face.</li>
    <li> I chose 1 star because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to leave zero. my friend and I tried this product together and it did not work to remove anything but a little facial hair and turn my forehead out into a huge field of small bumps. Had to run out and get a professional facial.</li>
    <li> Just came today. I opened it, put a thick layer on a few spots on my face and my t zone and nose. this works nicely. it works like biore. you have to use a thick layer for it to work properly and you MUST let it dry completely. There&#x27;s no scent, which is nice. left my skin soft after I peeled it off. Yes a little was left behind for me to wipe off with a damp wash cloth but with most peel offs that happens. no big deal. I really like this one and I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Works OK, a little messy though</li>
    <li> I used this stuff on my T-zone where I get black heads, so much grossness came out of my pores when I used this. It was very satisfying(in the weirdest/ickiest way) to look at all the gunk that was pulled out!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as awesome as I had heard from others, but maybe I just have a cleaner face lol</li>
    <li> This black mask takes 2 coats, first 15 min. And then 45 after a hot shower. But when I and a friend tried this, it only REALLY hurt! Especially on our cheeks! It just ripped off skin and left everything else (blackheads, etc.) And made me swell up, along with dried out skin. When I tried to redo the mask the next day it gave me a purple-reddish rash. The boxes are 100% NOT ENGLISH, so I had to look up the instructions. I Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works great removed all my blackheads and made my pores much smaller I would definitely recommend this to every one who has problems with acne etc...</li>
    <li> Just used this with a group of friends tonight and it works amazingly! It hurt a little to peel it off but once we did it was well worth it. My face has never felt softer and seeing the dirt pulled from my face was an eye opener. Extremely happy with this product</li>
    <li> This was horrible.  It took me forever to wash off. The picture looks like it is a peel but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Just after taking the mask off. It feels as if I&#x27;ve used the sea breeze deep clean. That instant cold tingle feeling you get from the sea breeze. Wish you could do like a .5 cause it&#x27;s more like a 4.5 stars. Not a full 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - absolutely grabbed everything. From black heads to pores that had to many hairs. Made my face look clean. A bit red. But nothing air and lotion didn&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - not to be pulled off slowly. Once you get a piece keep pulling until it comes off or breaks.&lt;br /&gt;And this certainly sticks to your face. Clean or not, I&#x27;m sure it will break down the dirty and stick like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alway test facial products on the bad of my hand first. It&#x27;s always recommended by make-up consultants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I followed up with simple sensitive skin cleansing facial wipes. Took the rest of the stuff off like it was still a soapy water substance.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful! My skin is so soft after I use this!  Will definitely get more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> hard to place on when it droops out of the thing for me to get and so gloopy</li>
    <li> Works great but takes sometime to dry.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 20 stars!! Makes my skin clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Not sure how much better this is to other masks but looks cool on ur face lol</li>
    <li> not as easy to use as described</li>
    <li> all info but the name in Chinese, including directions</li>
    <li> it works well, but I don&#x27;t like its smell. I recommend to use Daiso Japan Mask. It works the same way, but has more pleasant smell</li>
    <li> the stuff this mask gets off, insane!</li>
    <li> Be careful with this stuff Once it dries it hurts to pull off, maybe wet it first. The instructions are in mandarin (maybe cantonese) . Works great. I recommend not using on the whole face, just target areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff works to clean out oil-filled pores in my forehead.  It is messy and takes some familiarity to get the application right, but with a little persistence the problem lifts away.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  The box tells you to apply a think layer, wait 10 minutes, and peel off.  However, the mask did not dry in 10 minutes or in 15 minutes or in 20 when I finally just washed what did not dry off with warm water.  The mask was extremely runny.  I did not see dramatic results or any results for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend</li>
    <li> got this and then ordered more love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Peels right off and you can see the grime in the dried mask. I would suggest just using it on your t-zone if you&#x27;re a guy like me. It will get stuck in your facial hair otherwise. My skin feels really smooth after, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or hurt like some masks do, which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> works really well, but you have to put a lot on to make it easier to remove it</li>
    <li> I felt like my skin was being RIPPED off when I was trying to peel this off.  Used it once and threw this out immediately!</li>
    <li> My pores are clean, blackheads are gone, and my skin feels smoother afterwards. Only thing I would suggest NOT doing, is putting it all over your face. I tried it, and as I peeled the mask off, it pulled the fine hairs. And it hurts! Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> I have just used this face mask once so far and I could already tell a big difference! Once you take it off your skin is very soft and feels very tight and clean! It didn&#x27;t take out every clogged poor but it did a pretty good job. Yes it is a little painful to pull off but not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. Make sure you put a very think layer and wait for it to completely dry, (avoid your hairs!) I would recommend and buy it again!</li>
    <li> This product works.  It does pull the plugs out of your skin, but you need to be sure to apply a thick enough amount so it can get a good hold.  Only complaint is that it is a small tube/amount.  Still worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> It works, I do recommend.</li>
    <li> This product did not come with Instruction, the Seller had made great effort to respond with the Instruction via email complete with pictures showing each step. In addition, the Seller had offered to give me credit.</li>
    <li> I applied it in three layers as directed and I love it. My face has gotten really soft and my face looks brighter and cleaner than before. One small disappointment is that it didn&#x27;t remove the blackheads on my nose and much as i thought it would. I will keep using it to see if it will help but the first time it did not do much for my nose but great for my face! I will be sticking with this product for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was also very fast. I hope they will have a bigger bottle because one application uses up a lot in the small bottle that you get.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything. All it did was exfoliate my face and pull small hairs. It didn&#x27;t extract any kind of back head or white head, dirt ext. Even though this product was only a few dollars don&#x27;t waste your time or money. It&#x27;s a totally useless. I think it&#x27;s just a mental thing. You see dead skin on the peel that it. Enough said.</li>
    <li> When I put it on I feel like Batman or something...  It&#x27;s super fun &amp; even better, it actually works. My face feels so soft and clean after one use! I will continue buying this product!</li>
    <li> pulls oils and surface blemishes out well, not great for blackheads though. Have to put a very thick layer on for good results.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I have been using a similar for  while that I get from Sephora, not only is this one much, much cheaper it far more effective.  You can actually see dead skin when you peel it off.  I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to products on my face but have not had any issues with this mask at all.</li>
    <li> This works well for me and did NOT cause any irritation, removed matter from my pores and was easy to use due to other user reviews (thank you all). I used two layers and let the first dry before adding the second and then I added the second layer and let it dry. It pulled a lot of junk free and my nose looks nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will reorder it when I&#x27;ve used all of this.</li>
    <li> This product is ok for some customers, but not for me... it only takes out SOME blackheads. Everyone&#x27;s reviews will be different on these kinds of products I saw, and this one only satisfies me to the point to where I would buy something else cause I need something that&#x27;ll take out EVERY blackhead out of my poor pores... especially my nose. &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I have used this blackhead mask two times this week and it is amazing,after only two uses almost all my blackheads are gone.I have searched for so long for something to get rid of my blackheads on my nose,the top of my cheeks and on my chin from scrubs to pore strips and this is the only product that has worked amazingly. If you put two layers on it peels off easier and gets the blackheads pulled out a lot better,hurts a little to take the mask off but totally worth it. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome! It left my skin really soft and worked great at cleaning my pores. I will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;This is a beauty must have.</li>
    <li> This works so well!  There are no instructions included, but if you read the product information on-line it tells you to use after a hot shower.  (If you try it without the hot shower it does not adhere and dry the same).</li>
    <li> Came quick. But the results were lacking. The product did not remove any blackheads. I&#x27;ll yse my two bottles all the through and update if I see any long term results. But I&#x27;m a few weeks in, and nothing so far.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but it is time consuming for both layers to dry fully before peeling off.</li>
</ol>
