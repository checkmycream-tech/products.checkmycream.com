      <li>i&#x27;m pretty happy with the product, i have a beard</li>
      <li>It takes more time to cut hair</li>
      <li>The stand could be designed better.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is nice and light, and handles the job well.</li>
      <li>It does everything as described and more.  </li>
      <li>It also increases the life of the razor... :)</li>
      <li>I definitely love norelco.</li>
      <li>Let me begin by stating I love this trimmer kit.</li>
      <li>Fact is that, even if you have the power adapter plugged in to the wall, if it is not fully charged you will NOT be able to cut.</li>
      <li>Else, you better off get everything separately.</li>
      <li>Feels good: sleek and powerful.</li>
      <li>and so I had to wait with hair patches till the thing was charged again to be able to finish the cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to use the groomer 3-4 times before I have to recharge it.</li>
      <li>This works okay, just don&#x27;t like purchasing items from Communist countries.</li>
      <li>All its pieces fit nicely into the storage tray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just stating they could have designed the charger/holder a bit better.</li>
      <li>but this has been the overall best.</li>
      <li>This battery trimmer works fine for me and for the price it is even better.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;The package that this groomer comes is concise, the usability is great.</li>
      <li>Straight up, good deal.</li>
      <li>Itz very light weight and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The while the plastic addition is flimsy, it snaps together and can be changed easily.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer is light-weight, easy to use, and all the attachments work as described.</li>
      <li>Easy to use amd</li>
      <li>The attachments are easy to use.</li>
      <li>But the great feature about this is the many different ways you could use this trimmer.</li>
      <li>the charging system is easy and cleaning is easy.</li>
      <li>As well, they all seem to work fine.</li>
      <li>Battery still lasts, clippers work fine, etc.</li>
      <li>easy to use, easy to clean, no snags.</li>
      <li>All with one, twenty-dollar (relatively cheap) unit.</li>
      <li>Overall I must say that I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The handle and heads are easy to clean after use.</li>
      <li>No indicator light - nothing.</li>
      <li>The results have been fantastic.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like the feel of this cheap set of tools.</li>
      <li>Instead of going to the barber for an hour and spending money every 4 weeks, I bought this cheap trimmer and cut my hair myself in 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I trim my ears and nose by the sound of it clipping the hair, then look in the mirror.</li>
      <li>It comes with a cheap charging stand holder.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been good for trimming between haircuts.  </li>
      <li>The battery life is pretty good out of the box, and all of the tools work well at first.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for the past 10 years (literally) and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>We use it to trim our 4-year old son&#x27;s hair and it works perfectly for that as well as facial hair, etc.  </li>
      <li>Though I have just used it majorly once, I am very satisfied with the look &amp; use of this.</li>
      <li>I use it regularly (at least 2 times a week) and has always worked excellent!</li>
      <li>Could it be true?</li>
      <li>On top of all of this, I don&#x27;t treat it particularly well -</li>
      <li>exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction</li>
      <li>The recharger cord was backordered and a new one didn&#x27;t cost that much more, so I just went ahead and bought it.  </li>
      <li>This one doesnt exactly give as close a shave as a razor blade but still good enough if you repeat the process.</li>
      <li>BUT... MAKE SURE YOU CHARGE IT COMPLETELY BEFORE USE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this groomer. It does its job well. Charge lasts for a long time. Itz very light weight and easy to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t fully used all its features, yet i am satisfied with this buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for 4 years now and it&#x27;s great. Battery still lasts, clippers work fine, etc. Really happy with it and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I owned another one for several years but lost the recharger cord when I moved.  The recharger cord was backordered and a new one didn&#x27;t cost that much more, so I just went ahead and bought it.  Now I have 2 that I can use!  Lots of options for close cuts.</li>
    <li> It did it&#x27;s job.  Like all rechargeable electronics, the battery will go eventually.  It was good while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by stating I love this trimmer kit. It&#x27;s perfect for everything from beards, nosehairs, shaving all your hair off, you name it. It&#x27;s simple, but efficient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one problem would be the way it plugs in to the charger. It has to be aligned perfectly, and if it isn&#x27;t, it won&#x27;t charge. I actually thought it was broken and almost sent it back for just this reason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The exact positioning on the charger issue isn&#x27;t a reason not to get it though.  It&#x27;ll charge w/o a problem.  I&#x27;m just stating they could have designed the charger/holder a bit better.</li>
    <li> Having interchangeable heads is a good idea. The handle and heads are easy to clean after use. As well, they all seem to work fine. the only complaint I have is the base that holds the handle is too \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot;. The charger connector has to be positioned just right and inserted in the stand just so, so as to charge the handle in that base. It&#x27;s too light and is difficult to set on a countertop. It is probably easier to just plug the chord connector directly into the handle lay the handle on the countertop and bypass the base altogether.</li>
    <li> This unit is terrific.  It does everything as described and more.  We use it to trim our 4-year old son&#x27;s hair and it works perfectly for that as well as facial hair, etc.  Great deal at $15.99.  Seems to hold a charge a very long time.</li>
    <li> Though I have just used it majorly once, I am very satisfied with the look &amp; use of this. It is compact, sits in my bathroom corner &amp; the battery life is long enough to take care of most of the things you want to do at one time.</li>
    <li> I bought this last December, so Ive been using it for 8 months now.  I don&#x27;t grow a beard, so I&#x27;ve been using it to cut my hair instead.  It saved me money from going to the barber because I like my hair short, since my hair is thin it doesn&#x27;t look right when it&#x27;s long, so I cut short very often with these trimmers. It works out good.  The only problems are that: &lt;br /&gt;you cannot use it when plugged in, &lt;br /&gt;it may run out of power on you, &lt;br /&gt;you must remove trimmings from comb often due to its \\&quot;cupped\\&quot; design &lt;br /&gt;you must be very careful about the blue plastic head because it is very flimsy and it will break if you drop it. &lt;br /&gt;I recommend removing and storing the plastic head somewhere.  I just broke mine, and I need to get warranty service for it.  I guess overall, it saved me time and money.  Instead of going to the barber for an hour and spending money every 4 weeks, I bought this cheap trimmer and cut my hair myself in 30 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the best, but it&#x27;s cost efficient for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feel of this cheap set of tools. And there are a million things to store. I didn&#x27;t want to give all that junk the space it needed even though it comes with a stand for holding the 18 million parts. They even send you a comb -- like I needed another one!  &lt;br /&gt;I set the cheapo one aside and bought a Norelco T970 for about ten bucks more. Feels good: sleek and powerful. And it&#x27;s one simple unit.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m pretty happy with the product, i have a beard and i shave my head and it does the job well. and since the price was really low as well, i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved this grooming-trimming set. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Later I found this product on the shelf in \\&quot;Linen n Things\\&quot; shop for the same price. I prefer to buy it from the Retail shop if I am paying the same price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The G290 seems to be a better/latest product in this range. I would have bought that from Amazon but it was out of stock.</li>
    <li> This product delivers the results of a very poor quality. I&#x27;ve been using a similar item from Conair for about a year, but decided to experiment with Norelco. It was a bad idea. It takes more time to cut hair and I was not able to achieve the quality of Conair unit. The nose piece doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
    <li> This suits me perfectly. Especially since I shave only once a week. It helps in reducing the number of times I have to use the razor every time I shave. It also increases the life of the razor... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback being the working voltage. Where I come from 110VAC is non existent. Maybe they should try other alternative convertion methods. This is why 4 stars only.</li>
    <li> exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper.  So far it&#x27;s been good for trimming between haircuts.  The attachments work as well.</li>
    <li> In terms of money for years of use, this trimmer is the best thing I have purchased in my lifetime.    I bought it about 10 years ago, for $16 (on sale) at Walmart.    For $16, I expected it to last for a year or two, but it has been going strong this entire time.    It&#x27;s been to France, Germany, the UK, 20+ US states and Canada in this time - and has never let me down.    I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who is looking for a good trimmer/ groomer.    Maybe I just got the golden version of this product - but it far surpassed my expectations - especially for $16.    On top of all of this, I don&#x27;t treat it particularly well - I just rinse it in water when I&#x27;m done with it, and put it back on the shelf.  I&#x27;ve never done any maintenance to it, and it continues to work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I owned a Wahl trimmer before and decided to try out the Norelco Trimmer coz of its price. I only use the trimmer occassionally. The trimmer is nice and light, and handles the job well. Even liked the nose trimmer attachment. The battery charger however, is a piece of junk. I had followed instructions and charged the unit for the first time as indicated in the manual. I used the trimmer a couple of times after that till the charge ran out. When I tried to recharge it, it just died out. No indicator light - nothing. It looks pretty, but is anything but sturdy. I switched back to my Wahl trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this trimmer when I first ordered it for touchups at work, but let me assure you, it does much of the same work of it&#x27;s more pricey cousins with a few bonuses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Although I don&#x27;t have a problem with nose hair, the nose hair attachment works perfectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- The beard trimmer is the same as on the pricier cousins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- The hair trimming guard works very well for cutting hair, or for shaving your head during hot summer days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- The petite detail trimmer is great for more accurate trimming situations like mustaches. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one failing of this trimmer is how the different heads attach to the base. It&#x27;s a little clumsy and will often come detached when trying to change blade length. It&#x27;s also a fair bit more difficult to blow hair caught in the trimming blades, unlike it&#x27;s pricier cousins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will not be replacing my more expensive home Norelco Trimmer after it dies. This little wonder does everything I need and wont bum me out if it breaks. It is the best investment for the money you can make.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this trimmer... easy to use, easy to clean, no snags.</li>
    <li> Philips/Norelco trimmers have been made in Austria and Hungary for many years, but now they&#x27;ve succumbed to the lure of cheap Chinese manufacturing.  Next it will be the shavers.  This works okay, just don&#x27;t like purchasing items from Communist countries.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really expect a lot from this all purpose groomer since it is cheap; it is basically jack-of-all-trade but master of none. Its performance is just above average, good enough for normal use, but won&#x27;t satisfy you if you have high expectation. Overall I must say that I am happy with this product. So if you are like me, not really picky and just want to have it all cheap in one package, then this might be the groomer you need. Else, you better off get everything separately.</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this product to use it a beard trimmer as I am allergic to the normal razors or rotary blade trimmers. This one doesnt exactly give as close a shave as a razor blade but still good enough if you repeat the process. But the great feature about this is the many different ways you could use this trimmer. i can trim my hair between hair cuts and avoid frequent trips to the barber shop. the charging system is easy and cleaning is easy.</li>
    <li> I quite liked this trimmer while it worked well, so I&#x27;m disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months.  As of now the battery will hold barely any charge, if at all.  It&#x27;s frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this same model (though may be different construction by now) for well over five years. It&#x27;s turned out to be one of the best values I&#x27;ve ever encountered for men&#x27;s shaving products. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid at the time, but it was certainly cheap enough that I though, \\&quot;well, even if I get a year or so out of it...\\&quot;.    My primary usage has been to shorten beard, trim/line mustache area, sideburns, and the nose/ear attachment, at least twice a week. After all these years of use, the battery charge is still phenomenal, and the blades are sharp enough to do the job and not pull hair. As I was hunting for the charger this evening, the though occurred to me that this is only the second time I&#x27;ve pulled out the charger since moving to this place, which means I&#x27;ve only charged this shaver TWICE in a year. That alone makes this a great product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good trimer for my beard. I was also looking for a nose and ear hair trimmer. I came across this set and it had both items I was looking for in one package. When I received the trimmer it was packaged in a clear plastic casing. It comes with a cheap charging stand holder. The item worked better than expected. It trimed my beard well. The nose hair came off without pain. The set is light weight and the case holder not the best, In fact it was slightly difficult to put the plug into the charging stand. I liked the set since it does work well. In fact, I bought an extra one to give as a gift to my brother in law.</li>
    <li> This product is not suitable. It rarely keeps a charged battery after days and days of charging, and the clippers become so hot that you almost burn your face. I would not recomend this product to anyone.I am currently seeking reimburstment.</li>
    <li> This battery trimmer works fine for me and for the price it is even better.  The battery seems to last quite long, I am not sure why others say it does not.  Straight up, good deal.</li>
    <li> I have bought many products on Amazon, this one of the best purchases I have made.  &lt;br /&gt;The package that this groomer comes is concise, the usability is great. The attachments are easy to use. The instructions are very clear. &lt;br /&gt;This is the the best bargain you would have made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if this product is valued &amp;lt; $15, go for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only down side of this groomer is that this can not be used as a CORDED shaver/groomer. After the charge goes down, you need to charge the same for an hour before you can re-use the same. So, remember to know when you last charged and re-charge the same periodically. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Look all groomed with this purchase...</li>
    <li> For the most part, this groomer has worked very well, but I only have one gripe. The deal you use to change lengths of cutting used to snap on and move very smoothly. Now I have to almost force it on and to move positions. Taking it off will remove the entire blade, so I gotta be very careful with it. I just hate it doesnt slide on and off and work as smoothly anymore. That&#x27;s my only gripe.</li>
    <li> I think I purchased this about 5 years ago. It is a trimer , works like one, looks like one and acts like one. The only real issue? The battery has a very short life span and needs to be fully charged too often for my usage. I still have and use it , but if you get one, make sure you are always near an outlet.</li>
    <li> Why expensive product?, like the title saids all purpose, It is great, cheap, and comes with amazing accesories.</li>
    <li> I had an electric razor years ago by Norelco that I really liked, but when it quit working I just kept using the electric hair clippers followed by razor blades. When the hair clippers quit I knew it was time to get a new one. The results have been fantastic. This electric groomer gets closer than the hair clippers did and with the other attachments it gets better results than my first Norelco. I use the product for shaving my face and head before I use blades and it&#x27;s made it a lot easier. Being able to use it without keeping it plugged in all the time is also a big plus. Seeing that I shave my head too I haven&#x27;t used the hair clipper attachment on myself, but got fair results when using it on my nephews who have pretty thick hair. I&#x27;m able to use the groomer 3-4 times before I have to recharge it. My opinion, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for this price so why pay more for other similar products.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer does it all when it comes to keeping a beard and mustache neat.  It also comes wth a nose and ear trimmer that does a great job as well. If you&#x27;ve got a thick beard, like mine, it&#x27;ll need a bit of cleaning during your trim but for the money this is a super product. &lt;br /&gt;Thumbs Up</li>
    <li> This item is great if you want to trim short hair cuts, good value for a great price. Lots of accessories, even a nose hair trimer! BUT... MAKE SURE YOU CHARGE IT COMPLETELY BEFORE USE! I thought that if I used it with the power adapter, it would cut even if it was not fully charged. Fact is that, even if you have the power adapter plugged in to the wall, if it is not fully charged you will NOT be able to cut. This sux if you are in the middle of a haircut and you run out of juice. (happened to me) and so I had to wait with hair patches till the thing was charged again to be able to finish the cut. Maybe I should have read the instructions, but I&#x27;ve had other rechargable battery clippers in the past and as long as you had it plugged it would work even if it was not fully charged.   &lt;br /&gt;This is a big flaw for me and that&#x27;s why I take away 2 stars. Other than that the machine is great, Cipper sizes are very good, stable, convenient/all in one. Good product that could be better if the battery/power options were improved.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a cordless unit that requires you to fully drain the battery before recharging it again. This is very inconvenient and I would have prefered a corded unit to this. Other than that, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, versatile, and works well.</li>
    <li> The charge only lasts a few minutes.  Takes 24+ hours to recharge it.  When it is working, it works well and the attachments are good.  I would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for the holidays and my man loves it.  Easy to use amd the trim is great!</li>
    <li> My father loved this gift. He said it was just the right size not too flashy not too cheap. He uses it all the time. It was a great Father&#x27;s Day buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now and \\&quot;0\\&quot; problems.  All attachments work well and the self sharpening feature reall does work!</li>
    <li> Good razor for the money.  The hair gets caught in the trap of the plastic peice that covers for different thicknesses.  It gets annoying when shaving my head, when there is more hair than shaving my face.  The charging holder doesnt fit the wire for recharging either, but it holds a charge for a long time, so its not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Wish I could find another one of these. I&#x27;ve had one of these for the past 10 years (literally) and it was awesome. I only paid maybe $15 at the time and have used it to trim my facial hair and cut my hair (I keep it very short). It&#x27;s always been great and even broken, it still does the job....just a bit difficult now.</li>
    <li> Before I start, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m writing this review because when I purchased this from Amazon there were no reviews avaliable to help me decide if it was worth the money. I originally was looking into actual hair clipping kits from brands like Wahl but was a little aprehensive on spending $30 for a clipper that I didn&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;d continue using. I had previously bought a cheap $9 off-brand and the hair clipper died after two dreadful uses in which it nearly rattled itself to peices, so I was a bit leary on buying another, even if it would be from a famous brand like Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across the Norelco G270. I was checking into prices on a beard/mustache trimmer/groomer and they all seemed similar in the fact that you were about guarunteed to pay at leaste $20 on one. If only I could get a hair clipper, I thought, that came with a free trimmer! That would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak, and save me some money. Too bad that the only offer I found like this was from VS Sassoon who was loaded with bad reviews warning future customers from wasting their money. And I wasn&#x27;t about to buy a junk clipper again.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I see that this Norelco model has this clipper comb attachment for cutting hair...on your head! Could it be true? For $20, you were told you&#x27;d be getting a beard/mustache trimmer, with the ability to trim your hair too. No oiling of the blades needed and blades guarunteed to stay sharp. And a 60-day, money-back guaruntee. Hmm. If one brand could pull it off, I thought, it&#x27;d be Norelco. So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I soon recieve it and look in the mirror. About a month and a half&#x27;s worth of hair had grown since my last fairly close-cropped hair cutting, so I had a full head of hair. I pulled out the tiny clipper, wondering if the little battery would die on the first pass. I mean, this was a trimmer, not the chain-saw I needed. Well, I tried it, and immediately noticed I&#x27;d be stopping to shake it out a lot, and it may take a while to chop my hair down to a level I could continue to trim and maintain. It took a while, and wiped the battery dry, but I got it done nonetheless with, I must say, no &amp;quot;pulling&amp;quot; of the hair like my old clipper had done.&lt;br /&gt;I have since used it for trimming and maintaining my short cut (it has nine different lengths, but for the hair on your head the longest is still fairly short) and am glad it survived that first &amp;quot;over-use&amp;quot;. Even though buzz-sawing thick feilds of hair is not really fun with with it (nor is it designed for it) I must say it is cost-effective way to run it over your head and keep a short cut short all the time. Couldn&#x27;t maintian a military-esque cut by running down to the barber shop every week and a half and still have money to pay for gas. It will save you big bucks in the long run, if you like to keep short cuts well-groomed, and will get your beard/gotee facial hairstyle in check. All with one, twenty-dollar (relatively cheap) unit. In two cuts downtown, you&#x27;d have it paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Note: The hair cutting comb seemes to be made of relatively thin plastic and care should be taken as not to snap the guide comb ends off. Not a problem for me, but durability in the long-run will have to be seen. Also, hair builds up quickly in the comb when mowing down thick hair and you may have to repeatedly stop to unattach the comb and shake it out. A full charge takes approximately ten hours for about one-and-a-half hours of run time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job, and if you&#x27;re interested, I wouldn&#x27;t hold you back. Besides, it comes with Norelco&#x27;s 60-day, money-back guaruntee. Hope this helps with your decision-making process.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some time, and I can say the price is really great for the product. Takes care of all the trimming one can need for less than $20. It is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> ...turns out, i didn&#x27;t.  this compact and versatile product does everything it promises and does it well.  i can&#x27;t attest to how it compares to similar, more expensive products, but i don&#x27;t need to: there are plenty of attachments, the battery life is good, and it carries out all the grooming tasks flawlessly.  can&#x27;t beat the value!</li>
    <li> For the low price, this really isn&#x27;t a bad set of grooming tools.  The battery life is pretty good out of the box, and all of the tools work well at first.  Just don&#x27;t expect this to last very long.  After a few months, it has gotten to the point where a full charge barely gets me through 30 seconds of trimming my beard.  And the comb attachments for the trimmer are junk.  One of them broke within a few weeks, and the other one is very \\&quot;jabby\\&quot; on my neck if I don&#x27;t angle the trimmer just right.  I won&#x27;t be buying this unit again, and I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a good gift by any means.  But considering how cheap it was I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> This would work on a back with thin straight hair.  On a man with curly, thick hair, it pulls and hurts.  It does have a suprising amount of juice despite running on only two AA batteries.  Blade is sharp and might work well for a woman who cannot reach down to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> Works very well,for a very low price.</li>
    <li> i bought this trimmer in 2004. the battery is just now going bad. only lasts a short time with less power and&lt;br /&gt;the attachment finally broke some teeth. for the price and lasting 10 years i think i got a steal.  i&#x27;m trying to find one comparable now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to let my mustache and goatee grow out for a few weeks.  Unfortunately, it grows out unevenly so I&#x27;ve decided to trim it.  I went online and found the Norelco G270 with two different attachments for less than $20.  What a deal.  I quickly ordered the unit while keeping in mind that most other trimmers go for $30 and higher so I might be getting a piece of junk.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The while the plastic addition is flimsy, it snaps together and can be changed easily.  The rechargeable battery lasts a week of usage before I need to recharge.  The ear/nose hair remover doesn&#x27;t pull at all and cuts pretty close.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This groomer is very easy to use.  All its pieces fit nicely into the storage tray.  My husband reports that the mustache trimmer works great.  I would recommend this product as a good buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  I have gone thru at least three other brands of clippers over the years but this has been the overall best.</li>
    <li> I bought this a 3 weeks back and as another person had mentioned in his review it doesnt keep the charge int he battery.the battery dies within a minute after i charged it and start using it. I mainly bought it for the nose trimmer and i couldnt use it as i wanted because of the battery charge. i dont know whether if its bcos of defect in the product, but would advise not to buy it.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is light-weight, easy to use, and all the attachments work as described. The stand could be designed better. Overall, it fits my needs and is worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> This is my forth clipper in about 10 years. Each time I went back to manual devices. The one I bought from Brookstone had a very large nose hair trimmer -- nostrils must be \\&quot; diameter to use it. It pulled rather than cut half the hair I aimed it at! The one from a Walgreens also pulled hair and made so much noise I needed ear plugs which made it hard to trim them. It also pull hairs. The one from Sharper Image catalog pulled hairs, was bulky cheap plastic, dull and quite expensive. This Norelco is small, quiet, cheap, and very sharp. I trim my ears and nose by the sound of it clipping the hair, then look in the mirror. Use the mustashe &amp; beard trimmer with care - it is very sharp. The rack to put every thing on is \\&quot;el cheapo\\&quot;...it really needed a travel bag. I found a leather one at the dollar store. All the junk I bought before had nice cases. This time I&#x27;ll settle for the really good equipment.</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in August 2004. I use it regularly (at least 2 times a week) and has always worked excellent! The battery still charges and last a long time. If you are looking for a good and inexpensive trimmer this is the one that you have to get.  I definitely love norelco. I&#x27;ve been using their products since I started shaving back when I was 14. This is a brand that you can trust.</li>
