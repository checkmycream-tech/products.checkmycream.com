      <li>We have to use it for a longer period to be sure.</li>

      <li>Got this on a recommendation from someone and after about a month my nails are better and i think my hair is thicker.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>My understanding is that in some, this process will take more time.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it done wonders.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My nails would split and break and now they are healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>I have had a problem with thinning hair, and my nails seemed to be breaking more easily, BEFORE using these capsules.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to sprout more hair since I have fine hair</li>
      <li>My hair on my head is growing so fast and is so healthy, I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Ordering more right now!</li>
      <li>Love this Product and really notice the difference when I ran out!:-)...</li>
      <li>About my hair: fine, 3b-3c curly hair.</li>
      <li>it worked great but with this its doing the opposite</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have medical conditions it&#x27;ll work great.</li>
      <li>But for the best results I would recommend it to be taken everyday.</li>
      <li>, I only gave the product 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t experienced any strengthening in my nails.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my international award winning stylist and good friend.  </li>
      <li>I had been buying at a health food store AND paying 3 times as much!!!</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t see significant changes by July, I will discontinue use and seek an alternative.</li>
      <li>My hair is also much fuller and easy to manage!  </li>
      <li>I plan to take the vitamin for a full 6 months to ensure that I have given the process plenty of time to work.</li>
      <li>Love this!I really like it.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery of my fav supplement</li>
      <li>So I started using it and every hair that grows out of my body has grown so quickly</li>
      <li>I had a noticeable difference in how quickly my nails were growing.  </li>
      <li>This has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have had to have haircuts more frequently, which is not such a good thing.</li>
      <li>For a natural product im pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>As far as hair, i can&#x27;t tell yet because i colored my hair 2 weeks ago and cut it too, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see a difference in 2 weeks , if it works on nails</li>
      <li>They grow pretty fast, but break easily.</li>
      <li>(that normally always break) are so strong.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately I am so bad at taking pills that I can&#x27;t give it a full five stars since I didn&#x27;t finish taking them, but I am confident in their ability to keep your hair skin and nails at their best!</li>
      <li>My hair was thining and breaking, now it&#x27;s full and growing amazingly fast.  </li>
      <li>They came in super fast too</li>
      <li>I first started taking Purvana in April 2013.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I am not seeing the changes I had hoped for in my hair and skin.</li>
      <li>I must admit I am quite pleased and continue to take Purvana daily.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Purvana!</li>
      <li>If you want longer hair fast get this product!</li>
      <li>The length is consistently between my bra strap and waist line, depending on how often I get it trimmed.  </li>
      <li>But you must take care of your hair first, it will not reverse hair damage.</li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re really cheap on Amazon, initially I found them at my local health food store and they were $24.99, so getting them on Amazon for half the price is an awesome deal!  </li>
      <li>I see results with nails growing but hoping positive results for my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>It took about 2 boxes before I noticed a definite difference, but even my manicurist is impressed with how very hard my nails have gotten.</li>
      <li>My hair is growing at a rate of a inch per month and it&#x27;s so much healthier.</li>
      <li>After 30 days, I was ready to give up because I didn&#x27;t see any hair growth in 30 days.</li>
      <li>but it hasn&#x27;t done much in the way of that for me</li>
      <li>As for my nails, I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
      <li>They are much, much stronger.  </li>
      <li>VERY imporatant vitamin supplement for hair.</li>
      <li>I really encourage people to try it.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much this product.</li>
      <li>It took about 2 months or so for me to really notice a difference in the amount of growth I was getting.</li>
      <li>These pills really do the job on making my hair and nails grow faster.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have spent most of my life trying to get my nails to grow.  I have been using this product for years and my hair is very healthy, as are my nails - and they grow nicely now!</li>
    <li> I was using another similar product that was discontinued by the manufacturer.  After a year, I finally found/tried this product and have been using it for the past two months.  I like that it&#x27;s one pill a day and not multiples and the sheets are much more convenient to store in a purse pocket than a bottle.  I haven&#x27;t been consistent at taking it every day, but still have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that is falling out. (I&#x27;m over 50, and my hair seems stronger and healthier...and it is growing much faster.  The length is consistently between my bra strap and waist line, depending on how often I get it trimmed.  I have recommended the product to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using purvana max on and off for 2-3 yrs and I absolutely love it!!! Im just not good at taking pills consistently but if you are good at it or not it does everything it says its going to do. But for the best results I would recommend it to be taken everyday. It definitely grows an inch per month and gives me stronger nails!!</li>
    <li> VERY imporatant vitamin supplement for hair. When we age, our hair gets thinner. These supplements work!</li>
    <li> Works well!  I especially love the Fo-ti in this product.  Have purchased several times already and will continue...Longer and thicker hair.  Less loss, too.  I&#x27;ve tried many hair/skin/nails products, and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using these supplements for 5-6 months now. I rarely forget to take it everyday. My hair has grown at least an inch or maybe more each month - so im very pleased. If you want longer hair fast get this product! I was hoping to sprout more hair since I have fine hair but it hasn&#x27;t done much in the way of that for me but im looking closer at my diet for a solution there. Also shedding is about the same for me. As for my nails, I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement but I blame my bad habit of biting my cuticles for my brittle nails. For a natural product im pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t feel any side effects at all. About my hair: fine, 3b-3c curly hair. I order this from amazon because they have the best price.</li>
    <li> This stuff will work. Just give it time. I have been taking this for sometime now.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 1 month and a half.  I can tell a difference with the thickness and the length.  I cut my hair the beginning of October in a short bob near my ear and now my hair is 2 inches below my ear.  I will recommend it to anyone who want thicker hair.  But you must take care of your hair first, it will not reverse hair damage.</li>
    <li> Its great ,l would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2 months now and have not noticed any change in my hair, nails, or skin. Too bad!</li>
    <li> After 3 month i&#x27;ve been used this product, There is a noticeable difference in the feel and look of my hair. great n&#x27; cheap product but worked amazing.</li>
    <li> Purvana works!  I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my international award winning stylist and good friend.  He said that my hair would grow like never before, also another friend who has been using the product for years said that it worked wonders for her. So I started using it and every hair that grows out of my body has grown so quickly and my nails (that normally always break) are so strong.  My hair on my head is growing so fast and is so healthy, I love this stuff! It took about one month for me to see results and I definitely do.  Ordering more right now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken this 3 months and have started a 4th. My hair loss has not slowed done nor has my hair thickened. I have frizzy prickly hair since taking this, much like my hair was when I took shen min. I&#x27;ve been told that fo-ti root has a high estrogen content and the high hormones are adding to the havoc that is my hair loss. I was hoping the low dose of fo -ti including in this formula would give me some benefit but so far it hasn&#x27;t. Will give it another 30 days and update.</li>
    <li> my skin is softer, nails are harder and my hair fuller. This product does what it claims! i will order again.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing at a rate of a inch per month and it&#x27;s so much healthier.My nails would split and break and now they are healthy and strong.I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not only can I see a difference, so can my hairdresser!  My hair was thining and breaking, now it&#x27;s full and growing amazingly fast.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my weak nails and will definitely buy again. Nails haven&#x27;t broken off nearly as much before and eventually not at all in the tough work it do.</li>
    <li> A friend is using it and he thinks is great. We have to use it for a longer period to be sure.</li>
    <li> Purvana max is a good product, my skin looks more youthful ,my nails are growing &amp;my hair is growing BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Purvana max Hair for a little over a month but i already feel that the amount of hair that is coming out when i shower is much less. So that is why I am very happy with Purvana Max and want to continue to use it to see if my hair begins to grow back and thicken. Have my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> The best hair, skin, and nails vitamin.  I have been using it for year.  Tried others but didn&#x27;t do as well and upset my stomach.</li>
    <li> Got this on a recommendation from someone and after about a month my nails are better and i think my hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is a great! My nails are harder and my hair is stronger. I love this product and it done wonders.</li>
    <li> I have used this on &amp; off for years. My hair completely quit falling out &amp; is growing &amp; my nails are growing so fast I have to file them every week!</li>
    <li> I first started taking Purvana in April 2013. After 30 days, I was ready to give up because I didn&#x27;t see any hair growth in 30 days. However, my nails grew.  Ninety (90) days later, my hair has grown substantially. I will admit I have faithfully taken Purvana as well as kept any heat off my hair. I must admit I am quite pleased and continue to take Purvana daily.</li>
    <li> Good, I like it. I bought it for my girl friend.</li>
    <li> This is my second review on Purvana Hair,Skin &amp; Nails products. The other review is attatched to the 90 count bottle of Purvana Hair,Skin &amp; Nails that are both being posted today. I will never buy this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone. This stuff made my hair fall out even worse than what it was. I look nearly bald with the exception of some peach fuzz and a few clumps of hair hear and there! I am a woman and should not be balding. I took this product from Jan 2014 on through to July 2014 and still no new hair. If after taking this for 6 months and I don&#x27;t have results then there is something wrong here. And I have been to doctors about my hair loss which is why I bought the supplements. I got ripped off!! I spent alot of money for nothing. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> ~Wonderful product, suggested to me by a nutritional counselor.  Due to autoimmune issues, my hair falls out at times, this is the first product that GREW hair back.  Stick with it and in about 3 months you will see lovely results !</li>
    <li> I used this product for 30 days and, lo and behold, I have nails again!  My hair is also much fuller and easy to manage!  Thanks, Purvana!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I hardly ever right reviews  because opinions are so diverse,  but this product is no less than amazing.  My hair was suffering from TE.....which is extreme hair shedding due to stress and emotional trauma.  This product was my saving grace until the shedding stoped.  Now I still use it. I have stopped chemically treating my hair for over a year and along with this product I have hair like the Pantene commercial girls. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Love this Product and really notice the difference when I ran out!:-)...Aloha, Nicky</li>
    <li> Four of my nails were splitting down the center up to the flesh area.  After finishing one month I could see the improvement.  I have almost finished 3 months and my nails are beautiful.  The lady that does my nails could not believe how great my nails are now.</li>
    <li> I have taken this product for 6 weeks now.  I noticed an improvement in a split fingernail within one week.  The nail continues to improve and I think my thin hair is showing an improvement in strength also.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing like a weed and nails have less ridges. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery of my fav supplement</li>
    <li> I TOOK THESE FOR ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I REALLY REALLY NOTICED A DIFFERENCE.  I WENT THROUGH RADICAL CHEMO AND AFTER TAKING THESE FOR A FEW MONTHS MY HAIR REALLY STARTED TO GROW AND BECOME A LITTLE BIT THICKER.  MY NAILS WERE ALSO STRONGER.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and when I take a break my nails start &amp;#34; breaking&amp;#34; &amp; chipping!</li>
    <li> I love these pills, they make my hair feel like they&#x27;re on steroids. They came in super fast too</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference in the feel and look of my hair.</li>
    <li> The best thing i had buy, i recomend them to my daugthers to, wonderfull!!</li>
    <li> This vitamin works well.  Not only does it grow the hair it also thickens the hair as well.</li>
    <li> I was suggested this brand of vitamins at my health food store. I have had no reactions or negative side effects.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I have been using this for 10 months along with NOT eating meat and dairy. Also take saw palmetto and then using essential oil ylang ylang in an aleo vera spray every other day. At night (3 times a week) I use essential oil rosemary plus castor or coconut oil. Then once a week (weekend) I use a clay mask on my hair to detox....Also use a marrocco method shampoos and add melaluca (or tea tree) oil in my shampoo. My hair is GROWING coming in.This product has all the B complex plus the extra biotin healthy hair needs and my energy level is wonderful..,,FWI Hair is the last to receive nutrition from the food we put in our body..... My hair is twice as thick as last year at this time. I was going bald and thats emarrassing for a lady.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and so far I&#x27;ve noticed my nails gotten so white and long and strong! As far as hair, i can&#x27;t tell yet because i colored my hair 2 weeks ago and cut it too, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see a difference in 2 weeks , if it works on nails it&#x27;s definitely working on hair too and skin, just need a little patience:)</li>
    <li> Love these vitamins! They are affordable, have greaAr ingredients, and they work!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewer, My nails have split and broken more since I started this product. I might try the 2500 purvana next and see if that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> The best vitamin by far.</li>
    <li> I am TOTALLY satisfied with this product. I had been buying at a health food store AND paying 3 times as much!!! I have had a problem with thinning hair, and my nails seemed to be breaking more easily, BEFORE using these capsules. It took about 2 boxes before I noticed a definite difference, but even my manicurist is impressed with how very hard my nails have gotten. I am noticing little &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair coming in where my hair was thinning. This may not work for everbody, but as for me...I COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this pill on &amp; off for the past yr &amp; a 1/2. The 1st month my hair literally grew about 2 inches quicker than it normally would in a month. Now that hasn&#x27;t always been the same results for me as you know our hair does grow faster or slower according to the season that were in. I love this pill...remember you&#x27;ve got to give something a try for over a month to see the results.</li>
    <li> I love the purvana vitamins. Ever since i take them my hair has stopped falling. When i dont take them my hair starts to fall again. Thank you so much this product.</li>
    <li> I has been very slow in registering results.  I don&#x27;t think it works very well, but will keep trying for another few months.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Major improvement in hair quality and nails.  Extremely pleased. Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed. I had thin bangs and was losing hair daily, alot of hair. This has helped tremendously. Also my nails are growing faster and stronger.</li>
    <li> I think that this did make my hair grow and softer too. One pill is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now, and I must say it is working very well! My hair is growing very quick and very thick. It took about 2 months or so for me to really notice a difference in the amount of growth I was getting. I could tell that the texture and strength of my hair was improving as well. I am very impressed with the impact it has had on the health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I only gave the product 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t experienced any strengthening in my nails. They grow pretty fast, but break easily. My skin hasn&#x27;t had any dramatic changes either. I don&#x27;t experience breakouts so I wasnt expecting much difference with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product. I initially bought my first box at my local health food store and it cost me $23. I have ordered it several times from Amazon for $16 or less, with free shipping. I am going to continue using it. My hair loves it and I do too!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have medical conditions it&#x27;ll work great. But I guess with my med. condition, it didn&#x27;t work as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for years.  A few times I&#x27;ve run out or decided I don&#x27;t really need them, only to have my hair get super dull and coarse in a matter of a couple of months.  I&#x27;m not sure if they make my hair grow/thicker or anything, but I definitely feel like my skin is brighter and my hair is shinier and softer when I take them.  I&#x27;ve tried other hair/skin/nails pills and either had no results or had breakouts (biotin can mess with your skin), but have never had any side effects from these.</li>
    <li> Love this!I really like it. I had friends try this and get great results for using it. I really encourage people to try it.</li>
    <li> I had tried their previous formula. it worked great but with this its doing the opposite my nails are breaking more than usual!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beginning my 3rd month of taking Purvana Max. I&#x27;ve seen a change in my nails. They are much, much stronger.  Unfortunately, I am not seeing the changes I had hoped for in my hair and skin. Thankfully, I am not experiencing issues with shedding or breakage as described by others. I expected that my hair would be fuller and a bit longer. I also expected to see changes in the complexion of my skin. My understanding is that in some, this process will take more time. I plan to take the vitamin for a full 6 months to ensure that I have given the process plenty of time to work. If I don&#x27;t see significant changes by July, I will discontinue use and seek an alternative.</li>
    <li> These capsules are great for growing your hair and nails faster.  I wasn&#x27;t sure as to how they were going to work but they are working.</li>
    <li> They did what they were supposed to do.  I had a noticeable difference in how quickly my nails were growing.  Unfortunately I am so bad at taking pills that I can&#x27;t give it a full five stars since I didn&#x27;t finish taking them, but I am confident in their ability to keep your hair skin and nails at their best!</li>
    <li> I am on a mission to grow my hair and have been taking these vitamins for about 3 months now.  I have to say I see a significant difference in the overall quality of my hair, it&#x27;s much healthier and thicker in just 3 short months!  Before my hair just seemed to stay the same length and not grow, but now after taking these vitamins, I am definitely starting to see some new length to my hair! I am so excited about it!!! And they&#x27;re really cheap on Amazon, initially I found them at my local health food store and they were $24.99, so getting them on Amazon for half the price is an awesome deal!  Thank you Amazon I will keep purchasing!!! :)  Happy hair growing!!</li>
    <li> This product seems to make make my nails stronger.  My hair looks healther than before I started taking this product</li>
    <li> Commenting on the efficacy of vitamins is somewhat problematic but my wife states her nails have had less breakage(my word) since using this for the past month. She likes it.</li>
    <li> Service was excellent, I will order again.</li>
    <li> These pills really do the job on making my hair and nails grow faster. I have had to have haircuts more frequently, which is not such a good thing. I really got the Purvana because of my weak nails. It took a couple of weeks, but my nails have gotten much stronger and longer. The trouble is, after awhile I guess they become immune to the stuff and start breaking off again. When this happens I just take a break for a few weeks and quit taking the Purvana. After a month or so, I start taking it again and the nails respond again, and I have nice nails for awhile. It seems to be cyclical. But I have been using the product, off and on, for about a year with good results.</li>
    <li> I see results with nails growing but hoping positive results for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product multiple times and tend to use it when my hair and nails get too brittle. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but will run through the pack when needed. I probably should use all the time but I hate taking pills so only use it when I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for more than six months and see a great progress in my hair, mails and skin. This item was recommended to me by a co-worker and they work. Thank you colleague</li>
