<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After Modifying it (I have natural hair that&#x27;s very coily), it worked great ad doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Its great for detangling.</li>
    <li> Love the fact it keeps the static away.  I brush my hair before I shower and I don&#x27;t have the tub stop up due to excessive hair in drain.</li>
    <li> It does wonders with detangeling my hair without breaking or damaging it. I have very curly 3c/4a hair that was just impossible at times, I highly recommend it. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have used this type of brush for many years.  This brush is superior in my opinion because it does not break my hair.  The brush can be used on wet hair without damaging it as well.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush and very inexpensive</li>
    <li> I borrowed (took) my mom&#x27;s Denman in about 1986 and it has been my only hairbrush since then. Now, in 2011, it&#x27;s still going strong, but I decided to replace it with another of the same model.  I&#x27;ll be back in another 25.</li>
    <li> I had my first Denman brush in the mid-1970s, and I&#x27;m so pleased to have one again. This goes through very thick, straight hair easily, and the cushioned bristles make it feel heavenly. Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I received my first Denman brush in 1976. I love this brush! I have very thick hair - this is the only brush I can use. Had to give my very expensive - once used, Mason Pearson brush (for thick hair?) to a friend. I couldn&#x27;t get it through my mane. :) Amazon&#x27;s price compares to what the brush cost in the 70&#x27;s! Can&#x27;t say that about too many things.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the first one I ordered, seems cheaper. The bristles are quickly ripped out from the red bed of the brush by thick tangled Marley hair, so beware. This never happened with the one I ordered a year ago.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this brush. I used to use Denman Brushes all the time back in the 60s and 70s, but they were eventually replaced with blow dryers, round brushes and flat irons. My hairdresser suggested I use this particular brush when blow drying my hair into a straight bob style. My hair has a slight natural wave and using the round brushes only seemed to make the problem worse and didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. The Denman brush works miracles. I&#x27;m surprised at how effective it is to style a bob haircut. Old things are new again, thanks to this old standby. I received the brush quickly from the vendor and was satisfied with the product, price and delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush if you have long hair, especially if you tend to leave some hair in the brush.  Because of the spacious rows, it is easy to clean, so your brush is as good as new every time you use it.  It also massages your scalp, which promotes blood flow to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Best detangler brush on the market. Works great on my long Kinky hair without tearing my hair out.</li>
    <li> Great for my thick natural hair</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair and use this brush to detangle / brush my hair when wet. It&#x27;s a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is so sturdy which makes it easy to detangle my thick curly hair. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same brush for over 15 years and keep going back to Denman products.  Best in the world.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush, you can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore.  The bristles are not sharp so they do not harm your scalp!!!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this brush last week and it has become my favorite brush..EVER!  It easily detangles my 3c hair with no problem and makes detangling my crown area a breeze.  This is really a wonderful brush to have.</li>
    <li> Mom had this brush in the 70&#x27;s...little did I know I would be searching for this same brush in 2011...I have natural hair and read that when blow-drying my hair, this was the brush to use. It is perfect, feels good on my hair and doesn&#x27;t break by hair off when I&#x27;m blow-drying...and my hair is thick! It works perfectly and is a good investment. My length is just below the bottom of my ears...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten much use as of yet, but it was a great investment hope to use it many years to come</li>
    <li> I love the denman brush!  It really has helped with detangling.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for combing out and shaping curls</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush based on the favorable customer reviews.  Yes the bristles are very firm which seems to be what everyone likes about the brush.  But what no one seemed to mention is just how short the handle is.  It feels like a child&#x27;s brush; its so small.  I have average size hands and the end of the brush handle barely makes it to the middle of my palm.  I called Amazon for a return because when I tried to do the return online I got a message saying the item was not returnable.  Fortunately the good folks at Amazon issued a full refund to my account, essentially leaving me with the brush for free.  But even for free its unusable to me so I ordered something else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Denman brush for over 30 years. This is the 4th I&#x27;ve owned. They last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great brush for long, thick hair.  Small size makes it easy to slip into a purse, and these brushes are so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s great for thick hair .</li>
    <li> I have natural thick, curly hair, and this product actually WORKS for me. It detangles (which is a plus) yet at the same time is defines my curls(+++). the denman is also good for blow drying. it helps smooth and straighten my hair with at the initial process so that in turn i can lower my heat with my flat iron. but a WORD OF WARNING for all of you ladies with a beautiful thick head of natural hair it&#x27;s best to take out every other row in the brush so that it doesnt feel like its ripping your hair out.</li>
    <li> The best for getting through thick, tangled hair, especially when wet; brush from bottom up and you&#x27;ve saved a lot of work. Thanks</li>
    <li> Brush started out working great but is not as tough as I expected since it is marketed for natural hair. I actually use this brush to comb through a brazillian deep wave wig but find sometimes it appears that the bristles are not strong enough to combat tangles.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes around. They have been made for such a long time, and I have been using these for thirty plus years. These are the best brushes for me to use... I have tried others because I thought they were cute, or colorful, and I always come back to these because they feel the best and do the best job.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my daughter who has very tight curls which cause her hair to detangle very easily.  She can sctually get her hair detangled with it.  So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Devastated when my old Denman finally gave out after 20+ yrs. Had been searching everywhere to replace this fab brush--even beauty supplies w/no luck. Dump those cheap stiff, hair damaging brushes and treat your hair &amp; scalp to a Denman.</li>
    <li> Pros- It glides through hair well: noticeably less breakage and less hair in brush;there are no ball tipped bristles that get snarled in my thick hair  Cons-the brush slides right out of the base, and the handle is on the short side.  I wish the brush part stayed in the base, I am going to buy some glue to get it to stay in there.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  I should have bought the 9-row but this one was did the trick.</li>
    <li> What can I say Denman is Legend, sure their are supposedly better brushes with boar hairs but they are over priced in my opinion and don&#x27;t work well with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;this brush smooths the hair out detangles and styles the hair, its an amazing brush.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 out of 5 because its the best brush I have ever owned and any one that comes over, uses it, loves it, buys it.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you buy one.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that my girlfriend bought me in about 1978 that I carried in my travel bag and used every day until 2011.  Admittedly it was getting a bit beat up and finally it disappeared from my hotel room one day in Mexico.  There in the morning, gone in the evening.  I bought two of these and they are the same as my 1978 model, and perfect.  Won&#x27;t pull out your hair.  Travels well.  Can&#x27;t recommend the sturdy construction highly enough.  Watch out for those hotels in Mexico :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer with braid outs. This brush does an excellent job of gently detangling both textures of my hair. My only complaint it that it&#x27;s still a bit wide to get to the new growth at the base of a small section. I wish that they made a 3 or 2 row denman.</li>
    <li> I use this brush mostly to detangle my natural, African-American hair (type 4c), along with conditioner. I love how it has made the detangling process easier overall. The only drawback I experienced is that cleaning the brush is not as easy as I&#x27;d like - but it&#x27;s easier than all other brushes I&#x27;ve used. :)</li>
    <li> I am an African American who is transitioning from relaxed to natural. I have extremely thick and coarse hair with a really tight hair texture. The brush flows through my hair without snagging my only complaint is that my the rows of my hairbrush lay sideways after brushing through really textured sections. However that might be a consequence of me taking out every other row so that it will not snag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m letting my curly hair grow out so a friend told me to invest in a good brush. Why my hairdresser never mentioned Denman is beyond me. This brush works wonders. It really helps distribute conditioner evenly through my hair, and when I let my hair air dry with a little argan oil it forms loose curls with tangle-free ends that last 2 days.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that I have to brush out very carefully while wet and covered in great big gobs of leave-in conditioner.  I used to use a comb and pulled out so much hair that it was quite frightening.  Enter the Denman brush... upon recommendation of Teri LaFlesh and her book Curly Like Me.  The brush is every bit as awesome as she describes it.  It is sturdy and made of great quality hard plastic, the bristles are smooth and are embedded into a cushiony rubber base, but the very best part is that you can easily slide the rubber cushion from the handle, pop all the rows of bristles out and clean the brush in a jiffy.    I am so happy with my Denman brush!    It is a cinch to wash and to keep clean, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out by the handful and even though my fine hair knots easily, this size brush works absolutely perfectly and is easy to stash in a carry-on.  I expected it to cost around $45 but it was extremely affordably priced.  You cannot go wrong with a Denman!</li>
    <li> I hope they don&#x27;t make fake denman&#x27;s. This one serves its purpose but doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as my old one.</li>
    <li> Like I expected strong very strong</li>
    <li> This brush glides through my daughter&#x27;s 3C/4A hair without those cringe-worthy hair-snapping sounds you get when you use other types of brushes.  It smooths and detangles her hair very nicely.  I am very, very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have permed my hair for years, but now I am on a hair journey to grow it out natural.  I did not know all these years that my hair was never really detangled.  The first time I used this brush, while my hair was wet, I was amazed at the results.  I only comb or brush my hiar when it is wet, which I have discovered is best.  I threw away my other brushes and now only have this brush and a Denman detangling comb.</li>
    <li> i luv this for detangling my hair. i am black and have natural hair that is a lil past my shoulders when it is down and it is very kinky and super thick (its like solange knowles afro but thicker and smaller curls lol).. i have one issue the red part that holds the brisles keeps sliding out of the handle when its slick with product but its easy to slide back in just a nusance when ur in brush mode and have a rhythm going lol</li>
    <li> I purchased one for myself and one for my niece.  I use mine when I blow dry to ensure a straight blow out.  The bristles feel wonderful on the scalp.  When I start brushing I have to stop myself because it feels so nice.  This type of brush also works well on my niece&#x27;s naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s a great detangler and gives defintion to her curls.  It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull out large amounts of hair.  It&#x27;s strong and won&#x27;t break on you.  Denman I&#x27;ve found sells affordable and well made products.</li>
    <li> My old Denman hairbrush lasted twenty-five years before giving up the ghost.  Obviously I replaced it with a new one that is the same model and I love it.  You just can&#x27;t buy a brush like this at most stores.  Denman brushes have firm nylon bristles that don&#x27;t create static electricity when doing your hair and glide smoothly without clumping the hair.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Denman brush like this since high school when a friend told me it was \\&quot;the only brush to use\\&quot;.  They seem to be just as well made as years ago. It&#x27;s ideal for my hair and gets the tangles out easily.  I owned one for 15 years and it took that long for it to show its age.  The red base where the bristles are attached began to disintegrate somewhat on one brush I purchased a few years ago.  It might have been from a hair product that I put into wet hair and brush in. So I&#x27;ve taken to rinsing it afterward.  The purse size that&#x27;s available is also a great brush.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairbrush (Vidal Sasoon, very simialr to the Denman) finally gave up the ghost after about 15+ years. I was happy to find the Denman brush on Amazon. It looks and feels just like my old brush. It is nice to know that you can still find quality out there if you look for it. Thanks for making an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love it. I don&#x27;t use combs often.  But I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I was impressed with the high rating and bec I had a similar (knock-off) brush when I was in high school.  But after my daughter pulled off the pad to wash it the first time, the pad kept sliding off whenever she brushed her hair.  She has medium thick hair past her shoulder blades.  She doesn&#x27;t mind pushing the pad back into the handle, but it would drive me crazy.  Whenever I see that the pad is not pushed in all the way, I can&#x27;t help but do it for her and it is not easy.  It is a tight fit to push it in but not to come off.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> Detangles hair very well without the pain. Love it! I have 4c texture hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush basically because my neice ranted and raved about it.. so i purchased one.... I have 4b tight curly hair ..... THIS BRUSH ROCKS! it really brings out the curl pattern in my hair... Who&#x27;d ever think that something so simple looking could do what this brush does...I apply my product to my hair and run the brush thru my hair a couple of times and i look like i have gorgeous curly shiny hair (well i guess i actually do have it if its on my head  lol! This brush is a miracle worker... It even make those bushy spots in my hair curl up real pretty. Warning: It does cause shrinkage... but your curls will be soooo pretty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for detangling curly hair.  My husband has straight hair and also loves to use it to brush out his tangles.</li>
    <li> The bristles are nicely spaced apart which makes it good for curly heads</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!! It works perfectly for back combing, and creating \\&quot;the bump\\&quot; or volume in your hair, even if it is fine like mine! Would definatly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My son purchased one of these hairbrushes and I secretly used it for awhile.  I decided I wanted my own so purchased one for me and one for my daughter.  I just love this brush, it calms the tangles pretty much ouch free.  Seriously tempted to toss all the other brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came pretty fast too</li>
    <li> all i ever wanted in a hair brush</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used.  I have a thick head of hair and it works well to tame it.  The reason I needed to buy an new brush is that my wife and son have appropriated my other Denman brushes.  It is truly great especially if you get static electricity when you brush.  The rubber base eliminates this problem.  Just a great brush.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this brush. I like the brush alot. I recently cut my hair and wanted a smaller brush and this is what I wanted. It feels natural, does not pull the hair excessively and is gentle on tender scalps. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.   Good at giving volume to my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Denman brushes are always good</li>
    <li> I have used a version of this Denman brush for over 30 years.  I used to buy it through my hairdresser and I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is incredibly durable, works well on wet &amp; dry hair.  The brush is very easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> Great Brush for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Helps curls clump!  Great tool for detangling my 4A hair</li>
    <li> The Denman Nylon Bristles 7-Row brush is NOT for male straight dense and short (1 to 2 inch long) hair. As seen in the photos it has 1/16&amp;#34; thick bristles spaced almost 1/4&amp;#34; apart, so it goes through straight hair with little combing action. As some reviewers say, it may be good for untangling wet African curly hair. Used this brush for 2 weeks. For my type of hair, the Diane Nylon Bristles 5-Row brush combs much better.</li>
    <li> This summer I finally had to replace my last Denman brush, the base had come undone. After how many years use? 35. I think this one will be all I&#x27;ll need...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old one had 9 rows of bristles, but I chose this as the replacement as my hair was somewhat longer when I had got that earlier one -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is the real Denman brush. There are brushes on Amazon that are not the actual Denman brush. This one is. You need a real Denman brush if you have natural hair. The fake ones will tear your hair out. This brush is heavy and gets the job done. My hair is very curly and it really helps to tame the curls when I am doing a polished style. The shipping was fast and the price was right.</li>
    <li> The rubber base ensures that even when I have short hair it can grip it well. It is also good for just plain brushing especially if your hair is not too thick.</li>
    <li> After all the superior reviews, I was surprised to find that I don&#x27;t really care for this brush.  Even though it didn&#x27;t promote any static in my hair,  I found the solid rubber base that holds the bristles to be amazingly heavy.  Between the weight and a not so friendly (ergonomic) shape in my hand, it didn&#x27;t make it all the way through a brushing without my hand beginning to cramp up.  While I feel it is indeed made with quality materials, it just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> I never wash my hair ( or my children&#x27;s) without this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have type 4b hair ... Our children have 3c... I could not complete my hair-wash regimen without this denman. It allows my detangling/conditioning to be done with such ease. It literally cuts the time in half ( maybe more)!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried other (knockoff) versions, but none compare to the sturdiness &amp; craftsmanship of the Real Denman! I hope this brush doesn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I have had a brush like this for 20 years, and it just now started to fall apart. It is so comfortable to use and the only brush my daughter will let me use to comb her hair, and that is saying something. I was so relieved when I found this exact brush at a decent price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought this brush in October 2012 because I needed a new one. But I wanted a durable, GOOD brush, not one that would give out in a year or so. This Denman model is IT.  I love it! Plus it feels good against my scalp after I wash and brush my hair. Yay!</li>
    <li> The perfect brush for curly hair !</li>
    <li> I had this brand of brush 28 years ago when I was first married and my husband claimed it as his own.  I&#x27;ve had to replace it a few times over the years, but it lasts a long time and he loves it.</li>
    <li> My so really likes this for detangling. It really gets the conditioner through the hair to the ends. Think I may get more just in case I misplace this on</li>
    <li> I needed to upgrade my 5 brushes to one &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; one and this is it!!! It helps to detangle and style which is just what I needed. What a great price too!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same brush for 10 years.  I never looked for a new one because I wasn&#x27;t sure they still sold this brand.  This is a great brush!  So glad they carry it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using inexpensive drug store hair brushes -- as well as plastic hairbrushes that come pre-packed with electric hair dryers -- so long that I forgot what a really high quality hairbrush feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Denman Nylon Cushion Brush feels and works great on my hair, and the &amp;#34;heavy-duty&amp;#34; quality is immediately noticeable.  This is a classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for,&amp;#34; and even at a price that is 2 or 3 times more expensive than the typical drug store brands, the Denman brush is a very good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have a fuller head of hair to really take advantage of the Denman quality.  I highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
    <li> Used it with Zep grout cleaner.  1000x&#x27;s better than getting on my hands and knees with a grout brush.  The brush did not fall apart nor did the bristles weaken after approx 600sqft.</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with this brush. Does not pull my hair out and I now use this brush to remove the tangles instead of a comb.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anywhere. My Husband and I love it. So I had to find it online.&lt;br /&gt;others I bought that look like it are too hard.</li>
    <li> This brush is nothing short of amazing. I have coily 4B/C hair and have had serious issues with detangling. This brush has completely change that for me. It is a sturdy, well-made brush. I do wish the handle had something to help with grip as it can get a little slippery when working with wet hair, but overall it is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I got this brush because my aunt also has the same brand, and it worked well with her coarse, full head of hair. I got the 9-row brush as it was on sale; it was okay the first few days I got it, but then it got dirty and I tried to clean it.When I pulled the rubber out of the base of the handle, I noticed a significant difference in the quality of the rubber. It gets very flaky, like those terrible pink pearl erasers. It was easy to clean, but I found it very difficult to reinsert the rubber back into the handle. I just hope they change the material of the rubber. It&#x27;s a herculean task to put the rubber back into the handle. I don&#x27;t know if the composition of the rubber of the brush I received is different from that of the others, but it totally sucks. Sorry for the unprofessional statement but I am very annoyed by how hard it is to reinsert the rubber. In the end, I just asked my father to fix the brush. Instead of sliding the whole chunk of rubber in, he used the end of a spoon and push one end of the rubber in like a tire. Even he found it extremely troublesome. Then again not many brushes have this feature, so I can&#x27;t say it was absolutely terrible.&lt;br /&gt; I did find that there was less static in the brush initially, but some charges started building up in a few weeks. If you have fine and long hair like I do, then I would suggest you take out some rows of the brissels and brush more gently, starting from the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you I considering buying this brush, would suggest you go to an actual store. If you can, I would test out reinserting the brush. Otherwise I would try some other ant-static brushes.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair and I found that this brush works okay. I modified it to make the bristles slightly farther apart, and I find that when brushing through my hair the bristles kinda bend to the side and I have to push them upright again. I recently purchased the D31 Free Flow Wide Spaced Denman and it works MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Good brush, stimulating !</li>
    <li> Even though I was looking for a 7 row brush this one was still too big. I do not care for the bristles and the handle is very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> What can you say about a hair brush</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Especially since you can modify it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls defined. I noticed I have less frizz. I get many compliments on how my curl pattern is so defined now. I only use on wet/damp hair.</li>
    <li> our granddaughter loves it</li>
    <li> What took me so long to get a Denman I have no idea?!?!?!? These are awesome! This is ideal for 3a/3b fine curly hair that is thick.</li>
    <li> I have 3c type hair and this brush is great it goes thru my curls without getting tangled and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it helps get the tangles out so when I blow my hair out the drying time is cut in half.</li>
    <li> thank you i  like it  and GOD bless you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;janet.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for people without long hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, however, the handle could be longer.  I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; with average proportions but my hand hangs off the end of this brush handle. I measured it with the ruler butted up against the rubber pad and the handle measures 3-7/8&amp;#34;.  Were it a mere 5/8&amp;#34; more to 4-1/2&amp;#34;, it would have made all the difference.  Denman needs to stop being stingy with it&#x27;s handle length.  I believe it would only cost maybe 25 cents more to make a longer handle, an added cost that would not break me.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for one just like it which was all worn out.  These brushes are of high quality and feels great when I use it on my hair  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Very nice brush! It really defines my curls and although I am still in my transitioning stage to natural it prevents my hair from matting or getting tangled!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and is good at distributing oils or smoothing hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean by soaking, but I haven&#x27;t managed to take it apart for thorough cleaning yet.</li>
    <li> Bought this in regular and travel size.  Nice brushes, but the bristles are a little hard on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all of the hype on Youtube. I was not disappointed. I have natural African hair, and the other brushes I had just weren&#x27;t cutting it. Either they were to hard or to soft. The Den-man D13 is perfect. I highly recommend this for any naturals out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use on wet hair and it actually pulls my hair a little bit from getting snagged on the rubber.</li>
    <li> I heard so many of the natural hair girls on the Internets talk about this brush when i first went natural, but didn&#x27;t think it would be effective for my hair type. Since purchasing I have used it to detangle a few times and it gets through my kinky 4c hair pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out, which I chalk up to both the brush and patience when detangling kinky hair. I wish there was a better grip on the handle though. I have sent it flying across the room a couple times when the amount of product on my hands made holding it comically difficult.</li>
    <li> This is a really excellent brush.  I had bought this because so many curly-haired people were singing it&#x27;s praises, and it&#x27;s true - this is a great dry-detangling brush.  I use it prior to every time I wash my hair.  It&#x27;s both gentle and effective; I lose far less hair than I did with my drugstore paddle brush.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t advise brushing your hair when wet - I did that once when I misplaced my detangling comb, and it was a little too rough on my scalp and hair follicles.  Also, although Denman advertises this as a brush you can take apart for cleaning, the brush arrives with no instructions on how to do that, so I&#x27;ll have to youtube it or something when I want to deep-clean it.  On the other hand, this is such an affordable brush I don&#x27;t think it really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for other women with curls: I am caucasian with corkscrew curls (think of Shirley Temple) and hair that reaches my shoulder blades.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush that I&#x27;ve ever owned...... It feels soft and it detagles very good. Hope this helps and yes I do recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!! I have natural 4b/4c hair and use it on my wet hair. When starting from end and working to the root, it does wonders at detangling. The best part is how it brings out my curls. I have soft, fluffy hair, but when I brush it with this, I can actually see defined curls. I pair it with a curl cream or moisturizer spray and it&#x27;s just the best thing ever. I don&#x27;t travel without it and have recommended it to all of my natural friends.</li>
    <li> a lot of naturals say this product is bad, causes breakage, doesn&#x27;t detangle. I have 4c hair so my curls do not clump what so ever but this works WONDERS for detangling my hair! it sped up the detangling process! I don&#x27;t recommend doing this on dry hair (use lots of conditioner and detangle then)</li>
    <li> The bristles feel very sharp even if you touch it with you hand; I would dot dare use it close to my scalp. Unusable. (I guess, however, this brush may work for brushing /long/ hair.)</li>
    <li> Outstanding product in a professional grade.  They last years and are well worth their price.</li>
    <li> 9 rows was too many and too heavy, this brush is just perfect. A better weight and size, with good grip on my hair. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Looks to be the same Denman Brush that I have been purchasing for years and now unable to find in any retail store.  So I am very happy to find this brush online.  Will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair.  This brush was good at brushing out tangles but it was a little harsh on my strands,  I think its meant for thicker hair. I rarely use it because I dread the breakage. It&#x27;s well made and strudy so its great for detangling stronger hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for drying my bangs, but it&#x27;s also great just as a more portable version of a classic hair styling tool. Also works great on my artificial hair wigs!</li>
    <li> I always used Denman brushes waaay back in the 70&#x27;s.  For some unknown reason I got away from them.  This one reminds me how much I like them.  It is well made, goes through my hair easily and performs as advertised.  Does not create static when brushing.</li>
    <li> This was not the business!Curlynikki refers to this brush as the shredder and I whole-heartedly  agree. Even when I modified it, it was still rough on my strands. This just does not work for coily coily 4a hair. I think to get the best use out of this I will use it after I&#x27;ve detangled with my fingers and I want a more styled look with my wash n gos.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever made; I think this is my third or fourth one since 1975!</li>
    <li> Awful brush for my hair. Pulled my hair out much more than the cheapie brush that I had.</li>
    <li> I have several Denman brushes, both nylon bristle and boar bristle, in different sizes. The bristles on this brush are NOT the tiny nylon bristles on the combination brush. They are fairly large, smooth, graduated bristles that work beautifully on my straight hair, even when wet. Yes, I also love my expensive M-P brush from England, received as a gift, and available on Amazon. But why spend the extra money when Denman offers high quality and far less costly alternatives, made in the U.S.A? I LOVE DENMAN!</li>
    <li> I Love this brush!  It detangles with pulling your hair out.</li>
    <li> I remember when these brushes cost $2.97 at Boys market or Thrifty. LOL. It was my favorite brush when I was younger because you could take it apart and get it really clean. I guess I out grew that one but I am back to it. Just as I remember great workmanship.</li>
    <li> First time using while going natural and it does the job.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite brush EVER!!! The bristles are strong but flexible, allowing for a perfect scalp massage. Detangles effortlessly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used only Denman brushes for over 30 years and still love them.  This particular model is the one I like best.  It fluffs the hair without pulling it.  It works well on wet and on dry hair and reduces static.  I now order them for my whole family and they love these brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;The brush can be taken apart for thorough cleaning and seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> Sometime ago I bought a smaller version of this brush from my local beauty supply.  So I knew I wanted a bigger one.  I have natural 3d and 4a hair. My curls just POP with this brush! I LOVE IT!  Yes, I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for detangling natural hair!</li>
    <li> I have thick, course hair.  The brush handles my hair well.  It is easy to use, clean and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Love this for my natural hair styles</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It really glides through my hair and I love how curly my hair gets when I brush the ends. I do no see a lot of hair loss in the brush. Best brush evet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of brush since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;ve only bought three in the past 20 years, and one is just for travel.</li>
    <li> Always great for detangling my hair.</li>
    <li> I had one of these brushes well over ten to 15 years ago.  It was great.  This one is NOT the same.  The rubber portion is supposed to slide out for cleaning.  I could not get it to move but 1/4 of an inch.  I spoke to the manufacturer and they assured me they are supposed to slide out.  Well it doesn&#x27;t.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> This brush is falling apart already and I have only used it 4 times since I purchased it. The part of the brush that holds the bristles (reddish/pinkish) is sliding off of the base (black part) and that should not be happening?</li>
    <li> When I lost my Denman brush, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  Easy to get it through Amazon and still the best brush for my hair</li>
    <li> This brush is great for detangling my transitioning-to-natural hair! I did modify it some by removing a few of the rows (just because I was still a little nervous about brushing my wet or damp hair), but it works much better for me than a wide-toothed comb. It&#x27;s soft enough to glide through with breaking my curls, but strong enough to get through the tangles. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it. Love it. Love it. I have curly coarse hair that no one else in my family has, so no one has been able to help me with my hair. If I try to brush it, the top stays wavy while the bottom frizzes and poofs out. I went online looking for answers and found this suggestion. with a good price and nothing but amazing reviews, I though it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. It doesn&#x27;t tug and yank on my hair, and I don&#x27;t see as much coming out in the brush. My hair can still get a little poofy, but it is no where near as bad. If my hair has been styled, it helps in keeping it smooth and nice. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone with tough to manage hair.</li>
    <li> I used to have extremely long &#x27;heavy metal hair&#x27; all the way down to my waistline behind. I cut it to shoulder length several years ago because I simply couldn&#x27;t deal with it on a daily basis. I bought many types of brushes, but I never found anything that made managing my hair anything less than painful agony. This agonizingly painful brushing of extremely thick, long hair was just too much for me to take. I wish, I wish, I WISH I had known about this brush at the time, because I could have kept my hair and dealt with it in an enjoyable and pain-free manner. This brush is absolutely amazing. Comfort, durability, design, even the price, everything is perfect, and it gives your hair such luxurious volume and feel. No pain for sensitive scalps which is something I suffer from, including psoriasis of the scalp which is aggravated less by this brush than ANY I&#x27;ve ever used. Brushing is absolutely a joy. I look forward to brushing my hair after bathing now, and I&#x27;m going to start growing my hair out again! Wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> The brush itself looks good so I hate to just give it two stars but the package was ripped and opened when I got it. This has been a recurring theme with my Amazon Prime account so I&#x27;m mostly disappointed in amazon</li>
    <li> I use this for blowing up tops on cows; its a great brush with many uses!</li>
    <li> Loved my brush! Detangling is now a breeze!</li>
    <li> Precious to me. Love this brush and it feels so good to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this style/brand of brush before and I love how it goes through my hair. I&#x27;m African American and Puerto Rican so my hair is super curly and really really thick. If I don&#x27;t brush or comb it out after washing it I end up with a afro. The Denman brush keeps the fro at bay but my first brush started to wear down. I&#x27;ve had it for about four years so it held up pretty well. When I received the new brush it came with the brush cleaner which was a surprise to me. I was going to order the brush cleaner since I found out that Denman makes them but now I have one so I don&#x27;t have to spend the extra money. Thank you for the new brush and brush cleaner. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and the high quality of the Denman brand. ^_^</li>
    <li> You know when you buy something and realize its the best purchase you have ever made!&lt;br /&gt;That is how I feel about this brush.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH, I HAD ONE SIMALIAR LIKE THIS ONE AND HAD IT FOR OVER 10 YEARS, IT WAS TIME TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE, LOOKED ALL OVER IN MY HOME TOWN AND NO ONE CARRY A BRUSH LIKE THIS AT ALL.  THANKS FOR AMAZON.COM.</li>
    <li> I am loving it my old brush was 7 year old replaced it with new one. I am loving it</li>
    <li> Bought this for a present.  A classic.</li>
    <li> this is the best brush ever! my hair has never been happier and more detangled.</li>
    <li> The brush is small in the hand and quite heavy.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair (I&#x27;m cuban/black) and these knots seem to form at the ends of my curls that I had been ripping my hair trying to get the knots out. I didn&#x27;t matter which brush or wide tooth comb I used, nothing was doing the job. Frustrated, I took to Amazon in search of the perfect brush.  I came across this brush, read the reviews and thought this one just may do the trick. I received my brush a couple days ago.  As soon as I opened it, I brushed my hair.  All I can say is &#x27;WOW!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a good solid brush, has some weight to it.  The nylon bristles feel great as you brush your hair, not to mention it flows through your hair like a hot knife in butter.  Perfect, absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Detangling my hair has always been such an issue for me. While there are still some troubles and it still takes some time to do it, this denman brush may be the best one I have ever purchased yet to do the job. The price was great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Denman hairbrushes for years and love them. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently received my denman brush, I really like it however I had a little difficulty getting the padding out of the brush. It was like a war trying to get it out and putting it back in was even worse. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like my brush only used it once on some thick curly hair and it really works as far as tangles goes. It didn&#x27;t  define the curls it made it more bushy, but that&#x27;s ok as long as it detangles. I will watch more video reviews on this brush to make sure I am doing the technique right. Nowadays there is a technique for doing everything including brushing your hair.</li>
    <li> I love Burmax line of products . It is an investment well worth the money. These brushes can be used for to detangle hair, smooth hair , as well as blow dry. I have 4 of these brushes and use them on my clients as well.</li>
    <li> please don&#x27;t dis continue this. its perfect the only thing that defines and detangles my multitextured hair, 4abc . This brush melts my knots and tangles</li>
    <li> Nice quality and stong brush. It helps define curls. If you have kinky tight curls as I do, this brush will rip your hair out. If you have looser curls or staight hair, I imagine this would be a great brush. I now just use it on my staight hair weaves or loose curly weaves and it works fine</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because my other one broke whislt I was detangling (Yes, my hair is that bad). This brush is a life saver. It&#x27;s pretty strong and the handle is ergonomic so my hands never start hurting from too much usage. It may however be tricky to clean. All you have to do is slid out the red rubber portion and remove the combs teeth from the back. Overall, fantastic brush line! :)</li>
    <li> Glad to have a Denman brush again!  Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I had my last brush for 30 years and lost it.  I have searched for something that had the ability to go through my hair, detangle and smooth.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I am white with curly hair, and it really cuts down on the frizz when used with a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> The bristle on the brush are not very forgiving. I like the features of the brush and the way that it is crafted.</li>
    <li> I was really not that happy with the quality of this brush.  It feels a little heavy and awkward in my hand.  We keep this as a back-up brush in the car/</li>
    <li> I really loved this brush! It lasted for about 2 years before the handle broke.  It detangles my natural afro-kinky hair very well. The bristles themselves are intact. I bought a new one with a lighter pink bed but I do not like it as much.  The structure of the bristles was not built as well as this one.</li>
    <li> I have 2 biracial girls with very kinky/curly hair. I have tried almost every kind of brush and comb for their hair. This is by far the best! I can brush through their hair and the brush removes tangles and separates the curls. It doesn&#x27;t break the hair. They don&#x27;t complain about me pulling their hair anymore.</li>
    <li> I read about this brush In In Style magazine which gave it a high rating. The bristles are firm but the base has give so I&#x27;m not pulling my hair out or scraping my head.</li>
    <li> I like most everything about this.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and remove hair from, the bristles are not too hard, and it seems well made.  My only complaint  is that the handle seems too small (narrow and short).</li>
    <li> My hair naturally is very fluffy and very difficult to get in a combined curl pattern.  This brush has become an HG product for me.  For years, I finger styled - mostly tried to do the ouidad rake and shake.  But I can&#x27;t stand the feel of strands of hair getting wrapped in my fingers and I hate the feel of gel on my hands.  Then I heard about this brush on naturallycurly.com.  It seemed like mostly women with type 4 curls were using it and the results looked good.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the brush would work for my looser curl pattern.  It does.  This brush really defines my curls and separates them so that they look natural.  First, I use a leave in conditioner (these days, my favorite is Ouidad Moisture Lock).  Next I smooth the outside with gel (LA Looks Sports Gel).  Then I brush it.  Then, I separate my hair into 3-4 sections.  I brush it again and let it dry.  And that&#x27;s it!  It makes styling my hair easy as can be!</li>
    <li> YES.  One word is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this brush is great for all hair types, but for wavy, kinky, or curly hair like mine?  It separates and defines curls beautifully, clumps them all together with no knots, gnarls, or tangles whatsoever.  I got this brush as well as a 9-row, as my hair is very thick and medium-length.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It has helped my get through some quick and easy hair styles for when I am on on the run. I</li>
    <li> Did not &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; do anything special to my curly hair that my boar brush does not do already. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The bristles are smooth through my hair. It seems like it will work well but I&#x27;ll probably have to take out a few rows because my hair is so tightly coiled.</li>
    <li> This brush has saved me from perpetual bang gap. It&#x27;s perfect for blow drying because it lacks metal parts that would burn your scalp. It works wonders on wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Rubber bristles were not helpful on my curly hair or my daughter&#x27;s 3C coily hair.  Returned this one.  Heard denmans were good for our hair types, but this was extremely disappointing.  I started using &amp;#34;Ouidad&amp;#34; wide double-tooth comb and it works a MIRACLE with no hair breakage on my daughter&#x27;s 3C coily hair.  Their kids tear-free shampoo/conditioner are miracle workers too (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).</li>
    <li> I have thick 4c hair.  It&#x27;s about a foot long stretched.  The bristles have a lot of &#x27;give&#x27; making for a much gentler detangling process.  I think the handle on this brush needs grip or texture.  I use slippery products in my hair to detangle it.  The smooth finish on this brush makes it difficult to hold when my hands are slick.  Overall, I like how it glides through my hair once detangled.</li>
    <li> I got my first Denman brush at least 30 years ago, and have not used any other brand as my main hairbrush since.  I have thick, straight hair, and this doesn&#x27;t snag and works perfectly for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually need a new one about every 5 or so years (the teeth will start breaking off after 5+ years of daily use), although the last one I had met its demise early due to a canine interaction with it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making these as they are really terrific.</li>
    <li> This brush is really good and it helps with my hair, but i was a bit disappointed when i received the shipping. The reason i was disappointed is bc it was smaller than i anticipated, and i have a lot of hair so one can see why that was annoying finding how small it was.</li>
    <li> Kinda heavy compared to others</li>
    <li> I grew up thinking my hair was bad and was constantly given relaxers to deal with my &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; hair and I have finally broke free from my mom&#x27;s hair ignorance and I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair and I thought that NO brush was a match for my hair. Every brush since I was a kid would break and the bristles would fall out and get stuck in my hair but THIS BRUSH IS LIKE BUTTER GLIDING THROUGH MY HAIR. I have two textures due to transitioning and this brush is BEST for dealing with both natural and relaxed hair. I just got this and I&#x27;m going to order 3 more just for back up. Great as a stocking stuffer this Christmas.</li>
    <li> My kids are half African American and their hair ranges from curly to very curly. They love these brushes</li>
    <li> Had to remove some of the rows but this brush did define my daughter&#x27;s curls.</li>
    <li> am happy with my Denman Brush...</li>
    <li> I have tightly coiled very thick hair.  This brush works wonders in my hair.  It helps to remove the tangles and define the curls.</li>
    <li> The goody paddle brush I bought elsewhere started losing its plastic bristles on the first brushing. I have long and thick curls, thanks to my Greek heredity. This brush is much better suited to it that the drugstore garbage they pass off as brushes.</li>
    <li> my wife bought one of these over 25 years ago. it finally broke. I always liked it for my hair. so now both of us have our own new ones.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Defines the curls perfectly. Just be careful if you want big curls to use another one with less rolls. :)</li>
    <li> Great for naturals love it ...helps with detangling , wash and goes ,styling etc. Just buying it is very helpful .</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I keep reading other post on AA natural hair boards that it does wonders and is a must have. Ehhh I don&#x27;t agree that its a must have but it works and serves its purpose. Maybe the 9 row would work much better.</li>
    <li> The brush works great! My hair is natural and it makes detangling my hair a breeze. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well for brushing out my curly hair before or after a shower. Also found it good for brushing out hair a few days after shampooing, doesn&#x27;t get frizzy, takes out the tangles and breaks up the curls that start to clump together.</li>
    <li> I have short thick hair and need an hair brush this Denman brush would work great for longer straight hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very full but fine and tightly curled if that all made sense lol but I used this brush once and I no longer dreaded detangling!</li>
    <li> Awesome for my curls!!</li>
    <li> Very well made brush.  Best when used on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush specially for back combing (teasing) my hair then smoothing it out. I saw a YouTube video about this brush and I had to have it. I have very long hair and I wanted some volume on top. Long hair tend to weigh the hair down and the top just lays flat. I have tried other teasing combs and non of em worked for me except this one. I&#x27;m so happy I finally decided to get one :)).</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever bought and I&#x27;ve been through several in my 30 years! Gets through wet and dry tangled with ease and styles with no problem - love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s the only brush I have that can be cleaned to perfection. It helps a lot to brush my daughter&#x27;s loooong hair. 10 stars!</li>
    <li> My hair technician recommended the Denman brush.  I am so very pleased with the choice.  It is excellent and is very durable and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I had a Denman for about 20 years. It finally broke.  I ordered this one and it is made cheaper and the bristles are not as thick and well made as the old one.</li>
    <li> I really love how this brush makes my hair look. I may have to buy another one as a back up.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I&#x27;m a natural hair black female with type 4c hair. Removed every other row and it works great for detangling. Very durable and gets the job done. Very sleek appearance and great buy. Will be buying another as a gift.</li>
    <li> The nylon bristles creat static electricity and makes my hair go wild.  Not happy with this brush at all. It&#x27;s going to goodwill</li>
    <li> I love this brush and have for years. I have used these brushes for about 40 years now! When they finally wear out, I just get a new one because I would never use another brush. Thank you Denman!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve been on the fence about spending so much on a brush for quite some time. Everyone raves about Denman but I&#x27;ve never acted on all the recommendations. Now, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been without it all my life. This brush is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and glides through tangles and curls effortlessly. Remember to always start from the bottom of your hair upward when detangling.</li>
    <li> I love it it helped define my curls 10 times easier</li>
    <li> I used it the first day I received it and O MY GOODNESS .. MY HAIR &amp; SCALP IS THANKING ME RIGHT NOW. No more wide tooth big combs.. i use it to smooth out my hair and strands and I did not feel a thing. My hair type is 4b/4c.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!!  Detangles with ease.  I used to dread detangling my hair.  I need to order a larger size.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my natural curly hair. It don&#x27;t tug or pull your hair. The bristles are strong and flexible. They don&#x27;t scrap your scalp when brushing. I actually enjoy brushing my scalp with this brush. It feels therapeutic. (for me anyway)</li>
    <li> love,love,love...this brush.. its worth the money. its gets down to the roots..just what I need. b/c im African American..so yeah really awesome for our hair...nuff said!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this brush so I ordered it. Item as described. Received when promised. Pleased with purchse. Very nice brush. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for ages! We used to call these &amp;#34;vent brushes&amp;#34; back in the day. You could buy them everywhere but now they&#x27;re hard to find. This is THE BEST brush/comb for detangling thick hair when it&#x27;s wet &amp;/or for combing conditioner through your hair after you shampoo. (But ALWAYS start combing at the ends &amp; work back towards the roots). LOVE IT! Shoulda bought 2 but I won&#x27;t be letting this one out of my bathroom for any reason.</li>
    <li> glides through my hair , less fallout and great for detangling</li>
    <li> It feels like a high quality brush but a little on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for a few months now and it works amazingly....it really gets out the tiny shed hair from my coily mane and distributes product amazingly....</li>
    <li> Such a great teasing brush. I have incredibly flat, and thick hair. It works amazingly well! Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a nice brush. I like that there&#x27;s not little ball ends on the bristles that will fall off over time... that was my problem in the past... It seems that i will hold up pretty well too, which I&#x27;m really happy about. I have pretty thick, long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it&#x27;s dry, but a little harder when it&#x27;s wet. Maybe I don&#x27;t have enough conditioner in my hair for it to go through smoothly idk! I would recommend this brush if you want a quality brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a doll on a budget &amp; this brush works wonders &amp; the price is well worth it. I&#x27;ve been on my healthy hair journey/ long hair journey &amp; this brush helps to detangle my hair with pulling out a lot of hair. Thank you Denman&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have 3c hair with patches if 3b &amp; 4a :)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brush, this is my first Denman brush and I absolutely love it! I read a lot of reviews before I decided to go with this brush. I have naturally curly hair and thought to myself how could a brush help detangle my curls?! But it really works well! I was amazed to be able to brush my curls without breakage or a sore scalp afterwards. This is a MUST for every girl that has naturally curly hair :-)</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  My daughter has extremely thick and unruly hair.  She is 14 and style is at the top of her list.  This has helped her manage and style her hair a great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush specifically because it&#x27;s super easy to clean. The bristles don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;balled&amp;#34; end that keeps lint and such trapped. You can even slide the red rubber part up and out and completely take the rows of bristles out and clean everything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush and brushes my hair just fine.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> So far I am in love with this brush. I have used it twice and it works perfectly on my natural hair. No breakage and it glides through easily. I wish I had bought it long time ago.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to receive this brush.  This is the same brush I remember my grandmother using.  It arrived after just a few days.  I was new and packaged.  When I brush my hair, it feels like a massage on my scalp.  I love it.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Some teeth broke off, lost it so can&#x27;t say much more than it was weak.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this brush just going by the picture when I ordered it, and I still wasn&#x27;t sure when I looked at it in the package when it was delivered. But when I actually got it in my hands, my mind was put at ease. The brush is solid and substantial. The rubber is thick and feels very sturdy and long-lasting. The bristles are not flimsy. I have extremely thick hair, and I usually keep it pretty long, and this brush goes right through it. My 3 year old also has thick hair that tangles badly if you look at it wrong, and it gets her stubborn tangles out easily. I am very pleased with this brush and will be buying the smaller version for my purse.</li>
    <li> I think I saw this brush on LisaFreemontStreet (Beauty vlog on YouTube) and it reminded me of my grandmothers beauty drawer when I was a kid.  I ordered the brush on Amazon and I&#x27;m 100% in love. I have short, fine/straight hair so brushes aren&#x27;t a huge battle, personally. BUT - my daughter has fine/curly hair and it&#x27;s  a nightmare to comb out. This brush has cut her post bath routine in half, mostly by eliminating her screaming and crying. Thank you Denman!</li>
    <li> The BEST for thick curly hair. My daughter has more hair than most adults and cries at the sight of a hair brush. I got 2 different tangle teezer brushes, every detangle spray,  and still tears. This brush with Panteene Pro V detangle has solved all the tears.</li>
    <li> Good brush my daughter loves it shipping was pretty good !</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for over 35 years. Denman continues to make a quality product.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Gets my curls poppin.</li>
    <li> Re-purchased this brush after the rubber on my former Denman fell apart after many years of use.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s of this brush:&lt;br /&gt;-  Good for removing loose hair.  Some brushes I have tried to use don&#x27;t collect loose hair adequately, so  end up with loose hair on my clothes, which looks sloppy, especially on dark colored clothes or work clothes.&lt;br /&gt;-  Easy to clean.  Some brushes I have used are difficult to remove hair from - with the Denman it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;-  Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.  I am able to use this even on my wet hair after showering before blow drying it. Don&#x27;t know if it matters but I have naturally straight hair so that&#x27;s what I am using this brush on.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this brush.  First running it through your hair feels like a massage on your scalp.  I have a thick head of hair and an undercut/side part hair cut and this brush is perfect for getting my hair into place from the first big brushes to the last finishing touches. I even catch my girlfriend using it and she admittedly loves it too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for your grooming kit man or woman.</li>
    <li> perfection! i love how i evenly coats my hair with conditioner or leave in conditioner if i need it. totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this brush .... It really detangles and brings out my curls and my hair type can be around 4a or b and it is absolutely a must have for all naturals :D get it get it And 2 for this price is a great deal</li>
    <li> Denman brushes are the best!</li>
    <li> I love my brush so I purchases two.</li>
    <li> i had been looking for this type of brush in the stores for a long time.. thank you for great price and fast shipping... how to tell on bristles, the thinner the hair the less rows.. for normal thickness hair, at least 5-7 rows.. we prefer 7..</li>
    <li> The other raving reviews are right...durable brush, great quality, detangles well, doesn&#x27;t damage or snag your hair or make it static-y  Just an all around great brush.  I use it with both wet and dry hair to either detangle or getting the bumps out when putting my hair up.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of hair, and on top of that it&#x27;s naturally curly and not manageable at all. Seriously, i&#x27;m happy when i normally can go to the salon just to wash my hair because it takes so much on my hands doing it myself. I thought that maybe if i found the right brush, it would at least help me untangle the mess it always become simply by getting my hair wet, no amount of conditioner was helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very lucky on my search though, as i kept finding those that the bristles will come off, or untangle my hair further because of the end shape. Then there were those that only brushed the top part of my hair, but not deeper to the scalp. The worst were those with the \\&quot;spongy\\&quot; part holding the bristles, because it would either tear up or come completely off on my hair knots. Sure i could have simply go back to using combs, but with so much hair, i would have to keep untangling for hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would have told me about this brush sooner. Seriously i have been using it constantly since i got it, and it takes less than 10 minutes, without even having to use a whole bottle of conditioner at its most tangled. I can safely go to the beach, or pool and not have to worry to death that it&#x27;ll take me hours to untangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this brush so good?&lt;br /&gt;*The bristles, which are strong enough for any hair, yet doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp in the least.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s spaced enough between rows to make it easier, thereby faster to finish.&lt;br /&gt;*The part holding the bristles is made out of a \\&quot;spongy\\&quot; material i have never encountered on another brush. It makes it harder for that part to come off no matter how many knots you have. Yet it&#x27;s easy to pull it out when i want to clean the brush thoroughly.</li>
    <li> The brush looks like a factory reject, a 2nd in production. On one end the red rubber that holds the bristles looks torn.  I am a amazon weekly customer and Prime member.  All items i purchase are the right-competitive price. Sorry to say not this one. Looks like something from the \\&quot;99cent\\&quot; store. Unfortunately the packaging was thrown out, I would have returned it. I threw the brush out too.  I purchased on the reputation of Amazon (always 5 star) bad decision this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because of all the good reviews, but I completely disagree.  The bristles on the brush are very stiff, pointy and SHARP.  You do NOT want them to rub against your scalp.  Most my other brushes have little round bulbs on the tips to avoid this.  Maybe I will use it for a cat brush instead.</li>
    <li> All i can say is that my sister rates this highly, she says it does a great job at De-tangling her hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever had!!!</li>
</ol>
