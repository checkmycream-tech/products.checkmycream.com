      <li>I don’t find that any rotary shaver  does  a perfect job on my neck</li>

      <li>and I am having great difficulty finding a replacement</li>
      <li>Minute timer is a great feature.</li>
      <li>for a point of reference, I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for about 12 years and have not yet tried a Remington product I liked -- until now!  </li>

      <li>Good luck finding a business that will allow you to try out a razor before you buy</li>
      <li>It feels good in the hand.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a satisfactory shaver with lots of good features.</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver for the price...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Remington packed in a lot of features and style at a good price.  </li>
      <li>The built quality is satisfactory, and the feel from the grip is really good.</li>
      <li>shave wasnt particularly good or close for me.</li>
      <li>is good.</li>
      <li>Good shaver</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver for those that like the scruffy look that we see all around us these days.</li>
      <li>wonderfull shaver its the best, the first time that i am sure that it is the best</li>
      <li>But I would never ever buy this shaver when I can get the excellent and original Philips-Norelco rotary shaver.  </li>
      <li>The flowing design provides a perfect blend for the total shaving experience and it does an excellent job - when I prepare correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product will give you a great shave, and the features are all top notch.</li>
      <li>It turns out the stand needs to be unfolded when used as a charger and in this position the shaver sits up in it nicely and is fairly stable.  </li>
      <li>am I ever glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Plus, the shave is ok too!  </li>
      <li>am I ever glad I did!</li>
      <li>It is the perfect fit for my hand size, which makes it easy to handle and to glide it around my face while shaving.</li>
      <li>sellers will kindly allow you to try on a pair of shoes before making a purchase.</li>
      <li>the Remington has a countdown timer, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>, I refuse to climb into a warm shower with any type of electrical device even if it is OSHA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a nice shaver and it indeed does it job well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also never seen the advantage of the WetTech technology; shaving in the shower seems impractical, but it did come in handy when I washed it up to put it away.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that there is no difference in the quality, speed or comfort between these two razors.  </li>
      <li>I liked about the Remington shaver:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>is nice sometimes.</li>
      <li>shaver is nice looking</li>
      <li>The Remington looks something like the Norelco with the three rotating heads, but this is not a comparison with the Norelco I don&#x27;t own one and never have--just a comment on the similarity of the looks.</li>
      <li>Well again, each to their own...</li>
      <li>But this one does just as nice as any Norelco or Panasonic</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is washable, which is always nice – rinse the head under water, etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The stand folds up nicely for travel, but I would trade travel space for a stand that isn&#x27;t falling over after the slightest bump.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>added feature is that you can use it in the shower with a gel or foam, I really liked that feature.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice feature of the XR1370 that I appreciate</li>
      <li>Remington has added a nice charging stand.</li>
      <li>and I might compare it in looks to a nice Panasonic and Norelco I own.  </li>
      <li>The heads have a kind of rubberized shock absorber to keep it contouring your face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice feature is a travel lock, so you won’t accidentally have it turn on while it’s in your luggage, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this one does just as nice as any Norelco or Panasonic</li>
      <li>But this is nice.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It is washable, which is always nice – rinse the head under water, etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>truly is a remarkable product as it is does an excellent job at both being quiet and durable.</li>
      <li>minutes remaining indicator is nice, and very accurate.  </li>
      <li>Results from &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; use if you are in a hurry are very good, but used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; with shaving cream either in the shower or by pre-wetting the face with warm to hot water before applying shaving cream, the ease and closeness of the shave can only be described as EXCELLENT!</li>
      <li>I am most impressed with the Remington Hyper Performance XR1370 for many good reasons starting with the shaving performance.</li>
      <li>This does have a nice feature in that it displays how many more minutes of operation are let on the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It provides a very smooth and close shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very good rotary razor for the money, and it&#x27;s BY FAR the finest razor I&#x27;ve ever seen from Remington.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this razor for two weeks and love it.</li>
      <li>have used Norelco shavers for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>so I had more control and could apply more pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came back to rotary from foil, and very happy once again.  </li>
      <li>My husband said it was a smooth shave and had a nice feel, lots of ability to get around the contours of his face</li>
      <li>it would be an even better shave than the 8150.</li>
      <li>Most of these are rotary models made by Norelco.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The heads flex inward more than the Norelco, so maintain better contact going around contours.</li>
      <li>think my favorite thing about this shaver is that I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now</li>
      <li>It also gives more power than NiMH batteries.</li>
      <li>For those approaching the \\&quot;chimney brush\\&quot; categories, shopping around and test driving might be the best advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used a range of foil and rotary shavers (mostly Remington) over the years and the XR1370 is definitely the best!</li>
      <li>Would like it better if it had: 1)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those who have crevasses range on the Crevasse Scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being The Grand Canyon and 1 being baby dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Okay, I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
      <li>I do NOT recommend this shaver  for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>overtime, it seems more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is “tippy” when sitting on the counter, too top</li>
      <li>It does a nice smooth job.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrible, impossible to clean without falling apart.</li>
    <li> a lot of shaver for your money</li>
    <li> First let me say I really like the design and ergonomics of this shaver, it feels better in my hand than any other. It doesnt irritate my skin and its quiet.&lt;br /&gt;  Having said that the main requirement of every shaver is to give you a good shave, this one does not shave my face. I do have what would be considered a heavy beard and one side of my face is much thicker than the other. I wouldnt discourage men with less heavy beards to try this shaver, for me it just didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;  I also would like to say Ive been using a braun for over 6 yrs its identical to the 790CC the shaft broke on my shaver and I am having great difficulty finding a replacement, Ive tried 3 shavers and they failed for me and that included the cooltec which I think is a terrible replacement for the 790CC I am most likely going to purchase another 790cc from amazon</li>
    <li> I would avoid buying this razor due to the battery can not hold a charge for more than one day.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this razor 6 months ago, after one month the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Remington about the problem, sent me a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;This one lasted 4 months before the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge over a day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea that you have to keep buying cartridges to clean it, that is very expensive, paying and plus shipping.  The shaver does give a close comfortable shave but don&#x27;t buy it unless you want to keep buying plus shipping the cartridges. What a gimmick. For this reason I will not buy another one.</li>
    <li> I used this razor to trim a full beard after &amp;#34;Movember&amp;#34; and was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed, especially compared to the more expensive Norelco Sensotouch 3D (which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer was able to get close enough to the skin that the razor was able to finish it off, and afterwards it literally felt like I just shaved with a razor! My skin was smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and my daughter (who hates beards and stubble) even let me kiss her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit feels generally well constructed; a little plasticky, but using it gives no reason to doubt its waterproof or battery life claims. On the subject of battery life, the long-lasting 60 minute ticker seemed fairly accurate, decrementing by the appropriate time during use, even when I used it for 20 minutes nonstop to take care of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor negatives I can mention are that the razor occasionally has the tendency to yank a facial hair or two before cutting it, which hurts a little, and it seems to take more passes to shave than the competing (but still more expensive) Sensotouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, given the closeness of the shave and the comparative value price of this razor, I&#x27;d probably buy IT over anything else on the market. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am most impressed with the Remington Hyper Performance XR1370 for many good reasons starting with the shaving performance. It is on a par with the Philip Norelco Shaver 9300 and Braun Series 7-720 models which I have used over the years. Of course these models mentioned above cost considerably more than the XR1370 and in my opinion, shave no better. I mean, attempting to differentiate shaving performances between these razors is in reality trying to split hairs. In all seriousness, I certainly can&#x27;t find a noticeable difference in shaving performance outside of the noise factor. Braun&#x27;s foil razor and Norelco&#x27;s rotary are both noisier. If one feels more confident paying more for a razor other than the XR1370 by all means go ahead modern marketing is there waiting for you to assuage your naivet&amp;eacute; ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that I appreciate, which is in direct contrast to the other razors mentioned above is the well designed charging stand. If you travel this stand locks securely and avoids a &#x27;dead fish&#x27; on arrival, let alone saving Homeland Security a start if the bloody thing goes off in your luggage. I don&#x27;t know what Norelco was thinking with their ridiculously klutzy contraptions they call charging stands, as they are anything but travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature of the XR1370 that I appreciate, it is as water proof as a frog&#x27;s arse and one can use it with confidence in the shower. As to shaving, what works for me is to wet my face and apply some mineral oil and shave away. Afterward in the shower, I lightly scrape the surface of a bar of soap with the shaving head and shave away again (not that it is needed) but it does help to clean both my face and razor. It also avoids having one of those bathtub vat gizmos to &#x60;sanitize&#x27; the razor as a on going expense. What social disease or infection they are designed to prevent escapes me completely, unless I speculate with a sense of humor. Well again, each to their own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative point that works against this razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the release of the XR1370, Remington made some really mediocre electric razors, that looked like poor &#x60;knock offs&#x27; of other Norelco models. Intrigued by its design, I surprised myself and over came my built in prejudice and bought the XR1370 and boy am I ever glad I did! They scored a bull&#x27;s eye with this one. I am impressed with its distinctive, sturdy, functional design of a razor and it delivers!razor...

    <li> For my use this is a terrible shaver. It is a Remington as is my old screen type shaver. There is no comparison to the two shavers. My old screen type shaves much closer, and faster. This is a good shaver for those that like the scruffy look that we see all around us these days. I prefer a close shave that last 8-10 hours. It never will happen with this shaver. I may send it back. It has been only a week that I have used it. I will give it a second week to be sure.</li>
    <li> After shaving frequently for the past 3 years I have been in the search for an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn. After having problems with other electric shavers i was given the zr1370. After using it everyday for the past week I couldn&#x27;t find a complaint. Minute timer is a great feature.</li>
    <li> Although you may have to go over an area a few times, I find it shaves smoothly and is much better than the Braun 3 series foil</li>
    <li> It is the perfect fit for my hand size, which makes it easy to handle and to glide it around my face while shaving. The rotating, flexible head enables you to get to all the uneven parts of your face; especially around the chin and throat. The cutting blades do a perfect job, without causing any razor burn to the skin. The remote plastic charging device should have solid base/foot so that the razor would remain upright while being electronically charged. I like the wet/dry shaving options which is another positive aspect of this razor. The cleaning of the cutting chamber is easy, snap off the head and snap it back on. It brushes out and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s XR1370 Hyper Series Rotary Shaver offers a high, feel good in the hand build quality and styling at at mid-range price point.  Indeed, it seems Remington tries to put more features/style into products at each respective price points in an attempt to tackle the sales leader in the industry, Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have delivered again.  You get lithium battery technology.  This is welcomed as you will find over the life of the shaver, the battery&#x27;s runtime will remain more consistent than older battery technologies.  Plus, a quick 5 minute charge will provide enough power for a single shave.  Perfect in the moments you find your shaver&#x27;s battery dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, you will have fewer of those moments when you run out of charge as there is a digital runtime display.  Right on the front of the shaver, it displays the minutes remaining until the next charge.  You can plan ahead before you reach 0!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is quite nice indeed for a Wet and Dry shaver.  There are chrome accents for style, but soft rubber grips, which feel good in the hand and prevents any slip in the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the stand is oh so clever.  While it holds the shaver upright on your a flat service, it also prevents the shaver from being accidentally switched on, if packed in a suitcase. Clever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is quite acceptable for a rotary shaver in this category.  It is about what you would expect.  Not perfect, but very good.  The head design simply does not have that perfect, natural, feel to it, but overtime, it seems more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Remington packed in a lot of features and style at a good price.  Plus, the shave is ok too!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the fact of the lithium battery and the way this product works.  It is quite and clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic looking shaver. It is beautiful, sleek, and black, and has a great elegance to it. I love the digital number display on the front of the unit that shows how many minutes of charge you have remaining. I also like that it is a wet/dry shaver, and offers around 60 minutes of shaving per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is this shaver costs close to a hundred dollars and offers no closer a shave than the $30 Norelco I had been using. I have gone back and forth and there really is no difference in the shave. I was excited to try this one because I saw the appearance and thought to myself, &amp;#34;finally, an electric shaver that will shave as close as a blade.&amp;#34; Nope. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is a nice shaver and it indeed does it job well. It just doesn&#x27;t shave any better than some of the more economical shavers.  Nearly all practical products offer the same solution at both inexpensive and very expensive options.(cell phones, tablets, cars, etc.) If you want a good shave with a shaver that will also look great on your bathroom counter, you cannot go wrong with this shaver. If you want something cheaper and don&#x27;t care about looks or the ability to see your remaining charge, then there are cheaper solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know someone who would like a new razor for Christmas, the elegance of this shaver makes it a great gift. That is the time you may want to splurge for something nicer than you would buy for yourself, because this would really make a nice gift. But if it&#x27;s just for you and you don&#x27;t need the extra window dressing, just be advised while it is a nice shaver, you likely won&#x27;t see a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric shaver for decades and have been interested in getting back to a rotary shaver to replace my [[ASIN:B00BFS89SQ Braun Smart Control 190s-1 Cordless Foil Shaver]].  This Remington Hyper Series shaver is a highly capable but not necessarily a better shaver than my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington&#x27;s quality of shave was on par with the Braun.  For the first week (because I&#x27;m a bit of a nerd) I shaved half my face with the Remington and the other half with the old Braun.  I didn&#x27;t discern any difference in the quality of the shave - either immediately after shaving nor at the end of the day. The Remington&#x27;s Hyperflex head configuration is very flexible and slides around the face well, but it did not reduce my shaving time compared to the Braun&#x27;s single foil design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the Remington shaver:&lt;br /&gt;1 - It&#x27;s quiet.  I awake before the rest of my household and I appreciate a shaver that doesn&#x27;t sound like a hedge trimmer.  This shaver is impressively quiet, barely audible outside of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;2 - It feels good in the hand.  The rubber side grips keep the shaver secure in my hand and the shape is easy to hold.  It makes my Braun foil shaver feel like a brick in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;1 - Oh what a small trimmer - The pop-up trimmer isn&#x27;t very wide so don&#x27;t expect to trim anything quickly.  I shouldn&#x27;t complain about it since the smaller size is due to the better handle shape (which I just stated that I liked).&lt;br /&gt;2 - The charging base is a bit flimsy - It doesn&#x27;t take much to knock this guy over when it&#x27;s on the stand.  The stand folds up nicely for travel, but I would trade travel space for a stand that isn&#x27;t falling over after the slightest bump.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Pricey - There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough difference between this shaver and less expensive options to warrant its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;The Remington boasts a quick charge capability.  I didn&#x27;t put this claim to the test because I always put the shaver back on the charging base after use so the battery never got drained.  The handle has an LED indicating the number of minutes of charge left, which is a step up from the four light indicator on my Braun.  What would have been nice would be a counter indicating how many times I&#x27;ve used the shaver with its current set of blades (alerting me when I should start to consider getting a new set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion it is a capable yet pricey shaver that won&#x27;t wake up the rest of my household when in use.I always put the shaver back on the charging base after use so the battery never got drained.

    <li> As far as I can tell, actual shaving experience comes down to the heads.  Razors can add better batteries, stands, pop up trimmers,  and indicator lights which can be very useful and may impact the convenience of shaving.  However, the actual shave seems to be related to which head is used.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has a fairly large head compared to other brands.  That means in smaller areas (above the lip, near the nose between lip and chin) it can be harder to maneuver.  It does give a closer shave than the Norelco on the flat parts of the face.  However the trimmer is nice and narrow and can be used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super long battery life (60 min) and quick recharge (90 min).  Digital readout tells you how much time you have left.  Lithium batteries usually have a longer life span than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;Can use wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE to take the base with you (it does fold up) in order to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;It is “tippy” when sitting on the counter, too top heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note that is IS an excellent shaver for legs.  The big surface area makes quick work of the larger surface area of legs (when compared to a face!) and the flex head makes shaving knees easy.  Since it can shave wet, you can use it in the shower and the long run time means you can just charge it once a week.</li>
    <li> This Remington Hyper Shave is very well made and has some nice features: sleek design, ergonomic, wet/dry option, digital display, quick charge, long battery life, but in all honesty I didn’t think that it shaved very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought I had a defective device. I ran the dry shaver over my skin and literally couldn’t feel a difference between the shaved and unshaven sections. On closer examination I could see that the hair was cut, but it wasn’t cut close enough to the skin. I could still see and feel stubble. I shaved again, this time pressing harder, but still couldn’t get rid of the stubble. I tried with water and shaving gel, but the wet shave was not as close as the dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this shaver looks very attractive and high-tech sitting on my counter-top, but it doesn’t shave as well as my $30 economy brand.</li>
    <li> I use the razor daily and so far I have been satisfied with the job it does.  It takes a little getting used to using it but it works well and so far has done a good job.  I am very happy I made the purchase and would purchase another if I needed to.</li>
    <li> Good shaver but I find it hard to get all the hairs right under the nose because the silver heads dont sit at the edge and the plastic around it crapes the nose and get all the way to the top of the lip. And the trimmer on the back downtown feel protected enough to where it might cut your skin.</li>
    <li> My other half has been using this shaver and provided the outline of this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s electric shavers come in two basic types: rotary style like this one or foil / linear style like this [[ASIN:B007P1T7JC Remington FR-730 Pivot and Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Shaver with Two Flexing Foils and Intercept Trimmer, Grey]]. Prices range from under $20 to over $300. with blade quality, options and accessories making the difference for both types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about $100, this shaver is near the top of Remington&#x27;s price range for rotary shavers. Its higher end features include: cordless; wet or dry use; built in trimmer, decent power; and sixty minutes run time between charges. Features on rotary and foil shavers that cost more than this Remington can include some or all of these: titanium blades that stay sharper longer; more powerful motor for a quicker shave; bigger built in trimmer; and an automatic cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shaver daily for about three weeks. I can recommend it for giving a close shave and having cordless convenience. What I don&#x27;t like is the amount of time it takes. Even after using it daily, I have to make multiple passes over the same areas while pressing down. I can shave my face faster using a manual safety razor and shaving cream. Also, smaller areas, such as just below my nostrils, require extra attention or little patches of stubble get left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another issue when the GFCI breaker in the bathroom had tripped. I had run the shaver&#x27;s battery down and failed to notice it wasn&#x27;t charging. The next day I couldn&#x27;t use it because it can only be used cordless. If the battery fails completely someday, the shaver becomes useless without a replacement battery on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, considering the price, I rate this three stars. I&#x27;m using it but I don&#x27;t love it. It will do until I can replace my old [[ASIN:B005DKKBUG Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc 3 Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning System]], which is the foil type, gives a shave I prefer 100% more, has an automatic cleaning system and is less expensive.type, gives a shave I prefer 100% more, has an automatic cleaning system and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using standard blade razors for some time now. I shave daily for work and it&#x27;s quite a pain. I picked up the Remington model in hopes that it would eleviate some cuts &amp; irritation from regular blades. I have been very impressed. Not only does it cut well but I&#x27;ve seen the irritation on my neck decrease significantly. The flip up trimmer is also an added bonus. Its been great so far!</li>
    <li> I have a norelco that is similar to this and stopped using it when I discovered the remington 8150 that really gives me a good shave. I bought this thinking it would be an even better shave than the 8150. Not so. I will keep using the remington 8150  and I am sending the xr1370 back for a refund. This shaver is  is worse than the norelco 3d. The cutting heads just don&#x27;t give me a good shave in these new hi tech savers.</li>
    <li> I received my shaver today it was exactly what i had ordered.It was delivered to me on time exactly when it was due to be delivered., as descrived by the shipping instructions i was given when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem recommending the product or the shipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> Okay, I haven&#x27;t used it. I bought it for my dad&#x27;s Christmas gift. It&#x27;s been six months, and he just loves it. He has not used it wet. He is full of praise for this. Close shave, comfortable for an 85-year-old to use.</li>
    <li> It started out alright.  It cut the stubble off of my face with effort.&lt;br /&gt;It seems cheap.  Button is weak and has excessive movement.&lt;br /&gt;Protective cover was broken when it arrived; frustrating when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts poorly, and no amount of water, soap, shaving cream helps.  It seems to do best when dry, before the foil heats up from friction and it stops cutting well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 16th, 2016 update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck of the shaver came off and shattered on the floor while using the unit.  The blades came apart from the foil and retainer, ALL of which broke into shards upon the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2016 update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Remington and they they sent a new replacement which is capable of accidentally occasionally cutting a facial hair and irritating the hell out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beard is far more comfortable,  reliable and is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington will never see another penny from my household.</li>
    <li> Had a several Norelcos before trying a Remington. The last Norelco lasted just a year before it died and the heads were $60 a pop. Then last year Norelco decided to switch head style and could not find a head without spending $120 plus since they planned the transition poorly and ran out of the old ones before the new heads hit the market. Anyway, long story short I tried Remington and I am very happy. Shaves as well as the Norelco and for a fraction of the price. I like the indicator telling me how many minutes of charge I have left. It is a little noisier than the Norelcos. Happy with the purchase, I have had it for a little over a year now.</li>
    <li> Mostly we&#x27;ve used Norelco razors around here, so this is our first experience with a Remington. It&#x27;s been a good experience, so far. There are three flexible heads that adjust to any angle on your face, this helps you get a close shave without irritation. The battery runs for 60 minutes before you need to charge and you can use a 5 minute quick charge if it&#x27;s low and you&#x27;re on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added feature is that you can use it in the shower with a gel or foam, I really liked that feature. Overall a very nice razor and is recommended.</li>
    <li> The Remington XR1370 Rotary Shaver is a good, quality shaver with long shave times.  I&#x27;ve been a Braun guy for a long time, but the Remington rotary shavers are starting to win me over.  For the XR1370, you get a close shave with plenty of charge time available to you.  You don&#x27;t have to pack the charger, as you can likely use it on short trips and not run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is comfortable and the head is very flexible.  The charging cradle is a bit awkward looking, but it seems to work just fine.  I also find the handle of the shaver to be a little small as well and more difficult to hold if you have larger hands.  But from a shaving point of view, you are good to go.  There is also a clear time indicator showing you time remaining on the battery in minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 electric razors the past year or two and I have stuck with the Panny wet/dry that you can find highly rated on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the classic rotary style vs straight vs blade conflict that has been going on since the dawn of time, well maybe less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shave on the cheeks was very smooth, no tugging, very close, quiet.  The only issue I have with this and why I&#x27;ll keep using the Panny is the 3 rotary blade system, I still can&#x27;t easily get to all areas on the face and you have to be extra special not to totally screw up your sides.  Under the nose is very hard as well as under the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewer, this is aces if you have a very large area to cover like the legs, I&#x27;m going to ask my fiance if she wants it.  A big reason is that you can cover a LOT more area with fewer motions with this than a straight style like the Panny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is quite nice, high quality if again, you like the 3 rotary style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a month now and overall its been just OK. Here are my experiences with it:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The form and build quality is good. I had no issues with the ergonomics of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Pivoting head is nice sometimes. Other times you wish it would not pivot.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The shave wasnt particularly good or close for me. Occasionally pulled as well.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;It is a quiet device.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Battery lasts for about an hour and charges in roughly 1.5 hours. It does this through the stand included; which is flimsy and doesnt stand still very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i wouldnt really recommend it; i think it is a hit or miss kind of a shaver.</li>
    <li> (ORIGINALLY 4 STARS -- SEE UPDATE AT END FOR CHANGE TO 2 STARS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for a point of reference, I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for about 12 years and have not yet tried a Remington product I liked -- until now!  Also for reference, I&#x27;ve found that Norelco rotaries tend to be either -- A) expensive, slow to shave with, and offer a very close shave, and charge quickly; or B) mid-priced, quick to shave with, offer a less-close shave, and charge slowly -- and I currently own one of both, and I choose which one to use based on how much time I have to get out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because this Remington rotary seems to split the difference between Norelco&#x27;s A and B:  it&#x27;s mid-priced, quick to shave with, gives me a moderately close shave, and charges relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS --&lt;br /&gt;1) Speed;&lt;br /&gt;2) Price;&lt;br /&gt;3) Moderately close shave;&lt;br /&gt;4) BRILLIANTLY simple color-coding scheme to index blades to screens -- something Norelco should have come up with LONG ago;&lt;br /&gt;5) Offers wet-shaving and does a fairly good job at it;&lt;br /&gt;6) Relatively quick to charge;&lt;br /&gt;7) Excellent remaining shave time indicator;&lt;br /&gt;8) Clever travel lock-up design on charger;&lt;br /&gt;9) Relatively useful sideburn trimmer (which I&#x27;ve never seen on a Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS --&lt;br /&gt;1) Only moderately close shave;&lt;br /&gt;2) Nicked me a number of times, which I don&#x27;t think has ever happened with a Norelco;&lt;br /&gt;3) Lacks an internal drain, which makes shaving at the sink (not just in the shower) possible without a mess on some Norelcos;&lt;br /&gt;4) While wet shaving, head clogs up frequently, requiring partial disassembly to clean out several times during a wet-shave;&lt;br /&gt;5) Head assembly feels a bit more fragile than I&#x27;m comfortable with, though not terribly so, and heads don&#x27;t float as much as I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good rotary razor for the money, and it&#x27;s BY FAR the finest razor I&#x27;ve ever seen from Remington.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend your considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- I stand behind the above as it concerns initial quality, but I&#x27;ve reduced the rating to two stars because after two months&#x27; use the beard trimmer fell off.  A few weeks after that, the plastic device holding on the head assemblies gave way, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to hold the razor together.  Terrible build quality!

    <li> Remington has been doing this curious thing recently as they try to provide razors that fit within a certain nitch. A few years ago they released a razor that could be charged via a micro usb port and it had a countdown display to show battery life. They have since fine tuned that style of razor and released this model which has a longer battery life and a better display screen. I feel like the upgrade has created a much better product. The battery life on this model is good and I like knowing how much longer I can continue to use the product before the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a remarkable product as it is does an excellent job at both being quiet and durable. I don&#x27;t think I can be more positive in my praise for Remington&#x27;s design of this product, for both its function and its style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the function of this Remington shaver. I find this razor provides an adequately close shave and with the right amount of preparation as it cuts closely without ripping. Of all the razors that I have used this product definitely provides the least amount of razor burn damage to my face. It is very easy to clean and comes with a little brush to help in this endeavor. I also really like how I can bring the razor into the shower as it is built to be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as style, this is a tough razor that is well built and easy to clean. I don&#x27;t have to worry about throwing this razor into my dopp kit. It really does not need a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few negatives with this razor. I really don&#x27;t think that the asking price is right. I appreciate the changes in the technology of the electric razor but as another reviewer commented, I don&#x27;t feel that the shave, the primary function of the razor, is worth $100. There is a niche here that Remington is building towards. A razor with a great battery life that has a good electronic display. It is a good razor but I could buy one that does a similar job at half the cost without the electronic features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like this product and I will continue to use Remington products, but it does give me pause to consider just how many technological features are really needed for my morning shave.eatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like this product and I will continue to use Remington products, but it does give me pause to consider just how many technological features are really needed for my morning shave.</li>
    <li> The digitial time left is great.  The waterproofness is great.  The heads themselves shave well, but the overall shave is mediocre.  You have to go over the same spot several times.  The reason is the cutters are spaced too far apart in the head, so you can run the head over your face and not hit lines of it with the cutters.  They should be closer together.  They should also have less space around the edges so you can more precisely shave up next to beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind going over the same spot a few times this shaver does shave well, it&#x27;s waterproof, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also another nit to pick is that the power is 5V 1A, which is exactly the same as most micro-usb cellphone chargers.  Only you can&#x27;t use your cell phone charger to charge this because the plug is incomprehensibly incompatible.</li>
    <li> No complaints about this shaver.  I use it with shave gel and the shave is closer than previous electric razors I have owned.  I used my previous Norelco (Paid around $100) for 5+ years and just decided I wanted to switch it up.  It&#x27;s a little big for traveling but if you remove the head, it&#x27;s no problem.  The charging base doubles as a &amp;#34;travel case&amp;#34; of sorts (It just covers up the power button so it won&#x27;t turn on by accident).  The battery life is excellent.  I can use it for weeks without charging.  If looks matter to you, it looks pretty cool.  My only complaint is the pop up shaver on the back is pretty small.  I still keep my Norelco around for that purpose.</li>
    <li> My husband has owned several electric razors over the years, he says this one without a doubt, the most advanced and user friendly razor he has ever owned.  The floating rotating heads conform to his face for a closer shave.  He says the percent of battery charge is displayed on the body of the razor.  My husband says he recommends this razor.</li>
    <li> We currently have three razors in the house ranging in price from $30-$95 (this model). It seems that the higher the price, the more features you get. Our middle ground razor is my husbands favorite right now. The lowest priced model is my son&#x27;s who doesn&#x27;t have much to shave yet. So what do you get when you almost double the price? Remington has added a nice charging stand. You can charge it directly from the cord or place it upright in the stand and not have to unplug it when you want to use it. The heads have a kind of rubberized shock absorber to keep it contouring your face. It runs super quiet and has a pop-out mini-shaver for sideburns, beard trims or necks. This does have a nice feature in that it displays how many more minutes of operation are let on the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, does it justify the price tag? It depends on your budget. There are other shavers out there that do just as good a job for less. But this is nice. My husband said it was a smooth shave and had a nice feel, lots of ability to get around the contours of his face but he still prefers his middle priced shaver.</li>
    <li> For some shaving may be an \\&quot;art.\\&quot; For me, it&#x27;s a daily chore. The Remington looks something like the Norelco with the three rotating heads, but this is not a comparison with the Norelco I don&#x27;t own one and never have--just a comment on the similarity of the looks. Basically, the three heads are arranged to give your whiskers a rotating cut so that no matter which way they are lying, you&#x27;ll get a close shave. They&#x27;re also \\&quot;floating\\&quot; so that they adjust to your face. It does a nice smooth job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has a 60-minute runtime, and while even the Abominable Snowman doesn&#x27;t take that long to shave, no one is going to run out of juice on this shaver. It has its own stand for re-charging  and an LCD read-out telling you how much time you have before a re-charge. The good thing about the charging stand is that it is small (good for travel) but it&#x27;s not exactly stable. So put it somewhere you won&#x27;t bump into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small but important feature (and my favorite) is the little pop-up trimmer (think switch-blade) that they call a \\&quot;ComfortTrim Detailer.\\&quot; For those of us with a mustache, keeping those things from getting shaggy can be a hassle, but the trimmer on the Remington makes it easy. Also, if you&#x27;re overdue for a haircut, you can use it to touch-up around the ears or the back of your neck. Likewise, the sideburns get uneven and quickly gives you an unkept look--the \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is a big help in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you like to jump in the shower and shave, using a gel or shaving cream, this product is amphibious.  Every shaver can pull a little, but in the shower with a gel on, it&#x27;s about as smooth as it get. This is one of those \\&quot;what&#x27;s-not-to-like\\&quot; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final point. On the side of the box is an OR code reader that you can scan with your mobile phone (I used my iPhone). It&#x27;s supposed to be a &#x27;Weekly Tips for Every Man.&#x27; The tip it gave me was not to wear speedos and adjust the length of swimming suits depending on how tall you are.

    <li> The shaving head on this razor is large, with a lot of space between the edge and the blades.  This makes it difficult to shave up to edges like under your nose or your sideburns.  The entire head is very flexible, which can be nice, but I sometimes found myself stabilizing the head with my fingers so I had more control and could apply more pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minutes remaining indicator is nice, and very accurate.  When I first got the shaver I charged it for a full 24 hours and it showed 60 minutes.  After the seventh shave the display showed Lo.  I should have plugged it into the charger at this point, but I thought I would see how long it would run after that.  The next morning it ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Luckily my old shaver still had a charge and I used that.  I didn&#x27;t realize until that point that this shaver cannot be used while it is charging.  The charger plugs into the stand and then the razor sits on the stand.  It has a quick charge feature, but I didn&#x27;t try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit embarrassed to say the charging stand confused me at first.  I thought you were supposed to clamp the stand around the shaver while it charged.  This does not work, as I found out the next morning when the shaver was still dead.  I was also disappointed that the shaver could not stand on end in the base in this mode.  It turns out the stand needs to be unfolded when used as a charger and in this position the shaver sits up in it nicely and is fairly stable.  The base clamps around shaver to secure it for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco shavers for many, many years.  This is the second Remington shaver I&#x27;ve tried and in both cases it took longer for me to get a good shave and the shave was never as close as I got with the Norelcos.  I&#x27;ve also never seen the advantage of the WetTech technology; shaving in the shower seems impractical, but it did come in handy when I washed it up to put it away.</li>
    <li> wonderfull shaver its the best, the first time that i am sure that it is the best, I know that I will recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a razor blade to shave for my whole life, however I had been thinking about switching to electric. I&#x27;ve now been using this razor for two weeks and love it. It is quiet, quick to use, and very gentle on my face. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to any consumer looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Really, I can&#x27;t say this is a bad machine.  But I would never ever buy this shaver when I can get the excellent and original Philips-Norelco rotary shaver.  Even the old Norelco 1050 is better than this one, shaving as a Gillette Mach 3 cartridge.  But the Philips Norelco 1250 is simply superb!.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for about two weeks now, and I can’t find any major flaws. I had one from Philips and it broke without a reason. I used the Philips razor for about a year, and a couple weeks ago it just didn’t want to recharge. I wasn’t sure if it was just the nature of the NiMH battery (even so, it’s disappointing that it lasted only a year and wasn’t replaceable) or something else in the recharging system. Anyhow, it is always disappointing that things stop working right after warranty period. So because of this experience, I took closer look at the battery and charging system on this shaver. This one, luckily, has lithium battery that can last loner and quicker to recharge than NiMH. It also gives more power than NiMH batteries. In order to recharge the battery, I had to use the charging stand, and I found that’s good and bad. The plus is that there’s no plug in port on the shaver so there’s less chance of mechanical failure (only in my theory). And the negative is that if I travel longer than a week, I have to carry this charging stand. However, I really think this one was designed well. The stand takes minimal space when both opened (standing position) and closed (carry and travel position). Even though I said ‘negative’ I would not mind carrying that when traveling because it takes such a small space unlike Braun’s expensive and bulky ‘cleaning and recharging’ dock. The image with the stand on the product description page shows a different stand, but the actual stand that came in the box works really well, and it’s quite simple and convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Other things, such as light weight, waterproof, good grip, trimmer, and flexible head might be common among other shavers, and this one features them very favorable as well. I also like how this shaver is quiet compared to my previous ones (Philips’ and Braun’s).&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaving result, this one definitely gave me a better shave than my Philips one, and it was close to my Braun S5. Everyone&#x27;s mileage may vary, but I can’t complain with the result, and it felt good after the shaving. Also, it did a good job under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a satisfactory shaver with lots of good features. The built quality is satisfactory, and the feel from the grip is really good. If this is cheaply made product, I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody, but this is not.&lt;br /&gt;The box includes a recharging stand, power cable, and a cover (for the head). I wish it came with a little carrying case or pouch or something. Overall, a great buy, and it makes a nice gift.</li>
    <li> This Remington is a very good rotary shaver.  It does a reasonable job on my whiskers.  Because of its design, it is easy to manipulate and use this shaver.  Whereas some companies have developed cleaning units to compliment their razors.  This Remington requires you to wash by hand, with a daily regime and a more involved, though still simple, weekly regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Ergonomic design is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;  Lightweight shaver&lt;br /&gt;  Works wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;  Pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;  It has a large LED display to indicate time left in the battery, or when charging.&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;  The head angles and moves easily to match the contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;  Pop-up hair trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  No travel case&lt;br /&gt;  External cradle for charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a foil shaver user, it takes several weeks for your beard to get used to the rotary shaver.  Once it did, I got a dependable shave every day.</li>
    <li> I have owned, and presently own, several electric shavers.  Most of these are rotary models made by Norelco.  Normally I prefer Norelco over Remington, as I have found them to shave somewhat better in general and prefer some features (my last one cost similar to a mid-range Norelco but lacked a pop up trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is in the box?&lt;br /&gt;• Remington XR1370 shaver&lt;br /&gt;• Charging Stand&lt;br /&gt;• Cleaning Brush&lt;br /&gt;• User Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is nice looking and I might compare it in looks to a nice Panasonic and Norelco I own.  It can be used wet or dry, which is always nice.  It can be used with shave gel also.  Of course, as a concession to being wet/dry, this means you cannot use it while charging.  This is typical of all wet/dry shavers and is a safety precaution against someone who might try to plug it in and use it in the shower at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes only about 80-90 minutes to fully charge and will run for about an hour ‘s worth of shaves.  The first charge takes close to 24 hours.  It uses a Li-ion battery and while these charge quickly and last a long time, the one trade off is, rather than it slowing down as its battery drains, a shaver using a li-ion battery abruptly stops when the battery is dead.  So it is very nice that this shaver has a display which shows you the charge that is left, in approximate minutes!  Remington suggests letting the battery go dead every six months and charging again for 24 hours to prolong battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver handles worldwide voltage.  Charging on a stand may seem a nuisance to some. I prefer a plain AC cable so I can lay the razor flat while charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shave, this razor provides a close, comfortable shave which I find to be the same as my Norelco AT790 which costs about $35 dollars less.  For me it did a very good job on my cheeks, around my mouth and my neck.  I don’t find that any rotary shaver  does  a perfect job on my neck so I will sometimes follow with a regular blade.  But this one does just as nice as any Norelco or Panasonic I’ve used.  It seems a little quieter than my Norelco, not that the Norelco is loud by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a nice contoured shape and is easy to hold, and feels lightweight, yet not cheap, in your hands.  If where something is manufactured is a concern to you, this shaver is made in China, while some of the similarly priced Norelco shavers are made in The Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XR1370 also features a pop up trimmer, which works well for sideburns, neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is washable, which is always nice – rinse the head under water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is a travel lock, so you won’t accidentally have it turn on while it’s in your luggage, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other makers, Remington sees fit to charge you $80-$100 for a shaver, but the only protection it packages with the product is a clear, plastic cover for the heads.  While that is nice, I miss the inclusion of some sort of small carrying pouch.  This is the same with Norelco, so its not a knock against this specific brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a 60 day money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty so you can buy with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall there is nothing to dislike about this shaver.  For about $15 less you can probably find Norelco’s AT830.  I have that and it’s the same shave.  For a lot less you can get theNorelco  AT790, which also has a similar shave.etimes follow with a regular blade.  But this one does just as nice as any Norelco or Panasonic I’ve used.

    <li> Comfortable shave, but not close shaving dry.  Cannot shave in shower.  What alternatives do you believe that  I have with it?  I&#x27;m having to return to my five blade Fusion razor.</li>
    <li> It shaves really well, the trimmer is a great extra feature. It takes a few passes to get a good close shave, but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> switching from a blade to electric razor is difficult for a tough beard.  But after a few uncomfortable shaves, it gets the job done pretty well.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used a range of foil and rotary shavers (mostly Remington) over the years and the XR1370 is definitely the best! Results from &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; use if you are in a hurry are very good, but used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; with shaving cream either in the shower or by pre-wetting the face with warm to hot water before applying shaving cream, the ease and closeness of the shave can only be described as EXCELLENT! And the price compared to other top rotary brands is UNBEATABLE!</li>
    <li> This shaver has performed very well so far. I&#x27;ve had it now for one month.  It provides a very smooth and close shave. The only problem I have is the fact that the shaver seems a little week when I shave dry, the motor slows down considerably.  When I shave with water and/or shaving lotion it works great....</li>
    <li> Love this Remington over my previous Panasonic ES8103S Arc 3 foil Shaver.  Came back to rotary from foil, and very happy once again.  Long time Norelco rotary user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- pivoting head&lt;br /&gt;- quiet, MUCH quieter than Panasonic foil&lt;br /&gt;- pop-up trimmer opens smoothly, works very well&lt;br /&gt;- power remaining in minutes, great feature, accurate&lt;br /&gt;- waterproof is a big plus, can wash shaver afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t find a way to fix head in one position [stop from pivoting]</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding an electric shaver that pleases everybody is as easy as finding a pair of shoes that pleases everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most sellers will kindly allow you to try on a pair of shoes before making a purchase. Good luck finding a business that will allow you to try out a razor before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this razor feels natural on both my face and in my hand. The flowing design provides a perfect blend for the total shaving experience and it does an excellent job - when I prepare correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a rule from the old school of outdoor construction that also applies to shaving. The successful completion of any job requires that 90% of the total job will be in the preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation is an art form that requires extra time that most don&#x27;t take or have but it makes all the difference in the world in the quality of your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between a blade and a rotary shaver and often go a week between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer the duration the more preparation that is required - and preparation is the key to being a happy shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are approximately 7.131 billion different faces in the world with uniquely different shapes, curves and oddities of features, some natural and some not. About 50% of these faces need some sort of shaving implement at least once a year whether they use one or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have beards range on the Beard Scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being steel wire on a chimney brush and 1 being baby fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have crevasses range on the Crevasse Scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being The Grand Canyon and 1 being baby dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known men who should be going to a big box hardware or lawn and garden store for their shaving implements and have a utility trailer to bring them home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the type of beard tested for the review really helps. Are we testing face hair on Big Foot or the E-Trade Baby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1 to 10, I&#x27;m about a 5 on both the beard and crevasse scale and this razor does everything I want it to do. For those approaching the \\&quot;chimney brush\\&quot; categories, shopping around and test driving might be the best advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the product information page and reviews, there&#x27;s nothing much left to add. Well, maybe one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lithium batteries are the only way to go. The extra cost is justified. I&#x27;ve struggled with NiCd and NiMh batteries for decades. If I have an option, Lipo it is. A Lithium battery will hold a charge for close to two years. Try that with NiCd and see how it works out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been knocked down from a few explosions in Nam and rendered unconscious from a lightning bolt at home, I refuse to climb into a warm shower with any type of electrical device even if it is OSHA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do whatever makes you comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for the price... the cutting performance is below that of the [[ASIN:B003V32UDI Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Razor]] SensoTouch 3D line and closer to matching the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]]. Battery capacity is in line with other peers at about 60 minutes, the countdown display is nice and helpful particularly if you&#x27;re packing for a last minute trip. The ergonomics are good, but it didn&#x27;t quite feel as good in the hand as similar Norelcos.</li>
    <li> I can compare this to the Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor which AI have been using for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;The heads flex inward more than the Norelco, so maintain better contact going around contours. I love the pivoting head - it keeps the blades flush on the face easily.  The blade unit removes completely  but I have to pry it off with a fingernail (the Norelco&#x27;s flips up on a hinge).  The trimmer is narrower with finer blades than the Norelco, good for small areas, but the wider Norelco might be better for sideburns.  The Norelco cuts a little smoother when wet, the Remmington smoother when dry.  The time display on the Remington is super, just be sure to charge it for 24 hours the first time to set it properly. I like the stand - it stands the razor up while charging and folds close against the handle for travel.  I have a feeling this will be the favorite of the two.</li>
    <li> This is a capable rotary shaver.  I have tried many different types of shavers.  Thanks to the vine program I get to try different types on a fairly regular basis.  This replaces a Norelco with three cutting heads.  I have also had Braun foil shavers in the past but I find that the rotary shavers seem to do a better job, in general.  This shaver has three heads, which is normal for a rotary, and each head has two cutters, which is less than I am accustomed to.  My old shaver has three cutting section per wheel.  I find that going down to two cutters actually decreases the quality of the shave.  I can get the same result but it requires more passes.  The pivoting head I find to be gimmicky.  I can get everywhere I need to regardless of whether or not the head pivots.  I would not buy it for that feature alone.  The one nice feature this has over my old one is a charging stand.  For that reason I have replaced my old shaver with it since this is a nice convenience.  I also like the digital readout on shaving time remaining, although this is less useful since with the charging stand it never gets below full charge.  Might be useful on vacation or such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I sometimes long for the better shave I got with my old shaver with the triple cutters.  In all, this is a fine, capable shaver, but if you have a few more dollars to spend I would just get one with triple cutters and a charging stand instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco brand shavers for a long time, but I was impressed by this Remington. The biggest differences are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s much quieter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gives a smooth shave without the skin-ripping feeling I sometimes get from the Norelcos (e.g., the SmartTouch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t as fragile in construction as the head assembly of the newer Norelcos. I hate traveling with those because it frequently pops off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a shaver at this pricepoint, I&#x27;d definitely give it a look, as it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Having gone through several rotary shavers in the last year (all newer models), the guy in the house is very happy with this one. It gives a very smooth shave faster than the usual fixed-head rotary with less pulling on the skin. Razor bumps have also noticeably decreased. The shaver keeps a nice long charge and has an attractive stand that keeps bathroom counter mess to a minimum.</li>
    <li> This product will give you a great shave, and the features are all top notch. If you are looking for a top of the line electric razor, get this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But . . . if you are willing to go without the extra lights and frills, you can get almost the same quality shave from a less expensive razor. At almost $100, this is not cheap - but gets the job done better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver.  If I were scoring it as a stand alone product I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars but I can&#x27;t do that at this price point.  The reason being is that the Philips Norelco PT724/41 is every bit as good a shaver but costs 50% less.  I used them side by side for two weeks and I can honestly say that there is no difference in the quality, speed or comfort between these two razors.  In fact the only real positive side of the Remington is that it has a lithium battery that lasts longer than the Norelco.  But is this battery worth $45 dollars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure the Remington has a countdown timer, which is nice.  But it does nothing for me other than give me something to look at after the shave is complete.  The Remington also has a pivoting head but I can not see it making any impact on the way I shave or the results I get with either razor; so this is a bust for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a blind side by side comparison between these two shavers - there is no difference.  The Norelco being 1/2 the price is the one I would buy if I had to replace my shaver.  Given that, I can not recommend the Remignton.  It is an excellent shaver but the battery is not worth the price delta.</li>
    <li> shave is not close. cut head is all plastic, feels cheap. waiting for it to break.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 96 year old father and he loves it!  Easy to operate and charge.</li>
    <li> I purchased the XR1370 shaver about a year ago with great expectations as being the newest model from Remington. I do NOT recommend this shaver  for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do NOT expect a close shave with this electric razor! The rotary blades do NOT turn fast enough thus the shaving time is very long and still does NOT result in a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yesterday, the the pop-up side burn trimmer broke off! First of all, it is too NARROW compared to the older models and it pivots (pivoted) on two very tiny plastic pivots points - one of which broke off and can NOT be repaired! It is with great difficulty that now I try to use this feature until the other plastic pivot will also break off. Extremely poor design and choice of the plastic material. Terrible cost reduction. Plastic pivots to take the constant use? Common Remington engineers/designers you guys can do a lot better than using tiny plastic pivots to take the pressure while using this feature of the shaver. If you insist on using plastic pivot points, then choose a plastic material that can take the constant use without breaking off within a year or so. Do NOT purchase this shaver at any cost!</li>
    <li> Only  works on less than day old beard</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he totally loves it. It&#x27;s so convenient since he&#x27;s on deployment and he can dry shave. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Reasonable produce.  Would like it better if it had: 1) a travel pouch to help protect the head when packing, and 2) direct plugin to the razor itself rather than only through the &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34;, which makes it much less attractive as taking the latter along wipes out is size advantage for taking on extended travel.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I used to just use disposable razors before. It reaches spots that all my other razors would have to go over 8-10 times. I found that it works both wet and dry. I won&#x27;t recommend dry, of course.&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite thing about this shaver is that I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it just now dropped to 50% battery. I&#x27;m sold and I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
