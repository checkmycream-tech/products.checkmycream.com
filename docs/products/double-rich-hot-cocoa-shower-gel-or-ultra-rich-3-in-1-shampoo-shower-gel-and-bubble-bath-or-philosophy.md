      <li>But the yummy smells of the Philosophy products is worth it!</li>

      <li>Philosophy double rich hot cocoa body wash is good for just bathing, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of the hot cocoa.</li>

      <li>but I think you really need a rinse and repeat.</li>
      <li>hair and body very well,</li>
      <li>I expected a lot more from this company...</li>
      <li>Right now I have 75 of the same philosophy emails</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal customer of theirs for a long time, and have tons and TONS of stuff from them.  </li>
      <li>Their brand has something else in it that gives it a different fragrance...not quite hot chocolate.  </li>

      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Fun to use, but the smell goes away soon after you dry off.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would never pay this much for a basic product like a body wash,but I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff now!</li>
      <li>or I will be taking action.</li>

    <li> I received a free sample of the hot cocoa. It was fabulous! My shower smelled like chocolate. It was rich and lathering! After my shower the scent of chocolate still lingered in my hair until it was completely dry! It was so yummy! I have been using the spiced apple cider shampoo and body wash but I love the hot cocoa so much more! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the Philosophy bath washes did a better job of conditioning your hair. I usually need to use an extra conditioner with the product! But the yummy smells of the Philosophy products is worth it!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This stuff smells just like fudge brownie batter!  I love it so much!  An easy way to get your chocolate fix without your hips growing!  I exchanged Sephora&#x27;s triple layer cake body wash for this, and I&#x27;m so happy I did!  I love it!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> When I was in rehab, this was such a nice product to have because it could serve as both a shampoo and body wash.  The fragrance was a nice mood-booster too.  Removed one lippie because it was drying on skin.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about Philosophy bath &amp; shower gel and decided to try out this product since both my boyfriend and I love hot coca and I was looking to buy some presents for several friends birthday coming up . I ordered 4 bottles since they was on sale. So what happened? First, I see my credit card get charge. Few days later I did not receive my order shipping confirmation so I logged on to my account again and see that my order got delay. Ok, I don&#x27;t mind about that since I don&#x27;t need one right now. Today I received an email said that my order was canceled and I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY EXPLANATION OR APOLOGY WHICH IS VERY RUDE, plus the item was longer on sale. It was a waste of my time and energy .    Update: So the morning after the day I wrote this review. I woke up seeing 20+ emails from Philosophy explain the reason for them to cancel my order. I count it as Spam and abusing instead of an apology ( or are they having another \\&quot; technical problem \\&quot;???).</li>
    <li> Philosophy needs to take a lesson from their own motto they spew: find some grace!!    I placed an order for 4 of these bottles for gifts.    - I got charged.  - I then received an email from amazon, not even Philosophy that my order was canceled.  - Philosophy does not reply to my email.  - Instead, Philosophy SPAMMED my email.  I literally received 100+ canned emails from them.  - Philosophy blames amazon for the listing error.  (Although listing is done by the seller and not by amazon.)  - Philosophy then blames a third party for the spamming, and how it is out of their hands.  (So what?  Philosophy is selling our email to a third party??????)  - Philosophy then flat out LIED and said they don&#x27;t even make 16oz holiday scents.    Wow.  That is all I can say.... WOW.  I expected a lot more from this company...a LOT more.  They messed up big time, and the worst part is, they lied throughout the entire process.    I have been a loyal customer of theirs for a long time, and have tons and TONS of stuff from them.  This has left such a sour note in my mouth, I will NEVER purchase a single item from them again.  I will tell EVERYONE to stay away from them.  For what they charge you, you would be thinking that they actually care a little about what you, the customer think or how they treat you.  This incident sheds light on what kind of company they truly are.    The economy is bad enough for me to be splurging on their products, and there are way too many choices out there for me to pick.  If Philosophy treats me like this, I will just take my business else where, and tell everyone else to do the same.  I&#x27;m disgusted.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering from philosophy and my last!  I had nothing but problems with this company.  I ordered this product which was supposed to be a 16oz well turns out it was an error.  So I canceled my order and now I am receiving nothing but spam from them!   Right now I have 75 of the same philosophy emails and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be receiving more soon.  Will not be purchasing from in the future.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It smells so good and lathers well. The scent is not strong out of the bath and it rinses well from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I prefer it as a body wash and not as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was charged $51 for my order.  I just got a cancellation notice and no refund.  Where is my money at?  Very dishonest company.  I will NEVER order a Philosophy product ever.  You shouldn&#x27;t charge people then cancel their order.  I had better get my money back or I will be taking action.</li>
    <li> Yummy! If I could give this 6 stars, I would! Talk about smelling like chocolate...this body wash is great! You smell good, have soft skin, and if you&#x27;re dieting, you get your chocolate fix without the calories! Reasonably priced for this type of product and the quality of it. Philosophy brand is easy to work with, and give free samples with your order.</li>
    <li> I love this bodywash, shampoo..it smells like a chocolate heaven when I take a nice hot shower.I thought I would never pay this much for a basic product like a body wash,but I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff now!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything other washes don&#x27;t do, but it does smell yummie. Fun to use, but the smell goes away soon after you dry off.</li>
    <li> I loved the Bath and Body Works Wickly Hot Chocolate.  They don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore so thought I would try this instead.  It didn&#x27;t compare.  The scent just didn&#x27;t cut it.  The soap is okay but I bought it looking for a good chocolate scent.  This didn&#x27;t provide it. I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> This is exactly like an inviting,extra-rich hot chocolate...mmmm! &lt;br /&gt;Cleanses hair and body very well, but I think you really need a rinse and repeat. An extra conditioner is definitely needed, and &lt;br /&gt;extra luxury is following it with the melted marshmallow body mousse. I received this in the holiday rescue kit and if you want &lt;br /&gt;the ultimate holiday treat, this is it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff, although I would not say it smells like hot choclate.  It smells more like choclate cake batter, which is not a bad thing.  It reminds me of my mom baking when I was a little girl.  The only problem I have with taking wonderful choclate cake batter showers is that it makes me hungry.  The shower gel is very conditioning.  I don&#x27;t use extra conditioner on my hair because it is not very dry, yet I do have to on my skin because it is really dry.</li>
    <li> Though the chocolate smell is very strong, this product is highly recommended for any chocolate lover. Because it has a very strong scent, it&#x27;s best used occassionally because then the bottle lasts longer. Philosophy double rich hot cocoa body wash is good for just bathing, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a shampoo and conditioner. It does leave the hair dry. It makes the perfect gift for someone who likes the scent of chocolate and uses scented bath gels in general.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, wonderful bubbles, smells famtastic and leaves skin smooth and feeling very clean.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Another favorite!  To me, this smells like fresh, hot brownies fresh from the oven.  I much prefer this to Bath &amp; Body Works Wickedly Hot Chocolate.  Their brand has something else in it that gives it a different fragrance...not quite hot chocolate.  This is true hot chocolate fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, it lathers well, but the smell is not quite what I expected.  It reminds me of that chocolate chapstick I had as a kid....didn&#x27;t smell quite like chocolate, but close.</li>
