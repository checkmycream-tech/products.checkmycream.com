<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Applies smothley and absorbs quickly into skin without a gressy or sticky feeling. I&#x27;ve only been using about a month so still to early to see results, will follow up after the use of my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Wow great product thanks 😀😀😀</li>
    <li> makes your face feel nice a little tight. Nice.. I like it. A little goes a long ways</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night for a week.  I didn&#x27;t think anything was really happening, but I can see that my skin is tighter and less dry.  I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth ,I used together with vit.c serum</li>
    <li> Having been using this product on one arm for two months and have noticed no difference whatsoever from the untreated arm. I feel I have wasted my time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! I dont have many wrinkles but I did have a few on the side of my eyes, and they have definitely started to fade away. I also love this product because my face doesn&#x27;t feel as rough.</li>
    <li> This product is good. It makes your skin feel firm and more plump . This and the eye serum are good results similar to oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product! It gives my skin a nice glow. My skin feels firmer and brighter. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely see a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not necessarily sure if I see any difference in my complexion after using this for a few months. It could possibly work for others, but I do have to warn you, it kind of smells weird. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the consistency still waiting to see if it works only used it 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Works well - my wife added this serum to her anti-aging arsenal and she likes the feel of it as she applies it to her face. She&#x27;s looking good, too. I think her freckles are fading.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to see a difference. Seems to be doing ok, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I really wish this had more directions like how often am I supposed to use it should I use it under my eyes can I use it on your make up do I use it with other creams need more info</li>
    <li> A truly wonderful skin smoother with absolutely no irritation.  It feels wonderful going on the skin and I have been using twice a week with fabulous results.  I am gradually adding all the Protege products to my regimen.  They are that good.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t necessarily see overnight results (after all, those wrinkles and lines took a while to get there in the first place), but if you apply this product faithfully, you should see real signs of improvements within a few weeks. I know I did. I have very few lines around my eyes, but I was getting fairly deep grooves around my lips and the sides of my mouth. Over time, these deep grooves have morphed into fine lines, which I consider a great improvement. I have tried any number of other products with minimal or no results so I am quite pleased with Collage. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars because I received the product in a timely manner and from the first day I used the collage my skin felt better. I have not seen a huge difference but I have seen improvement in just the few days I have applied it. My skin absorbs it well. So far my skin feels &amp; looks better. My skin Is not as dry &amp; the product has not clogged my pores or caused any oiliness. I can&#x27;t say if I would definitely recommend since I have only been using it for just under a week because you should use a product for at least a month before knowing the total benefit. I will buy this product again if I continue to have the good results I have seen thus far. The seller also contacted me to assure they will back their product and left me their contact information should I have any questions, so the customer service is  good as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only 3 times since receiving it. I would prefer to write a review after I have been using it awhile. The few times I have used it I like the way my skin feels after applying it and leaving it on over night. I noticed skin appeared to be smoother with a bit of a glow. The wrinkles appeared a bit less severe.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived while I was ill with a severe sinus and ear infection.I will try to leave an update review after I have used it awhile.</li>
    <li> Looooved it! No more spending money on expensive brand&#x27;s creams. My skin looking and feeling more nourished and lifted!</li>
    <li> I really think its working!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I am on my second bottle, and I use it morning and night.  It is not greasy at all which I like.  I seems to tight up the skin and lift it.  I have tried tons of products; nothing works miracles.  This doesn&#x27;t either, but I can tell that it does improve the quality of my skin as well as the plumpness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for sometime. I like the way it feels and unlike a lot of these products, this is retinol-free. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for wrinkles but these days what is?  Have been using it for about 2 months now. Still not sure if the cost justifies the quantity. It makes for a solid moisturizer but I suppose I need more time.</li>
    <li> Good,  since I use it I find my skin become soft and bright</li>
    <li> I use a serum for 2 weeks. I really satisfied with the results. My skin looks more visibly fresher and firmer, instantly smooth out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles . skin texture is smooth and even skin tone</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it says I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;HN</li>
    <li> I found this to be okay, but being used to the obagi line, I may have had my standards a little high.  I am a forty year old caucasian female with olive, oily, acne-prone skin.  For starters, i had no redness or tingle or reaction (yay).  This serum is  light and feels good on, and didn&#x27;t break me out or make my makeup melt.  I used it for about two weeks then broke down and spent the money on obagi vitamin C.  ** if you&#x27;re looking into obagi, DO NOT purchase off amazon (or eBay) ... it&#x27;s painful to spend that much, but get it from the dermatologist or the obagi company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approximately a week and i am very pleased with it.  First of all I loved the ingredient list and the fact that it was all in one serum and not several different steps/applications.  Texture of my face has improved, also have just a brighter softer overall appearance.  I am looking forward to great longer term results, but I wanted to leave a review regarding my experience thus far.</li>
    <li> I just got the product,and its working already.My skin is brighter, and smoother.I also love the fast delivery, I definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is not overpriced. Feels good on skin. Good for wrinkles and uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients in Collage!  It has a great mix of skin benefits in one bottle so that I do not have to add anything else but moisturizer.  I really find it skin soothing and comfortable.  I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> fantastic stuff I use it in my facials every day at work with the Derma Roller. At the hair shows its three times the price</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product based on the amazing results I received with their exfoliating serum which is simply the best.  Needless to say, the Protege brand has hit on a goldmine.  After the first use, my skin appeared to be firmer and more youthful.  The texture was soft to the touch and my makeup glided on like a second skin.  Definitely a product to try if you are interested in looking revitalized and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I have noticed huge improvements over the past week or two and have already got another bottle on the way! Loving it!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I have only been using it for a few days, however, I can already see a difference in my skin. The company follows up via email to see how you are enjoying the product and offers excellent tips for getting the most out of your purchase! I will definitely update my review after 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> I actually just started using this product about four days now and I must say,I love it.I already started seeing improvement in my skin and I love the way it makes my skin feel.I must say though that everything does not work the same for everyone,but I would recommend you at least try it.</li>
    <li> I am 54 and just through menopause and noticed yet another unpleasant thing about the aging process - my skin (arms, face, neck) was so dry that no matter how much other moisturizer I applied it did not really seem to help much.  Realizing Collagen was one of the things my body lost as I went through menopause, I researched products on line and this product was given high marks.  I must admit, it has really helped.  I apply Protege Collage 2x a day as directed and apply collagen moisturizer by St. Ives on top and I have seen marked improvement.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz said we lose collagen in our face &amp; neck as we age. I&#x27;m in my 40s &amp; wanted to change up my routine a little. The serum is a fast &amp; easy step to add. I apply to under eye, face &amp; neck. With sensitive skin I was nervous about trying anything new but I haven&#x27;t had any issues (no redness or irritation).  I also look for natural products: No Parabens, Sulfates or Phthalates, 95% Natural Ingredients!</li>
    <li> The smell is awful! I had to throw it out and it made me break out. Too bad that this product is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using CollageN for a little over a month and can tell a huge difference. I am 47 and like the glow and smooth skin immediately after applying. I also drink lots if water, smoothies, eat nutrititious foods, and do yoga. I believe in health from the inside, and appreciate the extra drop from the outside. This bottle lasts a long time. Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> i really like this serum -very interesting ingredients (different from other brands on the market) -will buy again</li>
    <li> the protégé service is amazing!!!sunday delivery,now lets see how the product delivers,but good job on delivery</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use every night before bed, and can definitely notice an overall improvement in my skins look, feel and overall appearance!</li>
    <li> This has both collagen &amp; hyaluronic acid high in ingredient list. I did not really expect to find both in one product. What a plus! The rest of the ingredients reveal a listing of natural high quality items on the label.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Time Master device purchase on Amazon. It makes a difference. More youthful glow &amp; lines fading. Very pleased &amp; will contine to purchase</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted with my nuface until I applied this serum.This serum with the Nuface trinity is the best. Instant lift, people are asking what have I done? For the price this is the BEST....</li>
    <li> Excellent product to compliment your skin care routine.  Great price, fast delivery and stellar customer service -- I will definitely purchase again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it and hope it will keep future wrinkles a little under control.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Great for discoloration and uneven skin tone. Restores skin!</li>
    <li> Wanted to give some time using the product...I will continue to use it, still waiting for a small miracle, as I am 60 years young.  I have a deep line between my brows and I actually think it is better now...main reason to continue.  I do like how it feels after putting it on, sort of gives a tightening feeling or uplifting feeling to my face.  To my surprise, my hubby actually complimented my skin...a drop dead moment for sure...not sure what he sees, but I&#x27;ll take it for what its worth.  One concern is that I read an article that stated collagen cannot be absorbed topically through the skin...would love some clarity on this, but will continue to use anticipating my own little miracle</li>
    <li> Great product. Dries very fast.. Skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Excellent 5 stars, I love this item so easy to use works great. I recommend fully</li>
    <li> This serum is unbelievable.  I didn&#x27;t tell my fiance I was using something different and she said after about a week and a half that she had never seen my skin look this amazing.  Skin tone feels evened, lines have decreased, and my skin also feels just overall healthier.  I have also been using Nerium day/night every other day and I exfoliate my skin which is the key to soft skin and zero blemish/ blackheads.  I think that the Collagen has been the icing on the cake</li>
    <li> Major difference in my skin, noticeable to everyone and they don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing differently.</li>
    <li> I have used this all over my face and neck and decollete area and I have noticed a difference already. There is a tighteneing effect which I love and a softening effect which I have noticed as well. My skin has changed in the past few months I have used this I didn&#x27;t want to post too early as I wanted to see the effect first be fore posting. Definately good for aging skin!</li>
    <li> Good product, smooth on skin, noticeable difference, good for men or women</li>
    <li> Love it so far...this serum is doing its job for me so far. I only use it at night right now, and I love it!</li>
    <li> I use as a mask. This is great for rebuilding collagen!</li>
    <li> My face broke out.  Not sure if it was from this.  Giving it a rest for a week, and them will retry.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and have always had to be very careful when it comes to what I put on my face. Most anti aging products are too oily or thick so I am not able to use them. This product makes my face feel very soft, it has helped with the oiliness, and does NOT break me out!!</li>
    <li> I received my order two days early and have only used it twice. I can already see the difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month. I&#x27;m looking forward to looking younger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet but I like to be proactive at preventing them as long as I can. This product helps in maintaining good skin. It gives me a more youthful radiant appearance which is not what I had before.</li>
    <li> I like this.  I have been using it for about 3 months this is my second bottle.  I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference or even a specific difference, but I just like it.  I use one of those needle rollers on my face and apply this immediately after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. I will give it an honest chance and give it at least a month before I give a final report</li>
    <li> I sleep in it over night, it&#x27;s kind of sticky at first, but my skin looks so radiant and smooth in the morning. I added it to my jojoba oil for my whole body, my skin has never felt better!!</li>
    <li> Excellent! i use this all the time. Works well.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t buy into miracle creams or anything like that. I bought this to see if I could perk up my skin during weight loss, stress and preparation for my wedding. Much to my amazement, it&#x27;s actually working! With relatively consistent use (I remember to use this plus the moisturizers almost daily?), after just 10 days I could see reduced depth to my frown lines. As a very unexpected surprise, my age spots are also faded. I&#x27;ve been using this serum about 3 weeks, probably 4 or 5 days a week, and the age spots are almost entirely gone. I think I am going to try a tiny dot on my hands every day...</li>
    <li> I noticed a change the first day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with product</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle, as instructed, noticed no change at all.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet I&#x27;m a  very youthful appearing 40 year old, mixed race female with olive skin, but years of chronic late stage Lyme disease has me exhausted which shows on my face &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; unless I use this serum along with the product they also sell for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;When I have energy to apply makeup both products really work hand in hand to give me a sexy awake glow back!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t apply my products everyday and there&#x27;s no need to. I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate looking in the mirror anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I NOT look chronically ILL,but both proucts wake up the cells in my face and around my eyes!  Every area the products are applied feel instantly tighter,filled with life, and then I&#x27;m back to confident again!&lt;br /&gt;I hate looking and being sick @age 40 BUT these products changed my self esteem on day 1!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Thank you &amp; don&#x27;t stop being awesome! Stay affordable too,please!</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvement</li>
    <li> I have used it for a month. I don&#x27;t see any improvement so far. Hope to see some good sign when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I noticed a softening of fine lines after a few days of using this. After about three weeks, the deeper lines on my forehead and between my eyes have improved enough so that I&#x27;ll be putting off getting more Botox for now. I&#x27;ve added this serum to my regimen of 100% hyaluronic acid (available from Amazon) and doctor-prescribed Retin-A. Adding this to my skincare routine has significantly helped soften my lines and made my overall complexion look smoother and younger. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know if stuff works that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.  I just can&#x27;t seem to put it on because folks, it&#x27;s smells like you&#x27;re putting on stuff from an out house!  I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m not that desperate to get rid of my wisdom lines.  I literally have to hold my breath until the stuff dries and I put something on over it.  It is sticky as well.  I have all these gross thoughts going through my head and I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing it because of them.  The company did follow up with a personal phone call to see how I liked it and sent me an e-book on face care.  So that was very nice.</li>
    <li> i love it i will be ordering again soon .my skin looks healthier and my makeup goes on better than ever. love love love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the collage serum in the morning and evening for 7 days so far and I am already noticing that the lines on my forehead and around my lips have diminished significantly and my skin dewy youthful look. I have used a a lot of products in my lifetime(55 years old) that promised amazing results that never seemed to happened for me, so I was very skeptical about the results I would get with this product. The only reason that I tried the collage serum was because Protege gave a 365 day money back guarantee so I figured that I had nothing to lose.  Before I tell you my experience with the collage serum, I want to let future customers know that the one thing that makes Protege stand out right away from other companies for me is that I received an email from them before the product arrived they provided me with the name of a Protege Representative and told me I could contact the representative if I have any questions about the &amp;#34;collage&amp;#34; serum or any of their other products.  I also received an email that provided instructions on how to properly prepare my skin for the &amp;#34;collage&amp;#34; serum and then how to correctly apply the &amp;#34;collage&amp;#34; serum so that I get the best results possible.  I have received two compliments on my skin and I have never had anyone compliment me on my skin.  My neighbor actually asked me what work did I have done on my face ,because she couldn&#x27;t believe how I barely had any wrinkles, how even my skin tone was and that my face had a very healthy glow, she really thought I had some acid skin peels done on my face and fillers for the wrinkles at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I never thought I would say this about a product, because I&#x27;m skeptical about everything, but I&#x27;m a true believer in the collage serum and the other products that I purchased from Protege.  I will continue to purchase their products because they deliver the results that they say this product will produce on your skin!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just started, understanding it takes time I have parenthesis lines, trying to avoid bot ox , I purchased this product find great reviews so I gave it a try , my face feels smoother  but the smells is horrible , I only applied around my lines , not all over my face because it stinks , feels a bit tight when dries  the smells is like egg yolks combine with medicine yeap stinks , no allergies or breakouts yet but I&#x27;ll keep posting my treatment :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with COLLAGE Anti- Aging Serum . I have only been using it a few days and already see amazing results ! People have told me my skin looks great and that I&#x27;m Glowing ! I will continue to use this wonderful product . I highly recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;Paula Ventura</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and will continue to use it. My skin tone has balanced a bit (mind you I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks), and it has a healthy glow. I would recommend this to anyone who feels they need a product that really works in transformation of your skin.</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 months now. No real noticable improvement. About the same as similar products with the same ingredients. Cost is somewhat reasonable and willing to give it some more time.</li>
    <li> J8st&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
    <li> I like this. I want to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is great!  I really like this Collage serum.  I like serums/oils with Vitamin C.  This is a little more creamy than the oils I have been using and a little teeny bit is all you need!  I always test products on a scar on my hand that is quite ugly.  If it soaks into the scar and makes it less noticeable - then that&#x27;s MY product!  So, this will be my new serum to try out &amp; get these laughlines under control. Thanks for the wonderful serum.</li>
    <li> It was not right for my skin. There was nothing at all about it that made my skin feel luxurious. Even after using it for a week my reaction was negative. It may be perfect for someone else, so try it.</li>
    <li> i did not noticed any difference in my skin...it does moisture, better than nothing...but i used Dr Oz Hidrolic Acid and noticed the difference in a week,&lt;br /&gt;Im going back to that one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it daily and see results already.</li>
    <li> this product started changing smell and color after a couple of months. It smell awful and I don&#x27;t think it safe to put it in my face. I threw it away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different things on my face before this Serum..I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup &amp; I have very oily skin.,A friend told me to try it, so I did... I found out that put a little water on all over the clean face first &amp; then put serum a few drops on yr fingers &amp; put all over yr face &amp; neck softly .. I love it, so easy to use I feel the all the good changes on my skin after a month. Thank u.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I can see a difference. I am 64 so I have quite a few wrinkles. They don&#x27;t seem as deep as they were before I began this collagen. I only use it at night, with a wet face (like they recommend) right out of the shower. I look forward to continuing with this serum and see more results. Their customer service is wonderful. I received an email from them after I ordered this and they told me they would be checking up with me in a few weeks to see if the product is working. Not many companies do that.</li>
    <li> I love the Collagn! I have been applying it to my face and it has really helped with the dry skin and small wrinkles around my eyes. I will definitely continue using it and will recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
    <li> Very good serum.  I would definitely recommend this product.  My face looks brighter and smoother from using.  I actually use this serum on a few scars that I have as well.  It works.  I have added this serum to my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for awhile now &amp; I definitely notice a difference in my skin- only drawback for me is that it has a faint odor of fish.  Not crazy about that- smell doesn&#x27;t linger but I may think twice about buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> 5 stars ! This product has astounded me.  It is so much like the far more expensive La Mer serum.  I can actually see a real difference in just 6 days&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Pratt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it two weeks now.. seen some difference in very fine lines but nothing over the top. save your money, get a professionally done photo facial and use a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this is the first time I used a collage product and I must say a lady can never start too soon.  I love the smooth silky texture !!!  I just started using this a few days ago and my face is  softer says my hubby !!! Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a month !</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 30 days, I waited before I decided to write a review. I can definitely tell the difference in my skin texture. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am not beautiful and &#x27;years younger&#x27; but my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on July 28, 2014 and unlike the majority of the reviewers, I have not seen any improvement in my skin as of yet.  Since I have only been using this product for 10 days it may be too early to see results.  I am looking for a decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  I also have sun damage across my cheeks and I am hoping to see improvement in that area too.  I will continue to use it as directed until the bottle is empty and hopefully I will see improvement by then and will consider repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My face retains a special glow when I use it. This was a great product purchase. You won&#x27;t regret. Thank-you.</li>
    <li> It is working great!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I found out during my first week of using the product that I have an illness that I cannot use this&lt;br /&gt;Product until I am off certain meds. Otherwise I was happy with what I saw in a short time.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  The wrinkles are already lessening and my skin has a glow it hasn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager!:))</li>
    <li> Very nice and soothing to the skin, in a short time my skin does appear plumper, in agood way. A little oily, but a little goes a long way, works well with other products.</li>
    <li> All around needed in your face regimen and this was top of the line, great product..Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I am on a constant quest to find effective skin products.  As we age, we produce less collagen, which can make our faces sag.  This product helped my skin look smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice serum so it&#x27;s easy to apply.  You only need a very small amount to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is faintly medicinal and herbal.  I much prefer this type of natural scent to the artificial scents found in many other skin creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this as part of your daily skin care regimen and you will have younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> This product is not as described.  It is sticky and uncomfortable on face.  I would return it, but I missed my return deadline.  In fact all the products I purchased in this line feel inferior and work poorly with my existing products.</li>
    <li> wonderful item,my skin get much soft and bright,</li>
    <li> Love it! it firms the skin.</li>
    <li> I think this has made a difference, but can&#x27;t say it has been &amp;#34;amazing.&amp;#34;  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again after my bottle is empty, will decide later.</li>
    <li> This is awesome in a bottle!!! I had some wrinkles by my eyes that are now slowly fading, but I also had deep wrinkles in my forehead which have lightened dramatically! I will buy this product over and over again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nothing happen yet just waiting for more days to see the results</li>
    <li> I love Collagen.  I can see a visible difference.  I had sunken areas in my cheeks and they have plumped up some.  The lines on my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;have plumped also.  I use Collagen a.m. and p.m.</li>
    <li> Do not pay large sums of money for expensive products. This product truly brings out the youth, my wife loves it</li>
    <li> This made my face break out worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin.  I&#x27;ve NEVER had acne prone skin either--maybe just a pimple or two when I was a teenager.  This stuff is horrible.  I used it twice and 5 days later I&#x27;m still trying to calm my skin down.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed is the smell. I was NOT a fan. I went ahead and tried it any way. My skin is less dry, and looks and feels smooth. I have not broken out at all. I have not used it long enough to notice if it makes my skin look younger, but it feels softer and less dry with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have been using a couple of different products recently to try and improve my skin.  I turn 50 this year, and am wanting to make sure that I take care of those nasty little lines that creep onto our face at this age.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for several days now and have already noticed a difference in my skin. I won&#x27;t tell you that all my lines have disappeared, but I can tell you that I see improvement.  My skin is softer and the lines are starting to be smoother.  I am anxious to see the long term effects of this!  This serum doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell to it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a strong perfume scent.  I like the fact that this is putting Collagen back into my skin, because as we get older, that is a big concern!</li>
    <li> I like this product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does leave my face very dry. But that is taken care of with a quick use of a moisturizer. Other than that, I have noticed that my face seems a little tighter and my boyfriend did say it has a glow now. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing product - I love it!</li>
    <li> This collagen serum makes my face feel great after I shower and apply before I put on my make up. Little bit goes a long way. After it dries on my face I do not need near as much make up as I was putting on my face, my make up goes on much smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks now, and my skin feels &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; ,smooth, and much less dry, I have brought a lot of skin care products in recent years this one seems to help.  Onething that makes Protege special for me is that I received an email from them that provided instructions on how to properly prepare my skin for the &amp;#34;collage&amp;#34; serum and then how to correctly apply the &amp;#34;collage&amp;#34; serum so that I get the best results possible, how many companies do that? Plus they sent another follow up email to see how I am liking their product, I do!</li>
</ol>
