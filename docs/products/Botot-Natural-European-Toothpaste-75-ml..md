      <li>someone mentioned in a review, just to have the fresh taste and ingredients enjoyed by King Louis XV.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It might take a second to get used to the taste (which is kinda like box of Good and Plentys) but this is my favorite toothpaste around</li>
      <li>There&#x27;d better be no scary ingredients in the mouthwash, because I ordered that too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I swear I must have used this as a child...as it looks so familiar.</li>

      <li>/&gt;This is genuinely one of my very favorite personal care products ...</li>
      <li>left a mild aftertaste that wasn&#x60;t bright and</li>
      <li>/&gt;[Edit 10/14/2014: I really do still enjoy using it, and it makes my teeth feel fantastically clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels very fresh and pure.  </li>

      <li>Fun side effect...</li>

      <li>This is the only natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that leaves my mouth feeling clean, and doesn&#x27;t effect the sensitivity of my teeth.</li>

<li> This product has been around for a long time and although I doubt this is the original formula, that wad not really important to me.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of natural toothpaste brands and usually they leave my mouth feeling like it&#x27;s coated in a film, or my teeth become unusually sensitive.</li>
<li> As I have stated in past reviews, I discovered this product while traveling in Italy many years ago and used to bring back 6 tubes twice a year until the new airport security restrictions made that difficult.</li>
<li> This is actually really quite a small tube.  </li>
<li> for the triclosan (and possible the extraordinarily long list of sodium this that and the other following it), I&#x27;d say it was my fave</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase because of the price and just stick to colgate cavity protection since that is also one of the few toothpastes that doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and cleans well.</li>
<li> Gave it a few rounds, but it&#x27;s just too gross.</li>
<li> My teeth are noticeably whiter after using this toothpaste for only a few weeks.  </li>
<li> You know that pink stuff the dentist uses to make a mold of your mouth?</li>
<li> It is about half the size of a typical toothpaste tube and subsequently lasts half as long.  </li>
<li> and I find a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I will continue to use because I am extremely gratified with my purchase.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it twice in a row, because I rotate between 3 other toothpastes (Listerine, A&amp;H baking soda, and Euthymol, depending on what I&#x27;ve eaten or how plaque-y my teeth feel).]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t ruin other flavors after using it (like OJ for example).</li>
<li> Plus, a little goes a very long way with this stuff, a tube lasts months.</li>
<li> A Y* too harsh on the lining of my mouth.</li>
<li> I would eventually have trouble finding it.  </li>
<li> is the second time I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the presence of triclosan in a product I like.</li>
<li> I think this stuff tastes worse.</li>
<li> Sadly, the box itself touts triclosan as the star antibac ingredient.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the anise taste&lt;br /&gt;Great way to start your day - you just feel energized to buzz up your day&lt;br /&gt;The packaging I received is an old one - however it still looks great&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again&lt;br /&gt;Am hooked to this toothpaste - better than Marvis, although Marvis looks cooler</li>
    <li> A nice toothpaste but contains triclosan and sls, ingredients that I rather avoid. The toothpaste does a great job cleaning and keeping teeth plaque free. I like the unique taste and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. All that being said I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase because of the price and just stick to colgate cavity protection since that is also one of the few toothpastes that doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and cleans well.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste of French Kings!  Best thing is my kid&#x27;s hate it and so it&#x27;s always there for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Botot for quite a while and I love the anise flavor and clean feeling I get from it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best,I just like it</li>
    <li> I really like the flavor of this toothpaste and the added ingredients do not really bother me too much.  I was formerly using a natural toothpaste without and SLS and my mouth never felt really clean.  My teeth are noticeably whiter after using this toothpaste for only a few weeks.  The downside is the cost to quantity ratio.  This is actually really quite a small tube.  It is about half the size of a typical toothpaste tube and subsequently lasts half as long.  I would still purchase this toothpaste though if for nothing but the provenance.  I like telling my friends how much I spend on toothpaste, it is pretty funny to see their faces.</li>
    <li> I truly believe that this tootpaste was originally created for royalty and the history behind it, however when looking at the ingredient list I do have to assume that the ingredients have changed over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look: Calcium carbonate, Sorbitol, Aqua, silica, flavor, sodium lauryl sulfate, cellulose gum, sodium monofluorophosphate, triclosan, sodium phosphate, sodium saccharin, sodium methylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium lauryl sulfate was not an ingredient back in those days, nor was the preservative methylparaben or cellulose gum etc. I have to question a lot of the ingredients for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with all of that being stated, this toothpaste does work and it is a nice change from the drug store variety. I just think the company who manufactures this product shouldn&#x27;t lead the consumer to believe it&#x27;s the original recipe. It is worth giving it a try though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of minty toothpaste. Botot has been a nice change since I love licorice. It really leaves a fresh feeling afterward without using mint. My husband tried it and likes it too.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothpaste! My teeth look and feel absolutely immaculate after use.  My mouth feels very fresh and pure.  I will continue to use because I am extremely gratified with my purchase.  You have to try atleast once.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> You know that pink stuff the dentist uses to make a mold of your mouth? I think this stuff tastes worse. Gave it a few rounds, but it&#x27;s just too gross.</li>
    <li> I love the anise flavor of Botot, although I admit it isn&#x27;t for everyone. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of natural toothpaste brands and usually they leave my mouth feeling like it&#x27;s coated in a film, or my teeth become unusually sensitive. This is the only natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that leaves my mouth feeling clean, and doesn&#x27;t effect the sensitivity of my teeth. Plus, a little goes a very long way with this stuff, a tube lasts months.</li>
    <li> I TRULY love this product. It&#x27;s unique and though a bit pricey, I feel it&#x27;s well worth the personal indulgence. Most commercial toothpastes are&lt;br /&gt;*W A Y* too harsh on the lining of my mouth. They sting, burn, and in my opinion have a very unappealing chemical flavor. Plus most have fluoride, and since I have thyroid issues, I try to avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the unique and delicious spicy flavors in this formula, and they do not burn my oral tissues. It leaves my mouth clean and fresh, but not in that horrible supercharged over the top minty flavored way so many other commercial brands do. It&#x27;s well concentrated and I find a little goes a long way. It foams well, which I know is important to many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is genuinely one of my very favorite personal care products ... Along with Dr Collin&#x27;s soft Perio brushes. For me, they&#x27;re a perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> Not only does it taste great, but since there is no Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it, there is no lingering aftertaste.</li>
    <li> best tasting toothpaste i have ever tasted. it makes me feel quite european. charlie</li>
    <li> As I have stated in past reviews, I discovered this product while traveling in Italy many years ago and used to bring back 6 tubes twice a year until the new airport security restrictions made that difficult. Botot does a superior job of cleaning teeth without all the unessessary ingredients most products in the States contain. I also strngly recommend the mouthwash of the same name.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, bought it after NY Post article comparing 6 different toothpastes. This leaves the mouth tasting fresh. It is from Italy and doesnt have that chemical aftertaste of Crest for instance. It does have a licorice flavor to it, so if your not fond of licorice i&#x27;d probably would avoid. This toothpaste is very potent meaning you dont need alot of it to work. It isnt a very large tube so for some it is probably a little pricey at over 10 bucks a tube. It does have antibacterial properties and was recommended for those concerned about their breath. I will rebuy this toothpaste again. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I swear I must have used this as a child...as it looks so familiar. Pink &amp; full of frothy flavour...you get the best of everything here: mint, licorice etc. I like it better than Marvis (though that Marvis pkging is cool)....Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has lovely and stimulating clove, anise and liquorish qualities. The flavour is unique and the tickled pink colour is fun. I feel that it cleans my teeth better than typical mass-produced toothpastes. Best of all, it has no plastic micro beads in it that many mass-produced toothpastes have now. Those beads can get stuck into your gums and cause all kinds of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate Marvis and Botot daily to keep things interesting. My visits to the dentist have been non-events. The hygienist remarks how beautiful and healthy my teeth are—despite all the abuse they take from frequent food and wine tastings for work. So the formula works well for me—keeping my teeth healthy, clean and bright.</li>
    <li> The description and reviews were convincing. I took the plunge and bought this ancient recipe toothpaste. Clove and anise are some of the best things you can put in toothpaste. I was even willing to put up with the sodium laureth sulfate someone mentioned in a review, just to have the fresh taste and ingredients enjoyed by King Louis XV.&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning and the flavor made me happy, it is delicious, and my mouth felt so clean. And then, oh dear me, I decided to take a look at the ingredients list (not found on the Amazon listing) and to my utter dismay I saw TRICLOSAN. I just KNOW the French king did not put that gunk in his mouth. Then I noticed the box said, en francais, that the recipe was \\&quot;inspired\\&quot; by that made up by Dr Botot for the king. Inspiree, not the real recipe!&lt;br /&gt;But for the triclosan (and possible the extraordinarily long list of sodium this that and the other following it), I&#x27;d say it was my fave toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I love the taste, I will finish it, but I will rinse the heck out of my mouth, and then never buy it again. There&#x27;d better be no scary ingredients in the mouthwash, because I ordered that too.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the presence of triclosan in a product I like. (That being the baking soda deodorant, that makes me smell wonderful and makes me sweat less than antiperspirants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO NOT need triclosan if you have clove oil. Clove oil is already antibacterial. Sadly, the box itself touts triclosan as the star antibac ingredient. Please, please stop making this gorgeous product with triclosan. I thought that stuff was banned in Europe, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit 10/14/2014: I really do still enjoy using it, and it makes my teeth feel fantastically clean. I just rinse a couple extra times. I don&#x27;t use it twice in a row, because I rotate between 3 other toothpastes (Listerine, A&amp;H baking soda, and Euthymol, depending on what I&#x27;ve eaten or how plaque-y my teeth feel).]&lt;br /&gt;I may actually buy another when this eventually runs out, I like it that much.ally runs out, I like it that much.</li>
    <li> Love the Taste, love how scrubbed my teeth feel, hate the price, but it lasts a long time, so for the cost of a cheap lunch I treat myself to a great tube of fancy toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this is protecting me from cavities. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m being re-mineralized. I only know this is the best toothpaste on the planet if you want your mouth to feel ridiculously super clean. I don&#x27;t like paying almost $11 for toothpaste, but I will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> Botot products are always great.</li>
    <li> We have been using Botot for years.  It was suggested to us by a pharmacist in Las Vegas as we had for gotten our toothpaste for the trip.&lt;br /&gt;Botot is a 5 star</li>
    <li> I have used the same 2 well-known brands for all of my life.  I wanted to try something differ ent, yet not something so exotic or trendy that if I did like it I would eventually have trouble finding it.  This product has been around for a long time and although I doubt this is the original formula, that wad not really important to me.  I like the strong anise flavor, the antibacterial properties, and the &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling after brushing.  Yes you can get a similar feeling with 1.00 toothpaste but not all 3.&lt;br /&gt;Between Marvis and Botot , I prefer the Botot.  I prefer the flavor and the longer lasting &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling imparted by the anise.</li>
    <li> Love the flavor and my teeth look and feel clean afterwards. Highly recommended if you like anise-flavored pastes.</li>
    <li> Delicious anise flavor, nice and fresh aftertaste.  If you have wisdom teeth issues or similar, it contains triclosan.  This keeps infections at bay, though there are concerns that this ingredient is quite toxic and a hormone interruptor.  You may have come across it in Lever 2000 soap, which dermatologists used to suggest for acne.  It also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which gives lots of folks chin acne.  One of the few alternative pastes for gum infection people, with no SLSulfate, is Jason Healthy Mouth.  The flavor of which is boring.  I switch back and forth with these two.</li>
    <li> left a mild aftertaste that wasn&#x60;t bright and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;kind of fell into line slightly above the toothpastes&lt;br /&gt;that i&#x60;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> It might take a second to get used to the taste (which is kinda like box of Good and Plentys) but this is my favorite toothpaste around and i buy it regularly. Fun side effect... it doesn&#x27;t ruin other flavors after using it (like OJ for example).</li>
