    <li> Have used this product for many years and was very happy to find it at such a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s the ZP11 in the cream that does the  trick.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this did anything to stop my dandruff.  I purchases upon suggestion from my beautician but I don&#x27;t see mch difference in my scalp.  It was really expensive also because they no longer make it.  Not sure I would suggest it.  BUt it does have a nice smell and can be used as a nice hair lotion</li>
    <li> Was happy to finally find this product again  -- not satisfied with the price  -- but I blame Revlon for discontinuing it -- not the sellor.</li>

    <li> I suffered a bad reaction to this product and lost all of my scalp skin after extreme fluid secretion that lasted one entire night. My skin is recovering&lt;br /&gt;slowly with significant itching and flaking that I hope will be over in maybe another week or two.

    <li> I love Top Brass and the, it last long and I never have any worries. I use it because sometimes my scalp after two days can get a bit itchy. With top brass I never have that worry.</li>
