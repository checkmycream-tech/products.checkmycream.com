      <li>This could be fixed by coiling when packed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the tubing deteriorates so fast.</li>
      <li>Might have other useful applications...</li>
      <li>The device is a little bigger than I was expecting, but it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>If you plan to run it inside, you need to know that ozonating smells pretty odd, and you&#x27;ll need to have windows open and not be near the room when you run it.</li>

<li> (I wear my shoes too long throughout the day), revitalizes kefir grains, oxygenates your oils (use it with flaxseed and other oils you don&#x27;t cook with for maximum effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> My only complaint is that the hosing had sticky-tape on parts of it and the hose was bent in places, which made it difficult for the air to get through.</li>
<li> Flavor is hard to ignore.</li>
<li> , i turned it on in the kitchen to ozonate a glass of water and became instantly overcome with a burnt oil smell that made me sick</li>
<li> However it would not b good for making ozone oils.. tired it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ozonates water well but has a couple of shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30 minute limit on the timer makes it unsuitable for ozonating oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tubing is kinked from folding to fit in box resulting in restricted ozone flow.  This could be fixed by coiling when packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tubing discolors very rapidly - make you wonder what chemicals from the plastic you may be ingesting.</li>
    <li> This unit delivers as advertised. We just had an alert from the state that our town water failed a recent test. So they chloronated the heck out of it. Our filters did not get the odor from the water, but the ozonator removed all traces of any smell and any microorganisms. Out coffee tastes like coffee again. I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is great!!! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Warning:  Don&#x27;t go producing ozone in the house just to purify the air.  EXTREMELY HARMFUL.  When using this open a window for air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now now the good stuff:  This purifies water like none-other.  Kills lingering bacteria in your toothbrushes, detoxifies the leftover chemicals on your store-bought fruit, cured my external toe fungus (I wear my shoes too long throughout the day), revitalizes kefir grains, oxygenates your oils (use it with flaxseed and other oils you don&#x27;t cook with for maximum effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing is your water.  Charcoal doesn&#x27;t get rid of the chlorine or floride residing in your tap water.  This does.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> We use a ozone generator for our aquarium.  After a few months (4-5), this unit stopped working.  I suppose it did as designed, but just not what we needed (daily).    Might have other useful applications...</li>
    <li> I called the company because the hose that was sent was bent and not allowing air to flow. The sent a new hose which I am grateful to have. I am, however, concerned with the yellowing and brittleness of the hose after using it a few days. Does it oxidize my arteries too??? When I called to ask they didn&#x27;t have an answer for me on this concern.</li>
    <li> Ever since the show the Colony I&#x27;ve wanted one of these. It&#x27;s the perfect tool to have for purifying water. I&#x27;d still run it through a particulate filter, but after that this should kill all the remaining bacteria. (Don&#x27;t legally hold me to that, I&#x27;m not guaranteeing anything!) If it&#x27;s done right though you should have clean water though.</li>
    <li> It works great. That Dr. That recommended it did not say how much to use it or what  it is good for.</li>
    <li> This was a gift reorder the first one worked so well I ordered two for my sons and their families</li>
    <li> Awesome! Drinking more and water tastes better.</li>
    <li> Love to use it for natural disinfectant cleaning around the house</li>
    <li> The Ozonator was delivered on time and in good packaging. My only complaint is that the hosing had sticky-tape on parts of it and the hose was bent in places, which made it difficult for the air to get through.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! I feel happy I bought it!!!</li>
    <li> This unit is great but needs an oxygen input &amp; it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I wanted an ozonator to keep emergency water potable, so I&#x27;m planning to run it every two months or so for that use. The device is a little bigger than I was expecting, but it seems to work fine. The directions are clear, and the recommended uses are practical and interesting: remove bacteria from your kitchen sponges, for example. If you plan to run it inside, you need to know that ozonating smells pretty odd, and you&#x27;ll need to have windows open and not be near the room when you run it. It is fairly quiet, though.</li>
    <li> In the middle of ozonating olive oil and it broke!</li>
    <li> I have had a great experience with all people involved with selling and supplying this product. It is working very well.</li>
    <li> The ozonator does what it says it will do--makes the water taste great. Of course, part of accepting that it is purifying the water is a matter of &amp;#34;faith&amp;#34;. I think that I understand the science, but cannot totally. Nevertheless, since I have well water, it makes me FEEL like I am doing something to get rid of any residual bacteria. I wish I knew how it affected other things such as minerals, heavy metals, etc. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the tubing deteriorates so fast. In fact it starts turning brown pretty quickly. This is somewhat worrisome. Is the plastic degrading into my water? Fortunately Dr. Katz&#x27;s office directed me to a Pet Supply store to buy inexpensive replacement tubing (same as that used for fish tanks).</li>
    <li> Ive used it about 20 times this last week.. I use it for adding to my laundry instead of nasty toxic detergents. Clean my toothbrushes.  Sip an oz or 2 for my health. Wash my whole body in the morning between shower days. Put it in my humidifier.  Use it in my nebulizer. . Makes the house smell wonderful.. shuts off automatically in 5-30 mins.  However it would not b good for making ozone oils.. tired it and it&#x27;s not strong enough and would take 24 hours.. great little starter unit to use. If you want to make ozone oil  tho get something larger</li>
    <li> This little unit does what it they say it does. It oxygenates water and oil in 30 minute increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the seller: The first unit was DOA. I immediately contacted the seller and was given instructions on how to replace it. The replacement came from another company, so it was rather confusing, but the replacement works beautifully.</li>
    <li> After a few days the m/c ddid not work . I have sent the m/c back to Dr. Katz and asked for a replcement</li>
    <li> Let me say first I had an ozone business years ago and am familar with ozone ,this generator literaly stinks there is an oil smell not an ozone smell that comes out of it, i turned it on in the kitchen to ozonate a glass of water and became instantly overcome with a burnt oil smell that made me sick I cant turn it on indoors at all and will not use it again</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FROM DR KATZ WEBSITE 2-3 YEARS AGO .IT IS A HIGH QULAITY MACHINE RUNS LIKE A CHARM BUT I WISH THEY HAD REPLACEMENT HOSS AND STONES READILY AVAILABLE. OZONATED OLIVE OIL IS GREAT BUT IT DOES TAKE &amp;#62; 24 HRS CUMULATIVE ACCORDING TO CO MPANY SOMETIMES I BUY READY  MADE HAS HELPED FAMILY WITH SEVERE ITCHING AND EZCEMA . ALSO THE OZONATED WATER  FOR RINSING  AND STERILZATION.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and use but water taste strange. Flavor is hard to ignore. Machine is noisy</li>
