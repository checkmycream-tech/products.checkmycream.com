      <li>I have very fine hair, so it wasn&#x27;t very surprising that they fall out when I use them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a good idea but not well designed.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve set my hair many times.  </li>
      <li>:P Overall, great for what I needed it for, a comfortable roller set to sleep with on.</li>
      <li>I was able to roll my hair and these were quite comfortable to sleep in, however, it took forever to roll my hair since the roller kept falling apart.  </li>
      <li>Bouncy frizz free curl with no hair breakage is what I love about this product.</li>
      <li>Hair slides off easily</li>
      <li>The clamp need to stronger, because they break easily..</li>
      <li>I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t snag and break as easily on these ones</li>
      <li>I have beautiful silver and white hair...</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine hair</li>
      <li>enjoy</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;satin\\&quot; looks kinda cheap</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, curls and straightens super easily and just trying to wrap these around my hair and put the cip</li>
      <li>My hair does curl really easily but these curlers (after sleeping in them) worked even better than my hot rollers.</li>
      <li>They work great as expected.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about these is that all the pieces were there and the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with these rollers as they create smooth and soft curls while keeping the moisture in my hair.</li>
      <li>purchased this item and got it quickly.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m probably better off using the old foam ones.</li>
      <li>There were mixed reviews when I ordered this product, however I took my chances and purchased them to make my own decision.  </li>
      <li>At first, they are both great, less breakage for my hair, and my hair feels smoother.  </li>
      <li>they were ok but just not my style of curlers like other types of curlers better</li>
      <li>The satin is to slippery, cause the roller to slide right off.</li>
      <li>Price was right.</li>
      <li>Costs almost more to send it back, or I would</li>
      <li>Smaller one&#x27;s are more sturdy.</li>
      <li>Many times, when I finally did manage to get the curler set.  </li>
      <li>They were exactly what I thought they were.  </li>
      <li>After a few years, my beloved bamboo curlers were losing some foam</li>
      <li>but but woke up with strange dented curls and most of the rollers had fallen out.  </li>
      <li>Using the small rolers gives gorgeous curls.</li>
      <li>The large rollers snap off from both ends as I&#x27;m putting them on.</li>
      <li>And she was really excited about them at first, because they were satin, and they were a lot in different sizes.</li>
      <li>These work really well if you can get the rollers to stay.  </li>
      <li>and they were very accomadating.  </li>
      <li>These rollers worked really well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for these and threw them out after 1 use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After quite a bit of finessing and figuring I did find a way to make these work, but it really shouldn&#x27;t take me almost an hour to get my hair in rollers.</li>
      <li>However, with my hair type these did not stay in very well.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on these if you are looking for an effective hair roller.</li>
      <li>The headwrap included was a nice surprise, but again, the material was not satin-like nor soft, but scratchy and rough.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have included more of the larger rollers instead of so many small ones.</li>
      <li>my hair is pretty soft by itself</li>
      <li>So it gets the job done in the end, but, a better rpoduct will take less the time.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to sleep with, just be careful if you dont want too much curl</li>
      <li>Not the goodys rollers from back in the day, but pretty close.</li>
      <li>Need more small rollers.</li>
      <li>I did contact Goody directly about this</li>
      <li>they are just those old fashioned foam rollers with plastic clips.</li>
      <li>I used these as a young girl</li>
      <li>The clip end of the roller is really hard to engage while at the same time the bottom pops out very easily.</li>
      <li>I like the way these rollers work except there are many very small</li>
      <li>I have coarse curly dense hair that very fragile and these rollers are very gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>Had trouble wrapping hair around at first</li>
      <li>and/or were paid or perhaps have super thick hair.</li>
      <li>Normally sponge rollers dry out the ends of my hair causing my hair to be dry and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It make it extremely hard to snap the roller closed securely.</li>

<li> These are so so poorly made that I honestly feel like the previous reviewers are fake</li>
<li> but my hair has tight curls probably due to the length</li>
<li> This has happened in less than one month.  </li>
<li> Half came out in the night because I toss a lot in my sleep.</li>
<li> I experience quite a bit of damage on the ends of my hair due to the current rollers I use and expected these to minimize the damage, but unfortunately these rollers are unusable.</li>
<li> i tried sleeping in a few that I mangaed after 45 mintutes to get to stay in my hair</li>
<li> so you have to hold real tight when applying them.</li>
<li> Have had them for at least 6 months with no problems...</li>
<li> and they are a little difficult to snap on</li>
<li> They are not a good value for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the way these rollers work except there are many very small and I would need to buy 1-2 more packages to get enopugh of the size I prefer.  They should come packages/sold according to one size, two sizes max.</li>
    <li> I have beautiful silver and white hair...(premature thank you...lol)  I do not like using curling irons on my hair to avoid yellowing...I simply flat iron on low heat, add argan oil to the ends of my hair as I roll with these  satin covered rollers...great curl...lots of body...no yellowing...love the results...</li>
    <li> These rollers are wonderful, I bought them to maintain my curly updos.  Normally sponge rollers dry out the ends of my hair causing my hair to be dry and frizzy.  I&#x27;m so pleased with these rollers as they create smooth and soft curls while keeping the moisture in my hair.</li>
    <li> It is comfortable to sleep with, just be careful if you dont want too much curl, I wake up with a head curl of wig looking curls. XD It&#x27;s not supposed to be used with wet hair but I use it like that anyway. It brings lots of curl rollers of all sizes to work with and I have a lot of hair to need rollers for and I have a bunch left over. Simple to use and dont be intimidated by the need to snap it to open, it will not break. :P Overall, great for what I needed it for, a comfortable roller set to sleep with on.</li>
    <li> These satin covered rollers are fantastic!  I have extremely fine hair so a lot of rollers don&#x27;t work well since they&#x27;re too rough on my hair.  I get great curls with these without having to worry as much about damage.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I thought they were the pillow rollers I had at home, but they were only sponge rollers with satin around them.  I had to send them back, but other may prefer them.</li>
    <li> Bouncy frizz free curl with no hair breakage is what I love about this product. I have coarse curly dense hair that very fragile and these rollers are very gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> The plastic on these are supposed to be flexible to keep from hurting your head but... It make it extremely hard to snap the roller closed securely. Half came out in the night because I toss a lot in my sleep. The \\&quot;Satin\\&quot; came off several rollers as it is just a sleeve which slides over a foam roller. It is not really satin but some silky knit. I didn&#x27;t pay much for these and threw them out after 1 use. The head scarf they provide is a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these if you are looking for an effective hair roller.</li>
    <li> I was able to roll my hair and these were quite comfortable to sleep in, however, it took forever to roll my hair since the roller kept falling apart.  As soon as I will get to rolling my hair the plastic piece will just fall out, repeatly.  Also, after just one use the satin is already showing wear, especally on the sides so these will not last very long.  So it gets the job done in the end, but, a better rpoduct will take less the time.</li>
    <li> After a few years, my beloved bamboo curlers were losing some foam so I thought I&#x27;d try these.  These are literally foam, wrapped with a thin crappy piece of weird paper like cloth, covering the supremely flimsy clip underneath.  I have fine hair, curls and straightens super easily and just trying to wrap these around my hair and put the cip in was a nightmare.  The curlers started falling apart.  i tried sleeping in a few that I mangaed after 45 mintutes to get to stay in my hair but but woke up with strange dented curls and most of the rollers had fallen out.  These are so so poorly made that I honestly feel like the previous reviewers are fake and/or were paid or perhaps have super thick hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers worked really well. I got very nice curls after using them and they were comfortable to sleep on.</li>
    <li> I read elysianlight&#x27;s review prior to purchasing this product and despite the warning, I bought it anyway. Now that I have received and tried out this product, I find that this review is spot on. The rollers are of two sizes (large and small) they are wrapped in a type of fabric which does not feel satin-like but rough. The clip end of the roller is really hard to engage while at the same time the bottom pops out very easily. I found it really frustrating to try to roll my hair. The headwrap included was a nice surprise, but again, the material was not satin-like nor soft, but scratchy and rough. I experience quite a bit of damage on the ends of my hair due to the current rollers I use and expected these to minimize the damage, but unfortunately these rollers are unusable. As I cannot use them I will be getting rid of them. Purchase at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I have locks and like curls every now and then. I&#x27;ve tried flexi-rods and they are painful to sleep in. Not these...they are covered with satin fabric and I get great curls when i use them. I simply dampen my locks, roll them up and I&#x27;ve got bouncy springy curls for days. Have had them for at least 6 months with no problems...</li>
    <li> Not the goodys rollers from back in the day, but pretty close. The snaps do not always stay closed. Love the satin covers. Nice scarf included. Price was right.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter who wanted to make her hair curlier than it already is. The only good thing I can say about these is that all the pieces were there and the price. The product itself is very cheap. The rollers kept falling apart. The hook that closes from bottom to top kept falling off, then I had to re-curl that section of hair. The actual cushion part of the roller also kept coming off. By the time I got my daughters hair done, she was done! I used these as a young girl and my mom never had these kinds of problems. Save your money!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I did contact Goody directly about this and they were very accomadating.  This doesn&#x27;t change the star rating that I&#x27;ve given the product but it&#x27;s nice to know that they were concerned about this issue I was having with the satin unraveling.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these and a 6 pack of the Diane brand at the same time.  At first, they are both great, less breakage for my hair, and my hair feels smoother.  However, the Goody brand started to unravel, exposing my hair to the dry rough foam, while the Diane curlers have not begun to unravel. This has happened in less than one month.  I will not be ordering any more of the Goody brand, and I&#x27;m ordering more of the Diane brand to replace the Goody ones.</li>
    <li> I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t snag and break as easily on these ones but my hair also doesn&#x27;t stay in place either....even if I&#x27;m just sitting watching TV...my hair is pretty soft by itself so I&#x27;m probably better off using the old foam ones.</li>
    <li> The satin is to slippery, cause the roller to slide right off. They need a different texture of satin. Need more small rollers. The clamp need to stronger, because they break easily..</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother as a gift. And she was really excited about them at first, because they were satin, and they were a lot in different sizes. But she said that as soon as she started using them the ends of them comes off. She said the satin stays on but the clip part always have to be put on.  She still uses them, but I will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> The large rollers snap off from both ends as I&#x27;m putting them on. Smaller one&#x27;s are more sturdy. The satin on the rollers is really cheap and begin shedding off the sides from day one and is kind of slippery as you try to put them on. Hair slides off easily so you have to hold real tight when applying them. The satin isn&#x27;t going to last. They should have added seams to the satin. Using the small rolers gives gorgeous curls. And NO, it&#x27;s not like sleeping with pillows all over your head. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, sleeping with rollers is very uncomfortable feeling.</li>
    <li> I used to use the pink version of these when I was a kid. I bought these curlers thinking they were the pillow curlers so I was disappointed when they arrived. My fault for not reading the title closely. The \\&quot;satin\\&quot; looks kinda cheap and they are a little difficult to snap on but when I used them they worked great. My hair does curl really easily but these curlers (after sleeping in them) worked even better than my hot rollers.</li>
    <li> purchased this item and got it quickly.  Love the satin head wrap that was included in the pack.  Also love that there are a variety of sizes for all hair lenghts and styles.  enjoy</li>
    <li> They  allow me to sleep without having a headache but my hair has tight curls probably due to the length</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I thought they were.  I wish they would have included more of the larger rollers instead of so many small ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve set my hair many times.  I prefer to use curlers than heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled to get these in my hair.  The hair kept slipping off.  Many times, when I finally did manage to get the curler set.  It still slipped out of the hair, with the clamp closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away after two attempts.</li>
    <li> i did not like these they were ok but just not my style of curlers like other types of curlers better</li>
    <li> These work really well if you can get the rollers to stay.  However, with my hair type these did not stay in very well.  I have very fine hair, so it wasn&#x27;t very surprising that they fall out when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a bit of finessing and figuring I did find a way to make these work, but it really shouldn&#x27;t take me almost an hour to get my hair in rollers.</li>
    <li> There were mixed reviews when I ordered this product, however I took my chances and purchased them to make my own decision.  I agree with the review that there were not enough of the larger size.  The satin covers did not stay on the roller.  They are not a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> they are just those old fashioned foam rollers with plastic clips. They stick in my very fine hair and I have no use for them. Costs almost more to send it back, or I would</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  They work great as expected.</li>
    <li> The satin started shredding after just 3 uses. Disappointed because I like Goody products but this one was not impressive. It is a good idea but not well designed.</li>
    <li> Had trouble wrapping hair around at first but when I got the hang of&lt;br /&gt;it found that I love the curls, will be buying one more.</li>
