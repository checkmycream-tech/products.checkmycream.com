      <li>and I love the anti-bactieral factor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it still has the properties that make your hands feel good, the scent is too much like perfume for me to say I love the product.  </li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my hands feel soft as it both moisturizes and exfoliates with tiny microspheres.  </li>
      <li>Will be ordering more...leaves your hands very soft &amp; has a gentle fragrance.</li>
      <li>This smells very nice and leaves just a faint smell on your hands.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very conscious of any scent I might have on me that could affect another.  </li>
      <li>high marks for how it makes your hands feel, but next time I&#x27;ll choose something without a flowered scent.</li>
      <li>But I couldn&#x27;t find that particular fragrance on Amazon and due to sensitivity to chemical scents, I can&#x27;t walk into a Bath &amp; Body Works store.  </li>

    <li> Holy hell does this stuff work! Covered my acne scars and dark under eye circles. A little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> Perfect companion to lotion and hand gel. Very light and Fragrant</li>
    <li> Really like most bath and body works products. Can only get the anti-bacterial soap on line in all scents.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and this is part of a gift. Excellent for a Christmas gift like this one is. Thank you</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more...leaves your hands very soft &amp; has a gentle fragrance. We love it and it has become a family favorite.</li>
    <li> Great product of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Great soap and fragarance</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite scent. My old favorite was discontinued. This smells very nice and leaves just a faint smell on your hands. It&#x27;s a warm, pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> I had received the Vermont Sugar Maple soap as part of a gift basket earlier this year.  It has a warm, comforting smell that reminds me of eating comfort food.  Love the way it makes my hands feel soft as it both moisturizes and exfoliates with tiny microspheres.  But I couldn&#x27;t find that particular fragrance on Amazon and due to sensitivity to chemical scents, I can&#x27;t walk into a Bath &amp; Body Works store.  Who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of cherry, so I thought this Japanese Cherry Blossom would be refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it still has the properties that make your hands feel good, the scent is too much like perfume for me to say I love the product.  I have yet to have a problem from using this soap but there is a deep ingrained fear of these types of scents which has caused serious problems in the past and I&#x27;m very conscious of any scent I might have on me that could affect another.  Perhaps I will become more comfortable with it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also find that the dispenser gets clogged up with thickened product after you&#x27;ve been using it for a while.  It&#x27;s easy enough to grab and pull out, almost like rubber cement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So high marks for how it makes your hands feel, but next time I&#x27;ll choose something without a flowered scent.</li>
    <li> Not the smell that I expected for the price. Will not buy again .</li>

    <li> It is ok accidental purchase, meant to buy foaming. Thanks</li>
    <li> Not happy with the way it showed up in the plastic bag. The bottle itself  was leaking some of the soap out.of the container.  The bottle  was also covered with the soap.  On the bright side the soap  smells great. I won&#x27;t  be a return costomer.</li>
    <li> Best smell ever and I love the anti-bactieral factor.</li>
