      <li>This is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I had this problem for so many years</li>
      <li>The heels of my feet have not looked this healthy in ages.</li>
      <li>The pumice stone that is glued to a handle is much better to use because you can reach spots easier.</li>
      <li>It was okay.</li>
      <li>The stone does ok</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better pumice stone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the pumice stone after showering and then applying heel balm and my feet finally feel great again!</li>
      <li>It it just the right shape and size to get a good grip on.</li>

      <li>Perfect size and shape to use on heals made rough from walking around barefoot all the time.  </li>
      <li>Not too much dust came out from when I opened it out of the plsatic, and it works fairly well.</li>
      <li>It is however extremely sturdy and works great!  </li>
      <li>The good news is it has a very rough texture which has been effective at helping my feet get nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Easy to grasp, doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it works, its well priced when I got it, and it shipped easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and painless.</li>

      <li>It works great however, better than the old smooth white one I used to own.</li>
      <li>I recently bought this and am extremely happy.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this pumice stone to smooth out my heels for summer.  </li>
      <li>Some pumice stones are cheap and will break in two or crumble on you when you use them, this one does not, so I give it 5 stars.    </li>
      <li>But it DOES get your feet clean ..</li>
      <li>As pumice works it crumbles and this grit helps clean the sediment.</li>
      <li>But overall, a good quality pumice stone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely reccomend this as a good product.  </li>
      <li>Still cool though.</li>
      <li>Nice quality and natural stone, not man-made foam.</li>
      <li>It feels smooth right after you rub</li>
      <li>This Pumice Stone is really good at removing  callouse from your feet, i reccomend this to any one especially for those pretty summer sandals!</li>
      <li>If you want a mild ex-foliation, this is your product.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and was what it said it was - a pumice stone.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I bought a Diane pumice stone ([[ASIN:B003SZ4C1W</li>
      <li>and this is the first time I can see my feet clean.</li>
      <li>I received this item promptly and it was wrapped securely and then placed in a sealed container which I appreciated for cleanliness assurance.  </li>
      <li>old pumice stone \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; is far superior to this POS \\&quot;made in china\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>They were right.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s lasted for quite some time now, and the price was right.</li>
      <li>I think the whole natural thing was appealing, but it wasn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
      <li>and it seems like it&#x27;d do  a good job, but no matter how much I scrub, my feet are still pretty rough.</li>
      <li>I think if I use if on a regular basis it will work well as it is an easy grip to handle the stone while using, and does the job quickly.  </li>
      <li>Now I am ready for sandal season!</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a handle like in the picture, and it&#x27;s not as rough as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>He says can feel the difference after first use.</li>
      <li>I was able to remove layers of skin that even regular pedicures don&#x27;t take care of.</li>
      <li>The surface is pretty porous</li>
      <li>Actually bought it because I heard that pumice is a safe way to take rust stains out of a bathtub and sink.  </li>
      <li>I had to throw it away after first use.</li>
      <li>In fact, the color ran when I first used it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>it really works!</li>
      <li>(although it&#x27;s my first pumice stone, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to).  </li>
      <li>My feet are soft and smooth, even though I&#x27;m often barefoot.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what you&#x27;d expect from a pumice stone - helping to remove calluses.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Broke upon first taken out of package</li>
      <li>These stones really do the job and are priced right.  </li>
      <li>Good solid stone, it is not to big</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s this nice dark brown volcanic rock with holes</li>
      <li>One stone will last you a long time, no matter how scaley you might get - rinsing the stone and allowing it to air dry after every use is also a good way to extend its life :)</li>
      <li>For example, if you wear sandals a lot in the summer, this would certainly come in handy.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. It gives a nice finish. Sometime pumice stones can be too rough which is good to get off thick crust but you still need to smooth them out after or your heels will get worse.thats what this stone is good for.</li>
    <li> Actually bought it because I heard that pumice is a safe way to take rust stains out of a bathtub and sink.  They were right.  I spent over $30 buying products to bleach it that were corrosive and all and then I bought this.  Glad I did it removed the stains within one minute.</li>
    <li> This stone is an ideal product for me. The surface of the stone is not hard, so there is almost no possibility to hurt my skin. It only makes smooth dead and hard skin of my feet. Also, it is very cheap! I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive instrument for my foot care.</li>
    <li> The pumice stone I received was black, not the white one pictured in the product description.    While this pumice stone ex-foliates to some degree, it by no means achieves the degree or standard of ex-foliation I was looking for (and have achieved with other pumice stones in the past).    If you want a mild ex-foliation, this is your product.</li>
    <li> My 10-yr. old pumice stone \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; is far superior to this POS \\&quot;made in china\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t do the hard scraping that&#x27;s necessary to remove callouses and get heels soft.  But it DOES get your feet clean .. if that&#x27;s all you want, then go for it.  For example, if you wear sandals a lot in the summer, this would certainly come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone I received in the mail was BROWN, not white.  In fact, the color ran when I first used it in the shower.  (Why would a pumice stone be dyed brown?)&lt;br /&gt;My beauty tool of choice for feet and heels is still Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I see they&#x27;ve lowered the price.  I paid $4.21. The price is now $2.63.)</li>
    <li> This pumice stone works great.  I had previously bought one from a well known national chain and it fell apart as I removed it from the package....grrrr!      I even used it to remove ink and black mortar stains from my hands; it does the trick!</li>
    <li> The stone does ok but it broke in a half upon first use. The stone still works well but it is hard to get a good grip on it now.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly at removing/softening feet.  The one I got was black, not white.  That doesn&#x27;t really matter because the results cannot be beat.  My feet are back to being soft instead of calloused.  Easy to use and painless.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you&#x27;d expect from a pumice stone - helping to remove calluses. Nice size and shape makes it easy to grip and use. The one I got was a chocolate brown color.</li>
    <li> The one that costs $1.88 is the same exact product as this one. Just scroll down a little further and get that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for the price hike.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this.  It&#x27;s a dark colored natural pumice stone (3.5\\&quot; x 1.5\\&quot;).  It&#x27;s size is perfect for using on my feet.</li>
    <li> Good price and works really good to get calluses off- cannot go wrong- it really works!</li>
    <li> Broke upon first taken out of package</li>
    <li> The heels of my feet have not looked this healthy in ages. This stone has helped my feet become smooth and even all over, and the feel significantly better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pumice stone to smooth out my heels for summer.  The stone arrived and was packaged in a plastic box with shrink wrap around the pumice stone itself.  The pumice stone is brown in color unlike the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pumice stone is great for scrubbing your feet - I put just a bit of liquid body wash on it and then scrub away.  My heels are already in much better shape, they look and feel much better.  Now I am ready for sandal season!</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower everyday and have seen a significant improvement in my feet. Great product, great price...no complaints.</li>
    <li> I needed a \\&quot;real\\&quot; pumice stone to help my heels which were showing signs of walking around barefoot too much already this summer.  The stone was brown, instead of white as pictured, but I could care less about that.  It was smaller than I expected (my fault for not looking carefully) but I am finding I like this smaller size to fit into my hand when I use it.  It did not fall apart into gravel when used and there was very little dust when I unwrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have such rough, dry, cracked feet that I can use this for a few days in a row and my feet become almost girlish again.  I will replace this stone with exactly this one again, way down the road when I need to.  HIghly recommended.</li>
    <li> It was about what I expected out of a pumice stone! I have sensitive feet and am very ticklish, and for me personally, a callus shaver did a better job of smoothing my feet out. But overall, a good quality pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Nice porous stone.  Perfect size and shape to use on heals made rough from walking around barefoot all the time.  The color is not light as in the picture but a pretty chocolate color.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and am extremely happy.  It is not white- it is chocolate brown to begin with.  It is however extremely sturdy and works great!  I&#x27;d definitely reccomend this as a good product.  The color doesn&#x27;t bother me as I am the only one who sees and uses it.</li>
    <li> Was fully functional for first three days till it started growing green algae. I tried bleaching it, scrubbing it, and it still didn&#x27;t come off. Had to toss it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I am a female who does a lot of weightlifting. I got this pumice stone to save my hands from the roughness of barbells and this has helped 100%! It doesn&#x27;t scratch or hurt at all, perfect pumice stone!</li>
    <li> This Pumice Stone is really good at removing  callouse from your feet, i reccomend this to any one especially for those pretty summer sandals!</li>
    <li> Just a porous rock which makes a huge mess when in water. I had to throw it away after first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on these things but it seems to work well so I&#x27;m happy and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it, I use it, I like it, not much more to say, but the one I received does have a few craters.  My complaint is that about 4 days after I bought it here on Amazon, I was in Bed Bath And Beyond and saw one for $1.50, and I could not tell the difference just from holding it.  So just a note, shop around before buying this one.</li>
    <li> This stone works quite well. It it just the right shape and size to get a good grip on. It abrases well enough without hurting. I use it in the shower so it is always well lubricated, I do not know how well it performs dry.</li>
    <li> Great product and i got a free gift with my purchase. Excellent transaction. Shipping was faster than expected</li>
    <li> Very smooth surface does not work well to rub down rough patches on feet.</li>
    <li> This is a great stone! I had a gray pumice stone from The Body Shop for a long time (at least 2 years) that I loved &amp; I have no idea if they last forever, but I thought it wasn&#x27;t working as well, so I went to order another and they changed it, so I was too nervous to order it bc it didn&#x27;t look like a natural stone. This stone is brown, and has some run off in the water, but it works awesome! So glad I went with this one instead of the other. Works wonders! I use it every morning in the shower, at the end when my feet are softened from being in the shower for a while.  I&#x27;m a flip flop girl &amp; I have toe confidence year round :)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3M122WZ1K7TXV]]Until recently I did not know that pumice stone can effectively remove sediment and rust in the toilet bowl. Then I heard how someone used a pumice stone stick to clean their toilet&#x27;s ring I was somewhat skeptical, but figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very hard water. My toilets have a rust and sediment ring around the bowl. I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove the sediment/rust ring. I tried Clorox, CLR, Vinegar, Various Toilet bowl cleaner. Nothing worked. I was embarrassed whenever company came over. When I tried the pumice stone it took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nasty stuff. You just have to see it to believe it. Two split image photos attached: the toilet before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stick not only removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use. As pumice works it crumbles and this grit helps clean the sediment. After the job was finished I felt the bowl with my finger I did not feel any scratch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumice stones come as a stick without a handle or as a stone attached to a handle. The pumice stick without a handle gives you better leverage, and is cheaper. To avoid small particles coming off the pumice stone getting on my hands I just put on gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-m-a-z-i-n-g!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Got the dark brown stone.  Doesn&#x27;t work. It feels smooth right after you rub but it gets rougher the next day.  Gets tiring rubbing everyday.  Better stick with lotion. Pros: Great price! Makes a great paperweight.</li>
    <li> Some pumice stones are cheap and will break in two or crumble on you when you use them, this one does not, so I give it 5 stars.    I also liked the fact that mine seemed to have both a finer side (small \\&quot;holes\\&quot;) and a coarse side (big \\&quot;holes).    If I could say anything bad is that the stone I got was brown, not a light off-white color like the picture shows. But who cares about the color?</li>
    <li> I bought this to exfoliate my feet. This stone does a very good job! I was able to remove layers of skin that even regular pedicures don&#x27;t take care of. The surface is pretty porous and so there wasn&#x27;t a lot of scrubbing necessary to get results. My only complaint is that, as mentioned in other reviews, it leaves a brown powder when dry and will crumble if you hold too tightly. But, this shouldn&#x27;t affect how you use the product-there is no need to have a death grip on it and the powdery residue washes away with water.</li>
    <li> Best pumice stone on the market.  Much better than the pumice stones used at the nail salons I have been to.  Will continue to purchase as needed - great product!</li>
    <li> Works well...the color is a little strange (grayish brown instead of white)...but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the color! I have a steel scraper also, but this pumice stone is softer on the skin...but is strong material.</li>
    <li> I know everyone is different and so are their own feet, but I have been attached to a pumice for a long time. I moved and have not had time to go look for it, so finally after too much looking and reading and gauging I just did it. If you are stuck between too just do it. There was no left over gravel or sandy feeling. It worked FAST and I was astonished. I hope this doesn&#x27;t go out of make or stock whichever it is.</li>
    <li> Good solid stone, it is not to big and it fits in your hand well.  Looks very natural and has a good feel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several months ago. First of all, the actual product is a lot darker than this product image. The good news is it has a very rough texture which has been effective at helping my feet get nice and smooth. The bad news is that it was very brittle and crumbly and crumbled away little by little with almost every other use. It also broke in half unexpectedly after just a few times. I am going to look for another pumice stone that keeps itself together.</li>
    <li> Mine looked nothing like the picture and frankly it wasn&#x27;t very good quality.  It crumbled and broke and didn&#x27;t seem like it was a real pumice stone.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it only one star was that it was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who has leather for his feet. He says can feel the difference after first use. So for me, money will spent.</li>
    <li> This has the right amount of grit for my feet, without being too rough. I bought one that lasted for 3 years. During that time i moved several times and traveled a lot for work (it got banged around quite a bit during this time). It finally broke being dropped on a hard tile floor. I thought it had been through a lot. If you have had this stone for 4 months and it is holding up just fine. I have used a few different pumice stones over the years. This is definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> This Pumice Stone work prefectly.  I took a 5 minutes shower and then use this stone.  It almost removed all of my callouse.  I had this problem for so many years and this is the first time I can see my feet clean.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the awful smell was in my bathroom - turned out to be this pumice stone.  It made my whole bathroom and subsequently my feet smell awful.  I threw it away immediately.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Used it as soon as I got it, not only was it not stone-y enough, it literally dissolved after my boyfriend left the shower on. Great exfoliator for the shower drain!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting any results from this.  It was crumbly and ineffective.  I highly recommend the Pedx pumice stone instead.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job for callouses on the hands. There are no large coarse openings to deal with the callouses.</li>
    <li> Because of limited supplies of products where I am, I ordered this to help take care of my feet. Not too much dust came out from when I opened it out of the plsatic, and it works fairly well. One small issue is that the picture online shows it as white, when the stone I recieved is black pumice. Regardless, it works, its well priced when I got it, and it shipped easily. I&#x27;d reccomend it if you need it or want to try out a pumice stone instead of a foot file.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry skin. And my heels get cracked and dry because I exercise a lot and like to wear sandals. This product didn&#x27;t do much to help.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a handle like in the picture, and it&#x27;s not as rough as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I didnt have the worst dry cracked feet&lt;br /&gt;But before I purchased the pumice stone my feet had deep fissures and the skin would just start to peel off...it was pretty painful to walk sometimes. I&#x27;ve been using the pumice stone after showering and then applying heel balm and my feet finally feel great again!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this to grind off the dead skin from my wart but it&#x27;s not working. Not the stones fault, this is one tough wart! Maybe I need a metal file LOL. BTW my stone is brown, not a problem.</li>
    <li> This product barely works on my rough, cracked heels.  Product is darker in color than pictured and leaves a dark residue where it sits in the shower.  Luckily, I bought a Diane pumice stone ([[ASIN:B003SZ4C1W Diane Rectangular Pumice Stone with Tie]]) as well to compare.  The Diane pumice stone actually works, is actually white, is bigger, has a tie to hang it up, and does not leave a residue even if you do not hang it up.  I tossed Natural Sierra Pumice Stone as soon as I tried the other one.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all been there, with our cracked, busted looking feet, elbows, arms and god knows what else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what makes this pumice stone awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buff in one direction to get the majority of the dead junk off you, then rub in a circular motion to buff it to a nice feel. One stone will last you a long time, no matter how scaley you might get - rinsing the stone and allowing it to air dry after every use is also a good way to extend its life :)</li>
    <li> This stone is too small to be effective. I still use it on occasion, only because I haven&#x27;t purchased anything to replace it yet. The pumice stone that is glued to a handle is much better to use because you can reach spots easier. This stone fits in the palm of my hand which requires that I grip it harder and scrub longer.</li>
    <li> I received this item promptly and it was wrapped securely and then placed in a sealed container which I appreciated for cleanliness assurance.  I just used it once so far and it seems like it will do the trick.  I have to admit I have ignored my dried heels and so a lot of dead skin came off the first time I used it.  I think if I use if on a regular basis it will work well as it is an easy grip to handle the stone while using, and does the job quickly.  It is a well made, thick pumice stone that will last a long time and will get me on the road to taking better care of my feet, and they certainly will look better.  If you have ignored your dry skin I&#x27;d highly recommend this - use it a few times and you will see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> It was okay. It&#x27;s this nice dark brown volcanic rock with holes and it seems like it&#x27;d do  a good job, but no matter how much I scrub, my feet are still pretty rough. I&#x27;d stick to a regular pumice stone. I think the whole natural thing was appealing, but it wasn&#x27;t really worth it. Oh and it says pumice but it&#x27;s not. Pumice typically floats in water... This is a volcanic rock. Still cool though.</li>
    <li> These stones really do the job and are priced right.  No more hard water marks on my toilet bowl after using these.</li>
    <li> This was surprisingly small, but it&#x27;ll due. The picture is also wrong. Its a small stone and doesn&#x27;t have a handle.</li>
    <li> Good pumice stone. Still using it and it works great.. Picks up some stuff after a while though. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Does the job on tough skin, calluses, dead skin and skin buildup around the finger nails.  Nice quality and natural stone, not man-made foam.</li>
    <li> Broke the minute it was taken out of the packaging. Could do with a little better packaging. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this one.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this- and I&#x27;m so thankful she did. I keep it in the shower and use it every other day, or when I remember. My feet are soft and smooth, even though I&#x27;m often barefoot.</li>
    <li> I get really bad heels. The worst dry and cracked heels you can imagine. Tried this as a simple experiment and it works really well and really gets my heels looking much better after just one or two tries.</li>
    <li> works well - great price.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. I threw it out. I used it only a few times. Once you get it wet, it has this horrible rotten mold smell. Understand that I let it dry out after the first use but it still had that really bad smell. Not worth your money unless you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> I like this stone.  It seems to work really well (although it&#x27;s my first pumice stone, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to).  It fits nicely in my hand, making it easy to rub against my foot.</li>
    <li> I use pumice stone regularly on my feet.  One star off because the package was very gritty maybe because of rough handling.  Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this pumice stone at all. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s lasted for quite some time now, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was what it said it was - a pumice stone.  Not much to say about those.  It worked as it should.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She says its not too harsh, and is gritty enough. Easy to grasp, doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that this stone is actually a dark brown, volcanic rock with large pits, not the smooth white stone pictured. It works great however, better than the old smooth white one I used to own. I only wish I&#x27;d bought another for the toilet.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed , see the stick on the stone in the picture. all I received was the stone ,no stick attached. make sure the words say with stick or handle if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this pumice stone. The product I received is black and peanut shaped. The curve of the stone makes it a little hard to hold onto while scrubbing. Also, it&#x27;s a little on the soft side and tends to crumble. It does make my skin softer, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
