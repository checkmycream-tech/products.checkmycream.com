      <li>I think for the price there could have been a bit more quality.</li>

      <li>so I know my brother will enjoy it,</li>
      <li>The mug is plastic and feels cheap.  </li>
      <li>The cup is cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>The cup looks and feels so cheap and the brush must be made of horse hair</li>
      <li>I would recommend a cheap buying an inexpensive badger brush and a quality soap.   </li>
      <li>cheap brush, plastic mug,</li>
      <li>the cheap plastic mug included.</li>
      <li>got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it and said it was like the old days.</li>

      <li>it was a unique gift as that what he loves .old</li>
      <li>The only good feature is if it falls on a tile floor it may not break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
      <li>In my case, it was for a grandson who would play with his grandpa&#x27;s shaving mug as a child, and now that he has become a young-adult and has to shave I though this gift would be most appropriate and in the future a fond memory.  </li>
      <li>I could now lather up like the good old days, but almost immediately bristles started coming out and in no time the whole brush came apart.  </li>
      <li>Cup seemed a little cheaply made, but it is a good set to get for beginner shavers.</li>

      <li>The mug and soap are fine, but it was necessary to visit a local drug store and purchase a new brush which is working fine.  </li>

      <li>Average quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect more based on the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was expecting a ceramic mug at the least. So I was not impressed with the cheap plastic mug included. I think for the price there could have been a bit more quality. The brush is okay however.</li>
    <li> The brush was a total bust! It shed worst then my long haired dog!</li>
    <li> As I have started shaving with a double edged safety razor, I wanted to get a shave mug.  As a result, I ended up purchasing this set.  I would recommend that you purchase a better quality kit.     The brush is stiff boar hair that does not create a later very well.  I put it away as a travel backup brush.      The shave soap smells good with vanilla tones, but the lather isn&#x27;t impressive.  Rather than throw it away, I&#x27;m now using it as bar of soap in the shower.     The mug is plastic and feels cheap.  It has a set of rings on the bottom of the mug to help hold a puck of shaving soap.  I use the shave mug with some Van Der Hagen shave soap.  This setup works fine.      I wouldn&#x27;t recommend as a gift for someone -- the brush is stiff and abrasive, and the soap doesn&#x27;t lather well.  I would recommend a cheap buying an inexpensive badger brush and a quality soap.   That is what I ended up doing anyway.</li>
    <li> Thank You for your fast shipping.,It is a gift so I know my brother will enjoy it,</li>
    <li> Cup is plastic!  Seems I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth on this one....soap smells good, though.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it is just what they wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product.  It costs next to nothing, and that&#x27;s what you basicly get.  But it&#x27;s not a terrible product.</li>
    <li> Got these for a gift, Was a bit surprised to see it had a plastic cup tho. Any way was glad to find it there on Amazon this are hard to find anywhere.</li>
    <li> I really like this setup, I am getting a closer and smoother shave with this.  Plus, the nostalgia of shaving this way is so awesome.</li>
    <li> It is nice.. Since Dad&#x27;s other ceramic one got broke I got this.. It is worth buying. aonly thing is. I wish it had the decoration on both sides of the mug.</li>
    <li> Mug is plastic.  Brush is almost useless.  It is very cheap. The only good feature is if it falls on a tile floor it may not break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Bristles continue to fall out. Seems like something for a child to play with and not for a man.</li>
    <li> Being a senior, I was disappointed when I could no longer purchase lather shave cream and I hated the aerosol cans because they were wasteful and messy!!  This looked my answer to my shaving desires.  I could now lather up like the good old days, but almost immediately bristles started coming out and in no time the whole brush came apart.  The mug and soap are fine, but it was necessary to visit a local drug store and purchase a new brush which is working fine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who likes old fashion shavings and he love this.&lt;br /&gt;Would have preffered the mug to be ceramic, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> it seems to satisfy my needs, i would have preferred a different fragrance (maybe Bayrum) but the kit works as advertised</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending the mug &amp; brush set in a timely fashion. My brother-in-law really liked it. Again, thank you.</li>
    <li> Average quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect more based on the price.</li>
    <li> For the price, the mug could at least be a ceramic or porcelien</li>
    <li> got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it and said it was like the old days. he has been wanting this for a long time</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the brush the it shed .. I have replaced it with a different brush the one in the kit was poorly made.</li>
    <li> I wish I had checked the customer reviews closer!!! This is an overpriced cheap piece of crap</li>
    <li> The brush was not as good as expected. Not large enough bristle wise.</li>
    <li> It meet with my expectations and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cup breaking. Reminds you of when grandpa or dad used it.</li>
    <li> The shaving brush falls apart after less than a month.  I have not only single hairs but gobs of them coming out and can&#x27;t use the brush anymore.  As I side note this is a Boar brush not a Badger(higher quality).  The Mug is ok, it&#x27;s a basic plastic mug but the side walls are so high that it is hard to use to create a good lather.  The Soap is low quality as well and even with minimal water doesn&#x27;t really build up a good lather.  I would highly recommend AGAINST buying this set.  Save your money, spend a little more buying the items separately and get good quality!</li>
    <li> lather up good...perfect</li>
    <li> It was fine for a gift..</li>
    <li> Light weight, unbreakable, &amp; easy to use. The only negative I can find is the small handle, might as well not even had one. I just hold the whole mug on the opposite side because I have better control anyway. This system works great with a wet/dry electric razor, closest to date. Can&#x27;t beat the price around here (can&#x27;t even find one) but the soap is found at local pharmacy &amp; is inexpensive also. I don&#x27;t see myself ever buying the canned stuff again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift &amp; he was very excited to get this. He hasn&#x27;t had one before so he was looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> It was okay husband not happy about plastic cup but he will keep it</li>
    <li> Cup seemed a little cheaply made, but it is a good set to get for beginner shavers.</li>
    <li> The worst I ever saw.&lt;br /&gt;Junk.&lt;br /&gt;Poorest quality. Just Plastic.&lt;br /&gt;looked great in the ad.</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest thing I have ever bought.  The cup is plastic the brush is very low quality and it was very expensive for what you got.</li>
    <li> I got this as a starter set for my son.  It was really sad and disappointing.  The cup is cheap plastic.  The brush was so stiff and rough that it would have been better used for finishing wood or metal.  Should not be used on your face.  I threw the brush away and gave my son one of mine.  I gave him the shaving cup with the promise that I would give him something suitable as soon as possible.  At $25 I have to think they are working with a 95% markup.</li>
    <li> I needed to find something that would be appreciated albeit very inexpensive.  In my case, it was for a grandson who would play with his grandpa&#x27;s shaving mug as a child, and now that he has become a young-adult and has to shave I though this gift would be most appropriate and in the future a fond memory.  So far it has.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this item! The cup looks and feels so cheap and the brush must be made of horse hair .brush fell apart day one. Better off putting shave cream on with hand .</li>
    <li> Disappointed. So disappointed I gave away as a gift. cheap brush, plastic mug, no wonder they charge less than $8 dollars for this and it is not worth it. Buy a VanDerHagen at Walmart for $2 more.</li>
    <li> My husband ask me to find a shaving mug set on the internet and he is very satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional but does not look like something that costs 25+ dollars. it is plastic and the design on the brush is a paper label. It&#x27;s not horrible but just not what I had envisioned.</li>
    <li> I gave a god rating on the service with the on line ordering and the speed on which it arrived</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my husband wanted. He was talking one day, about what his dad used to shave with and he said he wanted the same thing. I bought it for him last Christmas and he loves it, and he never likes anything. He uses it all time. This is less stuff in the bathroom. He gets a lot of foam for shaving and he seems to enjoy shaving more with the brush and all the lather.</li>
    <li> i got this for hubby for valentines day brush an soap was great but the mug was plastic.very disappointed.he loved it anyway.an thoght it was a unique gift as that what he loves .old school items but not of qood quality</li>
    <li> The soap and cup are fine,the brush not so much.The brush started losing clumps of bristles after the third use.Now I have to buy a brush and this time I will not skimp on price</li>
    <li> Husband has been using this brush for years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> not a good set mostly made of plastic and the brush is harder that rocks</li>
    <li> expected the mug to be ceramic.</li>
    <li> Got this for a employee&#x27;s father 90th birthday. Was the hit with his dad!!!&lt;br /&gt;Was what his dad had been wanted and needed. His broke and could not find one.</li>
