      <li>Great fragrance from years ago...</li>
      <li>I am Happy.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the alcohol in it, but somehow it greatly enhances healing of any cuts.  </li>
      <li>If it makes her happy</li>
      <li>It makes me wonder if the formula has been altered, as it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it used too.</li>
      <li>Even so, it&#x27;s still good.</li>
      <li>it was a good  PRODUCT&lt;</li>
      <li>a good product as always.</li>

      <li>He was very pleased with it</li>
      <li>He said he always liked Brut, and  he used to wear it years ago, so I decided to surprise him &amp; order it for him.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked this product since the sixties.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like it smells as good as it did many many years ago.</li>
      <li>My nose tells me the Cologne has by far the best aroma.</li>
      <li>Both are good, but I wanted the original.  </li>
      <li>It was perfect for him, he liked the smell and size wasn&#x27;t two big!</li>
      <li>Love Brut and I think we can all agree that most of us are walking around on this planet because our Dad&#x27;s used Brut.</li>
      <li>Watch out as it is potent.</li>
      <li>Cologne is much better than the after shave or splash on lotion.</li>
      <li>reminds me of My Dad Love it..</li>
      <li>Started wearing this MANY decades ago..</li>
      <li>this is still the favorite of the women that have known me for years.</li>
      <li>The bottle itself screams distinguished and the fact that I can buy a 5 oz bottle of it for $3.99 makes it even a better deal.</li>
      <li>so be cautious.main ingredient in chemical warfare,dirty bombs and all acts of terror.also a potent paint stripper</li>
      <li>It smells more like an aftershave your barber would give you; overpoweringly musky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Manly scent causes people to assume I&#x27;m a test pilot able to answer aerospace queries.</li>
      <li>Love this men&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I purchase this product because it&#x27;s my  brither favorite perfume ever sunce</li>
      <li>Now I am a bit more at ease...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay though...live and learn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a many smell...not flowery or powdery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s authentic Brut.</li>
      <li>Nice clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Great price - I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Nothing really fancy but pleasant.</li>
      <li>Brute is my favorite cologne been using it for years, Good fast service</li>
      <li>However, if you do like a nice clean, piney scent for a cheap price, this is it.</li>
      <li>You can easily find an excellent cologne for even less than this stuff.</li>
      <li>product is fine</li>
      <li>This is NOT the original fragrance as pictured.  </li>
      <li>No Way this is the original.  </li>
      <li>Still the original scent.</li>
      <li>Good smell just as i remember it from high school good clean smell a little strong for my wife</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to any man who doesn&#x27;t want to smell sweet.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering, it blends well with most men who use this 1960&#x27;s era classic.</li>
      <li>if you like the Brut aroma it&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>I got this because I caught a sniff of my coworker and it smells like incense smell and fresh.</li>
      <li>Otherwise good but one bottle arrived with almost half of its content leaked out.</li>
      <li>It was offered at what I felt to be a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This cologne goes back many years, but is still very clean-smelling, not too heavy, and just nice!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get fooled by the cheap price because it&#x27;s a cheap job imitation.</li>
      <li>me to mark large geographical areas with my scent and increase my dominion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After being unable to find Brut in the stores for my hubby, I was pleased to be able to get it for him here!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that you can buy this locally very easily at a store whose first initial starts with a \\&quot;W\\&quot; and has \\&quot;Mart\\&quot; at the end for only $5.22.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get real enthused about men&#x27;s cologne</li>
      <li>Thanks, BRUT.</li>
      <li>I like the scent really well</li>
      <li>I have a whole spate of oil-based clognes...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I graduated from High School in 1965.  </li>
      <li>The real product comes boxed, glass bottle, w/ printed letters and clearly stated it&#x27;s made by Faberge.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the cologne is fine.</li>
      <li>simply because they exist.&lt;br /&gt;Incites unmistakable urge to wrestle large animals.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t check it out well enough and it really makes no difference.</li>
      <li>Faberge Brut was wildly popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only real issue keeping this from 5 stars, is that it won&#x27;t stay on you all day.</li>
      <li>Kinda like an old fashioned barbershop.</li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T LIKE THAT HEAVY OVERPOWERING SMELL OF MANY OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE COLOGNES.</li>
      <li>The bottle says Idelle Labs.&lt;br /&gt;The Faberge Cologne Brut in the 1960&#x27;s smelled much stronger for a long time: my girl friends gave it to me for Christmas!  </li>
      <li>I have used brut for several years, and this just doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the col I used in the past.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll like this traditional fragrance in the familiar green bottle.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice masculin scent and for $8 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>Was actually &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;, a new formulation that is totally unlike the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.</li>

<li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
<li> An old standard, not overwhelming and definitely no musk odor.</li>
<li> While this cologne may be generic and not a high end product, the fragrance continues to impress me.&lt;br</li>

<li> minus 1 for an incorrect picture and</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not great, or even good.</li>
<li> This cologne is an imitation.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;Designer Imposters\\&quot; label has body sprays and colognes that smell identical to the expensive designer brands and are very affordable.</li>
<li> I hate when any company changes a product that you have grown to love, to IMPROVE it.</li>
<li> Truth be told I had been in agony listening to my mother complained and laughed disgustedly at my dad&#x27;s taste for daily fragrances.</li>
<li> Those three little green bottles together enhance my bathroom countertop.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a green plastic bottle w/</li>
<li> It should not be falsely advertised or pictured if not the actual product.</li>
<li> On version, just know that it might not be a bad idea to reapply a couple hours after first</li>
<li> so not sure what&#x27;s up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> been using brut for years. Has a nice masculin scent and for $8 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong. Too bad the bottle I received was not a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> While this cologne may be generic and not a high end product, the fragrance continues to impress me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but if you like the Brut aroma it&#x27;s worth the cost.  I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for many&lt;br /&gt;years, and continue to receive compliments about the fragrance.</li>
    <li> The FORMULA  for  BRUT  COLOGNE  must have been changed cause it don&#x27;t  smell like it DID.  TO BAD it was a good  PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;  Mac&lt;br /&gt;  H R McGalliard</li>
    <li> a good product as always.</li>
    <li> After being unable to find Brut in the stores for my hubby, I was pleased to be able to get it for him here!</li>
    <li> Started wearing this MANY decades ago..This is one of those you get in a gift set from Aunt Myrtle, lol. I stopped wearing it for a while, but just rediscovered it again. Granted, it&#x27;s not the same scent as i was years ago, but it&#x27;s close. I will also add that it&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. However, if you do like a nice clean, piney scent for a cheap price, this is it.</li>
    <li> Truth be told I had been in agony listening to my mother complained and laughed disgustedly at my dad&#x27;s taste for daily fragrances. She had literally made cruelest remarks on his fragrances, so I had to save my dad from humiliation and save my mom&#x27;s olfactory cells from being damaged. Hence came BRUT. I am truly relieved that my dad has settled on something he likes that my mom likes, too. Thanks, BRUT. Thanks for stopping the cruel laughs. Now I am a bit more at ease...</li>
    <li> Great fragrance from years ago...</li>
    <li> Great price - I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like it smells as good as it did many many years ago. The company has changed hands since I was a kid. It makes me wonder if the formula has been altered, as it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it used too. Even so, it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Allows me to mark large geographical areas with my scent and increase my dominion.&lt;br /&gt;Gives heart to the weak, while striking fear into my enemies.&lt;br /&gt;Increased ability to sense other dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;Makes larger mammals fear me.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like cobra fangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Creates desire to climb tall mountains simply because they exist.&lt;br /&gt;Incites unmistakable urge to wrestle large animals.&lt;br /&gt;Manly scent causes people to assume I&#x27;m a test pilot able to answer aerospace queries.</li>
    <li> Good price--Hard to find (Cologne) in N. Texas</li>
    <li> The scent does not last very long. I hate when any company changes a product that you have grown to love, to IMPROVE it.</li>
    <li> same as it&#x27;s always been,,,,, women like it too</li>
    <li> Brute is my favorite cologne been using it for years, Good fast service</li>
    <li> Strictly working class, 30 years ago! This cologne should be sold &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; and should be discontinued for being simply bad! Give it to male imates in jail, they need it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get real enthused about men&#x27;s cologne but this smells like the Brut of yesterday and she likes it.  Watch out as it is potent.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Brut Cologne as a Fathers day gift for my husband. He said he always liked Brut, and  he used to wear it years ago, so I decided to surprise him &amp; order it for him. He said it is just like he remembered it.</li>
    <li> I have used brut Cologne for 45 years at least. My wife still loves it so , so do I. If it makes her happy I am Happy. I would recommend it to any man who doesn&#x27;t want to smell sweet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know anybody who would actually buy this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not great, or even good. It smells more like an aftershave your barber would give you; overpoweringly musky. You can easily find an excellent cologne for even less than this stuff. The \\&quot;Designer Imposters\\&quot; label has body sprays and colognes that smell identical to the expensive designer brands and are very affordable.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING BRUT FOR OVER 30 YEARS. DON&#x27;T LIKE THAT HEAVY OVERPOWERING SMELL OF MANY OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE COLOGNES. CAN ALWAYS EXPECT A NICE COMPLIMENT FROM USING  BRUT AND THE PRICE IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a friend because he has difficulty in finding it locally.  He was very pleased with it and It does smell good !!!</li>
    <li> as usual my brut cologne was exactly what i would expect</li>
    <li> Was not &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; as advertised. Was actually &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;, a new formulation that is totally unlike the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;. It should not be falsely advertised or pictured if not the actual product.</li>
    <li> Everybody loves Brut.  I&#x27;ve been using it since it came out.  It needs no introduction.  I still get compliments about it.  You will, too.</li>
    <li> Brings me back to the 80s!  Nice clean smell.  I scored within an hour of applying the Brut.  It still works!</li>
    <li> My grandpa loved it! It was perfect for him, he liked the smell and size wasn&#x27;t two big! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, the cologne is fine. It&#x27;s authentic Brut. I smell like the 60&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> Weak and scent goes away in 3 minutes: very disappointing.  This stuff is an imposter knock off with weak, poor ingredients: the smell disappears in minutes!  The bottle says Idelle Labs.&lt;br /&gt;The Faberge Cologne Brut in the 1960&#x27;s smelled much stronger for a long time: my girl friends gave it to me for Christmas!  Girls loved it.  I graduated from High School in 1965.  Faberge Brut was wildly popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idelle makes weak poor quality cologne and tries to call it the Orignal Faberge Brut.  No Way this is the original.  By something made by a name brand, NOT IDELLE.</li>
    <li> I think we  can all agree that Brut cologne should be taken off the market. What Brut cologne does/did for the dating game was what PED&#x27;s did for baseball in the 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s just not fair to the ladies. One scent of this of pungent smell and the ladies will be all over you like wool on a lamb. The women never had a chance. It&#x27;s a little known secret that the men in India and China use this cologne. Population problem in these countries just a coincidence,,,,  I think not!!! The bottle itself screams distinguished and the fact that I can buy a 5 oz bottle of it for $3.99 makes it even a better deal. Just think,  80 cents an ounce for this panty dropping juice. Love Brut and I think we can all agree that most of us are walking around on this planet because our Dad&#x27;s used Brut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stuck with this stuff since I was 16.  I am now 63.  Its been around for awhile so someone must like it.  Maybe its just me.</li>
    <li> The Hulk,Conan,The Thing,when I feel the need for power I reach for &amp;#34;Brute&amp;#34; stops  villains in there tracks.the vapors alone are quite  flammable so be cautious.main ingredient in chemical warfare,dirty bombs and all acts of terror.also a potent paint stripper</li>
    <li> My husband likes very well not strong enough for him.</li>
    <li> Not good.............do not order</li>
    <li> Really late delivery but product is fine</li>
    <li> Yes, Brut is bout the only cologne I use. I like the scent really well &amp; it seems to last.</li>
    <li> reminds me of My Dad Love it..</li>
    <li> Like the classics?  You&#x27;ll like this traditional fragrance in the familiar green bottle.  Not overpowering, it blends well with most men who use this 1960&#x27;s era classic.</li>
    <li> I smelled the 70&#x27;s .... and it was good</li>
    <li> I order two bottles one was leaking from the bottom. Will never order this cologne thru the mail for my father. Poorly packaging and disappointed with amazon.</li>
    <li> Still the original scent. Lovin&#x27; it! Promt delivery, thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a whole spate of oil-based clognes...this is still the favorite of the women that have known me for years. Who am I to argue? I like it too.</li>
    <li> This cologne is an imitation. It&#x27;s a green plastic bottle w/ a label glued to it w/o a box. The real product comes boxed, glass bottle, w/ printed letters and clearly stated it&#x27;s made by Faberge. Merchant refused to pay for shipping it back. They don&#x27;t follow up on email making resolution w/ Amazon difficult and long process. Don&#x27;t get fooled by the cheap price because it&#x27;s a cheap job imitation.</li>
    <li> Good smell just as i remember it from high school good clean smell a little strong for my wife though</li>
    <li> I got this because I caught a sniff of my coworker and it smells like incense smell and fresh. Then when I wore it around, my brother said I smell like a drunk.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW  ALL BOTTLS WERE BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYMORE BUSINESS  BUSINESS WITH AMAZON&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR \\&quot;NOTHING&#x27; IT IS NOT NICE..</li>
    <li> Otherwise good but one bottle arrived with almost half of its content leaked out.</li>
    <li> No problem with the product althought it was taped over the cap instead of sealed like you buy in the store.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment of quality product.</li>
    <li> I have used brut for several years, and this just doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the col I used in the past. The bottle came unboxed and taped at the cap so not sure what&#x27;s up I know I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Brut Splash-On, the After-Shave, and the Cologne. My nose tells me the Cologne has by far the best aroma. Those three little green bottles together enhance my bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> My shipment came from a different seller currently listed and arrived on time but not in 3 days or even 4. That being said it smells just like I remembered it. Nothing really fancy but pleasant. I didn&#x27;t realize that you can buy this locally very easily at a store whose first initial starts with a \\&quot;W\\&quot; and has \\&quot;Mart\\&quot; at the end for only $5.22.  Lol... It&#x27;s okay though...live and learn. Perhaps you can&#x27;t find it locally so this saves you time and gas ordering this way.  Plus the one in the store is 7 ounces and not 5 ounces.</li>
    <li> This cologne goes back many years, but is still very clean-smelling, not too heavy, and just nice!  It was offered at what I felt to be a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because it&#x27;s my  brither favorite perfume ever sunce</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original fragrance as pictured.  I ordered it for that reason, and received the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; one.  Both are good, but I wanted the original.  I use it as an aftershave.  Maybe it&#x27;s the alcohol in it, but somehow it greatly enhances healing of any cuts.  And you smell like a man.  I rinse it off a bit and the fragrance remains but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, Pharmapacks, was unable to replace the classic with the original, but they issued a partial refund for my trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; fragrance, minus 1 for an incorrect picture and me not getting what I thought I ordered, and plus 2 for solid customer service.  5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Chris</li>
    <li> Seems like Brut, but no mention of Faberge. I find that strange and wonder if this is a copy. The odor is about the same as the Brut by Faberge I just finished. It is about the same, but not quite the same.</li>
    <li> Like the product, but it&#x27;s hard to control the &amp;#34;portion&amp;#34; when you tip the bottle. Wish it had a sprayer.</li>
    <li> What can I say...it&#x27;s BRUT cologne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great and is a great deal. It&#x27;s a many smell...not flowery or powdery. Kinda like an old fashioned barbershop. It just smells and feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue keeping this from 5 stars, is that it won&#x27;t stay on you all day. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;ll last a while...much more than the Splash On version, just know that it might not be a bad idea to reapply a couple hours after first using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cologne for a great price. I know BRUT has been around for years and some people might consider that a negative, since their dad or grandpa probably wore it, but hey...if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked this product since the sixties. An old standard, not overwhelming and definitely no musk odor. Cologne is much better than the after shave or splash on lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this men&#x27;s fragrance.  Reminds me of my dad when I was growing up.</li>
    <li> I like the cologne. I was expecting a spray but I didn&#x27;t check it out well enough and it really makes no difference.</li>
