### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They do the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>They hold fairly well and release the hair without pulling the hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying not to use chemicals in my hair anymore, so I want to start using good conditioners, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to use anything with my hair flipping and flopping everywhere.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Simple and effective.</li>
      <li>I saw these with so many good reviews, so I ordered them.</li>
      <li>Because they&#x27;re so cheaply priced I was worried they would be not so good quality</li>
      <li>Ok</li>
      <li>Even four would have been a better value.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only thing I wish was for 10 dollars, I wish they maybe included more.</li>
      <li>The clips do not line up at top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>good product meets our expectations, arrived on time and is what the provider advertises, good price, carries out further purchases with you</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re plastic, but they feel strong, and have a strong grasp.</li>
      <li>it still does the job perfectly fine for me.</li>
      <li>so I could get free shipping,</li>
      <li>It is made with a cheap plastic material but</li>
      <li>The arch makes them comfortable against the scalp.</li>
      <li>just a side note if color is important to you.</li>
      <li>The clip hinges are nice and springy, but the overall clip is kind of flimsy -- not &amp;#34;snappy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grabby.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Super cheap product.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with these large clips.</li>
      <li>; This is excellent if you normally get your hair tangled or stuck in other clips, but I found that they like to slip right out of my hair.</li>
      <li>but I needed them so it was worth the risk</li>
      <li>Save yourself the trouble and pay a couple dollars more for something that works!!</li>
      <li>Also the clips didn&#x27;t even line up right.</li>
      <li>I expect them to break right away.  </li>
      <li>and it turns out they&#x27;re just right.</li>
      <li>sum it up: A very gentle clip.</li>
      <li>DID arrive pretty fast though!</li>
      <li>They are the exact ones from the picture.</li>
      <li>Then, I use a diffuser to gently dry my hair and give it more curl.  </li>
      <li>I thought these were supposed to have a strong spring, but when i put a section of my hair in it, it doesn&#x27;t even close, and my hair slides out of the open end.  </li>
      <li>For my purposes, it isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>Granted there are only 3 clips, but the quality is fantastic.</li>
      <li>They are also not lined up very well.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really think they would work well for hair.</li>
      <li>These really work.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>They would be a lot better if they were a little shorter, because then the force of the clamp wouldn&#x27;t be lost at the ends.</li>
      <li>They have small &amp;#34;teeth,&amp;#34; more like &amp;#34;texture nubs,&amp;#34; for &amp;#34;gripping,&amp;#34; but this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
      <li>The bottom would be crooked to one side and the top would be to the other, so the tip of the clip didn&#x27;t even touch.</li>
      <li>These clips are very large, about 6 inches long, and work well.  </li>
      <li>I paid only $6.97, and found that to be a reasonable price for three clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty long though..</li>
      <li>which pull and get stuck in my hair, but these are almost like old school banana clips from the &#x27;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plastic seems kinda cheap and the springs are not strong at all.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that they are quite large and wide, nearly six inches long, and more than twice the width of typical, skinny silver clips.</li>
      <li>It clasps down nice and firm.</li>
      <li>but they are pretty loose not a very tight grip</li>
      <li>I wanted a nice big salon clip to hold my hair up, but this wouldn&#x27;t even hold my 4 year old daughters thin hair in it.</li>
      <li>thought these were metal but ended up being plastic; the plastic is flimsy and will most likely break eventually with my thick hair</li>
      <li>However,I suppose because I have such thick hair, it really wouldn&#x27;t secure my hair, even when using a smaller section.</li>
      <li>Three of these clips should be enough to clip up the hair of nearly anyone - one for each side, and one for the back.</li>
      <li>The spring is so weak and the plastic so cheap.</li>

<li> Still slipped right out of small, looped sections of dry</li>
<li> Do  not get fooled by the picture on the item, I received the product and it was three black clips, not 1 black, 1 white and 1 pink as the picture shows.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have long hair, and was looking for salon-style clips to section it when I need to dye it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money on these, they are really big bendy crooked pieces of plastic that will only disappoint and won&#x27;t hold anything.</li>
<li> ANY MORE , NOT GOOD NOT GOOD</li>
<li> These clips slipped and slid off of my head and didn&#x27;t hold a single strand up.</li>
<li> They are much longer than I expected, and they are a little thick for my taste, especially on the bottom.</li>
<li> THE PICTURE SHOWING 3 COLOURS ,WHICH IS BLACK- PINK - WHITE</li>
<li> Cheap and useless, what a waste.</li>
<li> The clips at the roots help the hair curl there, because with long, thick, curly hair, the weight of the hair usually pulls the hair straight at the crown.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t hold anything at all towards the tip.</li>
<li> However, these clips are made out of a very flexible weak plastic that can&#x27;t hold anything firmly.</li>
<li> As the other reviewers said.</li>
<li> I would say these are not worth the price.</li>
<li> These are such a waste of money!!</li>
<li> They have little nubs inside, not exactly teeth, just grip nubs.</li>
<li> though, I received three black clips, not pink-white-black, but I don&#x27;t care about the color</li>
<li> , the shape is somewhat odd...</li>
<li> I have thick, long hair and was hoping to find sectioning clips to put my hair up when I&#x27;m drying/straightening it.  </li>
<li> I bought these clips for sectioning off my long, thick hair for styling (straightening, blow-drying, etc.).</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
<li> I received these a few days ago and I&#x27;ll be returning them immediately.</li>
<li> The quality is terrible - the clips do not stay closed and the bottom part of the clip isn&#x27;t even centered with the top part.</li>
<li> Definitely not strong hold for styling, but won&#x27;t tangle or pull your hair.</li>
<li> These have no strong spring.</li>
<li> A little disappointed, but I&#x27;m keeping them because I&#x27;m only using it to partition my hair, and not for an actual style.</li>
<li> These are a total waste of money!!!!</li>
<li> I use these to clip up small sections of hair at the crown.  </li>
<li> I wouldnt say this product is terrible, but rather cheap..</li>
<li> I have thick hair too and these don&#x27;t even close.</li>
<li> If you have thick hair, forget it.</li>
<li> Sections must be very small in order to work.</li>
<li> Clip parts are weak and they do not line up.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s THAT weak.</li>
<li> If you have thin hair, these may hold your hair.</li>
<li> The package I received was all black, not a variety pack - I needed the colors, so this product is worthless to me.</li>
<li> Useless.  </li>
<li> They are this chese plastic and the clips don&#x27;t even go together, they are made wrong.</li>
<li> I never leave bad ratings but this time I had to make an exception..these are by far the cheapest pieces of crap i have ever ordered!</li>
<li> All three of the clips all were defected and disappointing.</li>
<li> Very unhappy customer.  </li>
<li> I hate this product.</li>
<li> Horrible item.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered these hair clips for contructing hairbows. Because they&#x27;re so cheaply priced I was worried they would be not so good quality but I needed them so it was worth the risk and it turns out they&#x27;re just right. They do the job perfectly. They are the exact ones from the picture. It clasps down nice and firm. It is made with a cheap plastic material but it still does the job perfectly fine for me.</li>
    <li> I use these to clip up small sections of hair at the crown.  Then, I use a diffuser to gently dry my hair and give it more curl.  The clips at the roots help the hair curl there, because with long, thick, curly hair, the weight of the hair usually pulls the hair straight at the crown.  I read about that at another site, don&#x27;t remember where.  These really work.</li>
    <li> Super cheap product. As the other reviewers said. You don&#x27;t get what was advertised. I got all brown ones (doesn&#x27;t even mention brown ones) These have no strong spring. I have thick hair too and these don&#x27;t even close. I wanted a nice big salon clip to hold my hair up, but this wouldn&#x27;t even hold my 4 year old daughters thin hair in it. It&#x27;s THAT weak. Horrible item.</li>
    <li> I wanted really big hair clips, because I have a lot of hair. I&#x27;m trying not to use chemicals in my hair anymore, so I want to start using good conditioners, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to use anything with my hair flipping and flopping everywhere. They&#x27;re plastic, but they feel strong, and have a strong grasp. They have little nubs inside, not exactly teeth, just grip nubs. And they&#x27;re much bigger than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish was for 10 dollars, I wish they maybe included more. Even four would have been a better value. But overall, I&#x27;d suggest these.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, and was looking for salon-style clips to section it when I need to dye it. I didn&#x27;t want to buy in bulk.  These clips are very large, about 6 inches long, and work well.  I paid only $6.97, and found that to be a reasonable price for three clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> THE PICTURE SHOWING 3 COLOURS ,WHICH IS BLACK- PINK - WHITE BUT WHEN I GOT IT COME WITH 2 COLOURS ONLY , 2 BLACKS AND 1 WHITE .TELL ME WHO&#x27;S WILL GOING TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT ANY MORE , NOT GOOD NOT GOOD</li>
    <li> I never leave bad ratings but this time I had to make an exception..these are by far the cheapest pieces of crap i have ever ordered! They are this chese plastic and the clips don&#x27;t even go together, they are made wrong. Save yourself the trouble and pay a couple dollars more for something that works!!</li>
    <li> I make ribbon hair bows and got these to help out holding the ribbon together so I can tie it. They work Ok but they are pretty loose not a very tight grip so I don&#x27;t really think they would work well for hair. They are also not lined up very well.</li>
    <li> I bought the Marianna jumbo section clips.  The clips do not line up at top and bottom.  I expect them to break right away.  Makes no sense to pay to send them back.  I also received all brown vs. three colors. Very unhappy customer.  The one star is for simply receiving the clips.[[ASIN:B000NBMEVY Marianna Jumbo Section Clips 3-pack]]</li>
    <li> These clips slipped and slid off of my head and didn&#x27;t hold a single strand up. Cheap and useless, what a waste.</li>
    <li> I got these clips to make hair bows. However, these clips are made out of a very flexible weak plastic that can&#x27;t hold anything firmly. Also the clips didn&#x27;t even line up right. The bottom would be crooked to one side and the top would be to the other, so the tip of the clip didn&#x27;t even touch. All three of the clips all were defected and disappointing. So I tossed them out and bought metal clips from Sally&#x27;s that were about $3 for 6 and actually hold things in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money on these, they are really big bendy crooked pieces of plastic that will only disappoint and won&#x27;t hold anything.</li>
    <li> thought these were metal but ended up being plastic; the plastic is flimsy and will most likely break eventually with my thick hair</li>
    <li> I hate this product. I would give it no stars. It doesn&#x27;t hold hair well at all. I just got them to get to $25 so I could get free shipping,</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair, these may hold your hair. If you have thick hair, forget it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair and was hoping to find sectioning clips to put my hair up when I&#x27;m drying/straightening it.  I thought these were supposed to have a strong spring, but when i put a section of my hair in it, it doesn&#x27;t even close, and my hair slides out of the open end.  Plastic seems kinda cheap and the springs are not strong at all.  I would say these are not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for clips to layer off my hair for styling. I saw these with so many good reviews, so I ordered them. However,I suppose because I have such thick hair, it really wouldn&#x27;t secure my hair, even when using a smaller section. They are much longer than I expected, and they are a little thick for my taste, especially on the bottom. They would be a lot better if they were a little shorter, because then the force of the clamp wouldn&#x27;t be lost at the ends. If I could get them in my hair, hair towards the end of the clip would fall out because it wouldn&#x27;t clamp together. A little disappointed, but I&#x27;m keeping them because I&#x27;m only using it to partition my hair, and not for an actual style.</li>
    <li> These are such a waste of money!! When I got them out of the package they were bent, crooked, the tips stayed open and they wouldn&#x27;t hold my or my daughters hair. They were flimsy! These are a total waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Useless.  Clip parts are weak and they do not line up.  Will not hold hair.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt say this product is terrible, but rather cheap.. My hair is pretty long though.. These clips do not hold well even for a minute or two.. Sections must be very small in order to work. I think next time I will just use metal ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DID arrive pretty fast though!</li>
    <li> The spring is so weak and the plastic so cheap. As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t hold anything at all towards the tip. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Do  not get fooled by the picture on the item, I received the product and it was three black clips, not 1 black, 1 white and 1 pink as the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 cents.</li>
    <li> I received these a few days ago and I&#x27;ll be returning them immediately. The quality is terrible - the clips do not stay closed and the bottom part of the clip isn&#x27;t even centered with the top part.</li>
    <li> Granted there are only 3 clips, but the quality is fantastic. They don&#x27;t pull my hair out when I remove them, and actually unless you have a ton of hair, 3 will be plenty if you are doing something basic, which is all I needed it for. I highly recommend. One note though, I received three black clips, not pink-white-black, but I don&#x27;t care about the color so it&#x27;s not a big deal just a side note if color is important to you.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but just letting you know that you may not get the colors as shown.  I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It may or may not matter to you.</li>
    <li> good product meets our expectations, arrived on time and is what the provider advertises, good price, carries out further purchases with you</li>
    <li> I bought these clips for sectioning off my long, thick hair for styling (straightening, blow-drying, etc.). The clip hinges are nice and springy, but the overall clip is kind of flimsy -- not &amp;#34;snappy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grabby.&amp;#34; This is excellent if you normally get your hair tangled or stuck in other clips, but I found that they like to slip right out of my hair. They have small &amp;#34;teeth,&amp;#34; more like &amp;#34;texture nubs,&amp;#34; for &amp;#34;gripping,&amp;#34; but this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Still slipped right out of small, looped sections of dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shape is somewhat odd... I wasn&#x27;t expecting &amp;#34;metal alligator clips,&amp;#34; which pull and get stuck in my hair, but these are almost like old school banana clips from the &#x27;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up: A very gentle clip. Definitely not strong hold for styling, but won&#x27;t tangle or pull your hair. For my purposes, it isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> I knew they said jumbo but this is like the size of my head, I would not recommend this size.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the product pictured. The package I received was all black, not a variety pack - I needed the colors, so this product is worthless to me. Buyer beware if you&#x27;re looking for this variety! NOT AS PICTURED.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with these large clips. Keep in mind that they are quite large and wide, nearly six inches long, and more than twice the width of typical, skinny silver clips. Three of these clips should be enough to clip up the hair of nearly anyone - one for each side, and one for the back. They hold fairly well and release the hair without pulling the hair. The arch makes them comfortable against the scalp. No problems.</li>
