<li> Also, a little goes a looooong way on your face!</li>
<li> Some of the product does transfer onto my clothing but very little.</li>
<li> very small less than an inch writs tats.</li>
<li> this cream is unbelievable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used for a stage production and it done a fabulous job of covering many tattoos on the lead actor. It&#x27;s thick and it absolutely works.</li>
    <li> This over priced item does not provide coverage. Do not waste your money here, but head to a department store, where quality products are offered.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to cover my stretch marks for palm springs. It did not really do so. I&#x27;m thinking of maybe trying a concealer under and that may help. I do have to say it did cover all other imperfections on my legs and thighs. Also, a little goes a looooong way on your face!</li>
    <li> This is probably the first review I have ever wrote. I needed this product to cover up my stretch marks after having 3 kids. I do work out and my stomach is tone but I still have the stretch marks. They are not as dark as some women may have but the product covers them well and you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are up close inspecting my skin. It makes my skin look uniform and normal.  I put it on from under my bikini top to the top of my bikini bottom and even blend into my sides, so there&#x27;s no color difference between my regular skin.  I do use the loose setting powder (the color not transparent) over top. Some of the product does transfer onto my clothing but very little. You just have to be careful, it&#x27;s a trade off I guess. I am able to even swim with it on and it stays put. I have to remove it with makeup remover.  Once you put it on let it dry well enough,put the setting powder on,then your clothes. It does dry darker on me. I love it. Couldn&#x27;t wear a bikini without it.  I was actually on a national commercial and print ad wearing a bikini. This product allowed me to do that.</li>
    <li> Too dark for my very fair skin</li>
    <li> very good just as advertised which is refreshing. looks good doesn&#x27;t wear off like it says. words are not enough</li>
    <li> Great coverage!  I use this product as a concealer for sculpting my brows as well.</li>
    <li> I have some age spots on my legs and a few on my arms, it covers and blends with my skin so naturally, every time I use it I am still amazed at how much better I look in shorts and a dress, I also have a red birthmark on my face that all other cover creams have failed to keep covered, even though this is not stated for your face, I use it everyday and only once lasts all day, you need very little and it blends wonderfully...</li>
    <li> Covers my ugly, chronically, bruised hands&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Small application last two to three days.&lt;br /&gt;Must cover with settling  powder to keep from staining fabric.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this make-up. It covers everything that other concealers don&#x27;t touch.  It is especially good in the summer when more skin is bare.  At my age, I need everything covered.</li>
    <li> Just received these rugs. Very happy with color and quality so far.</li>
    <li> Covers well but I would use an applicator so not to stain hands</li>
    <li> The only issue I had was the color. I ordered medium and it was too dark. Otherwise it looks good and I plan on purchasing it again in a neutral color. Be aware that it also requires you to buy a powder and a remover. It is not returnable, but amazon was kind enough to give me a refund on my money anyway. Love amazon</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for arm bruises presumably caused by medications.  Anything my arms touch seem to result in a bruise.  After trying this product it completely covered the marks and if applied correctly should last at least 12 hours.  It&#x27;s been a blessing not having people comment but be sure to get your proper skin color before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;It really works well and have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> Great quality but I got wrong color! Too deep!</li>
    <li> this cream is unbelievable it covers everything your legs look nice and smooth the only problem that I have with it is that I chose a color that it doesn&#x27;t go with my skin but I will recommend if you don&#x27;t like to wear stocking this is a perfect for you. I will definitely buy another one but a lighter color. it was a mistake on my end I didn&#x27;t really know which color to choose but overall it&#x27;s the miracle cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best make up ever! I use it on my face and it covers up age spots and wrinkles flawlessly. This is a great price online for it and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Dermablend is the best cover up makeup for legs.  This color wasn&#x27;t the best match for me, but I will try a different one.</li>
    <li> This color has a pink tone to it. If you are dark person this color will look odd for it came out too pink on my caramel skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover a tattoo. The quality of the product is really good and lasts a long time. However i didnt match the color to my skin correctly so ive only used it a few times. If i would have matched it correctly it would have been great.</li>
    <li> Much darker than expected.</li>
    <li> First, the company was excellent as far as accepting the return and issuing a refund. I ordered several shades so that I could mix to match skin tone to no avail. I tried several different methods in applying the product all with the same outcome. It was obvious that something unnatural was applied to the skin. The appearance was very similar to that used by morticians. The final appearance was similar to a mannequin made of rubber.</li>
    <li> a little too dark but it worked</li>
    <li> Great coverage and easy blending.</li>
    <li> Terrible Orange color. Didn&#x27;t even come close to covering two very small less than an inch writs tats. Plus it made my skin itch. Very very expensive don&#x27;t bother buying</li>
