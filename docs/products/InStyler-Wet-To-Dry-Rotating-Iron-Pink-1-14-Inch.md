      <li>&lt;br /&gt;original case, unused, undamaged, unopened, highly recommended, works very good.</li>
      <li>I promise you it will help it feel better.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>works better on her</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this curling/straightening iron.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of not needing the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come to love the waves, curls, and fantastic body</li>
      <li>Easy to burn your head with.  </li>
      <li>I liked mine so much I bought 1 for my mom and have suggested it to my friends of all hair types!</li>
      <li>It keeps me frizz free all day.</li>
      <li>The best thing about them is being able to straighten and curl your hair with one gizmo, and without the ridges that you get with traditional flat and curling</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s such a good idea</li>
      <li>Not bad for all in one tool.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price .</li>

      <li>Remember to use a heat protectant and the right level of heat for your hair...</li>
      <li>Its very easy and likely to burn yourself.</li>
      <li>It is head and shoulders better than a flat iron (in my opinion) because it created silky straight hair with bounce and body without crushing my ends or leaving a burnt smell.  </li>
      <li>hair has to be nearly dry for it to be effective.  </li>
      <li>You can do so many different styles AFTER you get the hang of how to hold it and swipe it through your hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product, this would be my second one.</li>
      <li>My first one I bought lasted over 4 yrs</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with the product and its performance</li>
      <li>I have always used the InStyler from the first time they came out, everyone thinks I have been to a Salon...</li>
      <li>I love this product for the cool curls (tight or wavy) that I can do.</li>
      <li>So, after my haircut, it was a straight shiny sheet, with layers of course.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair straight.</li>
      <li>my hair manifests when released from so much weight and gravity.  </li>
      <li>My wife did not think too much of this.</li>
      <li>I think I can get better results with my other products.</li>
      <li>The instyler wet to dry rotating is really good.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised that it made my hair feel softer ;)</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use this piece if you want to curl your hair, which is what I mainly use this product for.</li>
      <li>When it was long it was darn near bone straight, which can be attractive, but I think it&#x27;s a hard look to carry off in your 50s.  </li>
      <li>is FANTASTIC for my hair, WET OR DRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>Overall, the concept is good, but it&#x27;s just not able to do the job of drying or curling hair.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Trust me it work, won&#x27;t live without it, take even when I travel...</li>
      <li>blow dry your hair quickly then use the Instyler or wait till your hair air</li>
      <li>I have medium hair that&#x27;s super coarse and without a ton of miracle products there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s getting blow dried smooth.</li>
      <li>I love the instyler wet to dry!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for wet to dry use, but I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it as a stand alone flat iron.</li>
      <li>Make my hair shine and soft.</li>
      <li>To conclude, my aunt (who is a professional hairdresser and salon owner) said of this product: &amp;</li>
      <li>and I would recommend drying your hair completely before use.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this overall, though it does not dry in one pass, at least in my hair.</li>
      <li>At the beauty salon they seem to feel compelled to dry my hair into a straight, shiny sheet.  </li>
      <li>This is still fast enough that I like it for times where I actually have time to do something for me.</li>
      <li>this styler gave me much silkier and longer lasting results than a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a hair-appliance that has convinced me once again to stop fighting my hair&#x27;s natural tendencies.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years the new version you can go from.wet to dry in 15 min</li>
      <li>I tried a less expensive brand before which provided okay results, but the InStyler is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t have the power to dry thick hair -- one daughter has baby fine hair and the InStyler</li>

<li> Generally it takes 3-4 passes through each area of my hair to dry and straighten.</li>
<li> It is easier to use and gives me much longer lasting results than straightening with a round brush while blow-drying AS LONG AS my hair was dry or almost so to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Hoping this one will last this long</li>
<li> Not as flat as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
<li> I am not a frequent shopper for personal grooming products, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t leave it on your hair for too long either.</li>
<li> I think if you use it properly (not have sopping wet hair)</li>
<li> Absolutely Wonderful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have Naturally Thick, Coils and the Curling Iron</li>
<li> With my long hair I&#x27;d never try to use this without the roots being completely dry.</li>
<li> I use it with dry hair as well.</li>
<li> To Dry Rotating Iron</li>
<li> I like the fact that it can dry and straighten and curl my hair even when it&#x27;s wet and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
<li> Because I have very thick, very curly hair, I did let my hair air dry before using the InStyler (even though this is the Wet to Dry model).  </li>
<li> /&gt;It takes some practice to use, and care too (it gets very hot, which is one of its advantages, but you can burn yourself if you&#x27;re careless.)</li>
<li> I usually let me hair air dry until barely damp, then run this through my hair.</li>
<li> InStyler Wet</li>
<li> It did not work the way I expected, so I returned it.</li>
<li> Does not work well on wet or even damp hair...</li>
<li> And, I tried a few times to get a similar look again, but never have.  </li>
<li> I usually use the InStyler to go from wet to dry and finish off with my other flat iron.</li>
<li> Bottom line, this is a very expensive straightening iron, and we have found it simply cannot effectively dry or curl hair of any texture (fine, medium or thick).  </li>
<li> It takes me around 20-30 minutes to straighten my hair with a regular flat iron, but with this it usually takes less than 10!</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t like this product it burns your hair way faster then other products.</li>
<li> Just be careful of heat damage!</li>
<li> Not exactly as described.</li>
<li> I would stick to other straighteners and curlers</li>
<li> I took a picture, and actually, that styling made it look very limp.  </li>
<li> I upgraded to this from my old instyler, which after years of use, was starting to fail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I upgraded to this from my old instyler, which after years of use, was starting to fail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on these hair devices. The best thing about them is being able to straighten and curl your hair with one gizmo, and without the ridges that you get with traditional flat and curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice to use, and care too (it gets very hot, which is one of its advantages, but you can burn yourself if you&#x27;re careless.)</li>
    <li> Awesome. ...I have been using this product for years the new version you can go from.wet to dry in 15 min you are done is awesome! Well worth the price . I would definately buy again</li>
    <li> I have always used the InStyler from the first time they came out, everyone thinks I have been to a Salon...&lt;br /&gt;Trust me it work, won&#x27;t live without it, take even when I travel...</li>
    <li> Easy to burn your head with.  Didn&#x27;t style quite as I would have liked.  Finally, a hair-appliance that has convinced me once again to stop fighting my hair&#x27;s natural tendencies.  When it was long it was darn near bone straight, which can be attractive, but I think it&#x27;s a hard look to carry off in your 50s.  I got a few inches cut off and some layers cut in and all of a sudden my hair is wavy if not curly.  At the beauty salon they seem to feel compelled to dry my hair into a straight, shiny sheet.  So, after my haircut, it was a straight shiny sheet, with layers of course.  I took a picture, and actually, that styling made it look very limp.  And, I tried a few times to get a similar look again, but never have.  I&#x27;ve come to love the waves, curls, and fantastic body my hair manifests when released from so much weight and gravity.  It&#x27;s sassy and bouncy and I don&#x27;t need this.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these for my teen daughters who have been using it for about three weeks now (since December 2014).  Does not work well on wet or even damp hair...hair has to be nearly dry for it to be effective.  Also, doesn&#x27;t have the power to dry thick hair -- one daughter has baby fine hair and the InStyler works better on her -- my other daughter has very thick hair and must use a blow dryer -- the InStyler cannot dry it.  Overall, the concept is good, but it&#x27;s just not able to do the job of drying or curling hair.  The InStyler does a decent job of straightening hair, but also impossible to use it to dry or curl hair.  Bottom line, this is a very expensive straightening iron, and we have found it simply cannot effectively dry or curl hair of any texture (fine, medium or thick).  Would not recommend the InStyler unless you&#x27;re just looking for an expensive hair straightening iron!</li>
    <li> Love this product, this would be my second one. Works great and smoothness hair to a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling/straightening iron. I was so afraid when I agreed to this longer style I wouldn&#x27;t have time to style it every morning. I have very thick hair and I can style it now in about 10 minutes. I was also surprised that it made my hair feel softer ;)</li>
    <li> My wife did not think too much of this. I bought it for her as a gift. She tried it a few times and then asked that I return it.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Make my hair shine and soft. If u have damaged hair I promise you it will help it feel better. U won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is unmanageable. Guess I have to learn to use it.</li>
    <li> My first one I bought lasted over 4 yrs and I loved it. I bought it at bed and bath,,,,It finally gave up on me...Hoping this one will last this long</li>
    <li> Received in great condition. Product, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with my hair. Not as flat as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
    <li> It takes me around 20-30 minutes to straighten my hair with a regular flat iron, but with this it usually takes less than 10! It keeps me frizz free all day. I don&#x27;t know how I lived before this! The only thing that I have noticed is that after only 2 uses the bristles became malformed. It&#x27;s now been about 3 weeks, and I think I&#x27;m going to have to replace them already. But unless you have especially thick hair (like me), I doubt this would be a problem.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of not needing the hair dryer. I am still learning how to use it. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and its performance</li>
    <li> Absolutely Wonderful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have Naturally Thick, Coils and the Curling Iron is FANTASTIC for my hair, WET OR DRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> I use it with dry hair as well. It leaves my hair straight. I have&#x27;t tried using it as a curling iron though I&#x27;m not sure how it is. Easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Not exactly as described. With my long hair I&#x27;d never try to use this without the roots being completely dry. Still a great product when used correctly. Just be careful of heat damage!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair. I love this product for the cool curls (tight or wavy) that I can do. My curls are bouncy and sleek. Honestly, I&#x27;m not so fond of using this product as a flat iron. I think I can get better results with my other products. I&#x27;ve honestly never have (or would) use this on my wet hair. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s such a good idea and I would recommend drying your hair completely before use. I will say that this product takes some getting used to. Its very easy and likely to burn yourself. I found the anti-burn training attachment to be a bit silly and useless. You can&#x27;t use this piece if you want to curl your hair, which is what I mainly use this product for. To conclude, my aunt (who is a professional hairdresser and salon owner) said of this product: &amp;#34;This is why people don&#x27;t come to the salons anymore. You can get salon results at home.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an American living in Germany and I ordered the wrong voltage so now I must return it. I never even got to try it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, straightens hair perfectly</li>
    <li> I love the instyler wet to dry! I think if you use it properly (not have sopping wet hair) its super effective! I have medium hair that&#x27;s super coarse and without a ton of miracle products there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s getting blow dried smooth. With this tool I can just do a couple swipes half air dried and I&#x27;m done in less than 30 minutes. Where was this thing when I was in middle school? LOL. You can do so many different styles AFTER you get the hang of how to hold it and swipe it through your hair. Remember to use a heat protectant and the right level of heat for your hair... yes it comes with a guide but that&#x27;s not a one size fits all either!! I usually let me hair air dry until barely damp, then run this through my hair. I have no damage from it! Don&#x27;t leave it on your hair for too long either. I liked mine so much I bought 1 for my mom and have suggested it to my friends of all hair types!</li>
    <li> I love the InStyler!  It is head and shoulders better than a flat iron (in my opinion) because it created silky straight hair with bounce and body without crushing my ends or leaving a burnt smell.  Because I have very thick, very curly hair, I did let my hair air dry before using the InStyler (even though this is the Wet to Dry model).  I tried a less expensive brand before which provided okay results, but the InStyler is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I saw some videos o youtube of people who tried it before I purchased it. It did not work the way I expected, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product it burns your hair way faster then other products. I would stick to other straighteners and curlers</li>
    <li> Not bad for all in one tool. Need longer time for curls maybe my hair is thick. Surely need more than 1 pass for wet hair.</li>
    <li> The BEST hair styling product I have purchased to date, well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this overall, though it does not dry in one pass, at least in my hair. I am not a frequent shopper for personal grooming products, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it. Generally it takes 3-4 passes through each area of my hair to dry and straighten. This is still fast enough that I like it for times where I actually have time to do something for me.</li>
    <li> The instyler wet to dry rotating is really good.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as expectes.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. Can&#x27;t live without it! Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage hair.</li>
    <li> Fiancee has no complaints</li>
    <li> My daughter has one of these and loves hers, so I decided to purchase one to see how I like it. Love it. I like the fact that it can dry and straighten and curl my hair even when it&#x27;s wet and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. This is an amazing product. The brush detangles as well.</li>
    <li> this styler gave me much silkier and longer lasting results than a flat iron.  It is easier to use and gives me much longer lasting results than straightening with a round brush while blow-drying AS LONG AS my hair was dry or almost so to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it with towel-dried hair the outcome was disappointing and short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just blow dry your hair quickly then use the Instyler or wait till your hair air dies.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for wet to dry use, but I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it as a stand alone flat iron. I usually use the InStyler to go from wet to dry and finish off with my other flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is my go-to hair straightener.  Don&#x27;t bother with the regular one.  I have that one too, but this is the only one you will need.</li>
    <li> InStyler Wet To Dry Rotating Iron&lt;br /&gt;original case, unused, undamaged, unopened, highly recommended, works very good.</li>
    <li> I loved it ! Using this makes my hair look like I went to the salon.</li>
