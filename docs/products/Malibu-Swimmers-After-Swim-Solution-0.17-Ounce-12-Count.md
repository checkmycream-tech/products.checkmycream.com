      <li>Love this product.  </li>

      <li>This is remarkable with the first use.  </li>
      <li>I swim every day and this product is great for renewing hair that has been exposed to a constant barrage of chlorine in the pool.</li>
      <li>This product is not the same Malibu treatment they do in the salon, but it works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>However, once I tried this product, her hair instantly was restored to its natural beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Nice to get this product in a larger package.</li>
      <li>This product did exactly what it was supposed to.  </li>

      <li>None of them worked and many of them were very harsh on their hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair suffers greatly for it.  </li>
      <li>My daughters swim a lot and this product really helps get the extra build up out of their hair.</li>
      <li>It helps, but even frequent use did not eliminate the residue of pool chemical while swimming 3 times per week.</li>
      <li>Without this treatment, her hair becomes lifeless, flat, and very greasy looking.  </li>
      <li>This product is the only product that took my children&#x27;s white-blonde hair back to normal after a summer of swimming in the pool.  </li>

<li> This product is the only product that took my children&#x27;s white-blonde hair back to normal after a summer of swimming in the pool.  </li>
<li> I have tried countless &amp;#34;swimmers&amp;#34; treatments for the removal of the green tinge from my blonde daughters&#x27; hair:  Every clarifying shampoo and every home treatment.  </li>
<li> We all have white blonde hair, and I have shelves of shampoo with promises to take green away that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> The green in my daughter&#x27;s very blonde hair was dripping out onto white towels!  </li>
<li> The conditioner is not extremely moisturizing but does the job on an everyday basis.</li>
<li> I only use half a packet on her hair and that works, so I get 24 uses from the box of 12 packets.</li>
<li> We have tried the cheaper products but they left her hair dry and dingy with a tint of green.</li>
<li> After only one use, every hint of green was gone from my girls&#x27; hair!  </li>
<li> However, you should be aware that the product will remove temporary dyes, and that it will leave your hair with an unpleasant sulfur-like odor for about a week with daily washing.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any odor like a previous poster.</li>
<li> You do have to repeat a few nights if the hair has a lot (which my daughter&#x27;s did), but it&#x27;s gets a lot lighter green each and every time.</li>
<li> This product takes the green away along with moisturizes her hair.</li>
<li> Her hair was green as a result.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and less green!  </li>
<li> My daughter has incredibly thick, course hair that is porous and soaks up everything including chlorine and other pool chemicals.  </li>
<li> She is an active swimmer, at least 3 times a week.</li>
<li> I noticed an immediate difference that lasted for at least 2 months.  </li>
<li> For me, I think this product would be beneficial if I used it at least once a week.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but WORKS!  </li>

    <li> It was a gift for my daughter who loves the product</li>
    <li> My daughter has incredibly thick, course hair that is porous and soaks up everything including chlorine and other pool chemicals.  Without this treatment, her hair becomes lifeless, flat, and very greasy looking.  This product really helps to prevent this chemical build up.    Our hairdresser sold it. but it was cheaper on line.</li>
    <li> My daughter has white blonde hair that turns bright green after swimming. This is the only product that easily removes the green on first use!  It&#x27;s expensive, but WORKS!  I only use half a packet on her hair and that works, so I get 24 uses from the box of 12 packets.</li>
    <li> This product is the only product that took my children&#x27;s white-blonde hair back to normal after a summer of swimming in the pool.  I tried many different shampoos/treatments and nothing else worked like the Malibu Crystals!</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has worked for both of my daughters and myself.  We all have white blonde hair, and I have shelves of shampoo with promises to take green away that didn&#x27;t work.  This is remarkable with the first use.  My hairdresser told me to use it with a shower cap and hest from a hair dryer and follow with a deep conditioner also with heat.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and less green!  Much cheaper here than in the store.</li>
    <li> This product is not the same Malibu treatment they do in the salon, but it works fairly well.  Since I teach swimming lessons as a job, I am in the pool 20 hours a week.  My hair suffers greatly for it.  For me, I think this product would be beneficial if I used it at least once a week.  Take note that you will have to deep condition your hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so blonde that it is almost white. We have a pool that we use daily. Her hair was green as a result. However, once I tried this product, her hair instantly was restored to its natural beautiful color. I use it on her two to three times per week and it keeps her hair blonde.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  The green in my daughter&#x27;s very blonde hair was dripping out onto white towels!  You do have to repeat a few nights if the hair has a lot (which my daughter&#x27;s did), but it&#x27;s gets a lot lighter green each and every time.</li>
    <li> I swim every day and this product is great for renewing hair that has been exposed to a constant barrage of chlorine in the pool. I use it weekly, plus the shampoo and conditioner. Great for avid swimmers. I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless &amp;#34;swimmers&amp;#34; treatments for the removal of the green tinge from my blonde daughters&#x27; hair:  Every clarifying shampoo and every home treatment.  None of them worked and many of them were very harsh on their hair.  I had just about given up hope when I found this miracle treatment.  After only one use, every hint of green was gone from my girls&#x27; hair!  I&#x27;ve ordered the daily shampoo and conditioner along with this weekly treatment and I&#x27;m hopeful we can swim the whole summer without fear of green hair.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it was supposed to.  It removed copper and build-up from my hair, making my hair softer, more manageable, and easier to style with heat.  I noticed an immediate difference that lasted for at least 2 months.  However, you should be aware that the product will remove temporary dyes, and that it will leave your hair with an unpleasant sulfur-like odor for about a week with daily washing.</li>
    <li> Seems like you need to do several treatments to make a difference in removing the chlorine</li>
    <li> Seems tobe working as advertised.</li>
    <li> It helps, but even frequent use did not eliminate the residue of pool chemical while swimming 3 times per week.</li>
    <li> Nice to get this product in a larger package. Works great.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Leaves your hair free of chlorine and soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Restored my daughter&#x27;s brittle swim team hair!!</li>
    <li> My daughter does not cut her hair as it is her glory from The Lord. She is an active swimmer, at least 3 times a week. We have tried the cheaper products but they left her hair dry and dingy with a tint of green. This product takes the green away along with moisturizes her hair. The conditioner is not extremely moisturizing but does the job on an everyday basis.</li>
    <li> My daughters swim a lot and this product really helps get the extra build up out of their hair. It&#x27;s much more manageable now and softer. I didn&#x27;t notice any odor like a previous poster. My two daughters can share one packet so I get 24 uses from this 12-pack. The cost is MUCH better online. My salon sold it for $3.50 a packet. Online, I paid about $1.32 a packet.</li>
    <li> I love this product and my hair is in better condition after swimming!  I plan to continue to use Malibu.</li>
