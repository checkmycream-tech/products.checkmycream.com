      <li>Here is a followup to my original review: I have been using Prosacea for well over six months now and my complexion is still looking great.</li>
      <li>Very strong stuff.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best treatment for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I started Prosacea about a month ago and am REALLY pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>am I glad I did.  </li>
      <li>, this is the next best thing...</li>
      <li>I do not want to disparage this product, as it may be beneficial to many, but it did not seem to help my rosacea.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>how many compliments I get on my complexion.  </li>
      <li>Monday, two days later, I ran into a friend and she commented on how wonderful my skin looked.  </li>
      <li>But I kept on keepen&#x27; on, and it&#x27;s getting better, the bumps are going away.</li>
      <li>and I love to go on the beach.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This product is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>and I love to go on the beach.</li>
      <li>but i think i started becoming immune to it, and it can get costly.</li>
      <li>who claimed that she basically cured her rosacea over the course of a week by using a mask made of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, applied for about 10 minutes twice a day but most importantly at night before bed.  </li>
      <li>may be a strong remedy for this condition.  </li>
      <li>I have had excellent results using the product to tone down my redness associated with rosacea.</li>
      <li>made a huge difference for me).  </li>
      <li>Now I am using it only before bed and my skin is great, though it&#x27;s summer</li>
      <li>When I saw Prosacea and discovered it was available without a prescription I decided to give it a try, too.</li>
      <li>Now I am using it only before bed and my skin is great, though it&#x27;s summer</li>
      <li>Basically, I am symptom free....</li>
      <li>I have suffered with rosacea for the past 13 years, and Metrogel used to work wonderfully for me... until it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>After reading so many positive customer reviews, I ordered a box</li>
      <li>I wish they would make it in a larger size, then I may be more apt to use it more often, even though I don&#x27;t really need to.</li>
      <li>My eye is better thanks to a caring ophthalmologist, by the way.</li>
      <li>So I went to a dermatologist and was told that I had \\&quot;mild rosacea.\\</li>
      <li>but it is mild and, after a while, becomes unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>Well, I was having a mild rosacea flare up.</li>
      <li>My verdict is: if you have any symptoms of rosacea, give this a try and see if it doesn&#x27;t improve your complexion quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m obviously still very satisfied with it, and I hope it will work as well for you.</li>
      <li>Now for most people, these mites never pose a problem because the human immune system is capable of regulating them on its own.  </li>
      <li>WITHIN 24 HOURS I WAS MUCH IMPROVED!!</li>
      <li>Prosacea is homeopathic, gentle and free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I got a few VBeam laser treatments and thought \\&quot;Great</li>
      <li>But for those of you in the middle, give it a little more than a week, and I think you will be happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I am not afraid to leave the house without makeup on for the first time in 6 years.  </li>
      <li>I just had a back surgery, and after being pumped full of antibiotics and cortisone, my skin looked glorious!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m consistently able to scoop out an extra week&#x27;s worth of gel this way.  </li>
      <li>At first, my skin broke out like hell descended upon my face.</li>
      <li>i also liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell and there is absolutely no stinging</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but for me, it does work pretty well.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine how fabulous it will be after another week!</li>
      <li>I suppose if I used it twice daily as the directions state I would probably have even better results.</li>
      <li>The stinging has almost stopped except for the nose area, and the redness is almost 100% gone, as well as the overall \\&quot;itchiness\\&quot; from the latest flare.  </li>
      <li>I love it, my only regret is that i didn&#x27;t find it sooner!</li>
      <li>I was using it twice a day first two month.</li>
      <li>Took about a week to really show results, but well worth the wait.    </li>
      <li>For the first month, I applied Prosacea morning and night.  </li>
      <li>I only put it on cheeks and chin now, and don&#x27;t notice the smell any more.       </li>
      <li>My face looks better now than it has in several years.  </li>
      <li>I was using it twice a day first two month.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Prosacea!     </li>
      <li>It has helped so much!</li>
      <li>, your face is sooo smooth!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used a whole bunch of products, you name it from cheap to expensive products and this is by far the BEST!!</li>
      <li>I barely write reviews but for the sake of beauty and helping others acknowledge this fine product, here it goes.</li>
      <li>Now here&#x27;s the really interesting (and gross) part: apparently, many people&#x27;s rosacea is caused by something called DEMODEX MITES--microscopic insects that live on all human beings&#x27; faces, eating the oil our pores produce.  </li>
      <li>After the first application, I thought I could really see a difference.</li>
      <li>You know how you search for a certain product on Amazon</li>
      <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and have recently been diagnosed with Rosacea, which I believe was induced by the YEARS &amp; YEARS of application of steroid creams prescribed by my doctor for a mild condition of Seb Derm!</li>
      <li>This cream really works.  </li>
      <li>So, I went straight to Target and bought the Prosacea.  </li>
      <li>I was elated that results were noticeable that fast.  </li>
      <li>I am really psyched to have found this.  </li>
      <li>The instructions that come with each box are really informative.  </li>
      <li>To see my complexion a healthy, clear pink hue makes this product worth it.  </li>
      <li>now, of course there are some days when you don&#x27;t use enough...or you wash you face too much, but,</li>
      <li>It took about a week to really see results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m beaming with thanks for having found this product here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>That, to me, really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>It controls my rosacea much better than the more modern and super expensive Metrogel that is normally prescribed.     </li>
      <li>Other blemish treatments I tried aggrivated my skin and made the redness more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>i saw a commercial about this product and was so excited about trying it.</li>
      <li>Finally, Finacea got my rosacea under relative control, but it never got any better than a certain point.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Ive had terribly acne since I was 11 years old! I have tried a million things! I&#x27;ve wasted so much money! The only thing that ever helped was Accutane, and they make you quit taking it after a while and the effects were not completely long lasting afterwards. I was left with moderate acne and the redness I&#x27;ve had forever. I decided to pick this up at the drug store because i remembered my mother has rosacea, and Ive read rosacea can be misdiagnosed as acne because of the pimples that come with it. I must have been diagnosed after all these years... Because this product did wonders! You cannot find it in the acne or face wash section, it will be separate from that, at least a walgreens it was separate completely way far away. $10 bucks for a small tube that will change your life! It goes on as a gel, not oily or anything! It is matifying you could, and I myself do, wear it under makeup! Does not dry me out, and because i already have very oily skin I was VERY pleased to find it keeps my face a little less oily throughout the day and it keeps shine redness and blemishes away! I love it, my only regret is that i didn&#x27;t find it sooner!</li>
    <li> After the first application, I thought I could really see a difference. I&#x27;ve now been using it a week and my face feels like it is on fire!  My rosacea is worse and my skin is so dry.  Very strong stuff.</li>
    <li> My rosacea was so bad that it went into my right eye and caused me no end of trouble.  I have no health insurance so I couldn&#x27;t pay for the prescription medication to treat my rosacea, either.  I found this in the grocery store (it has since disappeared) and it HELPS!  There is still a touch of redness and drying but the bumps are gone.  I treat the dryness with a face moisturizer.  My eye is better thanks to a caring ophthalmologist, by the way.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews of anything, but this product has changed my mind. I am a 52-year-old man and have had rosacea my entire adult life. It started out as acne when I was a teenager, then progressed to the rosacea stage later on, with much less acne. I have tried oral antibiotics, gels, lotions, and all of these were dermatologist prescribed. I even tried Murad products. Some treatments improved my complexion a little, some made my rosacea flare up even worse. When I saw Prosacea and discovered it was available without a prescription I decided to give it a try, too. Well...what a surprise. After just a few days the redness was diminished, and after almost a month now, my rosacea symptoms are all but history. I just can&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in that stuff, but it works for me. I am completely satisfied with it. There is no odor, no greasiness as with some ointments. In fact, after applying it seems to tighten and smooth everything a little, and I have found that I receive all the benefits even using it once daily, in the morning. I suppose if I used it twice daily as the directions state I would probably have even better results. I guess I just wanted to make the tube last longer. I wish they would make it in a larger size, then I may be more apt to use it more often, even though I don&#x27;t really need to. My verdict is: if you have any symptoms of rosacea, give this a try and see if it doesn&#x27;t improve your complexion quickly. Thanks, Prosacea!     Here is a followup to my original review: I have been using Prosacea for well over six months now and my complexion is still looking great. I only use it every other day now--in the mornings--and that seems to be often enough to keep the redness away. I&#x27;m obviously still very satisfied with it, and I hope it will work as well for you.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review in the hopes that this information will help others the same as it helped me rid myself of this depressing condition, instead of just trying to suppress the symptoms with Prosacea or antibiotics that will never truly cure you.    About a year ago I came down with a strange stinging redness on my face that would come and go depending on the frequency of certain \\&quot;triggers\\&quot;--e.g., when I drank lots of coffee or took cold showers.  I came down with it at a time when I was under major emotional stress and consequently developed a few other weird health problems as well.  The redness would come on like a mask and last for a few days and then slowly fade but never completely go away.  So I went to a dermatologist and was told that I had \\&quot;mild rosacea.\\&quot;  I got a few VBeam laser treatments and thought \\&quot;Great, I&#x27;m cured!\\&quot;  No such luck--the redness creeped back again in a few months.  I did a little research and found, to my dismay, that I appeared to be a textbook case: early thirties, Irish/English ancestry, etc.  So I believed everything I read about there being \\&quot;no cure\\&quot; and thought, I&#x27;m screwed.  I&#x27;m stuck with this thing for life.  I bought a tube a Prosacea and it worked reasonably well to calm the redness, but again, the redness and stinging never completely went away.  Then I came across a comment posted by a woman named Gabriella Getzko on a New York Times article about natural remedies for rosacea (search for it!) who claimed that she basically cured her rosacea over the course of a week by using a mask made of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, applied for about 10 minutes twice a day but most importantly at night before bed.  So I thought, what the heck, I have nothing to lose.  I tried it just as she described. And guess what: IT WORKED!  Day by day, just as she described, my redness shrunk and shrunk into the center of my face until it was gone.  AMAZING, I thought.  But I still couldn&#x27;t understand--why was this happening to me?  So I continued reading.  Now here&#x27;s the really interesting (and gross) part: apparently, many people&#x27;s rosacea is caused by something called DEMODEX MITES--microscopic insects that live on all human beings&#x27; faces, eating the oil our pores produce.  Now for most people, these mites never pose a problem because the human immune system is capable of regulating them on its own.  For other people, however, the mites are somehow able to reproduce out of control all over the face, irritating it terribly in the process.  There have been studies done that show that rosacea is more common in people with WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEMS, as I had for years.  So that&#x27;s why the peroxide and baking soda worked so well--it was killing off all the mites that were irritating my face!  And now for the CAUSE: the immune system is directly affected by our DIET.  When we eat too many foods that have an \\&quot;acidic\\&quot; effect on our body our immune system suffers as a result.  These \\&quot;acidic\\&quot; foods include just about everything besides fruits and vegetables (i.e., the modern American diet) and ESPECIALLY COFFEE!  That&#x27;s why my rosacea would get so much worse during times when I would drink large amounts of coffee.  On the other hand, our immune system becomes stronger when we eat proper amounts of \\&quot;alkaline\\&quot; foods--i.e., fruits and vegetables (especially dark greens).  If you don&#x27;t believe me, do some research for yourself!  There is a ton of information out there about the major negative health effects we suffer as the result of eating too many acidic foods, and Amazon has many books about how to maintain a proper \\&quot;Alkaline Diet.\\&quot;  It is also possible that you have something toxic in your body that is keeping your immune system burdened down--e.g., mercury (from fish or dental fillings), lead, etc.  Look for information online on how to test for metal toxicity.  So here is my suggestion to you to try in the hopes that you can rid yourself of this affliction as I have:  1) Start using the mask of peroxide and baking soda twice a day as described by \\&quot;Gabriella Getzko\\&quot; in the comments of NY Times piece about natural remedies for rosacea (do a search).  I have also read that APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, both ingested and applied topically to one&#x27;s face may be a strong remedy for this condition.  2) Start researching about demodex mites, candida and metal toxicity and their role in rosacea.  3) Start researching about acidic and alkaline foods and change your diet accordingly (drinking wheatgrass powder mix every day made a huge difference for me).  I hope this information helps you as it helped me!!  Please spread it around, and post a comment to this review!</li>
    <li> Well, I was having a mild rosacea flare up. I just had a back surgery, and after being pumped full of antibiotics and cortisone, my skin looked glorious!! Then as that wore off, of course my rosacea went into action. After back surgery and being on all kinds of medications, I didn&#x27;t really have the time or energy or ability to go to the dermatologist, so after seeing a commercial for Prosacea on TV I thought I would try it.    I decided a few months ago, to quit using anything with any type of acidic product in it, such as glycolic or salicylic acids, ot anything that says rejuvenating. Please forgive my spelling. Anyway, I use CeraVe regular face wash for regular to oily skin, and the CeraVe moisturizing lotion.    So, I wash, dry thoroughly, apply a light coating of the Prosacea, wait for that to dry, my skin feels tight, and then moisturize.    I had no stinging during the application of the Prosacea, I also don&#x27;t notice the sulpher smell. At first, my skin broke out like hell descended upon my face. Although, I did notice my pores were getting smaller YAY, breakouts BOO. It was all those oily bumps you get that only rosacea suffers know. But I kept on keepen&#x27; on, and it&#x27;s getting better, the bumps are going away. It&#x27;s just taking some time. I think it&#x27;s from the pore tightening that caused the initial massive breakout, and then once that is over, I will have smaller pores and less breakouts and flareups.     So, I&#x27;m happy for those of you that this product worked for instantly, and those of you that it burns and itches, I&#x27;m sorry. But for those of you in the middle, give it a little more than a week, and I think you will be happy with the results. I am. An over the counter product that actually makes your pores smaller. That Rules!</li>
    <li> I have had moderate rosacea for about 6 years. Flare ups can be bad at times.  I went to dermatoligists who kept switching my medications because according to them, you body gets immune to the meds.  Well I fell upon this product at my local supermarket next to skin antiseptics.  I purchased it out of desperation and boy am I glad I did.  This is by far the best treatment for my skin.  I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks and how many compliments I get on my complexion.  This is the only product I use for my Rosacea now!  I think dermatologists must know this product works but they want you to keep going back to them..Try it..It is incredible!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have tried a lot of products for rosacea.  Prosacea works.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost 6 months. I have bought it two times. GREAT PRICE TOO - 2 Tubes for @$18.00.  Each tube lasts for about a month.      My rosacea was getting to the point where it was so dry and red that it hurt.  I tried al kinds of products for red, irritated skin.  This is the only product I found that helped.    I will buy this product for as long as I have roasacea!    Take CAre,  Debby</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  It took about a week to really see results.  My rosacea was brought on by intense hot flashes due to menopause.  Now I use it twice a day and I feel like a new woman.</li>
    <li> This product is GRATE!    I have rosacea and I tried few products ( which were pretty expensive ones) and prescription medication, which was recommended by my doctor. They were working, but Prosecea is indeed working even better and the good part about it is the price and the fact that you don&#x27;t need prescription. I was using it twice a day first two month. My symptoms ( redness, rush) almost disappear already in a week  after using Prosecea. Now I am using it only before bed and my skin is great, though it&#x27;s summer and I love to go on the beach. I love it!     I have rosacea and I tried few products ( which were pretty expensive ones) and prescription medication, which was recommended by my doctor.

    <li> This stuff is top-notch. My redness is almost entirely gone, and probably will be all gone soon. (I thought I was going to live the rest of my life with discoloration.)</li>
    <li> I happened to spot this while at the drugstore, and decided what the heck.  I have suffered with rosacea for the past 13 years, and Metrogel used to work wonderfully for me... until it didn&#x27;t.  In the past few years I&#x27;ve tried several different prescription meds to no avail.  Finally, Finacea got my rosacea under relative control, but it never got any better than a certain point.  After a couple weeks of using prosacea there was a noticable difference in the bumps and redness on my face.  My face looks better now than it has in several years.  I still use the Finacea every morning, and I use the prosacea every night.  There is a slight odor to this product, but I hardly notice it any more.  It does dry your face a little, but I just use a damp washcloth once a week to kind of buff off the dry skin, and then apply Cetaphil cream.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but for me, it does work pretty well.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MGXMUM Prosacea Rosacea Treatment, Gel, 0.75 Ounces (Pack of 2)]]  I have used Prosacea for 6 months now, and it is the only product that I have tried that keeps my face looking clear.  The expensive prescription I tried just made it worse!  As long as I wash my face well and apply it twice a day, my face stays clear.  It is not a cure, as I tried backing off on how often I applied it, and my rosacea started coming back.  You do not have to use a lot of it, though, as a tube lasts me about 3 months, not the 30 days that I had read about.</li>
    <li> I do not want to disparage this product, as it may be beneficial to many, but it did not seem to help my rosacea. Also, when I had it on my skin I could constantly smell the sulfur it contains, which was rather unpleasant, not to mention irritating to my sinuses.  I was disappointed, because I am always on the lookout for a low cost rosacea treatment, and the price was right for this one!</li>
    <li> I have had excellent results using the product to tone down my redness associated with rosacea.</li>
    <li> This is most definately the BEST rosacea treatment I have ever used.  It didn&#x27;t totally take away the redness, but it did eliminate the dry, flakey skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other products like Proactive and they work for about a week with me and then my rosacea is back.  This has not happened with this product.  I am not afraid to leave the house without makeup on for the first time in 6 years.  I cannot say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> I have very minor redness on my chin. After I used it for 2 days, my condition got worse. I don&#x27;t know why bot I stop using it.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have recently been diagnosed with Rosacea, which I believe was induced by the YEARS &amp; YEARS of application of steroid creams prescribed by my doctor for a mild condition of Seb Derm! The doctor never told me that repeated use of steroids could INDUCE ROSACEA!! On a number of occasions lately, as I searched the stores for a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; to whatever was going on with my face, I had seen this product on the shelf at Target, but didn&#x27;t believe it would work - because nothing else I had purchsed OTC had worked so far....The redness and rash I was experiencing had gotten much worse over the last month. I needed relief, badly.  I saw the derm doctor for the 2nd time in a month (brought pictures this time to prove how bad my face had been) and she finally put me on oral antibiotics, but also gave me samples of yet another steroid cream, some MetroGel and Finecea.  I tried each one in a small area and they all burned like crazy!!  So, I went straight to Target and bought the Prosacea.  WITHIN 24 HOURS I WAS MUCH IMPROVED!! Honestly, my face even felt better IMMEDIATELY!! The stinging has almost stopped except for the nose area, and the redness is almost 100% gone, as well as the overall \\&quot;itchiness\\&quot; from the latest flare.  I can only imagine how fabulous it will be after another week! My skin had gotten sooooo sensitive that I could only use Purpose soap and there was no moisturizer out there that did not burn like crazy. Don&#x27;t wait - go buy this BEFORE you see your doctor!!  At least give it a try first; you have nothing but about $10 to lose!  Hurry and get relief for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> After being diagnosed with Rosacea I tried the antibiotic cream that the dermatologist recommended, but it did very little.  This cream really works.  I use it in the morning and before bed, with a natural, oilfree cleanser from the health store.  My problem is so much better using this product!  I was amazed, and still am.  An oral antibiotic is the only other thing that clears it up completely, this is the next best thing... We all know you can&#x27;t stay on an antibiotic.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my girlfriend. It seemed that none of the prescription medications were working for her anymore, including the pills she was prescribed. I saw this and figured there&#x27;s nothing to lose by trying it. Within a few days of using it there was a dramatic difference in her face. No more rash, no more dry skin. It was amazing. I would recommend this to anyone with rosacea. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I barely write reviews but for the sake of beauty and helping others acknowledge this fine product, here it goes. My face, mainly the T-zone is a bit red everyday. I use makeup over it but it still doesn&#x27;t mean that the redness has gone away really. You know how you search for a certain product on Amazon and it also lists recommendations of other products? Well, I am so glad I found this product! I received the shipment fairly quick and started using it the next morning. Immediately, my skin felt tight(in a good way) and the redness had gone down with dramatic results! A few days later, my skin also felt and I guess looked smooth because my Fiance was like \\&quot;Hon, your face is sooo smooth!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used a whole bunch of products, you name it from cheap to expensive products and this is by far the BEST!! I even put this on my \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; for it to come every 2 months. The price is good considering it works although I do wish the size comes in a bigger package but one tube is enough to last a month or two depending on the amount you use. Overall, I am actually wearing this product now and am glad to say I would highly recommend PROSACEA. It&#x27;s awesome that Amazon sells it here.</li>
    <li> Took about a week to really show results, but well worth the wait.    My redness has gone, my skin looks great - great product.    Just use plenty of it (I was a little to sparing at the start I think) - and give it a week to start showing improvements.    I will be using this product if/when my skin flares up again - but so far it&#x27;s a 100% cure.</li>
    <li> I have had soem form of dry skin/rosacea type skin for a while.  One day it started getting worse and nothing I did would calm it down...not one thing.    Until this stuff, that is.  The effects of using prosacea were almost immediate...seriously!  Basically, I am symptom free....now, of course there are some days when you don&#x27;t use enough...or you wash you face too much, but, man...this stuff is awesome....    I can&#x27;t recommend it enough...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mid-40s woman with lifelong acne and in the last few years worsening rosacea.  I have also been on every topical and oral antibiotic or gel that has come out, and never got lasting results.      I started Prosacea about a month ago and am REALLY pleased with the results. The acne part of acne rosacea is really minimal now, and the redness is diminished too. I use it once a day and it has not made my skin the least bit dry or irritated (unlike retin-a, benzoyl peroxide, accutane, etc.)    I didn&#x27;t like the sulfur smell either...until I realized that there is really no need to apply it around my nostrils as I had been doing. I only put it on cheeks and chin now, and don&#x27;t notice the smell any more.       I am really psyched to have found this.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but the results are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have real sensitive acne rosacea and sulfur turns my skin neon pink for like 3 days. This stuff was a disaster on my face. Do a test patch on your skin first, you don&#x27;t want to be neon pink, its no fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s fantastic!  People have been commenting on the improvement of my complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pimples throughout my adult life, not realizing it was actually rosacea.  A couple years ago, one of my cheeks turned red (almost purple at times), and over the course of several  months, the redness spread to my nose and to the other cheek.  Other blemish treatments I tried aggrivated my skin and made the redness more pronounced.  I learned to NEVER use ProActive on rosacea!  I began studying about rosacea and was mortified to learn that, left untreated, it gradually grows worse and can eventually swell and deform one&#x27;s features.  It doesn&#x27;t go away on its own.    I&#x27;m beaming with thanks for having found this product here on Amazon.  After reading so many positive customer reviews, I ordered a box and I began treatment that Saturday.  Monday, two days later, I ran into a friend and she commented on how wonderful my skin looked.  I was elated that results were noticeable that fast.  (If Prosacea is not available here on Amazon, check your local drug store or market.  Our small-town grocery store now carries it.)  For the first month, I applied Prosacea morning and night.  Now I apply it in the morning only.  The gel absorbs comfortably and has no noticeable odor, at least not to me.  When I reach the end of a Prosacea tube and no more will squeeze out, I cut the tube in half.  I&#x27;m consistently able to scoop out an extra week&#x27;s worth of gel this way.  That, to me, really makes a difference.  A single tube lasts me nearly a month, and each box contains two tubes.  Rosacea sufferers need to make a few lifestyle changes in order to help manage this skin disorder.  A few no-no&#x27;s are: hot drinks, spicy foods, direct sunlight, strenuous exercise--anything that causes the face to flush. Stress, inadequate sleep, and some soaps &amp; cosmetics can also cause flare-ups.  Occasionally I still blow it and my face reddens some, but learning these tips has been helpful.  The instructions that come with each box are really informative.  Prosacea is homeopathic, gentle and free of harmful chemicals.  I like this since our skin is porous and to some degree absorbs what we put on it.  To see my complexion a healthy, clear pink hue makes this product worth it.  Now that I&#x27;ve experienced the difference, I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.  UPDATE:  I could not be more thrilled with a product!!  My rosacea symptoms are all but gone.  I now apply Prosacea only when I get an occasional outbreak of redness or a little acne.  Within a day or two, my complexion is clear again.  From what I&#x27;ve been through with rosacea and how drastically this product has healed my skin, I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> What can I say, Prosacea is an excellent product. It controls my rosacea much better than the more modern and super expensive Metrogel that is normally prescribed.     There is a smell to it but it is mild and, after a while, becomes unnoticeable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with Roeasea. I have been to two different dermatoligists, have had a few different prescrition gels/creams and none really helped. My face was just getting worse and worse.The only thing that really helps is when I take an oral antibodics, but how often can you do that? A couple months ago I found PROSACEA. I use it twice a day. It has helped so much! It has improved the reddness, but it has not totally disappeared. But the bumps and dryness were gone after just a few days. My skin feels amazing.I recommend this to anyone that has Roeasea. When I do get an occasional bump I put it on an additional time and it disappears literally in a day.</li>
    <li> This actually made my rosacea worse. If you have a regime that works for you, think twice  before you buy this product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been suffering with rosacea for 12 years and have tried just about everything including homemade recipes. i&#x27;ve been to several dermatoligists and was prescribed antibiotics each time but i think i started becoming immune to it, and it can get costly. i saw a commercial about this product and was so excited about trying it. it wasn&#x27;t the miracle cream i was looking for but if you use as directed, a few times a day...it does make a difference. it tones down the redness and stopped alot of the flaking. i also liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell and there is absolutely no stinging AND i can afford it. i wear alot of makeup and i wear it over this product everyday and haven&#x27;t had any effects on the makeup. if you suffer from this frustrating skin condition, like i do, i would strongly reccomend it.</li>
