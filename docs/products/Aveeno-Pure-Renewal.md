      <li>Love that i can subscribe and save it</li>
      <li>It seems to be much better for my hair</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>While I love both those products they did not help my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, and the way my hair feels afterwards.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and not at all obnoxious.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild.</li>
      <li>It smells good and leaves my hair softer than normal.</li>
      <li>I switched her to Aveeno pure and we both love it!  </li>
      <li>I conditions just fine.</li>
      <li>Works super for curly hair!</li>
      <li>This conditioner works well and most importantly, makes my hair feel nice &amp; soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoo/conditioner for a while.  </li>
      <li>I tried this conditioner after originally buying it from the store.  </li>
      <li>in general, it is a good product.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job at detangling my long hair - since I don&#x27;t use a brush and use my fingers.  </li>
      <li>Other brands don&#x27;t condition well, or smell very much like medicine-not at all attractive.  </li>
      <li>I have tried shea butter hot treatments and sweet almond oil.  </li>
      <li>I have since stopped using this conditioner, and went on to try things more formulated for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt the difference in my hair right away.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with this product.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this product so more than likely</li>
      <li>I use this primarily for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming like a perfume.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work for heavily damaged hair, but if your hair is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and you just need a conditioner to make it smooth and easy to manage, this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a couple of their shampoos and conditioners, none of them seems to do much for my hair.....</li>
      <li>The main reason I chose this condition is because I was looking for something did not contain sulfate</li>
      <li>Recommend for normal hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is not strong and my husband is fine using it.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy, colored and highlights in my hair.</li>
      <li>It really made no difference at all in my hair, and I was left with masses of tangles.</li>
      <li>She does like the way it conditions and makes her hair soft</li>
      <li>I did not need to use too much of it; a bottle would last me 6 weeks with belly button length hair.</li>
      <li>This makes&lt;br /&gt;my hair as soft and the conditioner that comes with my coloring package.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I used this conditioner for about 6 months, and after that, I found that it didn&#x27;t really condition enough for my hair.</li>
      <li>WOW, my hair was softer after only one use.</li>
      <li>I love the skin Aveeno product, but when it comes to shampoos, I am not happy with it.</li>

    <li> Good stuff.  I felt the difference in my hair right away.  It is non-sulfate so I think it helps preserve you hair color too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner at CVS, because I have a great experience with Aveeno hair products. Unfortunately, this sulfate-free line did not work for me! It really made no difference at all in my hair, and I was left with masses of tangles.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product so more than likely they will probably stop making it in a year or so (just her luck).  She does like the way it conditions and makes her hair soft and I agree.  The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming like a perfume.  in general, it is a good product.  Aveeno is not cheap, but their products work well and are quality.  Amazon had the best price with free shipping to boot.</li>
    <li> Smells great, my daughter has curly/wavy hair, not too great for that.  Her hair has been getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love the skin Aveeno product, but when it comes to shampoos, I am not happy with it. I have tried a couple of their shampoos and conditioners, none of them seems to do much for my hair.....</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner for about 6 months, and after that, I found that it didn&#x27;t really condition enough for my hair. I have thick, curly/wavy hair (2b). It made my hair soft and less frizzy for a while, but then it seemed to stop working. I have since stopped using this conditioner, and went on to try things more formulated for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this conditioner is a little bit thin feeling. I did not need to use too much of it; a bottle would last me 6 weeks with belly button length hair. I did not find that it gave my hair a lot of slip; my did not immediately feel conditioned after I applied it. The scent is very mild.</li>
    <li> This product came to me by ups and even though it was in a plastic bag the caps opened and half of the bottles leaked in bag. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well for my dry, thick, wavy hair. It smells good and leaves my hair softer than normal.</li>
    <li> great sulfate free conditioner. Works super for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love love love. Smells good and my hair feels amazing. Love that i can subscribe and save it</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoo/conditioner for a while.  I started out using Infusium 23, then Loreal Evercreme and now Aveeno.  Of all three conditioners, I love Aveeno&#x27;s!  I love the scent, and the way my hair feels afterwards.  It does a great job at detangling my long hair - since I don&#x27;t use a brush and use my fingers.  I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have been desperate to find something for my dry hair.  I have tried shea butter hot treatments and sweet almond oil.  While I love both those products they did not help my hair.  After reading the reviews I decided to try Aveeno.  WOW, my hair was softer after only one use. For those of you with thick,curly hair (like mine)try Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Detangler really helps get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Aveeno&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelley</li>
    <li> I use this primarily for my 5 year old daughter.  It is hard to find kids conditioner, and her hair really needs it.  I switched her to Aveeno pure and we both love it!  No more tangles for her!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t not leave residue in my hair or on my scalp. I conditions just fine. The scent is not strong and my husband is fine using it. The main reason I chose this condition is because I was looking for something did not contain sulfate and this is sulfate-free.</li>
    <li> Great price for the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for my hair, and it smell delicious. Everyone said this, and I have recommended it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and loves it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well and most importantly, makes my hair feel nice &amp; soft.

    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I have naturally wavy, colored and highlights in my hair. Tends to be dry but not after trying these products. Makes my hair softer than its ever been!</li>
    <li> I started using this product when my hairdresser said my hair was too dry from the product I was using at that time. It seems to be much better for my hair so I don&#x27;t mind the extra expense.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my hair looks amazing! Definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner after originally buying it from the store.  I&#x27;d been looking for a good conditioner to use on my colored hair.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  Other brands don&#x27;t condition well, or smell very much like medicine-not at all attractive.  This makes&lt;br /&gt;my hair as soft and the conditioner that comes with my coloring package.</li>
    <li> It was great though they don&#x27;t give you the deal anymore and that is unfortunate.  Aveeno no longer seems to be any part of the subscribe and save shopping anymore.  I love the project and it is sad to not have the opportunity to purchase anymore.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product and it does wonders on my hair!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with this product. I have used it for about two weeks now, and the dry/brittle feeling I had in my hair is going away.</li>
