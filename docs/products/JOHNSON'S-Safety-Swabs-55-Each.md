      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>There are MUCH safer ways to clean those ears out that can be from home and over the counter remedies to medicated ear drops if absolutely needed.  </li>
      <li>I bought these to clean my 1 1/2 year old&#x27;s ears.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Cons- doesn&#x27;t really help clean that we&#x27;ll due to the circumference of the swab</li>
      <li>I feel so much safer using these on my baby than regular q-tips.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t  hurt the adult ear to use Johnson&#x27;s safety swabs.  </li>

      <li>And is fool proof for us adults not to go to far.</li>
      <li>I really like these for getting boogies out of my little one&#x27;s nose</li>

<li> Putting a foreign body in a child&#x27;s ear  (or an adult ear) is not a good idea no matter how &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; it is...</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> As a pediatrician, this is a mistake I see far to often thanks to awful marketing like this.</li>
<li> No more worries about accidentally going inside the ear canal.  </li>
<li> So ridiculous.</li>

That makes her happier and more willing to sit still through an ear cleaning. It was also a better deal compared to other sellers.  I would definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  hurt the adult ear to use Johnson&#x27;s safety swabs.  Not sticky.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pros- safety&lt;br /&gt;Cons- doesn&#x27;t really help clean that we&#x27;ll due to the circumference of the swab</li>
    <li> When I try to clear my baby&#x27;s nose or ears - he always tries to escape. I always use safety swab so I can be sure I won&#x27;t get too deep if he makes a sudden move.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. They are so thick that they don&#x27;t get down in baby&#x27;s ear far enough to get the wax out. Hell, they don&#x27;t even fit in my ear far enough to clean it out. So ridiculous. Just use regular q tips. they do a much better job</li>
    <li> I bought these with the hope that they will be smaller than regular sized swabs but they are bigger! bought them to try and clean 4 month nose and they wont even fit!</li>
    <li> UGH! People! Q-tips are not supposed to go inside the ear to begin with. As a pediatrician, this is a mistake I see far to often thanks to awful marketing like this. There are MUCH safer ways to clean those ears out that can be from home and over the counter remedies to medicated ear drops if absolutely needed.  Q-tips are only for the outside of ears and those can be washed just as well with a washcloth. Putting a foreign body in a child&#x27;s ear  (or an adult ear) is not a good idea no matter how &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; it is...</li>
    <li> Safety swabs have twice as much cotton on the tip as Q-tip.  Absorb more and are soft going in My ears,</li>
    <li> Good product just very slow to ship</li>
    <li> Great for you and baby.</li>
    <li> I have used these before.  You cannot damage your eardrums or those of your child or pet, if you tried.  Made by J&amp;J, a super provider of medical assists.  I actually bought them for my cat, Cotton Balz, the Li&#x27;l S*** but I have since had a better look inside his ears, and I will rely on the vet to tell me if they are appropriate for him.  But you don&#x27;t need the vet&#x27;s advice to tell you that they will be okay for you and yours.</li>
    <li> Good for ears, nose, and belly button on my little one! :)</li>
    <li> Love these for the kids, you don&#x27;t have to worry about hurting their ear or going too deep.&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for Johnsons:)</li>
    <li> great product for babies</li>
    <li> Perfect but then found them at dollar store for yes, one dollar!</li>
