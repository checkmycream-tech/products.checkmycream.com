<li> An okay quality/not bad</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m careful with it when I wear it</li>
<li> Got it almost three weeks before expected.</li>
<li> Tangles super bad in my hair.</li>
<li> but combs are plain.</li>
<li> I mean I paid less than 5 bucks</li>
<li> It makes me feel like a princess, the combs are just tight enough to hold in my crazy thick hair but it doesn&#x27;t yank, or hurt.</li>
<li> Some reviews said it came broken</li>
<li> and the head band was broken into 3 pieces.</li>

    <li> Gift for my daughter who has waist length hair.  She is going into real estate and needs to do something a little more upscale with it.  She thought it was very unusual and liked a lot.</li>
    <li> very pretty. will wear for next event</li>
    <li> Slightly cheaper quality than I hoped, but for the price it&#x27;s okay and it performs just fine.</li>
    <li> It is not high quality, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re paying for. It looks great and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price!!!! It looks beautiful on my daughter&#x27;s hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. At first I was afraid it would be too small, my head, because I come from other Asian hair band before ordered, often a little &#x27;small, but health is perfect. Every time I wear give praise. I look forward to a thin width, but still looks super cute.</li>
    <li> It broke the second I was putting it in, and I was not being rough with it because I could tell it was delicate (cheap). At least it was literally cheap.</li>
    <li> adorable!!!! is fashion!</li>
    <li> It tarnished after one wear...</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and looks elegant in your hair when wearing a bun. Good quality merchandise and would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> our teenage granddaughter is happy with it! so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I get compliments every time that I wear it!</li>
    <li> Really pretty!! Came earlier than I expected. Some reviews said it came broken so I ordered 2 just in case one broke. They both came unbroken so I gave my sister one. Love it but it does pull hair a bit, especially my curly hair. But it stays in and looks great.</li>
    <li> Very cool! I love the color and ease of using it! You can wear it across your forehead or across the back of your hair since it&#x27;s just combs in goes in either way!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a cute idea! I love it. It did break the first 3 times I put it in but I just attach it right back together and it works like a charm. I mean I paid less than 5 bucks so I can&#x27;t expect much. All&lt;br /&gt;My friends says it&#x27;s cute on!</li>
    <li> Broke when I was looking at it before I even used it.  Took a very long time to have it delivered.</li>

    <li> This was pretty cute and worked well for my Belle Cosplay. I was able to wrap this to compliment my bun well ;) It shipped well and was nice and shiny!</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as i tried to wear it total deception</li>
    <li> Cheap. Tangles super bad in my hair. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it and received it sooner than expected. I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 but combs are plain.</li>
    <li> quality looks better in the picture</li>
    <li> So cute!! Everyone loves my hair jewelry!!!! It makes me feel like a princess, the combs are just tight enough to hold in my crazy thick hair but it doesn&#x27;t yank, or hurt.</li>
    <li> Cute! No problems with the combs staying in but then, I have an Afro lol Nice on my up-do&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t snag which I&#x27;m thankful for.</li>
    <li> Very nice you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> broke the first time i used it</li>

    <li> Super cute to wear, stays in well, and it has a million uses! Feels pretty flimsy so I&#x27;m careful with it when I wear it and I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> It was very pretty while it lasted. It is a lot shorter than I had thought it would be, and it broke on me after about three wears. Very pretty while it lasts, but I definitely won&#x27;t be repurchasing. Shame, it&#x27;s gorgeous in the picture.</li>
    <li> An okay quality/not bad (it&#x27;s okay). I am not sure on how to improve and keep the item light (which it is and I like). My problem for me is that the leaves get stuck in my fine textured hair. People with thicker hair will like this better. It is pretty. I will wear this and consider looking at others that are beads or less likely to get stuck in my hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice. On time delivery</li>
    <li> I was very excited to wear this headband however when it arrived the package had holes in it and the head band was broken into 3 pieces.</li>
    <li> Cute even though it slips out of my hair sometimes. Hair spray however helps the problem.</li>
    <li> Super cute! Now just trying to find the perfect occasion to debut it!</li>
    <li> It came it early. And it&#x27;s so cute. Its worth the price I payed.</li>

    <li> First off I may say I&#x27;m in love with this headband. It was under five dollars. And it is so pretty and fits so nice in your hair. It is cheap but if you take care of this it will last you a long time! Love love love this:))</li>
