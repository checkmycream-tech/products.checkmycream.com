      <li>I was more interested in a conditioning effect from the added ingredients.  </li>

<li> , I AM 44 OF AFRICAN DESCENT, I CHOOSE THIS STRENGTH AND USE IT EVERY OTHER MORNING OR NIGHT IN CONJUCTION WITH RETIN-A AND SCALP STIMULATION.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using less than a month.  </li>
<li> When I first use the product my thin hair after an few day&#x27;s instantly became thicker</li>
<li> been using it for about 3 weeks now, is to early to give an opinion but at least it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy.&lt;br</li>
<li> , I will not report back in a few months with a supplemental review of my progress.  </li>
<li> Item as expected.  </li>
<li> I hope this product doesn&#x27;t get banned by the FDA due to it containing azealic acid, as hairloss is an &#x27;off label use&#x27; for azealic acid.</li>
<li> and that&#x27;s says a lot compared to the other formulas out there that make your hair feel too gunky or scalp</li>
<li> /&gt;The shedding is slightly increased</li>
<li> So about half the price of lipogain.</li>
<li> Drys quickly, no residue.</li>
<li> IT&#x27;S NOT, TRUE WITH ALL MINIOXIDIL PRODUCTS).</li>
<li> I got the one for women for myself and it took a little longer for me to see the difference</li>
<li> ABOUT A WEEK, AND IT WASN&#x27;T HEAVY SHEDDING.</li>
<li> Waste of money &amp; I bought 2 of them.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it previously and it seems to work but not great</li>
<li> hard to tell if it&#x27;s working yet</li>
<li> tried this random off-brand on a whim because it didn&#x27;t contain PG and had a handful of other things that</li>
<li> they mean it !</li>
<li> my hair is thin</li>
<li> but it made my hair look like crap and dried my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> He had a bald patch at one side which was very irritating</li>
<li> but I had to stop using it allergic reaction was crazy !</li>
<li> What&#x27;s the point if the stuff you put in your hair makes it look like crap?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using less than a month.  Im told it takes longer to see results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes any all ! Waste of money &amp; I bought 2 of them.</li>
    <li> I have been using product for about 7 months.  There has been moderate regrowth.  I am happy with results.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works, even my hairdresser mention that my hair has been getting thicker and I got lots of fuzz hair around the crown also. will be buying 2 more soon</li>
    <li> Update: I do see that more follicles are producing hair. It&#x27;s a process, my hair is fine and grows slow however this product works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying the product once per day, after my morning shower. I found a splash of witch hazel helps to spread it well.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using Perfect Hair shampoo 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First report: My baldness is gone after 8 months of daily use&lt;br /&gt;This product works well when used as directed. My baldness is gone after 8 months of daily use my hair is thin but when I started there wasn&#x27;t much hair. It&#x27;s going to take more time, but I am satisfied and now I am working on length.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it previously and it seems to work but not great</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  Drys quickly, no residue. No irritation, no dry scalp. Works better than any other minoxidil I have used.  Does it grow hair?  It is an monetary solution to balding anxiety, if you have 20$, then it is great therapy.  You might grow a hair or two. Will that make you happy?</li>
    <li> Helps to keep my hair from thinning more than it already has. Still worth using. Does not harm my scalp.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS WITH MY RETIN-A CREAM ON MY EDGES DAMAGED FROM BRAIDS 2 YEARS AGO, THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!! IT WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE ON AMAZON FOR A WHILE LAST YEAR, THEN IT WAS BACK IN STOCK. THIS IS ONE OF MY 3 MUST HAVE BEAUTY PRODUCTS I CAN NOT DO WITH OUT. I HAVE THINNING ON MY CROWN FROM GENETICS, I CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE EARLIER YOU START USING IT, RESEARCH STATES THE BETTER. PLUS ONCE YOU START USING IT YOU MUST CONTINUE TO USE IT FOR CONTINUED RESULTS ( I FIGURED THIS WAS A MYTH TO KEEP YOU PURCHASING IT, NOPE IT&#x27;S NOT, TRUE WITH ALL MINIOXIDIL PRODUCTS). THIS TIME I DID EXPERIENCE SHEDDING WHEN I NEVER DID BEFORE, BUT LIKE THE DIRECTIONS SAID IT SOON STOPPED AFTER ABOUT A WEEK, AND IT WASN&#x27;T HEAVY SHEDDING. THIS IS LIKE MY 4TH OR 5TH BOTTLE OF THIS BRAND. THIS IS THE BEST BRAND I&#x27;VE TRIED. I AM A WOMAN, I AM 44 OF AFRICAN DESCENT, I CHOOSE THIS STRENGTH AND USE IT EVERY OTHER MORNING OR NIGHT IN CONJUCTION WITH RETIN-A AND SCALP STIMULATION.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work, but best of all, no itching!</li>
    <li> hard to tell if it&#x27;s working yet and it leaves a weird residue on my hair, but it smells nice and leaves a nice tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> My brother has been using this product religiously since the day it has come, and he can well see the difference. He had a bald patch at one side which was very irritating and he had to comb his hair a certain way to hide it&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a dropper which makes it very easy to use and apply without creating a mess. Its a non greasy liquid so no issue there either.&lt;br /&gt;Only the affected area needs to be taken care of with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Its safe to use everyday and the working time varied from person to person. I got the one for women for myself and it took a little longer for me to see the difference but gradually i noticed new baby hairs on the front scalp. But the difference for my brother was much faster, within a month almost.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to get this product during promotion. But my opinions are honest.</li>
    <li> It makes me feel good.  Doesn&#x27;t make dandruff on my scalp. .  also doesn&#x27;t regrowth any new hair in my hair line . anyway still recommended if you have money if you dont take rogain brand</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I started using Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil treatment but suffered a horrid rash from what I assumed as the PG in their formula.  I Stopped that after 2-3 weeks and returned it via Amazon no problem.  Then I moved on to the Rogaine foam, which doesn&#x27;t contain PG, and had no adverse reactions but it made my hair look like crap and dried my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this random off-brand on a whim because it didn&#x27;t contain PG and had a handful of other things that *may* help your combat hair loss.  I was more interested in a conditioning effect from the added ingredients.  What&#x27;s the point if the stuff you put in your hair makes it look like crap?  More hair won&#x27;t fix crappy looking hair.  Anyway, It looks like someone caught on to this company because they were using azelaic acid and retinol.  As history shows, many companies who have introduced these ingredients had to retract them from their &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; formulas due to no scientific backing.  Lipogaine is a prime example of this when they removed azelaic acid from their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results, it is too soon to tell.  I will try their new formula when my bottle runs out as their old one made my hair look better after application and wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling afterward.  The only thing I don&#x27;t fancy is the smell.  It is reminiscent of a bottle of smelly vitamins or a medicinal smell.  Only time will tell if this stuff works.  All I know for now is that it feels better on my head after application and that&#x27;s says a lot compared to the other formulas out there that make your hair feel too gunky or scalp too itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I will not report back in a few months with a supplemental review of my progress.  Better to be honest than make a false promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogain minoxidil since 2012. It used to be better but it no longer contains azealic acid. This product does. This formula seems to absorb better and not leave a as much sticky s*** in my hair and it claims to contain azealic acid which is paramount for an effective topical hairloss product. I got 2 bottles for 25$ I believe. So about half the price of lipogain. I hope this product doesn&#x27;t get banned by the FDA due to it containing azealic acid, as hairloss is an &#x27;off label use&#x27; for azealic acid. I also feel that the solution contained in this product allows for better scalp penetration. It has a mild cooling effect on my scalp that makes it feel like it&#x27;s working. Still too early to tell for sure if it&#x27;s really good, but been on it 2 weeks (along with Propicia and ketoconazole shampoo) and my hairloss is still under control. So overall... I like it better than lipogain right now. Hope this post helps some people.</li>
    <li> been using it for about 3 weeks now, is to early to give an opinion but at least it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The shedding is slightly increased but I believe is part of the process. I will post the result in about 2 months to let you know if it actually works or not. It gives the feeling that is working but as said is just a feeling, no visual result at moment.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Item as expected.  Been using for 3 months now and seeing some results.  Will give it a 6 month challenge.  I love the peppermint scent...it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  Noticed some particles floating around in the bottle but did some further research with the company and found out that it&#x27;s some of the herbal ingredients that settle.</li>
    <li> The texture it leaves hair feels good ;but overall still waiting for regrowth ,been using hairmax comb as well.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 months now and I can notice the difference. Less hair falling in the shower, may be too early to see regrowth results but its well worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff work&#x27;s very strong ! as well but I had to stop using it allergic reaction was crazy ! Rashes swelling of the forehead etc...but I&#x27;m pretty sure I either put to much an also got some on my skin believe me when they keep away from skin and use latex gloves for protection they mean it ! When I first use the product my thin hair after an few day&#x27;s instantly became thicker I&#x27;m pretty sure I over did it! And instantly broke out with rashes and swelling wrinkles on the forehead and everything which is the reason I gave it 3 star&#x27;s over pretty good product verrrrrry powerful as well !</li>
    <li> Not greasy, dries fast. I use it morning &amp; night</li>
</ol>
