      <li>I think, finally I have found good products with great price from Tree of Life Beauty :-).</li>

      <li>Putting this cream on felt very cool and refreshing</li>
      <li>I was so excited when seeing it!  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most pure and effective creams I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Love the feeling of thie cream, so far so good</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it absorbed quickly</li>

      <li>My skin felt smoother and more even right away.  </li>
      <li>It feels very clean and fresh...</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this Matrixyl containing moisturizer to add to my routine face maintenance (retinol, vitamin C serum and gel, sunscreen, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This company (Tree of Life) is a company completely dedicated to making sure their customers are satisfied with their products.  </li>
      <li>This company (Tree of Life) is a company completely dedicated to making sure their customers are satisfied with their products.  </li>
      <li>I can see my skin improves more every day as the skin turns out so soft, more radiant and brighten.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and absorbs right into the skin, but you can still feel the moisture.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I liked its clean sent and how far it went without leaving my skin feeling covered in oil.  </li>
      <li>Really looking forward to the continued improvements that are sure to come.</li>
      <li>I am trying it for the first time, so I am excited to see results after a month.</li>
      <li>This is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  </li>
      <li>I love that it smells natural (as it should).  </li>
      <li>Then, after a month, I can see some of my brown spots from the old acne lighter and the skin turns more radiant and brighten.</li>
      <li>They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  </li>
      <li>They were quick and efficient in sending the product and had very fast customer service responses.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer was at night after cleansing with mild liquid soap followed by a gentle scrub.</li>
      <li>I accepted gratefully and offered to send back the bottle mostly unused.  </li>
      <li>And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal:</li>
      <li>I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and this product helps hide that!</li>
      <li>I was about to purchase another set, but lucky that I got a free 2-oz retinol moisturizer sample last week.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, after the second week of using them, I only feel my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot.</li>
      <li>I am trying this particular product for the first time.</li>
      <li>so I could put my make up on straight after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Tree of Life products are amazing---all of them so far that I have tried for anti-aging products and the price is beyond worth it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on it yet, and so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.  </li>
      <li>Plus I love the freebies, comes with samples of their other products</li>
      <li>highly recommend Tree of Life as a company as well.  </li>
      <li>I seemed to be none the worse for wear despite the mild stinging, but many beauty experts recommend not using products that cause any stinging.  </li>
      <li>Since starting, fine lines are definitely reduced.</li>
      <li>So fun to finally have a moisturizer that goes on smooth, covers with such a small amount and then absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oily when I put on my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised to smell peppermint and immediately upon contact with my face, I felt a stinging sensation.  </li>
      <li>Just wanted to let you know I am using daily clean scrubs to wash the face, then applying anti-aging, then retinol moisturizers on, then applying sunscreen (only for day time).</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin and specially my eyes easier to get red from facial  lotion or cream.</li>
      <li>I used this product along with the other Tree of Life products and I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I saw results.  </li>
      <li>However, after trying these products from Tree of Life Beauty, I have no problem with it so far.</li>
      <li>I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  </li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s too early to see changes.</li>
      <li>I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to always follow advice, but I have wondered why Tree of Life uses peppermint in this face product, a known irritant for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I use it at night and my skin is soft but never greasy.  </li>
      <li>It claims to be natural</li>
      <li>I see a real difference in my skin--not nearly as dry in this winter weather.</li>
      <li>am a 54 year old female.</li>
      <li>At times I&#x27;ll add AHA&#x27;s, but for my sensitive skin, only occasionally.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve been doing lately is to use this moisturizer for my neck and forehead which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as as the rest of my face; and I use another Matrixyl product with no scents (either natural or not) on those parts sensitive to this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was excited to try this Matrixyl containing moisturizer to add to my routine face maintenance (retinol, vitamin C serum and gel, sunscreen, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I use some of the products at night such as this one, and some during the day.  At times I&#x27;ll add AHA&#x27;s, but for my sensitive skin, only occasionally. The first time I tried the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer was at night after cleansing with mild liquid soap followed by a gentle scrub. I was very surprised to smell peppermint and immediately upon contact with my face, I felt a stinging sensation.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on it yet, and so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.  Since I only use the scrub once a day, I tried it when I didn&#x27;t use the scrub, and it still stung a little, but not too badly. I never mix it with my retinol products now either.  I seemed to be none the worse for wear despite the mild stinging, but many beauty experts recommend not using products that cause any stinging.  I&#x27;m not one to always follow advice, but I have wondered why Tree of Life uses peppermint in this face product, a known irritant for sensitive skin.  What I&#x27;ve been doing lately is to use this moisturizer for my neck and forehead which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as as the rest of my face; and I use another Matrixyl product with no scents (either natural or not) on those parts sensitive to this product. It all works in the end, but though I love Tree of Life&#x27;s retinol and vitamin C moisturizers, I probably won&#x27;t order this one again once it&#x27;s gone just because it is a hassle putting only here or there and not all over my face and neck. Oh and the jury is still out on any skin improvement as I&#x27;ve only just started using it.  I&#x27;ll try and update this review after about 8 weeks of use to report any improvements I see.&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/2/15&lt;br /&gt;After I wrote my review, I received an email from Tree of Life offering me a refund for the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer due to my sensitivity to the peppermint.  I accepted gratefully and offered to send back the bottle mostly unused.  They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  This company (Tree of Life) is a company completely dedicated to making sure their customers are satisfied with their products.  They go out of their way to ensure this and I find myself in awe.  In addition to treating me fairly and beyond, they have also offered me a free bottle of one of my favorite products (which I was invited to choose from their products on Amazon), the Tree of Life Vitamin C eye gel.  I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  Thank you, Tree of Life.tle mostly unused.

    <li> I use three of the produts (not the eye gel). Since starting, fine lines are definitely reduced. I saw some friends that I had not seen in a few months and every single one commented on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it reduces any wrinkles but it is a great moisturizer, very light. Absorbs well for my dry sensitive skin.  Plus I love the freebies, comes with samples of their other products</li>
    <li> Did not live up to the hype. My skin did not improve.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love Tree of Life porducts!</li>
    <li> I am trying this particular product for the first time. I love the moisturizing retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;This company stands by their products,  you can buy with confidence.  Their CSR are great.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service and great products makes us loyal consumers.</li>
    <li> So fun to finally have a moisturizer that goes on smooth, covers with such a small amount and then absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oily when I put on my makeup.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most pure and effective creams I have ever used.  It goes on easily and absorbs right into the skin, but you can still feel the moisture.  I love that it smells natural (as it should).  It feels very clean and fresh... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Pump Doesn&#x27;t Work! And scent is bothersome</li>
    <li> I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service! If I could add more stars to rate them, I would. Somehow 5 stars just isn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 54 year old female. And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal: Have great looking skin without makeup! Tree of Life Beauty products makes that end goal attainable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using their products for only a month by the way...I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the price is a great deal! Throw away your other products - you simply won&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> Excellent ... the product ingredients are as advertised. Very happy with the vibrate and refreshed look.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tree of Life products for over a month and am amazed how it has&lt;br /&gt;softened my wrinkles and I have had comments, &amp;#34;what are you doing? You are looking so great.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Needles to say this makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product.  My skin felt smoother and more even right away.  Really looking forward to the continued improvements that are sure to come.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and this product helps hide that!</li>
    <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC. This is LOVELY, lightweight and velvety. It adds hydration to even the deeper skin layer adding fulness to depleted skin. It&#x27;s a must for any regimen at this price!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products.  The Tree of Life products are amazing---all of them so far that I have tried for anti-aging products and the price is beyond worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, affordable moisturizer for awhile now and this one fits the bill.  I use it at night and my skin is soft but never greasy.  It absorbs quickly and has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent.  I love the way my skin feels using this!</li>
    <li> I bought anti aging and retinol moisturizers on Amazon based on the good reviews and have used them for more than 6 weeks. I have a very sensitive skin and specially my eyes easier to get red from facial  lotion or cream. Therefore, I am very careful when buying different skincare products. However, after trying these products from Tree of Life Beauty, I have no problem with it so far. To be honest, after the second week of using them, I only feel my skin so soft and smooth.  Then, after a month, I can see some of my brown spots from the old acne lighter and the skin turns more radiant and brighten. I was so excited when seeing it!  Then the 6th week passing by I can see my skin improves more every day as the skin turns out so soft, more radiant and brighten. The brown spots  and some small wrinkle lines lighter and lighter.  I was about to purchase another set, but lucky that I got a free 2-oz retinol moisturizer sample last week.  I think we should be patient when using skincare products. We should give it a try at least 6-8 weeks as everyone has different skin types and textures. Someone may do better within 3-4 weeks, someone else may find improvement after 6 weeks or 2 months.  I think Tree of Life beauty produces great skincare products with a great price. I wanted to try anothe skincare product skin rejuvenating cream.  Just wanted to let you know I am using daily clean scrubs to wash the face, then applying anti-aging, then retinol moisturizers on, then applying sunscreen (only for day time). I think, finally I have found good products with great price from Tree of Life Beauty :-). The only thing I am worrying about, their products are good, soon they will increase the price :-(</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of thie cream, so far so good</li>
    <li> Great service, item arrived on time, clean and neatly packaged with 3 additional samples and explanatory brochure. The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot. I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using. I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples. After using it for just a week I started to see visible difference in my skin appearance. Samples ran out so I purchased the other 3 products now in regular size, so altogether I am using 4 products (two at night and two in the morning) and I can&#x27;t be happier with the results. It claims to be natural (what I&#x27;ve been looking for) so I am hoping I will settle with this product and would not have to be on a lookout for another one for a while. The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall I had a very good experience with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my skin. I am trying it for the first time, so I am excited to see results after a month.</li>
    <li> This is worth the price.  I see a real difference in my skin--not nearly as dry in this winter weather.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with the other Tree of Life products and I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I saw results.  I have several sun spots and they were visibly lighter after about 3 weeks of using the product.  Putting this cream on felt very cool and refreshing and you could tell your skin was being hydrated.  It didn&#x27;t feel like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried that you can tell you are putting chemicals into your skin which is ultimately damaging.  I liked the fact that it absorbed quickly so I could put my make up on straight after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Tree of Life as a company as well.  They were quick and efficient in sending the product and had very fast customer service responses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to use a lot of moisturizer as I&#x27;ve always had oily skin.  However, with this product, I found it didn&#x27;t leave my face with an oily feeling and kept my face feeling fresher for hours.  I liked its clean sent and how far it went without leaving my skin feeling covered in oil.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Dried out my skin.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s too early to see changes. I&#x27;m glad I started taking biotin.</li>
