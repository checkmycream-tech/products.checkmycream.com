      <li>It cleans my face fine, however I bought it for my daughter who gets acne.  </li>
      <li>So just fine ...</li>

      <li>great product that i couldn&#x27;t find locally.</li>

      <li>I use this cream cleanser for personal use, it is non irritant and does a great job at keeping you fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>I will continue searching for the original phisoderm elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I called the Mentholatum company and they no longer make the original formula.  </li>
      <li>This is the first cleanser I have been able to use to wash my face twice a day instead of just once</li>
      <li>It has the consistency of hand lotion, is greasy, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>

      <li>Clean fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super picky.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with who wants good cleaning without worrying about harming sensitive skin.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my 11-year-old after reading reviews. She now loves washing her face at night, and it has cleared right up.</li>
    <li> My mom has used this cleanser for over 40 years.  When it started disappearing out of drugstores, she panicked.  Luckily, it&#x27;s still available on Amazon!  She has used it several times since it arrived and assures me, despite the new packaging, it is the product she loves.</li>
    <li> Ths product is good to use on problem skin. No harsh stinging. No after smell that you get with other products. Clean fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I used this and not only does it put moisture back into the skin but also makes it feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this for awhile, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available again. I am 38 with very oily, acne-prone skin. This product gives my skin a beautiful matte finish like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before or since. It feels clean and fresh without being dry. Phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Love this product it is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on my bulldog for his chin/face acne. It works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and my daughter to use.  I was a little hesitant to order after reading the ingredient list, where mineral oil is listed, but was pleasantly suprised that this cleanser seems to rinse away thoroughly without drying the skin. I actually like this inexpensive cleanser much better than Clinique&#x27;s sensitive skin liquid cleanser, which feels film-like after rinsing. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this, especially now with winter here, and will definitely buy this cleanser again.</li>
    <li> I usually can&#x27;t use cream cleansers because they leave a waxy residue.  This is the only cream cleanser my skin can tolerate.  I&#x27;m 28 so my skin is starting to become dry and hormonally challenged.  Since using this product my skin has improved greatly.  Too bad I never listened to my mom in high school when she told me to use Phisoderm.  It&#x27;s old school.</li>
    <li> this product removed the oil/grease on your face and prevent the outburst of acne as best as it can. I still have pimples once a while but you can notice the difference greatly.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this Phisoderm product for a number of years now.Thought I&#x27;d share a few thoughts with you.First,thank you Amazon for handling it as a while back the Drugstors in my area no longer carry it.Doesn&#x27;t hurt that Amazon is also less expensive and free shipping on $25.00 or more orders.I use it for one specific reason.MY itch on my anus from hemorids.Dont&#x27;t laugh,it works for me. Everytime I shower I use a little down there,let it stay awhile and then rise it off at the end of the shower. Hope this helps a few fellow hemroid suffers. I&#x27;ll bet the manufacture never knew this.Enjoy the releif!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this cleanser works well.  It does not irritate like soap does and does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin in rather unmentionable places.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over 30 years and swear by it.  It cleans with no irritation and no harsh side effects from fragrances.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with who wants good cleaning without worrying about harming sensitive skin.    This product used to be available in all drugstores until about 5-8 years ago.  Glad to see it&#x27;s still available!</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with Rosacea a few years ago and needed something that was \\&quot;very sensitive\\&quot; to wash my face since that was the area most affected.  I tried this product having picked it up at the CVS and it was fantastic and my skin has never looked better.  I have oily skin on top of everything so its hard to find something that works well in general.    Anyway, having tried it and loved it I then checked Amazon and the pricing they offer is MUCH better than the local stores and that is even with using a coupon.    A great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> We were very upset when this product was discontinued as my wife is hyper sensitive to fragrances and launched a campaign via e-mails to get them to remanufacture it.. I now have COPD and also can&#x27;t take fragrance as well.. A GREAT Product !!!</li>
    <li> Love oil-less formula and removes waterbase makeup well.  I do use moist cotton pad for removal, then wash face w goat&#x27;s milk-based soap and lukewarm water.....works best for my skin.  In colder months, use moisturizer in addition to eye/mouth area.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin, this was recommended by a co-worker who had flawless skin. I was hoping that would happen for me. Nope.I used ot for about 9 months. I still broke out pretty much at least once to twice a week. I will say that was less often than when I used proactiv, which was every day. For the cost and what you got was great. I think my skin just did not like it. Still continuing trying to find the perfect face wash for my skin.</li>
    <li> It cleans my face fine, however I bought it for my daughter who gets acne.  It has oil in it and shouldn&#x27;t be used on acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this product on my face since puberty, which is a loong time ago. Terrific facial wash. Simply difficult to find in stores. Online order is quick with a reasonable price. I&#x27;ll never change.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great at removing makeup.  Last time I ran out I tried two other brands that were around and they both irritated my eyes.  Never have had a problem with this phisoderm though and also like that it&#x27;s in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I wish this came in larger sizes to use as a body wash in the shower.  I have dry skin and this cleanser removes makeup easily and cleans while not drying out my skin.  I appreciate that it has mineral oil since it works very well for me, but those sensitive to mineral oil or who don&#x27;t have dry skin might want to avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Great price, great value, and quick ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for PhisoDerm for a reasonable cost since it was removed from the shelf. This was my first success. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband has been undergoing radiation and chemo for cancer treatment. The radiation was \\&quot;burning\\&quot; his skin and the regular soaps he uses to wash were also drying out his skin making it very painful. Then I remembered that years ago I had to use this soap to clean with when we lived where our water was very hard and my skin dried out terribly. We looked all over for it here in town but only one place carried it and it was in this small bottle, we bought one and after he used it his skin felt so much better. The price we paid locally was a lot more than here on Amazon so I now have set this up for auto ship and it&#x27;s the only soap we will both use in the home. I do wish they still sold it in the really large sized bottle I used to purchase it in when I was using it years ago. If your skin is tender or dry for any reason give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and oily skin. This cleanser keeps my face clear without irritating it, or over stripping it. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great product that i couldn&#x27;t find locally. package arrived as stated and on time. very pleased and will order again.</li>
    <li> You honestly can not find a better face wash than this. I am 29 years old and obsessed with all things beauty supply. That being said, I have tried a million facial washes from much more expensive companies and have found none as great as this one. pHisoderm is the only product which really prevents my hormonal breakouts and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find in stores these days. This was recommended to me for my sensitive skin by a dermatologist. Interestingly, it seems if you have acne it can often be because you are using too harsh soaps. As soon as I started using this, within three days, my inflamed skin was clearly on the mend. Same too for rosacea. Non-foaming but cleanses nicely. You won&#x27;t have any irritation related to this product. A good soap to use daily. Bottle size is good for about two months of use.</li>
    <li> I have used Phisoderm since I was in my teens (a really long time age!)  Best stuff on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product almost every year since I am 16, and I am 62.  I have tried other more expensive products and always go back to this. It has become more difficult to find, so I order it online.&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome to remove makeup, but never get a tight dry feeling afterwards. I also have sensitive skin and never have an issue with rash or breakouts from this product.  I am always complimented on my skin, and lack of wrinkles.  My dermatologist said this was good because it is PH balanced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of hypoallergenic skin products. Anything that contains the irritant stearic acid will make me break out in blisters, a rosacea outbreak. Many manufacturers, even though they know that stearic acid is an irritant, use it in their products anyway. Phisoderm for sensitive skin does not. Not only that but it is also non-drying and leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth and clean. I have been very happy with it, and my skin issues have cleared up considerably since I began using it.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this part, the ad was showing a &amp;#34;original recipe* u know how they say it on the bottle, and when I got it in the mail, it wasn&#x27;t the same as shown on the ad.</li>
    <li> I tried this facial cleanser for my sensitive skin and I&#x27;m very happy with the outcome. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or dry. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This came as a pack of 4.  Initially, this was a great deal but  I know why.  2 of the bottle was open and most of the contents was spill out.  Therefore I pay for four but only got two usable bottle.  Very unhappy with the way it was wrapped and deliver.</li>
    <li> Nice.  My skin is soft.  This is almost like using a non-greasy lotion that disappears.  Love it.  I liked it so much on my face I used it on my body as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m super picky.  There is not a whole lot I&#x27;m happy with in the skin department, so this was a nice find.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like a cream, and washes off leaving perfect soft skin.  No residue ickiness.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and people still ask what I use on my face that keeps it looking so young.  Really, I&#x27;m not joking, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Phisoderm is a great product for cleansing the skin.  No longer in the old green bottle but it is the same product.  Good for oily skin and a must if products are used in the hair.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> Been dealing with adult acne, some of it cystic, for about 10 years now (I&#x27;m 45). I never had skin problems as as teenager and I remembered that this was what I used then - along with a buf puf. I have tried every product made for acne, in all price ranges, over the past 10 years - even prescriptions - and nothing has done as well as this and a buf puf. I switched back about a week ag and My greasy, oily face is no longer that way. I used to have to blot several times a day. Now I don&#x27;t need to at all. My huge pores have all but disappeared and the scars are fading. I still have breakouts, but they clear up in a day or two. If that much can change in one week, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it goes in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> I started using Phisoderm to cleanse my face when I was 13 years old, when it came in that bright green bottle with the flip cap.  I continued to use it right up through my early 30s, and I never had complexion problems.  When it became increasingly difficult to find in the stores, I switched to a high-priced department store brand cleanser in a fancy package.  I am so glad I found this again!!  For me, this is the best product to help keep my skin healthy and young-looking.  The reasonable price is an added bonus!!</li>
    <li> Old school face wash at it&#x27;s best!  You can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for forty years and I swear by it! Even though I say this myself.....my skin is lovely 😇</li>
    <li> This was a reorder ... So just fine ... They have changed the formulation though from last time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Phisoderm since I was a teen and knows it well. I have been using the cream cleanser for sensitive skin since 2011 and have ordered them on Amazon since last year. The last pack was received 2-3 months ago. First it smells different from the previous ones I had. It also irritates when I had cuts on my face. It may be the substandard product sold on Amazon for cheaper price. I am not sure this is the same cleanser that I used to purchase. I will purchase different Phisoderm cleanser next time.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  Great cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Non allergenic fragrance free used to&lt;br /&gt;Require a prescription I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;This product.  Plus the vendor was very timely.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet because I am using up the last of the containers I already have.  It is labeled a little differently than what I am accustomed to but I really hope it is the formula I have been using satisfactorily for many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years as a daily face wash. I try to never run out but usually can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> I love this formula for the summer and warmer months when my combination skin is more oily than dry and it seems to help prevent breakouts. (I use the sensitive skin moisturizing one in the winter) As a fair skin person with minor rosacea I&#x27;m always looking for products that don&#x27;t irritate my delicate skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only cleanser my sister and I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate our faces or the rosacea. I am happy to be able to purchase it at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it.  It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Good Product.  I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin, I used it when I was in my twenties, then started using an apricot scrub for about 10 years, now that I am in my 50s I am back to Phisoderm, very gentle.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent bargain - this product is hard to find in the stores and Amazon, as usual, came through!  It is an excellent product, excellent value and works just great!</li>
    <li> I would agree with most of the review here. The ingredients might have changed. its still a good product but drying my face sometime.</li>
    <li> This product has kept consistency over many years.  Does not dry out skin or give any side effects.  Was recommended by Physician.</li>
    <li> This product, was not the product, I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from different stores, besides the online.  It was not the same product, and results was not the same, it seems like it was morer waterd-down, just like chalk-water.  Not at all satified, that&#x27;s why I discontinued, my auto-delivery...</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean but not irritated or dry. I particularly like that it is fragrance free since I also have a sensitive nose. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for many years, but now it&#x27;s not available in the retail stores in my area - so I&#x27;m delighted that Amazon has been carrying it.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to everything, MaryKay, Clinique and even organic skin cares. This is the only thing I can use on my face and my \\&quot;personal\\&quot; area (if you get the drift) without getting an infection or itching episodes.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my 12 year old daughter. She has sensitive skin and this is perfect for her. Keeps her skin clear and beautiful. Very gentle cleanser that is well worth the price. I bought this most recently here at Amazon for $[...] for 4 bottles. What an excellent deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All skin types could use this product of course, but I highly recommend it if you have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for use as a body wash (they also have face cleanser).  Is great for a facial wash, but not so much as a body wash due to very low (virtually no) sudsing.  You don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re washing - just rubbing a washcloth on your body - as there are no &#x27;suds&#x27;.  It is very gentle, and has not been problematic for my very sensative skin.  I would use it on a baby as well, as it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the fragrance or harshness of other soaps.  5 stars as a facial cleanser, 3 stars as a body wash.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with how quickly the product showed up.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was the same cleanser I&#x27;ve purchased for years. The bottle looks the same but instead of gel cleanser it says cream cleanser. It has the consistency of hand lotion, is greasy, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean. The gel cleanser would make suds on my wash cloth but this stuff just disappears into it leaving a greasy residue. I had to buy the 4 pack of gel cleanser from a non prime seller so I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being discontinued since this cream cleanser is so horrible.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that reacts even to many hypoallergenic products.  Unfortunately, part of that reaction is adult acne.  I have combination skin, so it is a heck of a thing to find products that cleanse without drying.  This is the first cleanser I have been able to use to wash my face twice a day instead of just once and I have tried an unbelievable number of skin care products.  I have been using this one for two years now and it is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I always loved Phisoderm H20 Daily Replenishing Wash.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anymore and saw this product.  Amazon always seems to have what I need!  Since my skin has become even more sensitive as time goes by, I decided this might be good.  I LOVE it!  I&#x27;d recommend for anyone with sensitive skin issues.  Amazon shipped this out right on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my face for years, as I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction to it, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get overly dry or oily, either.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my somewhat &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. Very gentle and my skin feels very soft after using. Great price on it too. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> Please beware...if you are/were a regular user of  Phisoderm ORIGINAL FORMULA, please be aware that this is not it.  I purchased this product solely based on the photo showing that it was the original formula, only to find out when I received it that they swapped it with the new formula.  I called the Mentholatum company and they no longer make the original formula.  They have now added a moisturizer to the product plus 3 additional ingredients.  I have now used this product for one week and my face is flaming red, so obviously I cannot tolerate the addition of the moisturizer.  When I called Mentholatum, I was told that they are getting numerous complaints and that those complaints are being forwarded to the quality control division.  I am hoping that with enough complaints from consumers like me who are not able to use the new product, that our original formula will be back on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meantime, while looking at the reviews, be sure to check the date of the review.  Anything prior to late 2012 is in regards to the Original formula which was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect that eventually Amazon will update the picture to represent the true product, in the meantime...if you are looking for the original formula, do not buy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product at first as it goes on unlike a soap washing cleanser, it is more like a cold cream cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up and leaves a slight residue after rinsing.  However my skin seemed to like it after using it a few weeks, especially in the dryer, winter months.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It caused my face to breakout. I am disappointed because I ordered the other phisoderm for sensitive skin product with the Brown cap that has the vitamin E, aloe and chamomile. I have used it for years until 2014. I ordered it last year from Amazon  two or three times but Amazon kept sending this one. I reordered because I thought they just got the order wrong. It looks like they don&#x27;t sell the one with the Brown cap,(vit E, aloe and chamomile) anymore. I did try adding some aloe gel to it but it&#x27;s not the same. I will continue searching for the original phisoderm elsewhere.</li>
    <li> good experience,fast del. good product for the money.you and  i can see clearly now.that this is a must buy !!!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this cleanser made my skin dry and irritated. I definitely would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My Mom used this for year&#x27;s while I was growing up.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the local store&#x27;s anywhere in town.  What a life saver to find it on Amazon.  This product always deliver&#x27;s when having any skin issues.  Highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This works well and leaves skin feeling very soft and not dried out like after many other cleansers I tried. Paula Begoun rated this one as a good one so I thought I&#x27;d try it. The only thing is that it  doesn&#x27;t wash off mascara well. I still have to use somethng else to wash it out.</li>
    <li> This product is the best face cleanser I have found. I wish phisoderm would get this product back on store shelves. It was recommended by my dermatologist years ago and I have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I use this cream cleanser for personal use, it is non irritant and does a great job at keeping you fresh and clean! Also use it on my face :)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and works good...Im so glad I found this product on line . Could not find it for sale anywhere in my hometown......</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dr. and it works great!  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great cleanser for acne or in grown hair infections</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a teenager.  I had horrible oily skin (which is, of course, the sweet spot for acne).  A girl turned me on to this...swore it worked...and it did.  In 24 hours, my face was cleared up (and sans oil...a first!).  The years have passed, and I admit to trying other solutions..but nothing else has come close to keeping my face oil free and zit-free.  As a long long LONG time user, can&#x27;t recommend Phisoderm enough.</li>
    <li> My soon has very oily skin, but very sensitive.  This is a good cleanser, just not for him, he needs cleanser for his skin type.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for decades. Because it is ph-balanced, if I get some in my eyes when I wash my face, it doesn&#x27;t sting!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also gentle and cleans the skin well.</li>
