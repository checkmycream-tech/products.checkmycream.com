      <li>And the product is good but not great.  </li>
      <li>it live it</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years, but it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  </li>
      <li>Not everyone is looking for natural alternatives.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind it not being natural</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m trying to find natural ingredients for my hair and body and this does not make the cut.</li>
      <li>Out of all the non natural products I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot, this is my number 1 choice.</li>
      <li>, it works wonders on my natural hair and my  5 yr old sons</li>
      <li>The 1 star missing is because of the ingredients and because the moisture is just ok and doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>After my hair was severely damaged during a Brazilian blowout this is the only product that I have found to help take the frizz out of my hair, restore the moisture and make it soft again.</li>
      <li>The only lotion that makes my hair soft and does not make my hair too dry.</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product that was referred to me by my stylist.  I have problems with dry scalp; however, I prefer products that add luster and moisture without water that can strip my relaxer.  This product works great, but it is hard to find locally in some areas and purchasing online is a great help. Compared to the price of the 8 oz product, the 16 oz product is a great buy.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t appear like the PCA that I bought at a beauty supply store last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived quickly, but the consistency of the product didn&#x27;t appear the same as the &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; bought product.</li>

    <li> The product is an excellent hair moisturizer that is normally only available in beauty shops and hair salons. The seller fulfilled the order quickly and packing was excellent.</li>
    <li> MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS MIXED HAS USED DUDLEY&#x27;S PCA SINCE SHE WAS TWO.  SHE HAS BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND IT COMES TO HER WAIST.  I WISH THIS PRODUCT WAS AVAILABLE TO ALL MIXED CHILDREN SO THEY COULD REALIZE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEIR HAIR REALLY IS.</li>
    <li> Use this product all of the time to help maintain moisture  for my hair.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great in my 5 yr old sons low cut. love it love it live it, it works wonders on my natural hair and my  5 yr old sons</li>
    <li> The product is great! Dudley&#x27;s is a decent product, a little pricey, but it works. I will purchase it again. I wish it cost less.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair very moist.</li>
    <li> PCA works great in my hair.  The only lotion that makes my hair soft and does not make my hair too dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. The very next day after I started using this, my hair was already showing a significant amount of improvement. I highly recomend this to anybody with hair troubles.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the cost is extremely reasonable. Can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
    <li> Great productas described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this in years and decided to purchase it as a leave-in moisterizer for my hair. The great thing about it; it has protein another benefit for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry hair/scalp.  Had not been able to find this online or in stores.  Glad to know I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this product when I had a jheri curl or relaxer. It was the only thing that slows the hair breakage down. I love it...It used to cost 6 dollars a bottle now almost 14...ridiculous....</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it is a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> A great hair moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This product keeps moisture in my hair, so therefore, my hair is growing again. Promotes healthy hair</li>
    <li> Not natural for the ingredients. And the product is good but not great.  If you don&#x27;t mind it not being natural then I would recommend it. But I&#x27;m trying to find natural ingredients for my hair and body and this does not make the cut. Moisture is ok. It&#x27;s not the best. It draws in moisture from the air so in humidity this works well for me. And in dry air I still have moisture in my hair for some of the day. Better than a lot of products out there to be honest. And it does soften the hair. Soooo. The 1 star missing is because of the ingredients and because the moisture is just ok and doesn&#x27;t last all day. I have 4c very dry hair and it&#x27;s coarse so the fact that it softens my hair as much as it does, probably from the lanolin, and has moisture about half the day is really good. Because sometimes my hair is dry after about a couple of hours with the supposed great products some people rave about. I do recommend this product even still to this day. Not everyone is looking for natural alternatives. If you&#x27;re not, give this product a try. Out of all the non natural products I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot, this is my number 1 choice. So it&#x27;s really based off your preference and hair needs.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, but it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  It was a great surprise to find it on Amazon for a good price.  It&#x27;s the best moisture retainer and I would not use any other product on my hair.</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed with this purchase. The bottle that I bought at the salon looks the same but they are NOT the same.&lt;br /&gt;This one  smells different...almost like sun tan lotion. Same brand name so I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.</li>
    <li> it works very well on perm hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. After my hair was severely damaged during a Brazilian blowout this is the only product that I have found to help take the frizz out of my hair, restore the moisture and make it soft again. I recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair. It is amazing</li>
