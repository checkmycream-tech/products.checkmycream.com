<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second one.  I have used one in my bedroom for several years.  Now I have a noisy neighbor - lots of vehicle noise in particular and decided to try one in the area where I sit at my computer.  It works very well to mask out the worst of the noise and the remainder is just a dull throb.  However with the new machine I had a burnt odor when first plugged in that made me think the thing was burning up.  However after several hours use, the worst of it disappeared.  It still gives off that odor at the start but soon disappears.  I don&#x27;t have a clue what it comes from.  Please note- you can become addicted to these machines.  I am much more relaxed when one is running.  I don&#x27;t think I could sleep without one, even with no outside noise.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve owned two MARPAC SleepMate units for 2-3 years each. Now we simply cannot sleep without whitenoise. Our youngest daughter now has one of her own to help her deal with nighttime anxieties by maintianing consistency in her bedtime routine. These units are also very portable and helpful while traveling, as it can drown road noise in hotels and gives a sense of familiarity. We&#x27;ve only ever used these in the US, but with proper adapters can be used abroad. Our oldest daughter wants her own, tired of using an oscillating fan to aid her sleep. The cord has a generous length so you can position it at a proper distance to your liking. I will say that I wish you could increase the whitenoise even further on some nights when the spouse is snoring or outside noise is particularly loud (we never use the low setting), but in general these units work quite well for drowning out extraneous noise and making for a peaceful nights sleep.</li>
    <li> The lowest setting on this is a little louder than the old one I had which is probably a good thing since the neighbors dog barks all night long. It took me a little time to get use to the level of noise but now I sleep much better at night. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> My business has about ten of these scattered around our clinic - invaluable for blocking out background noise and providing privacy for patients.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have owned one for 20 years and replaced it with the new dual speed model.</li>
    <li> It took about a week to get used to the whooshing sound, but then I found I was sleeping deeper at night. Still need a pillow over my head when the spouse snores, but I don&#x27;t need the ear plug near as often.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. I like that fact there are two modes but I do wish there was one setting that wasn&#x27;t as loud.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  the closest to this I&#x27;ve experienced was on an international flight.  Perfect and natural.  baby sleeps through anything.</li>
    <li> When we moved to CA from RI, our house size reduced by 2/3.  The kids&#x27; bedrooms are  now on the same floor, and close to the common living space.  We immediately purchased each child a White Noise Machine so they could sleep when others weren&#x27;t.  The machines have dual settings, and my eldest likes the high setting since his bedroom is right off the living room.  The others prefer the low setting.  The machines are small enough to take on trips, and the eye shades are a nice bonus, and happen to be the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> The product is not loud enough to drown out other noises. I still hear the dogs barking outside and my daughter watching television in another room. The noise is soothing,but I wish it was louder. It really doesn&#x27;t do the job I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it! The sleeping mask was NOT included, but it still all worked out fine!&lt;br /&gt;She likes the noise that it makes-- it&#x27;s a mix between static and ocean waves, and you can adjust the intensity/volume, as well as the pitch (but only slightly).</li>
    <li> I really liked the how long the cord is. I liked that the sounds could be adjusted. Also took it on vacation with me worked great. just light enough to mask any small sounds. only drawback was i feel it is a little pricy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for use in my apartment.  I positioned it high and at the end of my bed and it does provide an adequate amount of continuous white noise for the room.  I haven&#x27;t tested it with the sound of lawn mowing yet but, for blocking conversations and the sounds of footfalls from up above, it works well.  It was easy to use.  I have it on the lower sound option with all of the holes opened up.  I may have to use the loudest setting to drown out the sound of mowing.  Otherwise, I recommend this for anyone who needs to sleep through inconsiderate neighbor&#x27;s noise.  I wish that I would have bought this product sooner!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who has difficulties staying asleep throughout the night.  My husband was uncertain about the noise being too loud so we placed it near the door of our adjoining bathroom and kept it on the lowest level.  My husband did not like the sound at all, believed it kept him up more, and the machine was turned off after a few hours.  We attempted to use it again the next night though it was again turned off after a couple of hours for being too distracting.  HOWEVER, I discovered an alternative use for the machine: to help calm my 8 yr old Yorkie during storms. My dog is terrified of storms and shakes uncontrollably with the onset of bad weather. The constant sound from the machine helps drown out the wind, rain, thunder.  We place the machine in whatever room he is hiding, set the controls based on the severity of the storm, and keep it running until the weather improves. It doesn&#x27;t completely resolve my dog&#x27;s fear though his shaking is tremendously reduced.</li>
    <li> We have 3 of these.  We use one in my sons room, and we use 2 in the master bedroom.  These are loud but not to loud, if that makes any sense.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do, however we started with just 1 in the master bedroom but I have a very VERY inconsiderate neighbor who keeps his dog outside from 7am to 10pm and the bark is so loud it sounds like the dog is in the bedroom with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 was good to block out the dog most of the time, but the few times the dog seemed to bark wildly it would still wake me so I bought a second.  Now I never hear that dog.  But for most situations 1 would be plenty.  As long as you don&#x27;t live near my neighbor that is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the MARPAC SleepMate for 3 years. Not only do I use this unit to sleep, I keep it on all of the time. I usually have some kind of white noise going throughout the house to block out distractions. I don&#x27;t want to obsess about the noisy neighbor. I don&#x27;t always want to ask the kids to turn the TV down, when they are enjoying their TV time. The little machine helps me to re-group. It&#x27;s a little solace machine. It also gives me a focal-point so I may get to sleep. Helpful especially while traveling, as it can give one the feeling of familiarity and consistency.  - It&#x27;s travel-worthy. Using the proper country adapters, I&#x27;ve used this product in England, India, Finland, Australia and here at home in the USA.  - It has gotten me through many-a-hotel stay.  - I have a new baby (2 months) and I believe the white noise adds calm to our room.  Should anything happen to this unit, I will buy another. I may even buy another for my baby&#x27;s room, when he transitions to his own space.  Yes. Get it.  Update, January 20, 2012:  Still running!</li>
    <li> Not bad, but I wish it had numbers to dial in the settings.</li>
    <li> I have trouble sleeping due to a sleep disorder. This machine is wonderful. The noise from the machine is just enough to help me drift off and stay asleep</li>
    <li> I have used fans, humidifiers, air purifiers, and music to try for the right white noise.  This product is wonderful.  The sound level is variable, and it is pure, wonderfully relaxing white noise.  The best $50 i have spent to help with a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I used to sleep with a fan on and when it died I couldn&#x27;t find a good replacement.  I gave in and ordered the noise machine and I am so glad I did.  The only complaint I have about it is that the motor is a bit loud on the high setting but I think it is due to the fact that the noise machine is too close to the bed.  The bedroom is small and has no plug on the wall that would be farthest away from the head of the bed.  The low setting is great for me though and sounds like the noise my fan used to make.  I am extremely happy I finally bought this!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use for when I travel for work or fun to help sleep in motels!  It is great!  It sounds just like a fan blowing (which is what we all sleep with at home for noise) so I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MPH0PG Marpac 980A Sound Screen Sleep Conditioner White Noise Generator Dual Speed]]  I have two of these sound machines.  One in my bedroom &amp; one in a guest bedroom.  Love just the plain white noise....no sounds of waterfalls, oceans, birds, etc...just plain white noise...like the sound of a fan w/ various volume levels.</li>
    <li> I dont onger have trouble sleeping due to the noise in the neighborhood. This machine has helped me enormously to jettison any sound out of my room. I finally sleep throught the night.</li>
    <li> The MARPAC SleepMate performed exactly as described and expected.  I will no longer have to carry a full size fan with me when we travel to mask noises while trying to sleep.  I am very pleased with mine and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble sleeping.....busy mind and all!  Well, this product absolutely does work.  I used to use a fan to help me, but the &amp;#34;white noise&amp;#34; application works much better.  Kudos to Marpac for doing their research, and creating this great product.  It is VERY well constructed, and has different options to control the noise flow.  I absolutely DO recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very simple product, works well.  It&#x27;s just air...basically like having a fan on in the room, without the cooling effect.  Several adjustments to make it louder or softer.  So far, just having it pretty soft has worked well for us.  Only (mild) disappointment is that there was supposed to be a sleep mask included in the package, and it wasn&#x27;t there.  Not a big deal, but if you&#x27;re not going to send it, don&#x27;t tell us it&#x27;s part of the package.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Way way to loud and high pitched sound for sleeping</li>
    <li> I purchased this 10 yrs ago to help me sleep in a college dorm setting. I am a light sleeper and this white noise machine has been wonderful. It worked in a college dorm, first apartment, first home, and for my 1yr old (and me) when we travel.  I am purchasing a new one as a gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> great product and it lasts for years.  I definitely recommend but it doesn&#x27;t drown out a ton of noise bc it isn&#x27;t that loud, I wish it was louder</li>
    <li> Product arrived ontime and works exactly as I had hoped. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs what it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy little machine.  Does what it is advertised to do.  Short of shooting my neighbors (lol), it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> My stepmother gave me my first (and current) SleepMate in 1986 as I was having trouble sleeping after my father died. It worked then and has worked ever since. Mine stays on 24/7/365 – even if I&#x27;m just in bed reading, the sound is so very restful that I don&#x27;t want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here today to purchase two of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; machines – one as a gift and one as a backup for myself. What I&#x27;ll actually do is open and use the new one in the bedroom and put the old girl in the bag that I keep ready should I need to be hospitalized. If I&#x27;m going in for scheduled surgery, I always pack the machine before going in. But if an emergency arises and the paramedics think that I should, at least, visit the ER, I have a bag packed just in case I&#x27;m admitted. You&#x27;d be surprised at the rest that you&#x27;ll be able to get in a hospital with a SleepMate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t obliterate all noise, but rather generates a peaceful, restful sound environment that allows you to enjoy a mellow mood of relaxation.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I would like it to be louder but it does help with noise.  I have been using a box fan for years and I don&#x27;t like do use the fan in the winter because it gets cold.  This machine is small and doesn&#x27;t take up the space a box fan does.  I hope in future models they will increase the sound.</li>
    <li> I have one for work (really helps with cubicle-itis) and one for home (drowns out the cicadas).  The work one goes with me whenever I travel, and hotel noise is a thing of the past.  It&#x27;s worth every penny for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> The device works great, but I really don&#x27;t like the sound of white noise. (Purchased on doctor&#x27;s recommendation)</li>
    <li> MARPAC works like a charm---mask not so much. It is thin and flimsy</li>
    <li> We bought this for our newborn baby&#x27;s room to help block out all the random house noise. I stole the sleepmask :-) Both work great!</li>
    <li> this thing works great. it&#x27;s perfect for those who don&#x27;t work normal hours, drowns out most sounds for a good nights or days sleep... a must have.</li>
    <li> We bought one of these for ourselves a couple years ago and I love it.  Purchased another one for our son and his wife and they were equally impressed.  Now son number two and his wife have added it to their Christmas list for us to buy for them!  Has multiple levels for volume which is great. Am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Love it, it still doesn&#x27;t drown out the walking from apartment above but between it and the furnace fan I can sleep, it&#x27;s a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> I have a horrible time sleeping without white noise, like a fan.  Consequently, when traveling I would have trouble sleeping.  This machine is perfect for travel as well as home use.  There are many levels of volume, so it can be tailored to the individual&#x27;s needs.  It is very compact and easy to pack in a suitcase for travel.  I would highly recommend this item.  It is worth every $ spent to be able to sleep away from my normal home environment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for client privacy just outside my office door which is the waiting room.  It works great and actually helps dull the sound coming in from the waiting room also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought one for my daughter who is a light sleeper and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect I am such a light sleeper I was hoping this would block out other noises,but it by itself was to much noise&lt;br /&gt;for me.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I expected and the sleeping mask was an extra bonus!  It&#x27;s not loud enough to cover up all the noise - but I think it definitely helps.  If you&#x27;re realistic in what you expect I think it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a bit expensive considering they sell cheaper models but it works wonderful and I think it&#x27;s money well spent. My neighbors complained of hearing intimate sounds coming from my apartment and so I decided to get a white noise machine. Well it works great and even keeps me from hearing all of their noise which I didn&#x27;t know was that bad until I couldn&#x27;t hear it any more :)</li>
    <li> THIS UNIT WAS A LITERALLY A LIFE SAVER FOR ME! WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST CONDO..........THE COMPLEX HAS ALWAYS BEEN REPORTED AS RESORT LIKE, IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA. AND BEAUTIFUL, THE ONE DOWN SIDE, FOR ME, WAS THE NOISE I COULD HEAR LATE AT NIGHT FROM THE UPPER UNIT, AND THE BREEZEWAY THAT RUNS THE COMPLEX CONNECITNG SEVERAL BUILDINGS AND THE POOL, SPA AND RESTROOM AREAS.  I&#x27;M A LITE SLEEPER, THINGS JUST WEREN&#x27;T WORKING FOR ME, UNTIL I SHARED MY STORY WITH ANOTHER OWNER ;-)  SHE SHARED HER SECRET, THE SLEEP MATE, I CALL IT MY DREAM MACHINE, THAT WAS BACK IN 1986, AND I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN WITHOUT ONE SINCE.  IN FACT MY DAUGHTER ALSO PURCHASED ONE, SHE PROVIDED CHILD CARE IN HER HOME, WHICH ALSO INCLUDED HER OWN CHILDREN, IT WAS A BLESSING FOR ALL, PROVIDING THE ABILITY OF A GOOD NAPS, REFRESHING AND SOUND SLEEP.     A NURSE FRIEND OF MINE, WHO PERFORMED DUTIES VIA A TRAVELING NURSE PROGRAM FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THESE STINTS INCLUDED ROOMMATES AND MULTIPLE UNIT BUILDINGS.  SHE CAME FOR A VISIT AND WAS INSTANTLY \\&quot;TURNED ON\\&quot; BY THE SLEEP MATE, MEANING A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP.  SHE BOUGHT ONE IMMEDIATELY, HAS SINCE ALWAYS USED HERS, EVEN ON THE OCCASIONAL VISIT TO MY HOME. I TRAVEL WITH MINE TOO, ADDITIONALLY, PERFECT WHEN VISITING MY DAUGHTER AND HER KIDS.    THE TERM\\&quot; WHITE NOIS\\&quot;E SEEMS STRANGE, BUT YOUR MIND DEALS WITH IT IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY, OTHER SIMILAR UNITS HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF \\&quot;WHITE NOISE,\\&quot; USUALLY RAIN, WATERFALLS, OCEAN SOUNDS, BUT TO ME AND MY MIND, I STILL SENSE THE MOOD AND TIMING AND BELIEVE MY MIND WOULD MAINTAIN A CERTAIN AWARENESS,WHERE AS, THE SLEEP MATE IS A CONSISTENT NOISE/TONE, THAT CAN BE SET TO VARIOUS LEVELS AND OR TONES.    I LOVE IT, AND WON&#x27;T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT, PERIOD!!! IT EVEN BEATS MY OWN PILLOW, WHICH I NOW LEAVE AT HOME ;-)  WIN, WIN, WIN ;)</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Made heavy duty, sounds like a fan...no chirping birds or running water... several speeds but no timer so don&#x27;t have to keep getting up and turning it back on.  Easy to travel with - I love it!</li>
    <li> If your used to a fan running and need the sound but not the air, this is an EXCELLENT product.</li>
    <li> I used to run a fan near the head of the bed to create some noise to block out the other night sounds, but as fans are not as noisy as they used to be (at least not until they are about to die), the fan was no longer cutting it so I tried one of these Marpac White Noise Machines. LOVE it! It sounds more like a fan than my fan did!</li>
    <li> Item has:  Two settings high and low.  Within both of these settings there are ways to turn the noise up and down and change the pitch or output. It sounds like a box fan.   It&#x27;s made of plastic which is okay.  The construction isn&#x27;t what I would call \\&quot;solid\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t flimsy.    A bit expensive, but not too bad.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon for a gift.</li>
    <li> This has been my best purchase of 2011, and I only ordered it mid-December.  This totally covers up the street noise from out front of my house and the freeway that is four blocks away...  I now find myself craving this noise whenever I get drowsy.  Ambien does squat for me, this device gets me at least several hours of sleep every night(I suffer with insomnia).  Great for naps too!  I only use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, so perhaps the model with only one speed setting would work for you instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with being a super light sleeper for years.  Little things would wake me up from the times the kids were very little to when they were teenagers sneaking in on creaky floors!  Then there is the obnoxious neighbor who has her TV volume at maximum all night long.  And then I bought this little machine.  What a lifesaver!!  I don&#x27;t think I have ever slept so well in a long, long time.  Worth every penny of the $50!</li>
    <li> the marpac sleepmate is my second one purchased.  i enjoyed the first one so much that i decided to permanently place one in my guest bedroom.  helpful for grandchildren sleepovers and naps, and for company comfort.    my review is low only because I did not get the advertised sleepmask with my shipment.  when I brought this to the attention of the seller, they offered to send me $5 , but that never happened either.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have the original Marpac Sleepmate from when our now 30-something children were toddlers.  We keep that one in our bedroom.  We just bought this latest version for our guest room.  Needless to say, we have found the Marpac sound machines to be VERY reliable.  We have tried other machines (for travel purposes)and found that this white noise type is the best for blocking noise and enabling restful sleep. The size is also perfect for almost any spot in the room.  (Smaller ones do not put out as much sound).</li>
    <li> Even at its most quiet setting, it still sounds like a jet engine taking off. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can use this.</li>
    <li> We have several of these in our home and LOVE them..Service and shipment was great.</li>
    <li> It all started with a noisy humidifer. When that broke, we turned on our bathroom exhaust fan to have noise while we slept. In order to conserve a little, we started looking into alternative options. It seems that those little noise makers with specific sounds got bad reviews, and you can pick up on the annoying loop. Not with this little gadget. It sounds a lot like our bathroom fan, but with a more smooth sound. The sound is consistant. It takes a while to get used to having noise while you sleep, but after you do there&#x27;s no going back. Oh, and ignore the guy that complained about the button. Seriously? You turn it on and don&#x27;t worry about it until morning. There&#x27;s just no pleasing some people!</li>
    <li> Sounded like I had a refrigerator running in my room. I tried and tried but couldn&#x27;t get it to produce a noise less annoying than my upstairs neighbors. Returned it and just continued to use my fan to drown out noise.</li>
    <li> I am happy I chose this product.  It works as advertised.  I sleep much better and my office is now free of the external noise from co-workers conversations.  I highly recommend.  I&#x27;m buying a second one so I don&#x27;t have to transport back and forth between home and office</li>
    <li> This little machine has really helped me sleep through the night,</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member who kept having naps and sleep disturbed by common household noises.  Looked on Amazon for white noise machines and found this little wonder.  Does a great job soothing and blocking out noises with the adjustable vents.  Well worth the money and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> The Marpac sound machine is being used by a child with&lt;br /&gt;Autism who has trouble falling to sleep at night.  Right&lt;br /&gt;now the machine is lulling him into full nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this maching for anyone out there who has&lt;br /&gt;a child on the Spectrum that has trouble going or staying&lt;br /&gt;asleep.  Very good machine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted/needed. My cousin has one of these and has used it for a long time for her kids naps.  She loves it and told me about it.  I just received mine today and, for the first time, my little girl WAS NOT woken up during either of her naps by her excitable and loud older brother :)  Worth every single penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:  It has a high and low setting on the switch.  You can also turn the top and sides to change the sound from a \\&quot;wind\\&quot; or \\&quot;fan\\&quot; sound to more of a soft \\&quot;hum\\&quot;. So it&#x27;s nice to be able to adjust what the white noise sounds like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: My cousin has had hers for over 3 years now and it still works just as great as when she first got it... she doesn&#x27;t leave home without it, even for over night trips.  I probably won&#x27;t either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 8 months of use:  my son loves this machine and picks it up and accidentally drops it on a regular basis.  It still works great in spite of daily drops on the floor.</li>
    <li> We have used sleep sound machines for a long time.  This was a gift for a friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It was a baby shower gift..and she LOVED it!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This device resolved my problem! It creates a uniform noise that puts you to sleep instantly. My house is located right next to a busy street. Ambulance noise is extremely common. But after installing this device, the noise level has gone down significantly(not completely!!!). I love this little device.</li>
    <li> We have two of these in our house, I love the white noise and they are durable. My first one is probably 7-8 years old and still going strong!!</li>
    <li> This noise machine is terrific. It makes a nice, soothing hushing noise; with two volume controls, you can mask nearly any unwanted sound. Especially great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nightly since purchase. The sound has been very soothing and helps block out noisy neighborhood.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know it is suppose to make noise, but I was hoping it would have a lower setting.  Seems like all of the settings are just a touch too noisy.  Works well though and does block out the noise from the neighboring offices.  A bit pricey considering what it does, but my boss paid for it, not me so can&#x27;t complain.  I wouldn&#x27;t have spent this much though.</li>
    <li> I have had this machine for almost 2 years, and I started using it when my daughter was a newborn. She was having trouble staying asleep through her sleep transitions, and this did the trick. This product was an easy solution for our family, and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it. The dual speed allows you to choose what level of white noise works best, and I use both speeds depending on the level of noise in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the fact that this is a great product, the customer service is OUTSTANDING. After 2 years of owning this product, I had a question about a warranty issue. Marpac took care of the (tiny) issue quickly and efficiently. It was the best customer service experience that I&#x27;ve ever had. Thank you, Marpac!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had many sound machines thru the years. this is the best one. i was worried it wasn&#x27;t loud enough, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> Just so you know you will not receive one that looks like this.  I ordered the Sleepmate 980 and got the dohm DS which is $10 cheaper.  I sent back and then replaced the order and again got the cheaper one.  Amazon must not be selling this anymore.  The version I got is actually the same (we have had 3 Sleepmates and they are awesome) but DON&#x27;T spend the extra $10 or if you do make sure it looks like this picture with the Sleepmate on it.  Amazon was wonderful and helped out and gave me refund, (I did keep this one) as always but wanted to let you know.</li>
    <li> This machine is a must-have for anyone who has trouble with noisy neighbors or a generally noisy neighborhood. I use it at night and sleep so soundly. I also use it to help concentrate on work if there&#x27;s a lot going on around me (I work from home and between street noise, gardeners, etc., this thing is a huge help). Only problem is that I&#x27;m so conditioned to sleep with it that I find myself getting sleepy whenever I use it—even if I&#x27;m using it in the middle of the day to work! Still, totally worth it and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> It is suppose to have two volume levels, but seems like they are the same. Much too loud! Instead of helping me to sleep, it hinders my sleep because of how loud it is.</li>
    <li> Works great in my office.</li>
    <li> Had to have a second one for traveling.  Can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without it.  Blocks out sooooo much noise making it easy to fall asleep</li>
    <li> Simple, solid, and effective.  We use the Dohm nightly, and it truly helps with the outside noise that we would normally hear in the morning (neighbor&#x27;s chickens).  Life saver!</li>
    <li> I have this device just outside of my office door, in the hall of our clinic.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job of masking the voices during hypnotherapy sessions with clients.&lt;br /&gt;it also makes a great conversation piece as clients are entering the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do wish I could dial down the volume just a wee bit more than is possible now</li>
    <li> Love it for pure white noise.  But it has a narrow range of volume control.  Would be nice to handle that a little better</li>
    <li> I use this every night at home, and take it with me whenever I travel. I have had it for over a year now, and have had no problems with it. My husband snores, and this masks the sound enough to where i can fall asleep.</li>
    <li> This is basically just like the Hammacher Schlemmer version without the lifetime warranty.  The volume control consists of turning the outer casing clockwise so that more holes are open or less holes are open for the white noise to come out.  it does mask general noise but not loud noise.  good at blocking traffic noises when you&#x27;re staying at a hotel, etc. and providing general background noise.</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  It blocks out distractions when I am reading. It is just loud enough to block noises that would otherwise wake me up while I&#x27;m sleeping. I use to use a box fan to block noises but this is so much better and easy to pack!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son&#x27;s bedroom.  He sleeps so well every night.  I can make any noise in my house and not worried that my little one will wake up.  Best purchase EVER!!</li>
    <li> I use it in the waiting room of my talk therapy office.  Patients are so happy I got it.  Before they would wait in the hall bc it was too easy to hear what was being talked about in the treatment rooms.  It works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> We love this product so much, this is our second one for the baby&#x27;s room.  It drowns out the road noise (we live right on the highway), and the normal noises in the house to keep the little one asleep.</li>
    <li> Purchased through Amazon for $55 with free S/H.  It arrived in two days via Prime shipping.  It only work for 2 minutes until it started generating a loud metal grinding noise within - called the manufacture and confirmed that was a defective unit to which they processed a warantee replacement right away.  The first two minutes was too short to test it&#x27;s functionality but I could tell a slight different in the surrounding as if I was wearing a noise cancelling headphone and it operates very quietly as I would expect if I want to sleep with it.  The replacement still took 10-day ground shipping to arrive.  When I turned the new unit on again, all this it did was generating a very loud fan-like hissing noise (not so much of the air came out of the vent though).  This fan like hissing sound continues as long as the unit is turned on (quiet annoy to a point I would not use it as a sleep aid).  I tested in my office environment where I am surrounded by people who work in his/her own cubicles, different people who sit at least 15&#x27; away kept asking me what that noise was.  After I explained to them what this unit was suppose to do, we did a few test runs.  As a result, the replacement unit was also a defect as it did not have that instant effect as soon as it is turned on (no metal grind this time) and all office conversation could still be heard clearly as usual in the addition to this annoy hissing sound in the background.  I lost patience to trying for the third round because each time when they process it, they only go with the cheapest (longest) shipping unlike when I first paid for the merchandise I was able to use my two day Prime shipping benefit.  Amazon process the return and refund as soon as I reported the issue.</li>
    <li> Our entire family now has one of these in each bedroom to block out noise while trying to sleep. We even take it on vacations!  The two speed feature is great and the motor sound is an even one without any rattling that could possibly interrupt sleep.  Just a great item to have and even give as a gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this because using a fan was drying me out. This makes a fan sound and I love it. We also use one for our infant son.</li>
    <li> We purchased this white noise sound machine after reading reviews on a variety of products.  We intend to use this a lot, so we went with the better quality machine.  So far it has been great.  We highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I contemplated the single speed version to save some coin, but I&#x27;m glad I went with the dual speed. The low setting is perfect (the single speed version only has the high setting). No need for a fan anymore (especially in the winter)!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The one I just pruchased was for my son&#x27;s room (he is a light sleeper) and it works great for white noise. The only downside, is it has a burning-plastic smell after running it for awhile, which I think may be defective. I previously bought one for my office (its a very quiet trailer building) to provide some sound-masking and white noise and I have used it for 3yrs without any issue. Great product!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a light sleeper like me, this thing will change your life. I live in the city and my 2nd floor bedroom is adjacent to the building stairwell and faces the street. Very rarely does anything wake me up aside from the occasional extra loud motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I know people use them for their babies&#x27; rooms, but I read that they can sometimes be too loud for their delicate little eardrums, so maybe look into that before putting it next to your baby&#x27;s crib.</li>
    <li> my mother couldn&#x27;t sleep without this.Neither can my daughter now</li>
    <li> I have slept with a fan on for over 15 years.  The difficulty with that is not having a fan during vacations or business trips.  This is perfectly compact and convenient to fit in a suitcase.  The only issue I have is I would prefer more noise level choices.</li>
    <li> Living on the first floor of an apartment that is on a pretty busy street this magical machine manages to help me fall and stay asleep all night.  It is also extremely portable and has a few settings.</li>
    <li> This machine keeps me sane. I go to bed earlier than my boyfriend, and this machine helps me sleep through noise. It&#x27;s not fancy - no choices of waves or mountain streams, but it does produce the right background noise to block out other things. It doesn&#x27;t block out all noises, but it will certainly help light sleepers who need to drown out noise elsewhere in the house. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> We have used one of these machines for years and love the way it masks outside (and inside) noises.  Bought this one for the guest room and have already had complements on having it available for our visitors.</li>
    <li> Have to put it on the carpeted floor, as anything else ends up vibrating along with it.  The sponge on the bottom does not protect the surfaces upon which it sits.  In addition to the traditional sound of air, there is a bit of a whine.  Also, unlike the advertised picture, this item did not come with a sleeping masque as promised.  Still waiting for that masque.  Despite these shortcomings, it blocks out a few noisy neighbors or at least provides an alternative for listening.</li>
    <li> This white noise machine drains out the sounds that keep you awake at night. There is a bird that would keep me awake and a train that would go by now and then. it also drains out the sound form TV&#x27;s in other rooms or people talking so you can concentrate on your reading or work. It was well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the sleep mask but I don&#x27;t really care.  The sound machine works, was in new condition and was shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I have cleaned my glasses and every item of jewelry I own.  It does an amazing job. I would recommend getting the liquid cleaner.</li>
    <li> We have thoroughly enjoyed our MARPAC SleepMate.  The sound level is easily adjusted which provides the perfect atmosphere for our sleeping comfort.  We highly recommend it!  Happy Zzzzzz&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Minus 1 star since you do not make a dual-voltage option.  People travel... people travel.  Sometimes a journey will encounter multiple outlet types and voltages.  My computer, shaver and camera battery chargers all have dual-voltage chargers to handle these situations.  Can you imagine trying to carry TWO of these sound screens for a trip?</li>
    <li> Machine blocks most of the noise coming from the college dweebs living in the adjacent townhouse.  I like the two-speed selection option and the ability to somewhat adjust the resonance of the sound output.  A good and effective product which I believe was well worth the money spent on it.</li>
    <li> Great quality, and I love that there are NOT extra bells and whistles, just 2 settings that drown out noise!  Great for new babies and loud older siblings!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this machine!!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  Helps block out the noise with a calming white noise effect.  I bring it to hotels and on my cruise.  Definitely helps me because I am such a light sleeper.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and use it every night. I live it a mildly loud apartment building. I do, however, feel I could use two. I need one by my door to the hall and one by the window. I wish it were louder.</li>
    <li> Blocks out sounds...Exactly why I ordered this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
    <li> Have one for the master bedroom, and just bought one for 16 year old son and 20 year daughter old who is at college.  Daughter&#x27;s apartment is close to campus and near frat, so she loves it!  After having a lot of noise to sleep with in Afghanistan, I just need the white noise to provide some noise, and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> We own two of these now, one for each child.  Are older one is still working for our 5 year old daughter and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this idea got such great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) INSUFFICIENT NOISE: First, it&#x27;s not loud enough even in the highest possible setting. It might work if you like white noise as an ADDITIONAL noise but don&#x27;t purchase this to block out noise. It&#x27;s clearly not loud enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) OZONE GAS: Second, it might even be harmful to run this. Every time I turn it on, it generates an \\&quot;ozone\\&quot; gas type smell. I know this device is causing it because as I stick my nose closer to it, the ozone smells gets stronger. The ozone smell goes away when I turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ozone gas is generated sparks by some electric motors, such as the one used in this. My blender also generates that smell but I run that for less than 1 minute. I am concerned for the long-term health risks of using this item since one obviously runs this for more than 1 minute. Regardless of health risks, the ozone smell is very unpleasant in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously recommend an electronic/digital \\&quot;nature sounds\\&quot; sound conditioner instead of this. I saw one in an office and really wished I had bought that instead.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I have a two year old and a two month old and they both take great naps and sleep through the night thanks to this. We live on a busy road and it keeps the sounds out with a constant fan like sound,very peaceful!</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  I purchased one for my bedroom to help cover up noises that were awakening me.  It works like a charm.  Since then I have discovered that I can use it to cover up the noise of thunder so my dog is not scared.  I liked the device so well that I got one for my home office.  This one makes it easy to concentrate even though others in the house are watching TV etc.  I recommended to a friend and she says that she has never slept better than since buying one.</li>
    <li> This is such a great small portable noise machine.  It is perfect for our son&#x27;s room and easy to take with us on road trips.  I love it so much I want one for my room.</li>
    <li> Lots of adjustments so you can change the tone/pitch to your liking. I have been sleeping great, even the dog likes it! LOL! Helps level out the sound of my husband snoring. I can finally sleep, Yay!</li>
    <li> Initially I got this because I am a very light sleeper and the sound of my air conditioner was keeping me awake to the point that I had started wearing ear plugs.  After purchasing this I have not had to use them since.  They also have the added benefit of covering the sounds of my husband snoring and my cat meowing outside my bedroom door.  I have yet to see how well it will cover over the sound of snow plows going down my street.  The sound is adjustable with a turn of the body and gives just a nice whirring sound that is easy to tune out.  This is worth every penny.  I sleep in much better on the weekends now that I use this.</li>
    <li> This is way too loud. You will be better off purchasing an air purifier or just put your AC on fan only. What a waist of money and I missed the return window.</li>
    <li> I love this! My kids each asked for one for their bedroom after hearing mine. Now we all have our own. Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my mom because of her difficult to sleep due the surrounding noises such as dogs, car traffic, neighbors playing music, etc. She has been used the device since the day it arrives; she really love it; she says that the machine hides most of the noises producing like a relaxing buzz.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you need when you have grandchildren that are light sleepers. I had another unit from HomeMed that had more features but was broken in no time.  My daughter recommended the Marpac unit because of it&#x27;s heavy duty construction.  Not many features but it works wonders and allows you different sound volumes simply by turning the top housing.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Have 2 of them, one for travel.</li>
    <li> MADE IN THE USA!!! Silence may be golden for some people, but not others. It is very helpful in me getting to sleep at night. I am serving on a retreat at the end of the month. And I am really grateful to have this wonderful product along for the ride. It will certainly be such a great big help to me &amp; maybe a few others. I do not know where it has been, but I do know I would really be lost w/o it. Wish I would have ordered one sooner. Did I mention that it is MADE IN THE USA !!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a dream! Hate being without it. My kids love theirs too! I recommended it to some family members and they are happy as well.</li>
    <li> This machine has made a big difference in my sleeping life. I can sleep longer through the night with fewer interruptions. I can nap without hearing my neighbor&#x27;s child play flute while taking a rest during the day. Also great for professional use-but home life has gotten better.</li>
    <li> We love this white noise machine. We use it in the nursery for baby and it is a life-saver! It has two \\&quot;speeds\\&quot; (one almost seems louder than the other) and we use the high speed and works great. We have used it every single nap, night, and even my husband and I are lulled to sleep by it when we hear it through the baby monitor (and yes, we CAN still hear baby over the white noise sound). We have it plugged in to the wall and it has run hours and hours and hours over the last several months and has never faultered. We traveled with it and it worked great then to. We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This machine delivers a pleasing, perfectly pitched white noise at just the right volume to help block out extraneous noises.  It is perfect for home or office.</li>
    <li> I got one for my wife because I snore. I brought it to work to show our PM. We now have a whole office full of them. Probably around 12 of them.</li>
    <li> I now own 2 and have given 3 as gifts.  If you just want the white noise sound without all the other music, etc from other sound machines this is the one for you.  I use one in the hallway between the kids rooms and it keeps them from waking each other up at night when one cries or gets up early.  I even take one with me when I travel and put by door in hotel room and it blocks out any hallway noise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &#x27;sleep with a fan&#x27; type of guy, but have had a run of bad luck buying a fan that lasts longer than a month.  Rather than waste more money buying fans that don&#x27;t work I figured I&#x27;d try a sound machine.  This was more than I wanted to pay, but the cheaper ones got bad reviews so I sprung for this one.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months so far and it has been great.  Fills the room with a soothing sound that drowns out all the other little noises so I can sleep.  I like the adjustability so I can change the pitch and volume of the sound from time to time, and it feels well built so I expect it to last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted.  Easily found the setting best for me, it took less than a minute.  The fan puts out pink noise vs. white noise (Look it up if you don&#x27;t know the difference)  My only concern is the switch, it feels cheap, so I wonder how long will it last?</li>
    <li> when I first turned it on there is a very pleasing, neutral, rushing of air sound that is fantastic, but then, to my great disappointment, the electric motor that runs the fan emits a penetrating high pitch whine/buzz, making this item useless for me, without prompting my significant other also heard the whine and said &amp;#34;too bad, because the air sound is great&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, the wrong item was shipped, the single speed instead of the dual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;likes:&lt;br /&gt;-simple concept; soothing analog air sound&lt;br /&gt;-simple retro/future styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dislike:&lt;br /&gt;-high price for tiny fan in a plastic box&lt;br /&gt;-high pitch motor sound</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Arrived on time and is everything it was advertised to be. Works like a charm. I crank it on high and sleep like a baby!!!</li>
    <li> Old school product works the best!</li>
    <li> The main advantage of this over just using a portable fan is that it is smaller than most fans, and enclosed so that you don&#x27;t have air blowing around. It does have some limited pitch and tone adjustability, but it&#x27;s not that significant compared to what you could get with a fan. Overall, I like the product and it does help me sleep.  Oh, and the sleep mask is just okay. It&#x27;s pretty thin, not very cushy, and a little tight if you have a big noggin.</li>
    <li> This replaced the &amp;#34;no name&amp;#34; bargain machine and works so much better. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I like this unit a lot.  I use it to create noise near my bed while I sleep and it does a very good job of filtering out most sounds from outside my room.  It&#x27;s easy to use, with really just two volume levels on the on and off switch, but a very large selection of variations of pitch and volume from adjusting the sides and top of the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the unit fairly close to my bed and so I don&#x27;t have it turned way up so loud noises from outside still disturb me.  I have not experimented with moving the unit away from my bed and turning it up to see if it blocks out really loud noises.  But for most day to day sounds, it works really well.</li>
    <li> I took this with me on some overseas travel.  Worked fine with a step down transformer (220V to 110V) in South America.  Packs light and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the suitcase.  Did the white noise trick for sleep.  Could have been engineered with a bit more white noise though for those of us who like to block everything out.</li>
    <li> This sound machine has been a life-saver or better yet a sleep saver! I have always been a very light sleeper and that only got  worse after having children( mother&#x27;s ears in high gear)! I also have 2 young children with sensory processing disorder. They have difficulties filtering out sounds which make it very difficult for them to 1) fall asleep, and 2) stay asleep, which has resulted in many nights of interrupted sleep for them and my husband and I! Lack of sleep&#x3D;cranky kids/parents!   I first noticed these sound machines in doctors offices being used for patient confidentiality. I observed that they really did work at cancelling out background noise, but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they could be purchased outside of the medical arena! These sound machines were recommended in a resource book, can&#x27;t recall the book, that offered some tools to help people with sensory difficulties related to sleep/sound/noise.   What a difference! We all sleep much better! Less nighttime waking, and if one of the kids gets up earlier than the others, they can play without disturbing the other&#x27;s sleep. We have used this every night and naptime since it arrived! What a difference it has made. Also the eye mask is great for me since light interrupts my sleep as well. I&#x27;ve actually been able to sleep past sunrise since I started using it! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!! I highly recommend this sound machine!</li>
    <li> I know the point is to drown out other noises, and we have slept with white noise for years but even on the quietest setting with the device placed across the room I couldn&#x27;t sleep with the roar of this thing- even with a pillow over my head.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my fan, because it can dry my throat out pretty bad and then wake up with a soar throat. I remember having a similar model when I was younger and how well it worked, so I purchased another. It works great as a white noise generator! Better then any fan I&#x27;ve used for the purpose. To be honest I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite loud enough, considering I sleep with it 1ft from my head, however I do have a rather noisy environment for it to contend with. It was definitely a great investment, that I think provides more sound/uninterrupted (drowning out little noises) sleep, which makes the day that much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never heard one of these, give them a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It may also be good to note the top spins in two different places to change the air flow through it, and provide you with a real \\&quot;customizable\\&quot; white noise, at the right volume and frequency one might desire.</li>
    <li> This machine has a nice rushing air sound, but it will not block out my husband&#x27;s snoring.  It definitely is nice to use during the winter so that you don&#x27;t have to use a fan and get cold in the winter time.  It is very soothing, when my husband isn&#x27;t snoring.  Also very good in helping block my tinitus - ringing of the ears, when I am trying to sleep.</li>
    <li> We used another sound machine before and a CD. This is much better and much less obtrusive. Get it if you&#x27;re a new parent, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Wife says my snoring is not bothering her with this on and I am sleeping much better.....maybe because she is not pulling my pillow.</li>
    <li> We like the white noise to sleep by.  Bought 2 -- one for travel.</li>
    <li> Hmmm. I didn&#x27;t get the sleep mask, but I love my noise machine!!masks other noises in the room very well!  Nhad tried the Brookstone $130 noise machine and prefer this one!</li>
    <li> We sleep a lot better now.</li>
    <li> We love our Marpac Dohm.  Our kids have been able to sleep better and sleep longer with the white noise.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be loud enough but it&#x27;s just right.  I plan on ordering another one or the travel size one.</li>
    <li> We have had the same wonderful  &amp;#34;MarPac&amp;#34;  (Sleep Mate) white noise machine for 12 years, still works like a charm. I was worried it might stop working so I ordered a second one just in case!  We tried out the new one and it is just as great as the first one. If the first one ever stops working we won&#x27;t be sleep deprived. Got that covered!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, nice company!!</li>
    <li> My Husband works nights, so I got him this to help sleep during the day. With the road beside our house it gets noisy, let alone when the kids are home.&lt;br /&gt;Great item - 2 levels of volume and sturdy. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> bought it for my son, he liked it when he was home for the holiday, took it to school, waiting for long term results</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the fan that I was using in my daughters room to mute out the house noises when she slept. What a great purchase. Mutes out just enough so that she may sleep.</li>
    <li> We have one of these in each bedroom in our house. We are so used to the white noise now that we can&#x27;t sleep without it! It works great in our kids rooms too, so they don&#x27;t hear the TV or other household noise when they are trying to sleep. It even keeps our preschooler from waking up when the baby cries in the room next to him. I also like that it is small enough to easily pack when we take trips overnight. We sleep much better in hotels when the sound is familiar.</li>
    <li> Love this item.  I always sleep good with this turned on.  I have bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it serves its purpose very well.  The dual speed has the higher setting which is what we use exclusively.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of noise and works great. I take it with me on all the trips I take, because I also have one I keep at home. Would not leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. It&#x27;s very soothing. Just wish it could be a little louder (even when it&#x27;s on full volume, it&#x27;s still not as loud as I&#x27;d like it to be).</li>
    <li> We live on a busy city street and this machine helps drown out the loud buses, honking and yelling idiots. :)  It has two settings, but I do wish it could be louder.</li>
    <li> We have 3 of these and can&#x27;t sleep without them.  Love this white noise.  Easy to take on trips, too.</li>
    <li> I live in apartments with very thin walls.  I usually have a hard time sleeping because my upstair neighbors sound like elephants when they walk.  No problem anymore thanks to this little machine.</li>
    <li> We love our Dohm white noise machine!  We bought it after our small, battery-operated machine needed new batteries for the second time in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine has a consistent soothing white noise that you can customize to your liking with a simple twist of the top or sides.  There is no looping of sounds, as it does not play a recording.  Our 5 month old son goes to bed easily and sleeps for 10 hours with this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has traveled with us several times in the 4 months we&#x27;ve owned it.  It helps block out unwanted noise from unfamiliar surroundings.</li>
    <li> This is a good piece. I live in a noisy corner apartment and this helps block out a significant amount of the street noise at night from my room.</li>
    <li> This product works just as described.  We use it at home and take it with us when we travel.  The only negative I would give is that the sleep mask was not included as promised or shown.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. There are two volume levels and other adjustments to get just the right amount of background noise you need.  I received it right away.</li>
    <li> My son suffers from tinnitus and PTSD.  This has been a great sleep aid for him.</li>
    <li> I like this sound machine. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. It has 2 settings. I&#x27;ve been using the higher one which is really helpful blocking out street noise but I wish it was however a bit louder. Our walls/ceiling is very thin so even with the sound machine on I still wake up to my neighbor or his cat walking around upstairs. As for previous reviewers I can say the eye mask was not included in my shipment either. Helpful product but next time probably ill buy something with more options to change the volume up/down.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for the area we have used it.  It is a large area and there is no insulation in the walls so we are using it so we can&#x27;t hear the people in the next office talking.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I&#x27;m a light sleeper, so I bought this product to drown out the noises from outside my window (i.e. birds chirping, people talking, garbage trucks, loud music from cars, etc...). I&#x27;ve been using this device for a few months and I now have a sound sleep. I took the product out of the box, did not need to to make any adjustments, and it works like a charm. Lives up to my expectations and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave my Son-in-law one when he was working nights and he said it was great. On visiting them I tried it out and loved it so now I have my own. I have a clock radio with many different sounds available but I always seem to hone in on 1 sound in the rain, or waves or any of the other sounds , it was like listening to a ticking clock. The Dohm DS has that one constant sound and I drop off to sleep right away. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this noise machine but they were dashed in seconds after plugging it in.  People, this machine may work as a white noise machine...if you TAPED it to your head.  I bought this because we live in an area where homes are being built nearby and I wanted to drown out the noise in my baby&#x27;s bedroom.  I immediately returned this and bought just a small fan for half the price and it works WAY better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these; one for myself and one for my daughter. We are both light sleepers. Little noises would wake us up. Not anymore! We have both been sleeping like babies for a month solid now! Sweet!</li>
    <li> I have had various speaker-based sound machines and they are far inferior to this mechanical device. It is small enought to fit in my carry-on suitcase for travel. I purchased a 120 volt unit for home and a 220 volt unit for an upcoming trip to Greece.  I was gonna use a EU power adapter but have read so many disaster stories about them smoking, I figured the $60 is a relatively small travel expense.  I really need the white noise when I travel so didn&#x27;t want to risk not having a working sleepmate.  I give 4 stars because of the company&#x27;s power supply shortcoming; The company should develop a universal power unit, like for a laptop so I don&#x27;t need to buy two sleepmates, and hardly ever get to use the EU model as I travel there infrequently.</li>
    <li> The sleep machine works great. With the two high and low settings combined with the change in sounds as you turn the collar for adjustments, you can always find the level of white noise to suit you.  I have an original sleepmate that is over 20yrs old and it is still going strong.  The new one is only a cosmetically updated design of the original and works just as well. I like it best for blocking out the television noises from the other rooms in the house when I am trying to sleep.</li>
    <li> I use this machine in the room where my grand kids sleep when they are over . They are use to the sound of a fan . It works great for that and it&#x27;s small and not bulky like a fan ..</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it.  Small, two volume setting, My wife bought it as we live in a VERY small house with two kids and I work overnight and need to sleep during the day. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work as well, but I am able to sleep better since. No complaints on my part.</li>
    <li> I never sleep without it!  Perfect white noise and levels for adjusting... This is the third machine of this type I have bought.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better we sleep with our white noise machine. We had one for many years and it finally wore out. It was then we found out how sleep was not the same without it so we ordered the MARPAC Dohm-DS  Dual Speed machine. Ahhhh, peaceful sleep again.</li>
    <li> Great for helping to mask noise.  Produces two levels of adjustable white noise( think the noise shhhhhh makes) to mask environmental noise.  I use it to mask noise from outside my apartment while I sleep and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help drown out noises in my 1 year olds room and it does the trick!!! Over the summer we were using a fan but this works without the cold air for the winter.</li>
    <li> Best sounding white-noise I have ever heard in a machine.  It helps me to feel relaxed.</li>
    <li> The Marpac arrived in excellent condition. I ordered it to mask conversations in a poorly noise insulated environment. It works extremely well for this use.</li>
    <li> Sounds like a fan but no breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Might want to select the machine with the dual speed settings as the higher setting might be too loud.  Have mine behind a door of an adjacent bathroom.  Both settings work for me.  I set the machine to the higher setting when rain is expected overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Takes a delicate touch to turn off the unit but you will get the hang of this after a week. Could connect to an extension cord with an on/off switch if this is a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After doing plenty of research, I am glad that I selected this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Eye mask works great after an eye exam requiring dilation.</li>
    <li> The MARPAC Dohm-DS Dual Speed White Noise Machine is by far the best that I&#x27;ve used.  The sound is consistent and I like the variable sounds you can create by changing the air flow.  I live on a busy street and the road noise early in the morning was causing sleep disruptions.  While I can still hear some of the sounds, this machine effectively blocks out much of it and is a relaxing sound to fall asleep to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a small, portable, white noise machine.</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  My husband and I can&#x27;t sleep without it!  I will always have a white noise machine and MARPAC makes a great one.</li>
    <li> Great item, got it quick like it  fine. Nicely made item does the job. Welcome addition to my collection. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This machine is great if you need to drown out background noise.  It is compact and can fit into a suitcase for travel.  I have had no trouble getting it through airport security.</li>
    <li> This device provides excellent white noise to help me sleep.  It&#x27;s just loud enough to drown out the persistent tinnitus that I have to deal with.  Generally, I use the higher (louder) speed, but if my kids are having trouble going to sleep I put it in their room on the lower setting.  Rotating the casing of the unit allows you to adjust the tone of the noise until you find a tone that is pleasing to you.  I have tried other digital ambient noise generators in the past and I could always hear the audio track recycle at the end of the loop.  This machine is mechanical so the looping is not an issue.  It&#x27;s built to last - mine has been going for nine years.  If the one I have now ever fails, I&#x27;m getting another one.  I may even buy a couple more for my kids.  Update:  I&#x27;ve had it, and run it almost nightly for 16 years, and it started rattling a bit. I took the top off and dusted it with my can-o-woosh duster and saw that one of the plastic mounting brackets for the motor had cracked. I superglued that thing back together and reassembled it and I&#x27;m back to perfect white noise. I wish this company made cars.</li>
    <li> Works as disclosed. I use mine daily and like it.</li>
    <li> I now how have two of these sound machines and love them.  I&#x27;ve tried several noise/sound machines and this one by far works for me and my family.  I really liked the sleep mask too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this white noise machine when my son was a newborn for his room and it helped tremendously with his sleeping (we live close to our neighbors and there&#x27;s a lot of outside noise). We still use it every night!</li>
    <li> I loved mine as I&#x27;ve always had trouble sleeping. When my daughter said she was bothered by the noise in her dorm room I recommended this and got her one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said it took a week or so to get used to it but can&#x27;t fall a sleep without it now. This one is just like the one I had about 40 years ago. You can adjust the pitch and speed of this white sound machine which can help a user customize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended - a very solid 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th SleepMate I&#x27;ve had in 24 years. I use this everynight at home, hotel, daughters house and it is much better than the \\&quot;looping\\&quot; sounds you can get on a digital system. This is like the loud fan you turn on to drowned out the sounds around you...without the air movement...which would probably just stir up dust. It is perfect for the sleep hygiene you need to unwind at the end of the day. When you travel, take an extension cord for those rooms that don&#x27;t have easy access to outlets (most are getting better, but I travel with a power strip AND extension cord).&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SleepMate, the best Nurses Continuing Education class information I ever received was this recommendation.</li>
    <li> I have always been a light sleeper and have found white noise (like a window fan) helpful in the past, so decided to give this a try. I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love this machine! It&#x27;s small enough to tuck into my suitcase, so I have been taking it with me when I travel, but I use it every night. I opened the slits up all the way and I keep it turned to the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting and it does the trick. Personally, I don&#x27;t know why you would use one of the lower settings, but I suppose everyone is different, so it&#x27;s probably a good thing that it has those options.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this to help her sleep and it is just the right amount of noise. we don&#x27;t hear it across the hall and it eliminates the need for a fan blowing constantly. perfect for those who need a little help drifting off.</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s a noise-making fan, all right. It seems well made and the tonal variations are pleasant enough. I wish there was a way to make it a *bit* quieter, as if you have good hearing (like I do) you may find even the lower settings rather intrusive in small rooms.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter was having trouble sleeping with noise in the house until we got this. It really does blank out most distracting noises such as conversation, TV, appliances, and so on.</li>
    <li> I am now able to sleep all the way through the night.&lt;br /&gt;It diminishes the disturbing noises and has brought peace.</li>
    <li> Love it. Best night&#x27;s sleep! Would recommend this to anyone havig trouble sleeping or night shift workers. Wouldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this MARPAC Dohm-DS Electro White Noise machine and another brand because I can&#x27;t sleep with the television on or people talking. This is not loud enough to help and is bulky. Glad I bought another brand that is smaller &amp; absolutely blows this one away. Will keep it &amp; probably resell. It just doesn&#x27;t do the job like another brand. See my reviews.</li>
    <li> My entire family is hooked on using these to sleep with at night.  They are wonderful!  I&#x27;d rather they weren&#x27;t so pricey, but well worth the comfort &amp; soothing white noise to lull you to sleep every night.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and it sounds great but there is hardly any difference in the volume of the sound between the 2 settings.  A little too loud for me. Had to set it in the closet and that worked well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone who likes/needs white noise to sleep.  I travel and would not be able to sleep without it.  Would purchase again and recommend for anyone who needs the white noise to rest.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my college daughter who has to have noise to sleep.  She was using a loud fan, but this works just a good.  I would definitely recommend this if you need &#x27;noise&#x27; to sleep.</li>
    <li> Love this dual speed Electro-mechanical noise machine/sound.  Been using it every night and will order more soon.  Totally recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This was indeed worth the prize.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect white noise machine especially if you don&#x27;t want to hear planes, trains and babbling brooks.</li>
    <li> This machine drounds out outside noise perfectly.  Very helpful for falling and staying asleep soundly.  Highly recommend this product.  Great pricing also.</li>
    <li> Living near a street with a lot of traffic in NYC the MARPAC Dohm helps with car, truck, occasional airplane noises in falling asleep and staying asleep when the windows are open.  For my particular use it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years, and it is still working well and going strong.  It&#x27;s the standard noise machine, and wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other.</li>
    <li> I use my MARPAC Dohm-DS Dual Speed E-M machine every night, year-round, to sleep.  It seems very durable--have been using 2 or 3 years now with no problems (outlasts fans which I used to use).  I also have one I take on vacations with me.  If you need a relaxing, non-obtrusive, consistent sound, not too loud and not too quiet, to fall asleep and stay asleep, this is the product you need.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Objective Tinnitus and the white noise machine gives me something to focus on other than the noise in my head.  I&#x27;ve been married for nineteen years, and my husband has become so used to sleeping with one running, he can&#x27;t sleep without it being turned on.  The same thing happened when I lived with my son and his wife and they got used to sleeping with one.  The whole family has become dependent upon this machine to get a good night&#x27;s (or daytime) sleep.  Love it.</li>
    <li> this is a great machine, the second one I have bought.... I purchased the first one three and a half years ago when my grand son was born... It ran every night and sometimes all day without a problem... the old one still worked, but wouldn&#x27;t start every time; because of a flat spot on the armature...</li>
    <li> This helps drown out any noise and provides the perfect sound for sleeping. Bought them for all my bedrooms! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I own two of these now, one in my baby&#x27;s room and one in our room. I am an EXTREMELY light sleeper and this sound machine in our room helps drown out some of the slightest noises during the night, and my baby is 1 and 1/2 now and she can not go to sleep without her sound machine on!  So much so that we just ordered a third one for daycare so she can take a nap there during the say!!  she will not sleep with out this machine on!!&lt;br /&gt;This one is different than all the ones you can buy at target or Walmart- those all have this repetitive reverberating pattern in the background that drives me insane!!!  But because if the quality and craftsmanship of the material in these sound machines, they just make a very nice tonal white noise. HIGHLY RECOMMEND- you get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an air filter machine in my room (really just for the white noise) for years but I&#x27;m tired of the bulky thing in my room. A friend had one of these dual-speed white noise machines and I loved it. It works great, make just the right volume of &#x27;noise&#x27; and I sleep better.</li>
    <li> Good product, well made and exactly as advertised. For us the noise wasn&#x27;t close enough to a true fan sound, which is what we were after. We returned ours because of this,  but if you are looking for white noise I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
    <li> This item is compact so it can go pretty much anywhere in a room and easy for traveling.  I used this to transition my baby from the white noise of the TV being on all night to this.  It worked right away! She slept just as well if not better as she did with the TV on since this item does not create extra light.  It has multiple volume settings depending on the amount of air you ahve beign released.  The volume can get loud so it covers the trucks that drive by our house all night and used to wake her up. I LOVE it! It is expensive, but it is so worth it!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my best friend who suffers from PTSD and whos sleep is easily disturbed by the slightest sounds in the house. She says it&#x27;s the best gift she has ever recieved. They forgot to include the \\&quot;face mask\\&quot;, though.</li>
    <li> We simply love it. It probobly won&#x27;t knock out someone doing construction next door but it worked as promised. We are now sleeping through the night.</li>
    <li> We love these machines and have one in our room as well as our children&#x27;s rooms. They work well to block out unwanted noise and sooth you to sleep.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had our original sound machine for over 10 years, and it runs every night, and still runs like new.  We bought a second one for the kids.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Use in baby&#x27;s nursery to drown out noises and it helped tremendously</li>
    <li> This white noise machine works amazingly well. The tone is almost infinitely adjustable making it easy to find a sound that works for you. The only drawback for travel is it&#x27;s size. It is about as big as 50 CDs stacked up.</li>
    <li> Loving this... using it in my nursery and it is working like a charm!</li>
    <li> My husband and I sleep with one going every night.  Blocks out the unnecessary noises that keeps you awake at night.  In turn, both of my grandchildren have them in their bedrooms so they don&#x27;t wake up easily.  Started using them at birth.  Excellent.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Have had several &#x27;noise machines&#x27; &amp; this on is by far the best one. Highly recomment for anyone. Great buy.</li>
    <li> My husband needed something to help him fall asleep!  This did the trick.  It helps him clear his mind and fall asleep.  Very good at masking out other sounds.  Soothing sound of air rushing.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted this particular machine because the sound is not a &amp;#34;recording&amp;#34; that loops again and again. My big debate was whether I needed the dual speed.  In the end I decided the extra cost was comparatively small and have found the need to use both loudness choices at different times.  So for me it was a wise choice to buy the dual speed as not being able to make it softer or louder when the need arises would have defeated the purpose of having it in the first place!</li>
    <li> The only problem is I have a tough time getting to sleep if I do not have it with me on a trip.  Very soothing sound and puts me to sleep immediately.</li>
    <li> Good, Good, good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was good, good, good, good, good and good.  And good..And also, it was good, good, good and good./</li>
    <li> Used this machine for 15+years nightly in bedrm. Some noise gets through but helps to block apt. living, sounds.&lt;br /&gt;Also used in my doc&#x27;s office in all of the rooms. Couldn&#x27;t sleep w/out it. Also sold @ BBB.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sleep without this thing. It&#x27;s a little loud at first, but so is my dad&#x27;s snoring which the whole house can hear. In the morning when I wake up, I;m totally oblivious to the sound &amp; then slowly comes to me and then I realize it&#x27;s on and what I&#x27;m hearing. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve been hypnotized by it.Now I can&#x27;t sleep without it. I bring it with me on trips.</li>
    <li> Much better than electronic sound machines. We&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 decades and no problems. Works great. Use it every night. It&#x27;s not so big that you can&#x27;t pack it if you want.</li>
    <li> I have used looping white noise on my IHome radio and hated the interruption the loop space created. So I decided to give this product a shot. Since the first night we used it we have been sleeping better and it really does help with those annoying sounds throughout the night that can wake you up. Plus I have found it is a great buffer for when a TV is on in the other room and I want a quiet place to read. I also travel quite a bit and plan to take this on my future ventures.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Swoooooosh sound is soothing, continuous, natural, and live (i.e., not pre-recorded). Sounds somewhat like a box fan (with no rattling). Fills the room with a neutral, neutralizing sound (&amp;#34;white noise&amp;#34;) that you can easily tweek to suit your needs.  Volume, pitch, and intensity are all adjustable. A variety of richer, more interesting, sounds are produced by pre-recorded systems such as Ecotone&#x27;s Sound+Sleep and Sound Oasis&#x27;s S-5000, both of which I have in addition to the MARPAC Dohm-DS.  Which sound machine (or combination of sound machines) is best for you depends on what you would prefer to hear in the background.  You may want just one sound machine, or two, or three (putting one in each room, for example). Depending on who you are, where you are, and what you want to hear and not hear, this product may help you to create your own private little universe for reading, writing, thinking, sleeping, and dreaming . . .</li>
    <li> I snore so my mom loves this!  She says it makes her sleep even more than usual.  Comfortable wooshing noise, not too loud.</li>
    <li> Great product for drowning out noise.  Good quality, easy to find switch.  You&#x27;ll fall right asleep for a nap with this machine, as well as be able to sleep during the day if your house is full of people and you work nights.  Nice and dark (no annoying power lights anywhere).</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous and was truly helpful in easing fits of insomnia.  Totally delivered as promised.  That being said, I found iPhone apps that basically helped in the same way with soothing white noise. The phone/apps are a much less expensive, more portable option.  Once I started using an app, I sold this product on eBay for very close to what I paid for it.  Products that hold value like that are in demand because they work.  MARPAC is great if you don&#x27;t have a smart phone or prefer not to use your smart phone for these purposes.</li>
    <li> If you need to study, and the rest of the family wants watch TV, turn this gadget on and you can concentrate, without the noise of the TV bothering you.  It is Kool!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and it works perfectly. I love that it has two settings and the mask that comes with it is super comfy. The strap is like a velcro material so you can adjust it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This white noise generator works perfectly, and the amplitude is adjustable using a combination of fan speed and adjustable airflow components on the body of the device. Very satisfied customer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> works great and used all day</li>
    <li> Product does mask noise quite well - sounds like a fan running in the background.  Adjustable a few ways to make the noise louder or softer (and a few gradients in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face mask, however, is worse than what you get for free on a plane on an overnight flight.  I wish they would have spent $5 on it and given you something worth keeping.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews. This works well except for the fact that it is not lound enough. I thought based on the description that I could adjust this. Not so. I can adjust the tone and make it quieter but no way to make it louder. For the price, I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This machine has been around forever! I have used it for several years with no complaints whatsoever. I have even purchased a few for friends and everyone loves it. If you want to have a consistent non-disruptive way to drown out background noise while sleeping or even just working or studying this is a great solution.</li>
    <li> These work great in my office drowning out unwanted noise.</li>
    <li> I got what was promised. I like that it is perfect for travel. I use it everynight. I have had it for 2 months without a problem.</li>
    <li> We love this gadget! with kids in the house who are older and stay up all hours of the evening; gotta have this device. the white noise is helpful to mask the sounds of the 20 somethings wandering around the house; even of storms and cars going by. Great devide</li>
    <li> This is 2nd one.....bought this one for travel.  My husband and I can now sleep in the same room again.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. I need this to help sleep when the heat pump/air conditioner start running right outside my bedroom window.</li>
    <li> I had a unit similar to this many years ago and loved it.  I was looking on-line to replace it and found this item.  This unit does make the sound I was looking for - a &amp;#34;whooshing&amp;#34; air sound and NOT a static noise (like TV channels that go off-air).  I do not find any real adjustability in the twisting of the cover - nor is there much difference (to my ear) in the two speeds.  But this does make the sound I was looking for and that was my prime objective.</li>
    <li> this item came as described and it works as directed on the web site.. i will buy this item again if needed.</li>
    <li> It is a good well-manufactured product.  It is not helped the tinnitus of two different people who have tried the machine.</li>
    <li> This arrived in the nick of time.  Midnight worker needing sleep with all the lawn mowers and motorbikes.....perfect &amp;#34;white noise&amp;#34; that lulls me to sleep.</li>
    <li> Like the ability to adjust for different highs and lows in the sound spectrum. Its small and uses very little power.</li>
    <li> We got this to help with our sleep and were overjoyed when we learned it would also help our dogs sleep.  That was the biggest part of our sleep improvement as we no longer have to get up to let them out several times each night.</li>
    <li> We have these in every bedroom in the house. These are perfect for kids and adults alike. Take it on trips too!</li>
    <li> Not as loud as the TSCI-330, with which I replaced it.Decent, but,not quite enough for city noise.</li>
    <li> I have owned a sound conditioner for over 20 years.  When I needed to replace it, I went back to what I knew best.  I wouldn&#x27;t have any other.  I use it for myself to shut out noises from other parts of the house as well as for my dogs when we stay at motels or visiting other houses.  It helps keep them from reacting to \\&quot;strange\\&quot; noises.</li>
    <li> I am glad I went for the dual speed because the quieter setting is way too quiet. The sound is pretty good but I would like it a little louder (that is just me though - you may be different).  I have been using it together with the fan I have always used and together they work like a charm.  Note that it had a slight clang noise upon first start up, but that went away. As I said - if it were a little louder I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product blocks all the noise and lets me sleep well at night. It has a &amp;#34;air-wooshing&amp;#34; fan sound and not a staticy white-noise sound. The volume of the noise is adjustable by rotating the top and/or sides of the machine. It&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter who loves it.  She brings it to college and back when on break.  It has adjustments for volume and is light.  She has had it for over a year and it still works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought a sound machine earlier and thought I was buying the same one.  This looks exactly like it and is called the same but it is slightly quieter.  However, it does the job I need for my sleeping situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound machine does have a softer and louder setting but doesn&#x27;t get as loud as my first sound machine got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the sides to have more or less noise which is nice.  I haven&#x27;t used the eye mask because I am not bothered by extra light, just extra sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does drown out sounds like snoring and people walking around.</li>
