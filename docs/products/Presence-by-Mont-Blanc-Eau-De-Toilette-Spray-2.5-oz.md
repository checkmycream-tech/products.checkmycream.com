      <li>One of my all time favorites, glad I was able to find it.  </li>
      <li>A car, a top hat, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Mont Blanc makes some of the most underrated Eau De Toilette Spray on the market.</li>
      <li>Was able to order on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>no te hace sentir sexy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of legend and starwalker guy.</li>
      <li>I get the most complements from women.</li>
      <li>Many people like this in a cologne</li>
      <li>I like the subtlety it brings better.  </li>
      <li>I love Mont Blanc perfumes and this one does not disappoint.</li>
      <li>You will love it.  </li>
      <li>I did not taste much more brand than anything else.</li>
      <li>Smells like rich people!</li>
      <li>Adorable and not annoying</li>
      <li>Great product, smells smooth but yet masculine.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice smell, slightly warm and cool smelling at the same time.</li>
      <li>Very nice presentation, this fragance contains, really wood, cytrus fresh...</li>
      <li>My wife and daughter say they enjoy it too</li>
      <li>Mont Blanc Presence is a fantastic perfum.</li>
      <li>this is an awesome perfume i recommmend anyone to be buy this perfumes it lost on you for the whole day and even the next day u still smell it</li>
      <li>t has been very useful still use it</li>
      <li>Excellent, exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hit you over the head like original \\&quot;green\\&quot; Polo.  </li>
      <li>you guys are real funny at Mont Blanc.</li>
      <li>unique.. try this..</li>
      <li>Clean &amp; distinctive.</li>
      <li>It has a unique combination of scents that is neither fruity sweet nor industrially metallic.</li>
      <li>nothing special.  </li>
      <li>If you like YSL L&#x27;Homme, this is a good fragrance that is in a similar vein to me.</li>
      <li>In two words woody and sweet, but not cedar</li>
      <li>Good fragrance, but will not buy the 2.5 ounce anymore because it appeared to be weaker than the 1,7ounce for some strange reason thats why i give it a three star rating.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean, but far from sexy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s crisp, clean and does not grow on you to the point where it precedes your entrance into a room by 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Just what I expected, good buy</li>
      <li>Finding a versatile cologne like this is rare.</li>
      <li>worth the price and will purchase again</li>
      <li>I liked this cologne when checking out a tester at a local department store, but the store was out of stock.  </li>
      <li>the package was the right size.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the rare perfect casual scents.  </li>
      <li>Clearly in the mid range cost wise.</li>
      <li>It arrived more quickly than anticipated, was reasonably priced, and seemed to be the same fresh fragrance as the one in the tester.  </li>
      <li>Legend is good, but is too plain and smells like a cheaper version of Chanel&#x27;s Platinum Egoiste (which I like but am not crazy about).  </li>
      <li>cologne is an exact memory match for the stuff I found in there, and it was out of style 30 years ago.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Individuel is a well-made fragrance, but it kind of smells like Skittles, which is not really my thing.  </li>
      <li>I was a small child I used to sneak into my grandfather&#x27;s room and sniff the many multi-colored bottles he had laying around on top of his dresser.</li>
      <li>I first bought it for my husband for our 1yr anniversary and he&#x27;s been wearing it ever since (almost 5 years now).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of this too much!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know it it is real!</li>
      <li>as always, the service at Amazon was quick and the price, even more than usual, was fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is a nice mix of freshness and spice that makes it work for pretty much any season - light enough for summer, but enough fullness for winter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come to notice that there are many popular men&#x27;s colognes that smell like baby powder after they dry down.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a complete success.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent arrived on time</li>
    <li> Smells like a grandpa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a small child I used to sneak into my grandfather&#x27;s room and sniff the many multi-colored bottles he had laying around on top of his dresser. A car, a top hat, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is an exact memory match for the stuff I found in there, and it was out of style 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yikes!</li>
    <li> Mont Blanc got it right on this great fragrance.  In two words woody and sweet, but not cedar and it doesn&#x27;t hit you over the head like original \\&quot;green\\&quot; Polo.  Not that I don&#x27;t have some fondness for RL Polo,MB Presence is just more refined and complex so at my age I like the subtlety it brings better.  My wife and daughter say they enjoy it too so it&#x27;s a complete success.  Recommended and, as always, the service at Amazon was quick and the price, even more than usual, was fantastic.</li>
    <li> A soft subtle scent that is fresh and not overpowering. Similar to a cool water. I have been wearing it for years...not as pricey as some. Clearly in the mid range cost wise. I get at least one compliment a day</li>
    <li> Smells like rich people! Adorable and not annoying</li>
    <li> excellent product in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Having owned several brands of men&#x27;s fragrance, I am picky when it comes to what i buy after settling down to 3 brands.  Earlier this year, I decided to, go outside my comfort level and selected this Montblanc Presence after reading the reviews.  To my pleasant surprise, it was a great decision to try something new.  It last long enough for me and is not overwhelming</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great! I first bought it for my husband for our 1yr anniversary and he&#x27;s been wearing it ever since (almost 5 years now).  All the ladies at his job compliment him on it. It&#x27;s very unique and almost impossible to find in the dept stores so you won&#x27;t find other guys wearing the same scent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance, lasts almost all day.  The problem is, it just kind of smells like &#x27;soap&#x27;, nothing special.  I wear it to work, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  The other Mont Blanc fragrances are much better, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had recieved the after shave balm as a gift.  The after shave balm is superlative!  I am a head shaver and I have never used a more soothing product, but I digress.  The eau de toilette is mundane.  The scent is clean, but far from sexy.  It is reminiscent of Paul Sebastion and if you are looking for something along those lines it may be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but not my favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> excelete seller and the product was welcomed</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition at a fraction of the price I paid locally.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to every man out there. I get the most complements from women. They say its PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase would buy again.  I get it for my husband all the time and he likes the fragrance also.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this given at an airport and liked it. Now that I got it I can say that the quality is great.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, good buy</li>
    <li> It smells like something my dad wears. I&#x27;m more of legend and starwalker guy. Individual is too sweet and this presence is too musky.</li>
    <li> It has a sophisticated smell to it! It is for a  James Bond wanna be! And ladies, I can assure you that you will be happy to have your man smell like this!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Presence for years. I have tried others but keep on coming back. It has a very pleasant and clean scent without being being overpowering.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites, glad I was able to find it.  Please keep it in stock and also add the after shave to accompany.</li>
    <li> gracias me llego el producto en buen estado muy conforme con el perfume son buen proveedor los recomiendo con los ojos cerrado</li>
    <li> The item was received as promised and expected. I love the scent. It&#x27;s subtle and fresh. It complements the other Mont Blanc fragrances I have.</li>
    <li> Se lo recomiendo a mi papa o a mi abuelo, no es para alguien menor de 35 anos, no te hace sentir sexy si no mas bien algo elegante.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragance , smell amazing and super fast shipping from amazon A+++++</li>
    <li> Thanks for attention, the purchase was carried out normally perfume in time, in time for you to the currier, it hurts that not I could enjoy it longer than deliveries lost company perfume arriving in venezuela, was unfortunate, but part of you there is no complaints, thank you very much for your attention</li>
    <li> Good fragrance, but will not buy the 2.5 ounce anymore because it appeared to be weaker than the 1,7ounce for some strange reason thats why i give it a three star rating.</li>
    <li> Mont Blanc makes some of the most underrated Eau De Toilette Spray on the market. My wife always mentions how she can still smell it late in the evening after I only put it on in the morning. Also try their other lines.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume. It smells musculine and fancy. If you are looking for something not for everyday.. can be for every night.. unique.. try this..</li>
    <li> Perfect! Really Great Product!</li>
    <li> Mont Blanc Presence has a subtle non offensive scent that can be worn almost anywhere.The dry down smells a bit powdery. I am not really a fan of the smell of baby powder. I&#x27;ve come to notice that there are many popular men&#x27;s colognes that smell like baby powder after they dry down. Many people like this in a cologne but I am not one of them.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it it is real!</li>
    <li> Very nice presentation, this fragance contains, really wood, cytrus fresh... you can use day or night... very pleased with this product...</li>
    <li> Great fragrance at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Great product, smells smooth but yet masculine. I have bought it over and over and give gift to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents, bang for buck! Clean &amp; distinctive.</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance and delivery is fast</li>
    <li> Very good perfum, I like too much. I&#x27; m very happy with this, good Price also. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> very happy with my order and it got here in good time thank you</li>
    <li> One of the rare perfect casual scents.  It has the crisp scent that can be used wearing normal clothes, and dressed up.  Finding a versatile cologne like this is rare.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t discontinue this product.  It is my favorite fragrance for my husband!  Try it !  You will love it.  Now over powering!</li>
    <li> Great fragance for men</li>
    <li> This smells different from the typical cologne for men that tend to have citrus notes.  This cologne has a warmness to it that gives it a romantic feeling.</li>
    <li> The smell is not lasting! when you wearing you cant feel the smell in your bodies, maybe can be falsed..</li>
    <li> me parece que el producto es muy bueno llego a tiempo y cumple con mis expectativas y hay responsabilidad lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not maintained during the day, only lasts about two hours, I have previously purchased this product and is not equal</li>
    <li> This cologne is totally not for me.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of this too much!  I like it soft and mellow like Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Nautica Voyager, and Versace.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Been using Mont Blanc for some time and have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase in the future&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> simplemente exelente!!!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells really good. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I love Mont Blanc perfumes and this one does not disappoint. It has a very nice smell, slightly warm and cool smelling at the same time. Lasts for several hours and has a slightly fruity note to it as well. Suitable for all occasions.</li>
    <li> Great Smell, Great Price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> i have no complains about it. im really happy with the perfume. the delivery was on time, the product quality is good. the package was the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recomend 100% this product.</li>
    <li> This came late, it smells very fresh, not a &amp;#34;man sent&amp;#34; but I enjoy it so far. Reminds me of a fruit but I can&#x27;t name it</li>
    <li> I keep this one as a staple and is my signature scent. That said this one (Sold by Amazon) had a noticeable alcohol smell to it,but after its application and left to dry it smells like others I have so I am not worried about it being a knock off but then again you never know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts for a long time, it is a very sweet soft smell unlike anything generic on the market. A very original nice scent that can be worn on a man or a woman IMO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price and will purchase again</li>
    <li> My bottle never arrived and the seller never compensated me for that, Amazon did though. I did reorder the cologne by another seller and it is very nice, but this seller did not want to help after receiving the payment. I think however it was a handeling problem or maybe someone took it from my front steps, any case the package was not to be left on the steps,  don&#x27;t know who said it if it was supposed to be left on the steps, but the seller did not want to help find out what went wrong with one of there customers. and thats not good......So i&#x27;m happy with this same product that I got from a different seller but unhappy with what happened in the deal with this seller.  They did give me a 10% discount card on my next purchase which is like a band aid for a gunshot wound......you guys are real funny at Mont Blanc. Step up your customer service because the product is very nice.</li>
    <li> its a frangance so much, better than the others, his smell its so cold and hard, i dont know the other skywalker, maybe could be better than this, or worst, let me smell the other</li>
    <li> t has been very useful still use it</li>
    <li> Great smell,last all day........My Wife loves it and I also get a ton of compliments on how great it smells!!!</li>
    <li> Unopened &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; bottles to be placed out at retail.  Same fragrance at about half to a third of retail price.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I liked this cologne when checking out a tester at a local department store, but the store was out of stock.  Was able to order on Amazon.  It arrived more quickly than anticipated, was reasonably priced, and seemed to be the same fresh fragrance as the one in the tester.  Met all my expectations, so to me that means 5 stars.</li>
    <li> You will always find these in my cupboard, this is one of my favourite perfumes. I have been using these for over 5 years and bought quite a few of them</li>
    <li> I WANT MY MONEY BACK,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOST MY TIME N MY MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE UR MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>

    <li> Mont Blanc Presence is a fantastic perfum. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 11 years. It is a shame that Mont Blanc has stopped its production.</li>
    <li> fair price for this brand.brand new,no bad surprises</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cologne for over 5 years and never get tired of it. It has a unique combination of scents that is neither fruity sweet nor industrially metallic. It&#x27;s crisp, clean and does not grow on you to the point where it precedes your entrance into a room by 3 minutes. I am a retired air traffic controller. That job required me to sit elbow to elbow with my co-workers for 8 hours a day and I have sat next to people (men &amp; women) that wore fragrances that were so overpowering, I could hardly breathe. I have gotten a lot of complements on it  from my female coworkers who then bought it for their husbands. As time has gone on, I have tried samples of various new colognes because I don&#x27;t have to remain blindly product loyal if something better comes along, yet nothing has beaten it yet. I remain loyal because of the quality and consistency from Mont Blanc and because on Amazon, I can get it for a whole lot less that at the Mont Blanc stores, since no one else carries it.</li>
    <li> I did not taste much more brand than anything else.</li>
    <li> lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttttttttttt...........................this is an awesome perfume i recommmend anyone to be buy this perfumes it lost on you for the whole day and even the next day u still smell it</li>
    <li> Fresh ginger, cinnamon, and a &amp;#34;barbershoppy&amp;#34; feel - good stuff!  This is a classy scent that is great for the office, but can be worn casually too.  Nice complement getter also.  It is a nice mix of freshness and spice that makes it work for pretty much any season - light enough for summer, but enough fullness for winter.  Another great fragrance that will not break the bank.  It is actually my favorite Mont Blanc by a mile.  Legend is good, but is too plain and smells like a cheaper version of Chanel&#x27;s Platinum Egoiste (which I like but am not crazy about).  Individuel is a well-made fragrance, but it kind of smells like Skittles, which is not really my thing.  If you like YSL L&#x27;Homme, this is a good fragrance that is in a similar vein to me.</li>
