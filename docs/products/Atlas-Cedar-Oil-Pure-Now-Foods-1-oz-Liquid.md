<ol>
      <li>Great discovery!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars anyway because I was impressed by the ease of the return process.</li>
      <li>I diluted this with water and sprayed inside and now the cedar chest smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>Cedar is an awesome EO for diffusing.  </li>
      <li>Best value and good product.</li>
      <li>This was great when I opened it.  </li>
      <li>Recommend the purchase at this great price.</li>
      <li>Good smelling, quality product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for things to work out as they are supposed to.  </li>
      <li>and I have to fill out some kind of form.</li>
      <li>Nice, relaxing woodsy scent/ I made cologne with it and used on my skin for disinfecting purposes/ works well and the scent lasts a while</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with all of the ones I have purchased!</li>
      <li>Obviously, most everyone else&#x27;s seems ok</li>
      <li>It still works okay though.</li>
      <li>It is one of my favorite scent combinations.</li>
      <li>So either it&#x27;s tainted with gasoline, or it&#x27;s just really potent.</li>
      <li>Wonderful essential oil - I have ordered a number of these from the NOW brand -</li>
      <li>This Atlas Cedar has a great mildly woody with a hint of sweet smell to it.</li>
      <li>I love the clean smell it imparts on my clothing when used on a dryer ball!  </li>
      <li>Smells great, keeps bugs away from outside pirch.</li>
      <li>All of these oils are fantastic and I use them in my craft projects to make things like lotion bars and beard oil/balm for my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>Stick to Eden&#x27;s Garden Himalayan Cedar (they just call it &amp;#34;Cedarwood&amp;#34;), it smells better and the shipping was quicker/</li>
      <li>Strong scent worth prce</li>
      <li>It gives my apartment a nice masculine scent.</li>
      <li>I had purchased that brand previously and was happy with it  . . .  </li>
      <li>Purchased this awhile back because I liked the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Fresh &amp; clean!&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use them for candles, as I normally use regular fragrance oils made for candles, and to be honest, essential oils are too good for that in my opinion.</li>
      <li>My first place to look for things like this is Amazon.</li>
      <li>It also arrived a day later than the latest estimated day.</li>
      <li>I tried it a couple different times, let it &amp;#34;mellow&amp;#34;... Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my sniffer.</li>
      <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with all the Now Foods essential oils I&#x27;ve tried thus far, and it&#x27;s hard to beat their prices.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the stress reduction is real or just imagined because I expect it, but I like the smell of this oil.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s potency that fast.  </li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the smell of cedar oil, but I use this as part of a natural bug spray.</li>
      <li>I put a few drops on his pillow and he started sleeping much more soundly with fewer trips to my room in the middle of the night.</li>
      <li>I received a bottle with the older NOW label on it.</li>
      <li>When I put the oil on the back of my neck before I go to sleep, I have a very peaceful sleep</li>
      <li>Just wanted to get that same fresh smell as my clothes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s masculine without being musky.</li>
      <li>I tried using just a few drops, added to my bathwater along with lavender and bergamont essential oils, thinking they would make it smell better.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the smell of this mixed with other herbs to make household cleaning products.  </li>
      <li>I bought it based on the price and other positive reviews.  </li>

<li> Either way, horrible shipping (might not be their fault), and I only received 1 inside of my package.</li>
<li> Needless to say I stopped using it on him and now just use it as air freshener.</li>
<li> Wrong!  </li>
<li> I think I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch because, to me, this smells vile, like a litter box.</li>
<li> Fleas and ticks hate cedar and this keeps them at bay.</li>
<li> Very unpleasant smell</li>
<li> This is one of the worst buying experiences I&#x27;ve had yet on Amazon, and I buy a lot of things all the time.</li>
<li> It was horrible and moldy.</li>

    <li> Smells great, keeps bugs away from outside pirch. Strong scent worth prce</li>
    <li> We inherited an abused cedar chest!!! It was horrible and moldy. We refinished the outside and sanded down the inside. It no longer smelled like cedar, but moth balls. I diluted this with water and sprayed inside and now the cedar chest smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I think I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch because, to me, this smells vile, like a litter box. I tried it a couple different times, let it &amp;#34;mellow&amp;#34;...

    <li> Nice, relaxing woodsy scent/ I made cologne with it and used on my skin for disinfecting purposes/ works well and the scent lasts a while</li>
    <li> This was great when I opened it.  Within 2 days all the scent was GONE.  There was NO real essential oil in it!  I have NEVER had an oil lose it&#x27;s potency that fast.  This one was a total SCAM!</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil in my diffuser. It gives my apartment a nice masculine scent. When combined with the Now Cedarwood oil, my apartment smells like a woodshop. It is one of my favorite scent combinations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with all the Now Foods essential oils I&#x27;ve tried thus far, and it&#x27;s hard to beat their prices. This Atlas Cedar has a great mildly woody with a hint of sweet smell to it.</li>
    <li> I needed some cedar oil .  My first place to look for things like this is Amazon. I knew what I wanted  . . .  they had some  . . .  I had purchased that brand previously and was happy with it  . . .  so I ordered a bottle.  My order arrived in a few days  . . .  it was as they said it was (no surprise).  It&#x27;s nice for things to work out as they are supposed to.  Sometimes what you get is not close to what you see. In my life, I tend to think this way  . . .  \\&quot;if it is up to be  . . .  it is up to me\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about the smell of cedar oil, but I use this as part of a natural bug spray. Fleas and ticks hate cedar and this keeps them at bay. This is actual cedar oil and not the alternate one that comes from berries. I received a bottle with the older NOW label on it. It still works okay though.</li>
    <li> Helps my kiddo off to sleep.  I put a few drops on his pillow and he started sleeping much more soundly with fewer trips to my room in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> Purchased this awhile back because I liked the fragrance.  Just now starting to use it because I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.  I love the clean smell it imparts on my clothing when used on a dryer ball!  Fresh &amp; clean!&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I added some to my plug-in wax burner, as the scent had faded.  Just wanted to get that same fresh smell as my clothes.  Well!  To my surprise,  I woke up to a bunch of fruitfly-type bugs dead around the burner!!! I had been having a problem with them &amp; didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of them.  Problem solved!!!  Great discovery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Cedar is an awesome EO for diffusing.  Mixed with pine, fir, spruce and a bit of spearmint or a pepermint, and you&#x27;re bringing the beautiul smell of the forest into your home.  I ordered this, primarily due to price.  A lot of oil for the buck!</li>
    <li> Good smelling, quality product. However, I bought this to help rid my cat of flees and it didn&#x27;t seem to help; perhaps i applied it wrong, but it made his skin very dry and if he got it in his mouth he started to drool profusely. Needless to say I stopped using it on him and now just use it as air freshener.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this essential oil to smell like a cedar closet, or at least &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smelling.  Instead, it is plain nauseating!  I bought it based on the price and other positive reviews.  Turned out to be a big waste of money.  I tried using just a few drops, added to my bathwater along with lavender and bergamont essential oils, thinking they would make it smell better. Wrong!  Very unpleasant smell, I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the stress reduction is real or just imagined because I expect it, but I like the smell of this oil. It&#x27;s masculine without being musky.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these and only received 1. It also arrived a day later than the latest estimated day. Furthermore, it smells pretty bad. You&#x27;ll have to dilute it. It smells like gasoline (seriously). So either it&#x27;s tainted with gasoline, or it&#x27;s just really potent. Either way, horrible shipping (might not be their fault), and I only received 1 inside of my package. Was trying to file a claim, but accidentally hit the backspace button during my description, and now for some reason it won&#x27;t let me finish filing the claim and I have to fill out some kind of form. This is one of the worst buying experiences I&#x27;ve had yet on Amazon, and I buy a lot of things all the time. I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this product again. Stick to Eden&#x27;s Garden Himalayan Cedar (they just call it &amp;#34;Cedarwood&amp;#34;), it smells better and the shipping was quicker/everything actually arrived.</li>
    <li> Wonderful essential oil - I have ordered a number of these from the NOW brand - I use a lot of their products already and so I&#x27;m a fan of the brand. All of these oils are fantastic and I use them in my craft projects to make things like lotion bars and beard oil/balm for my boyfriend. I don&#x27;t use them for candles, as I normally use regular fragrance oils made for candles, and to be honest, essential oils are too good for that in my opinion. I&#x27;ll save them for using in my personal care products. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with all of the ones I have purchased!</li>
    <li> I use Cedar Atlas oil almost every night now. I used to suffer from insomnia and heard this would help. When I put the oil on the back of my neck before I go to sleep, I have a very peaceful sleep and I started dreaming again, after not having any dreams for years. It is said to be a preventative measure for Alzheimer&#x27;s and I would definitely give it a try.</li>
