      <li>Comfortable and soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I wore the first one out.</li>
      <li>My old flat mask, which did not protect me from light as well as this one, was much more comfy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
      <li>This may not be a major factor for some people, but it was of primary importance for me.  </li>
      <li>I like this new one because with the black interior it seals out the light better.</li>
      <li>I love to keep my windows open for fresh air, but early morning sun naturally will wake up your brain!</li>
      <li>It is the most comfortable but the pink still lets a little light in.</li>
      <li>I really like this sleeping mask.</li>
      <li>I really like that you can adjust the band.</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, the slipperiness of this mask may not be worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you need to feel free to move, this is too big!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Service was fast.</li>
      <li>I really wish they were softer.</li>
      <li>There is definite light leakage that comes from the bottom, particularly around the nose area.  </li>

      <li>Some nights I notice that I adjust it a few times more than others, guess I&#x27;m moving too much?</li>
      <li>It feels so soft on my face when I lay down to sleep, and is sturdy, of excellent quality and thick material.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s a cute little carrying case with ear plugs</li>
      <li>Very soft against my skin, there are eye sockets and longer length than most to ensure black out.  </li>
      <li>The pink material around the nose gets some light shine to it.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin anyway, and the skin around my eyes is very tender.  </li>
      <li>If you are a side sleeper, as I am, it can feel like sleeping on a rope unless you have a very soft pillow.  </li>
      <li>The cover fabric is very soft.  </li>
      <li>it should have a soft material to!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I dont like it. Is not like a picture is not Soft is hard an unconfortabble  i cant sleep whit this</li>
    <li> The cushion at the nose bridge keeps out light.  There is no pressure on the eyeballs.  Great for naps because it does not smudge your massacre.</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask! I travel a lot and wanted something really cute and feminine to wear on the airplane and this certianly fits the bill. Although it can feel at times a little bulky on your face it works great and keeps the light out to help you sleep. This was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a long plane ride but use them nightly! Great coverage. Comfortable and soft.</li>
    <li> This mask is soft and goes on easy. Some nights I notice that I adjust it a few times more than others, guess I&#x27;m moving too much? There is a little light leakage in it. But maybe it needs to be tightened? Clearly not that bad, since I haven&#x27;t tried. I would recommend and buy it again.</li>
    <li> &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this!  This eye mask is of great quality!  Very soft against my skin, there are eye sockets and longer length than most to ensure black out.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s pink and there&#x27;s a cute little carrying case with ear plugs ;)</li>
    <li> I purchased this sleep mask several months ago.  My old one was the flat type, very soft, but offered little protection from light around the nose area.  It also tended to slip around a lot during the night and I often awoke with it askew.  So when I decided to replace it with something better, I read all the reviews and chose the Dream Essentials mask based on other&#x27;s ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The cover fabric is very soft.  This may not be a major factor for some people, but it was of primary importance for me.  I have sensitive skin anyway, and the skin around my eyes is very tender.  I knew it would be impossible to get to sleep if something was rubbing on me.  The fabric on this mask is soft and plush and will absolutely not be abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The light guard around the nose area works very well.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it works when adjusted carefully.  I have occasionally awakened in the morning because the mask has slipped around, but I&#x27;m a side sleeper and this is something that can hardly be avoided without adjusting the headband unreasonably tight.  Back sleepers should have no problems at all.  Stomach sleepers should resign themselves to a tight headband.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The quality of the workmanship is excellent so I expect it to be durable. Again, I&#x27;ve only had it for six months but it shows no wear whatsoever to date. The stitches are tight and even and the satin trim is pretty.  The little storage pouch and earplug pouch is exactly as represented.  I have not washed this mask, and doubt I&#x27;d need to for some time, but if washed by hand in cool water and dried flat it should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It freezes well.  For those who like to refrigerate or freeze their masks during hot weather or for headache relief, this mask seems to hold the cold better than others.  It is not an ice mask by any means, but it can be stored in the freezer before use without any ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The storage pouch and earplugs, also in their ownlittle pouch, are a nice extra.  The storage pouches make traveling easy and keep the mask clean between uses.&lt;br /&gt;6. The service was great.  It arrived promptly, a day before it was due, in excellent condition.  It was a bit over-packaged, however; how could a sleep mask require bubble wrap?  But I was pleased with the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s not so great:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The mask is a bit hot to wear.  That soft, plush fabric can get very warm against the skin.  If you suffer hot flashes or sleep in a hot room, this may not be the mask for you.  Or, perhaps, at least not during the summer.  In the winter it may be a benefit!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The thick eye cavities are a bit hard, even over-stuffed. I really wish they were softer. If you are a side sleeper, as I am, it can feel like sleeping on a rope unless you have a very soft pillow.  I tend to burrow my face down into my pillow and, with this molded mask, that is just not comfortable.  My old flat mask, which did not protect me from light as well as this one, was much more comfy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The mask can slip about on one&#x27;s head during the night unless the band is quite tight.  All that soft satin also tends to make it slippery.  Now, for me, it&#x27;s a price worth paying.  But if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, the slipperiness of this mask may not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did decide to keep this mask and I use it often.  I have also given one to my son&#x27;s girlfriend, who sleeps during the day, and she just loves hers.  So, overall, I&#x27;m giving it four stars, knocking one off because I wish the eye cavities were softer on my cheekbones.  But considering how well made it is, and how effectively it blocks the light, this mask is well worth the money and I recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> His review:&lt;br /&gt;My husband needed a sleep mask for while traveling on long flights. I bought this for him hoping it would be a \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; buy for one trip. He has used it repeatedly not just for airplane flight but regulare sleep too. He has Keratoconus a cornea disorder that has required him to have a cornea transplant. As such his eye is very sensitive and has to be cared for and treated delicately. This sleep mask is the only one we felt he might be able to use because of the eye holes. It has been perfect for him and has never put any unneccessary pressure on his corneas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her review:&lt;br /&gt;I suffor from insomnia and often find myself unable to sleep for days at a time. This mask has made an extreme difference in my sleep health. I find myself waking less at night and able to sleep better in 8 hours than I ever have before. The padding is comfortable, the strap is sturdy and the eye holes make all the difference I think because my eyes don&#x27;t crust up while I sleep anymore. This mask is worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is recommended by two people in our one house!</li>
    <li> Ordered a black one for myself and this pink one for the wifey.  The pink one simple does not work well.  The black is not much better either, however the pink color makes it worse b/c it is so light.  There is definite light leakage that comes from the bottom, particularly around the nose area.  Just not made that well.  They should have tested this product first.</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. It&#x27;s padded around the eyes which helps keep light out.</li>
    <li> Love this, I work 12-hour night shifts, so when I get home the sun is already up and I am exhausted. I bought this and it does everything it says it supposed to, which makes me totally happy!! Only downside is that, as a side sleeper, the mask will shift a little. Otherwise great product. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This eye mask works really good</li>
    <li> Love it. I have macular degeneration  and was told not to sleep with a ceiling running. I can&#x27;t sleep w/o the fan so the mask is a life saver. No more dry eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is comfortable and I don&#x27; have any problems sleeping with it on. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Jeam</li>
    <li> I purchased five masks for my wife and this is her second favorite mask. It is the most comfortable but the pink still lets a little light in. She likes a black mask just like this one the best.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, this is true to the color, and a great product, def would recommend it to other people</li>
    <li> I thought that maybe being so expensive this could be a greeeeat product but I was wrong, when you go to sleep you need to feel free to move, this is too big! it should have a soft material to!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick that every time I roll over, it moves and I have to adjust. Also, it gets very hot since it traps heat.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased one of these sleep masks and loved it.  It was rather flexible and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask seems to be stiffer and moves around, waking me up to adjust it.</li>
    <li> It does a great job at blocking light. The pink color is a little less effective than the black or purple which I had previously however. The pink material around the nose gets some light shine to it. Otherwise it is comfortable and travels well.</li>
    <li> I have two of these and I have given them as gifts. They are soft and nicely made. They was up nice in the washer and block more light than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Extremely comfy and I love the color!! Blocks off all lights and looks so stylish. Bought another for the bf and we had fun taking photos with it on. So cute!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask. It feels so soft on my face when I lay down to sleep, and is sturdy, of excellent quality and thick material. It will withstand many washes and does wash well, retaining it&#x27;s shape. I&#x27;m sure it will last me for many years. I have used other brands (and disliked them) but this is better than anything I could ask for.</li>
    <li> I love it....I love it...I love it.  Soft...supple...cradles my eyes in their slumber.  Sweet dreams are now a regular occurance...</li>
    <li> I love to keep my windows open for fresh air, but early morning sun naturally will wake up your brain! So it&#x27;s been proven, wearing a sleep mask that totally blocks out light, allows the body, mind to continue in deep slumber, while you&#x27;re able to keep that awesome sea air flowing through your wide open curtains &amp; windows.  Cool rooms &amp; sleep masks &#x3D; good sleep. I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect mask. One that is soft, not to much pressure, and gives a total black out. Dream Essentials came through with this mask!  Sleeping like a baby now!</li>
    <li> I really like this sleeping mask. It does need some getting used to because it is big and a bit bulky but I love the padding. As another reviewer mentioned, light does come in through the nose area but if you tighten the band, that won&#x27;t happen. I really like that you can adjust the band. So far so good!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing a Dream Essentials Sleep Mask. I wore the first one out. I like this new one because with the black interior it seals out the light better. The elastic in the back doesn&#x27;t appear to be as likely to stretch out of shape like my first one. I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase. The best part is the eye wells inside the mask that allow you to open and close your eyes without rubbing on fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was fast. I ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon at the same time. The mask arrived in 3 days. Very pleased with seller.</li>
    <li> This mask is heavenly!  It&#x27;s ultra soft, yet it fits snug.  All the light is blocked.  All.  Even with the mask on you can open your eyes, there is lots of room inside the mask.  The strap lets you adjust how loose or how tight it fits.  I&#x27;m taking a trip to Sweden in a few weeks and I&#x27;ll be taking this with me on the plane!  Wow.  The value for the price is beyond my expectations.  You will love this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great concept, but may be better just for sleeping on a plane. As a side sleeper, it is pretty uncomfortable. It&#x27;s just very bulky and stiff. I&#x27;m going to try washing it to see if it will soften it up a bit.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it! Blocks out the light and my annoying boyfriend with his waking up early and needing lights.</li>
