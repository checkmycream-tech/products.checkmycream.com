<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these at all. I was very disappointed. They are dry sticky but the polish leaks underneath so you don&#x27;t get a clean line. They did not help me achieve the look I was going for.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick with the curve of your nail and paint bleeds underneath, defeating the purpose.</li>
    <li> These are sooo neat. Thank you. Make great stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> It is easily attached and removed from nail. doesn&#x27;t remove nail polish. It&#x27;s a good quallity product and I would gladly reccomend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love them. Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Sweet little addition to your manicure supplies. If you like to add french tips, or other patterns for multi-color manicures, these little gems will help. They stick well, peel easily, and leave a sharp line at the edge  of the polish. Very inexpensive. Stock up while you can!</li>
    <li> Yay! They&#x27;re really nice and they came earlier to my house then the expected delivery date!</li>
    <li> Wanted these for nail deco and even waiting 5-10 mins between coats it stripped off bottom layer polish. I was not happy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use nail polish sticker. Thank you</li>
    <li> Sometimes they stick too much it messes up my nails..</li>
    <li> They take off the nail polish when my daughter is making her nail different colors, maybe they are not what I had intended for them to do</li>
    <li> Loved the price and loved the quantity. It&#x27;s very easy to use and when I run out I&#x27;ll purchase them again.</li>
    <li> oMG! Exactly what I needed, this arrived 2 weeks ahead of schedule and&lt;br /&gt;used it right away for my&lt;br /&gt;manicure.you get a lot of strips in case you make a mistake. very well packaged I recommend this seller and will buy from them again. A solid 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great size and great for different looks. Will definitely be trying different ideas and or techniques with these little guys.</li>
    <li> The paper is so fragile that the strings break apart. Also, the chevron stickers does not really do a chevron. Its is too big for people with skinny nails like me.</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool. I&#x27;ve used them a bunch of times and had success. Just be careful that the nail polish is completely dry underneath when using them.</li>
    <li> work great for the price and getting your french done is very easy with them! and i like that you got 3 different froms</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting but some of them serve the purpose I need them for.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to use at times,however it is better for me than doing the French manicures freehand. Takes a little skill to position the guides perfectly.</li>
    <li> Our 10 year old already mastered the French Tips with these guides.  I just bought them as a cheap, filler gift and didn&#x27;t even think that they would actually be used as much as they are.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with these is  the fact that they are so big, it&#x27;s hard to get them to sit on your nail properly. I end up getting nail polish underneath on to my nails where the sticker doesn&#x27;t lay flat. Maybe I can cut them down to size. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Other than that. I love these...</li>
    <li> Very nice Nail Tip Guides Stickers.  We will buy more in the future when we need new one.  Like it much.</li>
    <li> I am really excited about using these! They took about a week and a half to 2 weeks to come but you can&#x27;t beat the price and shipping and handling was free! I would definitely re-order or recommend to another buyer!!</li>
    <li> Sticks to the nail perfectly. Easy to remove and paint over.</li>
    <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something to make it easier to do tips at home then this probably isn&#x27;t for you. I had issues with sticking to the polish and corners won&#x27;t stay down while painting. I would order again though because of the variety inside the packs.</li>
    <li> This were definitely delivered early, like a few day before the estimate. The first time I used them they peeled up some of the nail polish below them. The second time I used them a few hours after the first coat and then they were fine. They fit my nails shape and size for the most part. All in all, not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the nail tape.! You can do all kinds of designs. I mean any kind of design you like.! No mess up problem or anything. I love them I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out.!!!</li>
    <li> I like what i received i love trying chevron and half oon design and this is perfect for that. The only thing is that idk why but when i peel it off they smear a little.</li>
    <li> So what I received is different than what is advertised. Although the packaging looks identical to the one featured, when I received it in the mail it was only the french nail tip guides. In each packet there were three columns with each respective design. Mine consisted of five packets, each one containing three columns of only the french tip. Therefore, I give this review a total zero, considering that it took almost a month to ship and it was the wrong item. Buyers beware. (P.s. - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth returning a five dollar item and probably waiting another month or two for a refund, so I&#x27;ll be keeping them anyway - out of pure laziness.)</li>
    <li> Not very happy thought I was getting French tip chevron and teardrop nail guides only got French tip! Very upset I perfer you not to buy they&#x27;s they lie !!</li>
    <li> These are all right.  I guess like any sticker you really have to make sure that it&#x27;s on there long enough for the paint to dry, but it does leave a ridge where your paint was. I guess it&#x27;s a work in progress for making them work out. I&#x27;m finding that free handing it is easier.</li>
    <li> the work just how they are suppose to work. it always annoying to use this stickers stuff but in the end the results are perfect :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that it would have as many decals as it did, I&#x27;m impressed with it. just need to work on my technique of allowing polish to dry prior to placing them.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using these in non-traditional way to make chevrons and other shapes on my nails.  the stickers are easy to use and peel off dry nail polish nicely.  make sure nail polish is very dry before putting the guide on the nail.</li>
    <li> I have to say that in spite of having long and strong nails, I&#x27;m lazy to paint or decorate them, but I decided to give a try with these tip guides, thought would be fun. And indeed it was, I actually painted my nails with two different colors using the guides, and they didn&#x27;t fall apart. It was easy to put the stickers on, and easy to take them away. I also noticed that the vernis didn&#x27;t go to unwanted areas, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars. I would recommend this product to a friend, and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The stickers work great because the polish doesn&#x27;t go under the sticker.  Unfortunately, the adhesive leaves a slight sticky residue if left on too long.  At first I applied the stickers to all my fingers, put on the polish, then took the sticker off.  But now I do one finger at a time.  Seems ok if you put on top coat.  Cute packaging.</li>
    <li> They serve their purpose and they are easy to use. They make nail designs easier to make.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> These work great I love that they have 3 designs instead of jaut the normal one gives you a chance for more variety</li>
    <li> Glad these were so cheap. I bought them hoping they would work with gel polish so I could do chevron or other designs. They did not stick to the polish at all and moved around so much that I got frustrated and tossed them.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of the 5 pack French, Chevron &amp; Teardrop Nail Tip Guides Stickers in the mail today and was extremely disappointed at what I received! Instead of receiving what is pictured, I received a 5 pack of just the french tip stickers. And it&#x27;s not worth shipping these back half way around the world and waiting another month and a half for a refund of $5. So buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Took quite a while to get here.. Thought I was getting a variety pack but only got the French Tips so I was a little bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I thought it would.  They do not stick very well and do not leave clean lines at all. They are also very thick, so people with small nail beds like myself, they do not look right.  I would not buy another pack of these again.</li>
    <li> It came alot earlier than expected delivery date which was surprising considering the fact its coming from hong kong. It came as it said 5 packs, and the tip guides stay on nicely, while your trying to apply polish over it.</li>
    <li> very satisfied!! they are very easy to use!!! will reorder more and I have told my friends to order too!!</li>
    <li> The work fine. You got to let the nails dry very well to use on top of another color. I like the different shapes.</li>
    <li> I ordered the three different sticker pack but received a pack of 5 French tip guides only. After it was nearly 3 weeks late, I was pretty irritated by that especially because there is no tracking on the package and I had no idea when it would arrive. The customer service was good, though. She refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Found it very useful, it made my work so much easier and the look was fabulous and with a professional look.</li>
    <li> These nail stickers work really good of you wait. What I do when I use these stickers is I put the base coat on then wait a day or else&#x27;s when you take the sticker off you base coat will to and then you have to redo the whole thing but all in this is a really good product. And also once you have painted over the sticker I think it works best to wait until that is mostly dry. You just have to be patient</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. They were so easy to use.I could noy have been more satisfied with my ordsr and they werw so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Ordered these over a month ago and still haven&#x27;t gotten them. Very frustrated. It&#x27;s not like they were expensive, but I still paid for them.</li>
    <li> Easier to do freehand than use these.  Besides they are supersticky and hard to position  because of the stickiness and size.</li>
    <li> Such a great price for how many you get. I will probably never use all of them there is so many</li>
    <li> Disappointed.. Mine only came in a three pack. The stickers work great though. Just wish I would have actually gotten a 5 pack</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would help with French tip lining but it was a waste of money. The hand crafted is the only way to go the polish leaks under this an messes up the whole design.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27; t see the point for them.. I thought I was going to use them as a tip but they peal off so fast.. not even a days worth.. I would never buy them again..</li>
    <li> I love these,  and I was very surprised at the amount.  These have given me so many styling patterns!! They are great!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact it did not pull off my nail polish and came off cleanly and adequately, Love it!!</li>
    <li> I received a whole pack where the stickers were stuck together. Not worth the wait to get sent to you</li>
    <li> they are not very practical .</li>
    <li> came really quickly and very easy to use. now i jsut need to wait for my nails to get longer so i can do more designs</li>
    <li> I used them the first time and they didn&#x27;t stick to my nail very well so it was pointless in doing French tip. I didn&#x27;t count them out so I gave it another shot making sure that my nails were well clean and they still didn&#x27;t stick. I purchased these for the 3 different options but they are very thin, they don&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> There is no instructions and they don&#x27;t stick on , you should not buy this item it is a ripoff</li>
    <li> exactly what it says it is same exact thing as shown in the picture! this also came early! vey good way to do nails!</li>
    <li> These stickers are fantastic and a huge help for doing my own nails. Great value for the price (several sheets of them). Shipping was a tiny bit slow (not terrible), but I think they&#x27;re coming from another country so don&#x27;t expect them overnight or two-day.</li>
    <li> Does not stick very well. My nail polish ended up going underneath the sticker instead of leaving a clean design.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even for this price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. They make tips so much easier Nice clean nail and very easy to use best money spent!!</li>
    <li> The nail tips arrived home, nicely and securely packed, which I loved it. The first thing I appreciate when I order online, is how well the item is packed. And this one - match my demands :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I have 3 option for the nail tips, and that I have 5 packs to work with! In addition, I was completely satisfied with the shipping time frame, I received the item before the actual delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, but be careful because the nail tips have a lot of glue, so when you want to peal them off you might actually take away some of the nail polish already applied to your nail.</li>
    <li> I use nail tip guides all of the time.  These work great.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more.</li>
    <li> this wasnt what I got it was 5 packs of the same thing French and nothing else very disappointed no chevron no teardrop</li>
    <li> Seriously took FOREVER to get here, I understand they are from China but still. I have had other packages from China that did not take this long, I ordered these months ago. They work fine for creating French nail looks, and other nail art, check out YouTube for tutorials using nail guides. If you like the chevron trend these can be a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> it worked really well the results were amazing but you need to wait when the nail is fully dry</li>
    <li> They do as they say and theres a whole lot in one package. Super cheap too! Love them! :D :D</li>
    <li> One of the packages was bent. But overall these came perfectly. I need a little more practice. :) Great to be used as a gift!</li>
    <li> Very cheap and small didn&#x27;t fit all the way on my thumb</li>
    <li> Package came on time and as expected! looks just like picture!&lt;br /&gt;I do my own nail art and these were just what I need, they work really well. Don&#x27;t slide around, don&#x27;t leave a whole bunch of glue goo behind.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that there&#x27;s not straight across guide just the curved and then a V shaped.&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are very sticky, which is great!  They stick very well to the nail so none of the polish will seep under them while you paint.  You get enough stickers per sheet to do your nails three times - plus a few extra if you have any goofs.  They&#x27;re easy to remove.  I recommend removing while the polish is still wet to avoid peeling your polish up after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
    <li> I really like these stickers, it makes my nail art easy because i don&#x27;t have a steady hand and i&#x27;m not very artistic, nor am i a professional.great buy.</li>
    <li> It works well and creates great designs. You have to practice with them first though. It comes with 5 packs of the tips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay overall. But for it to look perfect, you really have to have good hands. My daughter tried it on her nails but it got messy since she just did it all by herself without knowing how to apply it. You can look for guides on YouTube.</li>
    <li> These are good and just as advertised, however the chevron is more of an arrow than the continued pattern. Still a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Reliable to make different designs on nails. The pack brings more than enough. Good investment for nail art. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Man it&#x27;s a great product but it just sucks I wasted almost 7 bucks for theses bags. I literally thought they were bigger but they&#x27;re not. And yes it says it cost cheap but I really needed them that I paid extra for speedy delivery. O well, good product overall.</li>
    <li> These are amazing they stick well and I have had them for 5 months and I use them a lot but I have only used one so it&#x27;s a great amount</li>
    <li> If you have wide fingernails these aren&#x27;t for you. They do fit my nails though, and do the job well.</li>
    <li> These suck. I was trying to do a french manicure, and they wouldn&#x27;t even hold the polish back. It bleed through this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> these nail sticker work great to make straight lines. use these every time I want to create a French tip</li>
    <li> I purchased them at a very cheap price and even though they take a while to actually get to my mailbox, It was worth it. There&#x27;s no way that you can find these cheaper and at the same great quality any where else.</li>
    <li> They stuck enough to pull tiny flecks of polish off, but not enough to keep the other polish from bleeding under the stickers. When I was done, it looked like a drunk  toddler tried to do nail art.  If that&#x27;s the look you go for, then these will be right up your alley!</li>
    <li> These are sticky enough that you can re-use them (if you&#x27;re that frugal). They aren&#x27;t so sticky, however, that they&#x27;ll pull your existing polish off.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for helping in placing a guide to paint tips of my nails. Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Very nice for French tips. Makes a nice curved line. Inexpensive and lots of them.</li>
    <li> The standard french tip guide sticker is too curved.  The angled french tip has a rounded angle, which looks weird.  And the other one is just odd.  Also, the stickers are really thick which isn&#x27;t ideal with making sharp lines.  Not many for the money either.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; great price,  will definitely order again in the future</li>
    <li> These work great!  Great for the price!  I&#x27;ve used 2 out of the 3 shapes and love them!  I LOVE doing my nails!  I tried doing the teardrop and chevron by hand before and my nails turned out ok, but these are great to give you that nice crisp line.  They don&#x27;t bleed through either or streak.  I suggest using tweezers to put the stickers on and lightly push down on the sticker to ensure no bleeding.  Put your polish on and peel off almost immediately!  I would buy these again!  Great price and shipped to my house pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Lots of stickers/guides for the price. Quality product. Five individual packages so you could split them up for gifts or to go in party favor bags. WOULD DEF BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I like these very much. They are easy to use and came on time.  Worth the money.  They make fun designs</li>
    <li> they work well, thank you.</li>
    <li> NIce , and good quality</li>
    <li> They are OK they don&#x27;t stick that well though...</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but I love them!!  I&#x27;m forever messing with my nails and changing them. Glad I bought them :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting but I wish for more variety</li>
    <li> Different nail designs with different tips. Very easy to use and take off also. Works perfectly when trying to integrate color but without the mess.</li>
    <li> Just as described. It came faster then said. Right quantity delivered. Fits nail.</li>
    <li> I got many compliments (1 from a salon owner btw) within a few hours for my french mani that i had done using these french tip guide. Everyone thought i got my nails done professionally at a salon. It can be a bit tricky getting these sticky to position right on your nail but once that part is done, it&#x27;s a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the chevron and teardrop yet but will soon.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more!!!</li>
    <li> Great!!!! Sticks great peels great!!!!</li>
    <li> not sure i liked these that much...for the price...they were ok...doubt i&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> When you apply these stickers, make sure the base coat or nail polish you have on underneath is completely dry or else the sticker will rip it off. Also, leave the sticker on until the nail polish on top of the sticker is dry or else the nail polish will come out blurred.</li>
    <li> not very long, ineffective on wide nails</li>
    <li> They came individually (singles) not all 5 in one pack. No names, no brands, just in a sleeve. To me they should have cost way less then that. If you put nothing into the product then the paper you put them on, then why am I paying so much? OR should have been an add on.  they do what I need them to do and just make sure nails are dry or like usual it will take up polish. Make sure you add a sealant and a quick dry. shipment was a little longer. just came in an envelope.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just as described!</li>
    <li> Good quality matches pic and good shipping time.</li>
    <li> These only work for finger nails. Wish they would have some that fit toe nails</li>
    <li> Even though I don&#x27;t need these very often, they are great to have on hand for clients that want a french tip manicure FAST!</li>
    <li> This helps alot and its plenty in a pack I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out it&#x27;s a great liner.</li>
    <li> These r cool. They do the job. I love that it contains three different styles. It is definitely much cheaper than going to a beauty store.</li>
    <li> As other Reviewers have written, these are such a cute idea for nail art. I&#x27;ve followed the suggestion to apply the sticker to my skin a couple times before putting on the nail as the adhesive is really strong. I like the idea of creating cute nail art without paying high salon prices. My experience is that you do need to set aside time when doing your nails to let the first coat fully dry before applying the nail sticker to create the art.  Then letting that coat fully dry before removing the sticker. A top coat is required.  Don&#x27;t try this if you can&#x27;t set aside at least an hour and a half to two hours to do your nails.</li>
    <li> Great deal-so cheap! Would be triple the price at Sally&#x27;s.  Work good as any other brand.</li>
    <li> I actually hate them but it might be operator error. I can&#x27;t get them to stick tight enough and polish bleeds under them</li>
    <li> I like these alot better than the ones at the store and you have more in a package so they last alot longer too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This order comes as a 5-pack so you get plenty of each shape. I liked that they were thinner than other nail stickers I&#x27;ve purchased in the store because they stay on my nails better. Would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of use for these strips. I have had no problems using them for any design. There are various styles that can be used for nail art work.</li>
    <li> Makes three different types of french tipped natural nails super easy. The adhesive is strong enough to keep any polish out of the areas it&#x27;s not wanted, but peels off easily without damaging the base coat. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is that it took a month and a half to come. Although that was within the delivery estimate, it&#x27;s still kind of a crazy-long time-- especially for a package the size and weight of an a average business envelope.</li>
    <li> I got these two weeks earlier than I was supposed to! They work really well and I love how they look and are so easy to use. I really recommend buying these</li>
    <li> I really needed this product but when you get it at the store.... it&#x27;s so expensive and for a lot less quantity so when I saw it in Amazon, I had to get it, and I was not disappointed at all, I love it.</li>
    <li> These work great. I love them.</li>
    <li> Didnt really like them</li>
    <li> Great value and the stickers work very well. Just make sure you let the nail polish dry completely or it will peel it off. I would actually prefer less of the French tip since it&#x27;s so out of style for me. I do like the chevron stickers a lot!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast ! A cheap way to do your nails at home.</li>
    <li> So thin, I can barely pull one off the pack.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot use</li>
    <li> I like then patterns but what I don&#x27;t like is that if you put them on top of nail polish it peels it off when its being removed. Its too sticky. It works great on no polish but that limits the design. Won&#x27;t be buying anymore of these.</li>
    <li> May do good on kids but was to small for my finger nails. Seem like it would&#x27;ve been great. But they are useless to me</li>
    <li> Pack of 5 nail tip guides in sticker form&lt;br /&gt;Works fairly well, helped to work on my wife&#x27;s nails&lt;br /&gt;Not bad</li>
    <li> These make a self done French manicure possible.  Not as good as a professional manicure, but definitely doesn&#x27;t look obviously like a &amp;#34;self done&amp;#34; manicure.</li>
    <li> Really helps when doing a design on your nails</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these more than life itself, but I can&#x27;t.  They are a bit too sticky, so they adhere to everything.  Applying them to your nails takes practice, faith, and probably a child sacrifice to get right.  I&#x27;ve never attached them evenly.  It can certainly be my fault that they seem mis-applied, but it has such an outsized effect on the nail art that it&#x27;s hard not to call out that it requires such experience to apply properly.  I actually did better french tips without the guides.  I&#x27;m still going to give them a chance, though.  No product deserves my rage just because I&#x27;m incapable of applying the items to my right hand.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.....the y send me a note yo say .....sorry for been late....bit it was a great time and the quality of the product is great</li>
    <li> These things are awesome, the reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are kind of hard to apply straight without using tweezers. But besides that these are great and I would recommend them to anyone thinking about getting them.</li>
    <li> This is great, the only thing is that u really have to let the polish dry because if not when upeel the sticker the polish Will come right off, other than that it&#x27;s great:)</li>
    <li> I love these guides, they give me additional confidence to try new designs.</li>
    <li> Not as even of a line as you think they would make.</li>
    <li> I used to freehand all of my manicures.  My right hand never looked quite as good as my left.  These stickers make it so much easier and faster!</li>
    <li> Lots of lifting and bleeding under the tips.This product is utterly worthless. It doesn&#x27;t stick to a polished nail, even if it&#x27;s clean and dry.</li>
    <li> Drawing perfect lines on my clients have never been one of my stronger qualities.  Even less so when it comes to my own hands working on themselves.  These have made my polishing time much faster and the look is exceptional!  Not to mention the price was perfect.</li>
    <li> The chevrons and french tips are pretty large for average nail size.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use.  Delighted with the professional look!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and I only revived a 5 pack of French tip nail guides! I am extremely unhappy and very disappointed because I am a nail artist and I was hoping this would be someone I could buy a lot from. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It says French cheveron and something else but It doesn&#x27;t come with this e I comes with a total different one</li>
    <li> A great buy!  Perfect for fun, pretty, at home french manicures.  Just what I have been looking for at a super price!</li>
    <li> I only received French nail tip guides one pack!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is you can never have enough nail guides.  There are so many designs you can make.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> wonderful guide and easy to use</li>
    <li> The tape does not get a good seal and it allows polish to leak under so it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet... I have played a little but just haven&#x27;t had the time. I am glad that there is two different shapes though.</li>
    <li> These were okay, some of the patterns didn&#x27;t really make sense to me... the chevron patterned ones are too small to d anything with and do not stick so you can paint your lines.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great price</li>
    <li> I have regular sized nail beds.  For my thumbs and for my toes, these stickers do not fit width wise and make it very hard to complete a nice looking manicure because I end up having to hand paint my thumbs and toes.  Doesn&#x27;t look as nice when your biggest nails stand out the most and don&#x27;t have that perfect line like the rest of your nails do.  The Sally Hansen brand of this same product fits great...these do not work for me.</li>
    <li> Did an awesome french tip this weekend with these tip guides. They are great. I love them! They are easy to use and make your nail designs perfect</li>
    <li> They come in really neat packages and I love the teardrop. At first I didn&#x27;t know what that was but now I do and I love it. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet cause I got a today but I bet they would work really well</li>
    <li> Mine were stuck together when took them out of back so a few were ruined oh well still able to use most of them</li>
    <li> great paging and love it so much i do ever thing with them and i going to order more so my friends can do the same for their birthday  love ever thing about it think you so much</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work at all with gel polish. They don&#x27;t stick well to the gel and it just moved all over the place, so no reason to use it. Probably works better with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Easy to peel off, if paint is very dry when you apply the stickers. Makes nail art easy and fun.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> tends to take polish off..but I could be rushing things...</li>
    <li> I have recently got into doing my own nails and I love these guides. The 5 pack comes with so many different designs that there are so many things you can do. They stick to the nail well and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t bleed through so I don&#x27;t have any mistakes with these.</li>
    <li> Very happy, this products gives me many many products for my nails for several months to come with nail tips.</li>
    <li> amazing i loved this product. makes the perfect french tips. i plan on ordering more. recommend this to everyone who has a hard time with straight lines.</li>
    <li> The price on these cant be beat, and they do exactly what they are supposed to. Very handy to have in my nail art stash!</li>
    <li> These are so cheap I hate to complain but....they took over a month to get here, coming from China, whatever, I get that. But then I got them and there are NO Chevron or Teardrop tip guides, just the regular French tip. Boring. I didn&#x27;t even contact them because like I said they&#x27;re so cheap, not even worth it. Lesson learned, get them at the store, might be a couple bucks but you know what you are getting.</li>
    <li> The thing says pack of five, so I assumed that&#x27;s what I would get. However I only received one pack.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use, my daughters now don&#x27;t need me to do their nails!  We still have fun together experimenting with the different designs though.  This product did take a very long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Never Got Them..... WHERE ARE THey!!! I wish i actually recieved them but i didnt... Ughhn so dumb i was so excited!</li>
    <li> I like that this pack gives you the french tip curve as well as some other shapes. They are wide enough to fit across my thumb which is about 1.5 cm across. They stick well and I really like them.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love them. I love anything that deals with my nails though.</li>
    <li> I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used these several times now with different designs and I&#x27;m very happy. Make sure polish is completely dry underneath if using  for nail art, stickers may peel off underlying paint if it&#x27;s too wet. Not the stickers fault though, I&#x27;m just impatient  :)</li>
    <li> Not great, but can&#x27;t beat the price. I can&#x27;t use them b/c they don&#x27;t stick to my acrylics that well, but my friend says they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I love this product minus the fact the the sticker it self is too strong, it actually pulls off some COMPLETELY DRY POLISH</li>
    <li> The stickers way too small and barely fit over my fingers. They don&#x27;t fit properly and are somewhat difficult to remove from your nails. I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you have little children and they fit their little nails.</li>
    <li> The single chevrons are not pointy so the finish it gives is not really a chevron.</li>
    <li> These also come with a chevron stickers.. But i like them they just leave a little bit of sticker residue after peeling it off so you have to wait till it&#x27;s done drying and youve washed your hands a few times before You apply a top coat. Great for the money spent though.</li>
    <li> Not only did my product come sooner than it was expected, I bought a 5 pack and they sent me 10! Will definitely buy from again in the future. I am excited to finally have salon quality tips!!!</li>
    <li> give&#x27;s you lot&#x27;s of choices in creating interesting mani&#x27;s. If you like a professional look but like o do your own nails this is a product you may enjoy.</li>
    <li> These stickers are so sticky that they will take off your base color when you remove the sticker. You have to make them less sticky before placing them on your nails, but that can be tricky because you still want them sticky enough to stay down on your nail. I really wanted a chevron nail guide sticker, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Just Received my order today..what you see is what you get i got 5 pack all in great condition it comes in a very small yellow&lt;br /&gt;envelope it took like 3 weeks to receive it.. I have not tired them yet but when i do ill right another review iam just glad i got my order...</li>
    <li> I have not used them and I have had them for awhile now...I don&#x27;t take time to do my nails often but I&#x27;m sure they are fine</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work at all. They take the underneath polish over when it is torn off. The polish bleeds through . Horrible product DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, these are so worth it!</li>
    <li> These stickers arrived really fast. They are good quality and didn&#x27;t peel off nail polish when removing the sticker for your chosen design. They are sticky but not overly sticky and don&#x27;t leave behind residue on your nail when you pull them off.</li>
    <li> Good price but every time I use them they pull my under coat of nail polish off.</li>
    <li> Always had a hard time getting a straight line for french tip, but not no more! Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Awesome nail guides. They stick on very well. It&#x27;s possible to re-use them, but the stickiness wears off a little with each time you re-use. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> French tip made easier. It&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Makes it easy to do French nails.  As described by seller.</li>
    <li> I love these guidelines. They are a huge help.</li>
</ol>
