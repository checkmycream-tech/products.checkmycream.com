      <li>Superb mini Iron gets down to the root and straightens natural afr0 hair.  </li>
      <li>I just was not crazy about it-sorry.</li>
      <li>I wanted a cost effective upgrade from my $13 flat iron I purchased from Target.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s natural (unpermed) hair and it is It is perfect for African American hair textures.  </li>
      <li>Love the flat iron ..</li>
      <li>I love these flat irons.</li>
      <li>I am really well pleased with this flat iron.</li>
      <li>i have ethic hair and this flat iron works wonder for my edges, flat iron get super hot fast and very easy to use get my hair very very straight</li>
      <li>I really like this product, it gets really close to the root and produces a very silky/shiny result.  </li>
      <li>You can get very close to your scalp with this iron for some root lift.</li>
      <li>It makes root straight and relaxed ends shiny.  </li>
      <li>It is less bulky and I can work with it very easily and get very close to the scalp.  </li>
      <li>That being said, it is very worth forgoing the 1 year warranty to pay 1/3rd of the salon price for this flat iron.</li>
      <li>The small size is much easier to use, and I can get VERY close to the roots of my hair where I have the most kink.</li>
      <li>This works as well as my Chi and I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Turns out that I can curl short hair better with the 1\\&quot; flat iron.  </li>
      <li>like and use them both but the TS-2 seems to make my hair do what I want a little better.</li>
      <li>and I can now create the same fresh from the salon look at home.</li>
      <li>It just leaves my short fine bleached hair too dry without giving my already straight hair the smoothness I am looking for.  </li>
      <li>narrow for short hair or bangs, quick heating with display light, adjustable temperature (140º - 400º)</li>
      <li>I think there needs to be more of a spring/settle allowance in the bed of the blades to accommodate small hair volume.  </li>
      <li>Cons: they sell out quickly, the directions are minimal.</li>
      <li>After much research I finally bought this Farouk ½\\&quot; mini.</li>
      <li>I purchased it to straighten my almost 9 yr old daughters hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I had used a Wee Chi at a friends house in the past and liked how it worked, and I feel this flat iron (made by the same Manufacturer) is comparable.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it does not get as hot as the Farouk Chi flat iron.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that much smaller than the regular one, either, so it doesn&#x27;t save that much room in a suitcase.</li>
      <li>Works ok but not great.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much hair I iron, it still doesn&#x27;t leave the same silky feeling as the regular flat iron.</li>
      <li>Several years ago I started out using a cheap drugstore flat iron for my thick wavy hair.</li>
      <li>The Sedu and Solia manuals suggest around 340 - 350° for normal hair texture, less for bleached, damaged, fine hair and above that (370°) for coarse, thick, ethnic or otherwise resistant hair.   </li>
      <li>This one (deep brillance) will do the trick though, in a pinch....just not as flat and straight as the other.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Superb mini Iron gets down to the root and straightens natural afr0 hair.  Processed hair is shine and silky.  I am growing out my hair. 2 inches are kinky. It makes root straight and relaxed ends shiny.  I have to leave on roots for a while.Its takes time.. but no burns like hot iron.  I was looking for bigger size to do roots with small one and ends with other but not avail in deep briliance.  Good for the money too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and have very thick and course hair. I first bought this iron when I chopped all my hair off.  My Chi was too bulky for the length of my hair.  I love this iron.  Here are the perks:  -Heats quickly.  -Small and easy for traveling.  -There&#x27;s a tie that comes with the cord.  Now I wear weave and I use this iron to straighten my roots and the regular Chi for all longer pieces.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I started out using a cheap drugstore flat iron for my thick wavy hair. After talking to my stylist and my friends I got a 1½\\&quot; Sedu and a 1\\&quot; Solia flat iron for my long hair, and then my inverted bob (Posh Spice). They&#x27;re pricey but you get what you pay for. I got nice SILKY STRAIGHT hair with those brands. Now with my boy haircut (Demi Moore in Ghost) I needed a narrower flat iron. After much research I finally bought this Farouk ½\\&quot; mini. It&#x27;s about 10 inches long and 1½ inch at its widest point.   Pros: narrow for short hair or bangs, quick heating with display light, adjustable temperature (140º - 400º), smooth ceramic surface means no pulling or catching, swivel cord, the tip stays cool enough so I can handle it, the two sides compress for better holding if I want to hold the ends and the price.  Cons: they sell out quickly, the directions are minimal. FYI - The Sedu and Solia manuals suggest around 340 - 350° for normal hair texture, less for bleached, damaged, fine hair and above that (370°) for coarse, thick, ethnic or otherwise resistant hair.   Get a good haircut, use a deep moisturizer once a week and you&#x27;ll be good to go for a great price! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As a cometologist, This one is even better and at a great price!! Love the adjustable settings!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this is the second hair iron I purchased. The other one is the TS-2 detailer, both iron have 1/2\\&quot; plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like and use them both but the TS-2 seems to make my hair do what I want a little better. No idea why. The Farouk iron is not a bad option though. Both have temperature control, long enough cords and get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. They&#x27;re great for short hair coarse hair ,it gets to the roots very well and leaves a shine to the hair. The price makes them even more great. Good buy ! U won&#x27;t be dissappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it gets really close to the root and produces a very silky/shiny result.  I&#x27;ve used it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s natural (unpermed) hair and it is It is perfect for African American hair textures.  I&#x27;ve replaced my CHI Irons (which I paid $85.00 more for) and I can now create the same fresh from the salon look at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after being referred to a Farouk by my hair stylist. The 1\\&quot; was out of stock, but I read the review for the .5\\&quot; and went on other&#x27;s recommendations. The small size is much easier to use, and I can get VERY close to the roots of my hair where I have the most kink. I have medium texture, wavy hair. This iron makes my hair very smooth and shiny. I would suggest it for anyone with any hair texture!</li>
    <li> ITS SMALL and not as inexpensive as I would have liked, but its great for bangs and curling.</li>
    <li> Any flat iron you buy outside of a salon does not come with the 1 year warranty. However that one year warranty is not all it is cracked up to be and each salon has it&#x27;s \\&quot;rules\\&quot; for returning. All of my flat irons break because I drop them too many times and most salons will not refund money for what they feel is \\&quot;abuse\\&quot; (e.g. dropping them). That being said, it is very worth forgoing the 1 year warranty to pay 1/3rd of the salon price for this flat iron. It is excellent for short hair and finishing touches. I have naturally curly, thick, coarse hair cut into a  bob and use this on my front pieces and the back of my hair. I do use a 1 inch flat iron for the longer sides of my hair. It is also great for adding volume at the roots. Especially if your hair is heavy. You can get very close to your scalp with this iron for some root lift. This works as well as my Chi and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I own the 1\\&quot; FHI runway (which is great) and I purchased this one to do the shorter hair on my neck and aound my face. Turns out that I can curl short hair better with the 1\\&quot; flat iron.  This one is only good for burning myself--thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.</li>
    <li> I am really well pleased with this flat iron. I purchased it to straighten my almost 9 yr old daughters hair. She has extremely thick and course hair and it is cut above shoulder length so it was hard to straighten with any other size. This iron is so great cause you can turn down the temperature if need be and it is maneuverable. It takes a lot less time with this iron than it does my slightly larger one. I do recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as great as the other farouk products. No matter how much hair I iron, it still doesn&#x27;t leave the same silky feeling as the regular flat iron. It&#x27;s not that much smaller than the regular one, either, so it doesn&#x27;t save that much room in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> i have ethic hair and this flat iron works wonder for my edges, flat iron get super hot fast and very easy to use get my hair very very straight</li>
    <li> sorry to ruin the positive reviews but I did not like this iron. I saw this iron at TJ Maxx the other day and I was very happy to find it for half the price. So if you can find this iron at TJ Maxx or at Marshalls perhaps, buy it there instead of here. You can pick it up for 29.99! Anyway, I have a short inverted bob that I was hoping to use this flat iron to style the back of my bob. I have a Paul Mitchell flat iron which by the way is excellent that I use to style the top and sides of my hair being that the hair is longer in those areas. This flat iron did not straighten the hair well. I dont think it grips the hair well enough to create the tension you need. Meaning I do not think the plates meet up evenly to grip the hair tightly. I dont think it is a terrible iron but I am just not simply satisfied with the results. I will be returning it tomorrow for a refund. It may work for some I just was not crazy about it-sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I bought this flat iron for work. It&#x27;s wonderful for short hair or bangs. I liked it so much, I got one as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron to straighten my short bangs. It is works great. My only complaint is that it is expensive, if it lasts for a long, long time- I can live with the cost.  I would recommend this small straightener.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  I wanted a cost effective upgrade from my $13 flat iron I purchased from Target.  My hair dresser uses Chi and FHI on my hair(my hair is short and relaxed).  This flat iron on par with both of those but for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality flat iron.  The only problem is that it does not get as hot as the Farouk Chi flat iron.  Although, I purchased this product because it was advertised as one which was created for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair, my Farouk Chi does a better job, faster!  I guess the difference in price is well warranted.  The farouk Chi costs about $50-80. more!  This one (deep brillance) will do the trick though, in a pinch....just not as flat and straight as the other.  It will not likely get all the puffiness out for people that have hair like mine!</li>
    <li> gets very close to the scalp but works as well as any chi... or even better because of the adjustable heat</li>
    <li> I bought this item here on Amazon in March 08 and it&#x27;s now shorted out....just 3 months later.  I contacted the company who stated that Amazon does not have the authority from Farouk to sell their products.  What a waste of money on my part.  I should have just paid full price at a salon who is authorized to carry Farouk items.</li>
    <li> perfect for my inverted bob.  I actually look like I know how to fix my hair without going to the salon!</li>
    <li> This product is great it is made by the same people that make the Chi flatirons, love them will by more of their products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of texture or curl in my hair, so pretty much any straightener would be adequate for me.  That said, this one&#x27;s narrow heating wand is perfect for getting closer to the scalp (safely) than most other straighteners.  If it broke, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM TO STRAIGHTEN HAIR WITH INSTEAD OF THE PRESSING COMB AND IT WAS WONDERFUL IT REALLY LETS ME GET TO THE ROOT LOL AND STRAIGHTENS WONDERFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom odered this for me as a gift 2 days ago. It showed up yesterday afternoon and I tested it out as soon as I got home. Works GREAT! Thanks for the speedy shipping!</li>
    <li> I prefer this iron to my Farouk Chi iron.  It is less bulky and I can work with it very easily and get very close to the scalp.  There is a temperature heat adjustment.  It reaches temperature very quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because the Wee CHI is out of stock indefinitely.  It&#x27;s not the best but it serves the same purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It works really great, nice and small, heats up super hot and quick. I do have very thin hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on thick hair. It is the best flat iron I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have over the years been through two flat irons from TIGI the \\&quot;lil hottie\\&quot; and I had been looking for the Wee Chi for quite some time now only to find out it has been discontinued for fire hazard. And I was bummed because there were no other flat irons out there as small as the lil hottie, and I have used the big Chi before and noticed it gets your hair pin straight quicker and is easier to use.  My two lil hotties have since lost their heat over the years and It was time to upgrade to something that you can adjust the heat on.  I had used a Wee Chi at a friends house in the past and liked how it worked, and I feel this flat iron (made by the same Manufacturer) is comparable. Highly recommend this great product great value!</li>
    <li> Product works great.  I have thick hair that&#x27;s past shoulder length.  Probably should have opted for a 1 or 1.5 inch.  Nonetheless this product because it&#x27;s a .5 inch works great at getting to my roots.</li>
    <li> This a perfect flat iron for short hair! I love it I use it every day. It has an adjustable heat setting, and heats up quickly. Would not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I used to have the Jose Eber 1/2 inch iron.  After I lost it, I ordered this one because it has temp control.  I have just reordered the Jose Eber again because I haven&#x27;t been using my Farouk.  It just leaves my short fine bleached hair too dry without giving my already straight hair the smoothness I am looking for.  Works ok but not great.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a pretty severe mismatch in the angles of the blades and not enough glide to the coating so that with some pressure it pulls out some of my hair without even touching the rest of it.  I think there needs to be more of a spring/settle allowance in the bed of the blades to accommodate small hair volume.  I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this for travel so I&#x27;m not too sad if I loose it.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron ..I wish i could find on that is compatible to this ..Very good on short hair !</li>
