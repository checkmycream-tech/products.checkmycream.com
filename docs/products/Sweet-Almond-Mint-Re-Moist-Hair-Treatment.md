      <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m really, really happy with it!</li>
      <li>Believe me, I have spared no expense and have tried the very best on the market no matter where around the world I had to get the products from, and Nothing Compares to Wen.</li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>I even fell asleep one night with it in my hair and it was great.  </li>
      <li>it smells great.</li>
      <li>This product is a great conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with the product line is</li>
      <li>This product is exceptional when it comes to keeping my hair moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent conditioner, the thing I noticed about Wen is you have to stay with the product line, when I first started using it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to give it what it needed!</li>
      <li>Well, that&#x27;s because they have to experiment and find out which Wen conditioning cleansers are most suitable for their hair type.</li>
      <li>I love all the Wen products.</li>
      <li>I think that Frederick Fekai has a better intensive treatment hair mask</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I had hoped it would be more hydrating for the hair then it states.</li>
      <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t wait to use it again in a week.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love what this product did for my hair.</li>
      <li>Now for three months I have had so many conditioning treatments to get rid of the frizzy and straw-like look since the hairdresser destroyed my hair.</li>
      <li>most times.&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed this product and decided to spend more money on one more product without any expectation and it worked.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products to keep the frizz away and this is the one that did it.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and does a great job of repairing my long  hair.  </li>
      <li>I use this product as a leave-in conditioner and use a great conditioning styling gel to get my natural curls to come through without any frizz on the ends!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and works as promised.</li>
      <li>I love the Wen Sweet Almond hair care line.  </li>
      <li>Shoulder length and fine to medium fine - but lots of it.  </li>
      <li>The Re-moist hydrating hair mask has improved the texture of my hair tremendously!</li>
      <li>I used it and really did not see much of a difference in my hair.but smells great</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need as much as they recommend to get a great conditioning treatment.  </li>
      <li>One use of this product left my hair shiner, softer, and more manageable!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says!</li>
      <li>Worth the money...</li>
      <li>When a product makes a distinct and noticeable difference like this you have to say something keeping in mind</li>
      <li>my product should arrive in a few more days!!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and normal.  </li>
      <li>Wen has made significant improvement in texture, strength-my hair is far less suseptible to the breakage I had experienced, appearance and manageability.</li>
      <li>After my morning shower, my hair was so soft, flowing and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just used this product for the first time last night and my hair is softer and more conditioned than it has been in ages.</li>
      <li>Consistently delivers in the hair care category.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
      <li>If the Wen they are using is making their hair too oily or not as conditioned, all they have to do is experiment and find out which one is right for their particular hair requirement.  </li>
      <li>I like it, however like the Wen Sweet Almond Mint ReMoist Intensive Treatment better because it is a little lighter.</li>
      <li>I use this mostly on my ends in the shower when my ends feel dry and brittle and this fixes my problem.</li>
      <li>I try to keep as much heat from it as possible but the frizz would be so unmanagable until curling or pressing with a light grease</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I like it or not..</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my hair after using this product.</li>
      <li>I purchased a whole line of Wen products and this was included in my package.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Really you could not add  printed(with readable font) instructions?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m working on a more natural look but naturally my hair is dry, thirsty, and course.  </li>
      <li>is worth every extra penny I spend.</li>
      <li>I Love the product but found it at another site for about $25 less than here!  </li>
      <li>Then I started cleaning my hair with wen sweet almond mint conditioning cleanser and then applied the  Wen Sweet Almond Mint Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask and left this in my hair for half an hour with the shower cap on.</li>
      <li>IT IS VERY SOFT AND MANAGEBLE.  </li>
      <li>I then took a spray bottle and half filled it with water and put in a tiny portion of the wen Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask and shook it to make my own leave-in conditioner and sprayed my hair with this and then blow dried my hair.</li>
      <li>I am sure that if I ever decide to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, this product would be the one I would use to assist with eliminating excessive breakage, as I go through the transition period.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I am an African American woman in my late 50&#x27;s, and during the normal 6 to 8 week time period where I would have put a chemical relaxer on my hair to straighten it, I decided to try WEN Sweet Almond Mint Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask instead; I was so pleased with the results of this product and how it made my hair look and feel, that I decided to postpone putting a chemical relaxer on my hair for another two weeks.</li>
      <li>The Wen products make your hair look healthier because they don&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals in them and actually literally bring your hair back to health.ich one is right for their particular hair requirement.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.  </li>
      <li>If I had known that I would have to stay up late night to catch the Wen infomercial to be able to use this product I would have not bothered.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and silky.</li>
      <li>it is a product it is not going to give me a model&#x27;s hair that is professionally styled, etc.,</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also naturally frizzy</li>
      <li>so the natural look hasn&#x27;t been one I&#x27;m liking so far.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and it went far beyond what was promised.  </li>
      <li>I was a little disappointd because I expected a better result.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft after using it and I have really coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>My coloured, blow dried, curled hair was soft as my granddaughters 3 year old hair was!!!  </li>
      <li>Well, I have done this ritual three times now(three shampoos later) and my hair looks normal and healthy,not frizzy or dry, just like it did before the Hairdresser</li>
      <li>I have very thick, fairly long hair, think mixed chicks type hair, the kind you need at a minimum a wide tooth comb to get through?</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little high for the quantity but the quality of it pays off!</li>

<li> I wish it were a little less expensive!  </li>
<li> I use it now at least once a month to refresh my tired hair and scalp.  </li>

<li> That disappointed me.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed in that.</li>
<li> They smell horrible to me!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this. It does exactly what it says! Re-moist! I use this mostly on my ends in the shower when my ends feel dry and brittle and this fixes my problem. I also use it as a deep conditioning hair mask when i feel that my hair is in need of intensive treatment. All in all, a great product! Worth the money...yes!</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time last night and my hair is softer and more conditioned than it has been in ages. I left it in for 25-30 minutes with a conditioning cap on. After rinsing it out and blow-drying, my hair revealed long-awaited beauty. The hair is soft and silky. It was like straw before. I love this product and can&#x27;t wait to use it again in a week. My hair has needed this and I&#x27;m so glad to give it what it needed! Seriously, I&#x27;m really, really happy with it!</li>
    <li> I JUST RECENTLY SWITCHED TO ALL THE WEN PRODUCTS.  I REALLY NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.  IT IS VERY SOFT AND MANAGEBLE.  I HAVE VERY COARSE AND DRY HAIR, NOT ANYMORE.  I RECENTLY RAN OUT AND HAD TO USE REGULAR SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, MY HAIR FEELS LIKE STRAW NOW.  CAN&#x27;T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME IN!!</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my hair after using this product. I left it on for 5 hours (it recommends 45 minutes to 8 hours). I think that Frederick Fekai has a better intensive treatment hair mask so I&#x27;ll be purchasing that in the future!</li>
    <li> I Love the product but found it at another site for about $25 less than here!  That disappointed me.  I usually come to Amazon for service...great service.  Just so disappointed that had I gone to QVC or any other site, maybe, I would have spent $25 less!  Very disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen Sweet Almond hair care line.  It smells good and does a great job of repairing my long  hair.  I wish it were a little less expensive!  Yikes!  If you follow the directions and you have long hair you will be spending a fortune!  I also tried the sampler pack with the different fragrances like cucumber, lavender, fig, etc.  They smell horrible to me!</li>
    <li> I have heavy highlighted and body permed hair.  Shoulder length and fine to medium fine - but lots of it.  Using this product my hair separated and was weighed down to where I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.  Used it one time and am left with an expensive purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner, the thing I noticed about Wen is you have to stay with the product line, when I first started using it the change was negligible but there was enough of an improvement that I stayed with it and now I would not use any other product line. I have very thick, fairly long hair, think mixed chicks type hair, the kind you need at a minimum a wide tooth comb to get through? Wen has made significant improvement in texture, strength-my hair is far less suseptible to the breakage I had experienced, appearance and manageability. When a product makes a distinct and noticeable difference like this you have to say something keeping in mind it is a product it is not going to give me a model&#x27;s hair that is professionally styled, etc., but now that I have stuck with Wen I would never go back to stripping my hair with shampoo of its natural oils and then turning around and trying to rehydrate it with conditioners and other products-how does that make sense? I am so happy with the product line is is worth every extra penny I spend. Even the woman that trims my hair noticed the difference she had told me awhile back I needed to cut quite a bit off due to damage? She does not say that anymore!</li>
    <li> This product has been used by our family for a long time.  Consistently delivers in the hair care category.  Easy to use and works as promised.</li>
    <li> This is not made by Chaz Dean but by Guthy Reneker.  Yes Chaz Dean is making money off of his knock off, the ingredients aren&#x27;t the same.  Check it out for yourself don&#x27;t take my word for it.  NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> The Re-moist hydrating hair mask has improved the texture of my hair tremendously! My hair is not dry, dull and brittle any longer.</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair coloured and the hairdresser left the developer in my hair for too long and literally cooked my hair.  My hair is fine and normal.  Now for three months I have had so many conditioning treatments to get rid of the frizzy and straw-like look since the hairdresser destroyed my hair. Nothing worked.  I also had the Keraste Chronologiste Hair Mask treatment to bring it back to life and this cost me $98 at another Hairdresser.  Nothing worked. My hair looked extremely dry and cooked. Then I started cleaning my hair with wen sweet almond mint conditioning cleanser and then applied the  Wen Sweet Almond Mint Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask and left this in my hair for half an hour with the shower cap on. When I rinsed this out. I then took a spray bottle and half filled it with water and put in a tiny portion of the wen Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask and shook it to make my own leave-in conditioner and sprayed my hair with this and then blow dried my hair. Well, I have done this ritual three times now(three shampoos later) and my hair looks normal and healthy,not frizzy or dry, just like it did before the Hairdresser (cooked)my hair. I was contemplating cutting it all off before I used the Wen products. In the three months following the damage that was done to my hair, no matter what treatments I did to my hair, it didn&#x27;t improve until I tried the Wen products.  In my opinion, these products are the Rolls Royce of Haircare and nothing else compares. Believe me, I have spared no expense and have tried the very best on the market no matter where around the world I had to get the products from, and Nothing Compares to Wen. I have seen reviews of people using Wen and they say it makes their hair too oily. Well, that&#x27;s because they have to experiment and find out which Wen conditioning cleansers are most suitable for their hair type. If the Wen they are using is making their hair too oily or not as conditioned, all they have to do is experiment and find out which one is right for their particular hair requirement.  Or the cheaper way to find out is to contact the Chaz Dean website and ask for advise before they start knocking this product.  The Wen products make your hair look healthier because they don&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals in them and actually literally bring your hair back to health.ich one is right for their particular hair requirement.

    <li> I totally will buy another WEN  hair mask, It has worked wonders in my hair. The price it&#x27;s a little high for the quantity but the quality of it pays off!</li>
    <li> I had hoped it would be more hydrating for the hair then it states. I used it and really did not see much of a difference in my hair.but smells great</li>
    <li> This product is a great conditioner.  My hair feels so soft after using it and I have really coarse hair.  You really don&#x27;t need as much as they recommend to get a great conditioning treatment.  I love all the Wen products.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to keep the frizz away and this is the one that did it.  I&#x27;m working on a more natural look but naturally my hair is dry, thirsty, and course.  Factually my head of hair is a combination of different curl patterns throughout but it&#x27;s also naturally frizzy so the natural look hasn&#x27;t been one I&#x27;m liking so far.  I try to keep as much heat from it as possible but the frizz would be so unmanagable until curling or pressing with a light grease became the only solution most times.&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed this product and decided to spend more money on one more product without any expectation and it worked.  I use this product as a leave-in conditioner and use a great conditioning styling gel to get my natural curls to come through without any frizz on the ends!  I now use it daily.</li>
    <li> This Product should be called &amp;#34;Sweet Almond Mint Life Saver for Hair&amp;#34;! I absolutely love what this product did for my hair. One use of this product left my hair shiner, softer, and more manageable! I am an African American woman in my late 50&#x27;s, and during the normal 6 to 8 week time period where I would have put a chemical relaxer on my hair to straighten it, I decided to try WEN Sweet Almond Mint Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask instead; I was so pleased with the results of this product and how it made my hair look and feel, that I decided to postpone putting a chemical relaxer on my hair for another two weeks. I am sure that if I ever decide to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, this product would be the one I would use to assist with eliminating excessive breakage, as I go through the transition period. I am seriously considering going natural, which has prompted me to order another jar of the Re-Moist Hydrating Mask...my product should arrive in a few more days!! yea!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a runner, so I constantly have to wash my hair.  This product is exceptional when it comes to keeping my hair moisturized.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I like it or not..I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. Problem.... instruction is sooo small that even with my bi-focals it&#x27;s still to small to read...Really you could not add  printed(with readable font) instructions? For the price, no one should have to guess the proper use.  If I had known that I would have to stay up late night to catch the Wen infomercial to be able to use this product I would have not bothered. It&#x27;s not a case of \\&quot;you get what you paid for\\&quot; because I paid enough to get instructions I can actually see.  CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO USE THIS STUFF???? Oh yeah it smells great.</li>
    <li> Having coloured my hair for years, as it has aged, it has gotten a bit drier and I needed a treat for my hair to feel alive again.  I purchased a whole line of Wen products and this was included in my package.  I had never used a deep treatment before and did not know what to expect.  My first try I only left it on for an hour and was not impressed.  My hair was softer but not refreshed. I was a little disappointd because I expected a better result.  But I vowed to try it again and the second time, about a week later, I applied it, combed it through and let it sit for over two hours.  WOW! What a difference! My coloured, blow dried, curled hair was soft as my granddaughters 3 year old hair was!!!  I was shocked.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and it went far beyond what was promised.  I use it now at least once a month to refresh my tired hair and scalp.  I even fell asleep one night with it in my hair and it was great.  After my morning shower, my hair was so soft, flowing and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read a few people who were not satisfied but I found, for my hair, this is the perfect treatment.</li>
    <li> I put it on after washing &amp; conditioning my hair &amp; just leave it in. I like it, however like the Wen Sweet Almond Mint ReMoist Intensive Treatment better because it is a little lighter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal! Loved it!</li>
