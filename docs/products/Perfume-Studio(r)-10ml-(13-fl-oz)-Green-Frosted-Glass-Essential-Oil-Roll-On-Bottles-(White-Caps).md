<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product. A little hard to see amount of liquid in bottle.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> These are great for making my own perfumes. I have not had any problems with the roll on</li>
    <li> with the metal roller balls - my favorite!</li>
    <li> not much to say except it does what it is designed to do.  Top snaps on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leak.  nice quality.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite bottles. I&#x27;ve ordered a couple times and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I mix essential oils to make soap, and wanted to mix the same scents with a carrier oil to use as a roll on.  This are exactly what I needed, perfect size, easy to use, and the green is dark enough to protect the oils.  Arrived well packaged and on time.</li>
    <li> So far, so GREAT! These bottles are working well for my essential oil/carrier oil mixes! And I love the color!</li>
    <li> Good price, very satisfied</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, they arrived as advertised and have a good look to them.</li>
    <li> I thought these were bigger.  Just ok</li>
    <li> These are good roller bottles. They function well, perhaps a little scant on releasing the oil, but that prevents waste. I like the green, it helps differentiate from my other bottles. I use them for FCO.</li>
    <li> very nice bottles. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you</li>
    <li> I received my order and really like the size of these bottles for different oils.  I did have a problem with one of the roller balls; but the vendor replaced the ball free of charge.  No problem with the replacement ball.  Since all bottle are same color; I used by label maker to make each bottle so I don&#x27;t get the wrong one when using them.  Maybe a multi color pack would solve this problem; but I really like the green. The darker color keeps the light from getting to the oils.</li>
    <li> Not enough air movement from base, but lids are tight!</li>
    <li> Great little bottles for topical medical solutions like ones from compounded pharmacies.  I also carry skin and hair oils in them for air travel.  Sturdy glass.  I wish they came in a 3.5 fl oz size also.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for essential oils. Great, sturdy product. I have reused them and the roller balls stay intact. Well done.</li>
    <li> These bottles works great! The roller ball actually rolls and dispenses product perfectly. They don&#x27;t leak or drip, they just do what they are supposed to do. On some other brands the roller doesn&#x27;t roll or it leaks and drips. These bottles are awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice roller ball...easy to pop off to refill without it being leaky.</li>
    <li> Great for my oil blends!!</li>
    <li> The bottles themselves are of good quality but I found I don&#x27;t like using them. The rating is more a personal preference not quality of the product.</li>
    <li> These bottles arrived fast. More importantly the bottles are great to work with. The cap and roller ball are easy to put on and remove. Mine have yet to leak.</li>
    <li> Great bottles.  I use them often for different essential oil concoctions and they work very well.</li>
    <li> So useful for any type of EO blend!</li>
    <li> I love these bottles!!</li>
    <li> These were just what we needed.  Work great.</li>
    <li> These are a very nice bottle. I have had others that the colored coating wears off quickly! These hold up and retain the green color for a long time and i carry one in my pocket at all times! Love them</li>
    <li> Very high quality, hasn&#x27;t leaked.  The roller puts out just the right amount of oil whereas some cheaper ones on other sites seemed like they didn&#x27;t put enough oil out.  They&#x27;re great, I ordered these in bulk directly from Plant Therapy too (discount for large orders).</li>
    <li> these are beautiful easy to use and work well. one of the rollers was not useable as the ball just fell right out of the insert, but other than that they are great</li>
    <li> Came with No Rollball lid.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and true to description. Good pricing and value for 4 bottles, shipped in excellent time.</li>
    <li> These are a great item.  They&#x27;ve worked really well with my essential oil blends.  The roller ball rolls very well, the caps have not leaked on me, and I like that the cap is white so that I can write on it with a sharpie.  No need to add another label, and the green is dark enough to protect the oils.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far these are holding up with a mix of some essential oils in a base oil.  The roll on feature is great and works well for my needs. It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry in my pocket.  A little bit larger than a standard chapstick container.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and was just what I needed for my essential oil blends</li>
    <li> Excellent quality nice thick glass with an inert roller ball. Dark deep green can be seen through just enough to get a visual of oil levels. The ball top snaps on easy peasy and the lid has excellent fit snapping on and off to refill easily with a little gentle pry. The jar mouth is wide enough for drops of oil to enter without a funnel or eye dropper. Excellent for diluting essential oils with carrier oil. Comes disassembled for easy first fill.</li>
    <li> These are a beautiful frosty green and are perfect for the purse.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly! They are fantastic for mixing essential oils and super convenient. Make sure you do NOT push down on the roller ball when snapping the top on. They don&#x27;t leak and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Received item very quickly. It was not broken and was not missing any parts. Haven&#x27;t tried using it yet, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Whatever your favorite essential oil blend is, I  recommend these bottles. The roll on tip makes it very easy to apply on your temple or wrists. Just mix your oil with a carrier oil and you are set to go.  They come very well protected.  My daughter uses them for her blend that helps ease headaches.  Many uses.</li>
    <li> The roller ball snapped easily and securely into the bottle. I use them for storing essential oil blends, and the roll-on distributes the right amount of product. No leaking. I am very satisfied with these bottles.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great! Not too difficult to get the roller lids off and on, but no leakage. Love them!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to mix your carrier oil and essential oils to take with you for applying as you travel.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t yet used it but the roller seems to be a little stiff.  May be OK once oils are added.</li>
    <li> love green so these are my favorite to use for my mixed oils. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> These are very nice bottles for my oils, someday I wish they would make ones with metal roller balls as these plastic ones tend to get gunky and stick making them not roll-on so easily</li>
    <li> So far I have used these to store and apply diluted EO&#x27;s to skin. They work great..no leaks and ball moves well. I will re-purchase when in need.</li>
    <li> Lowe these attractive bottles. Love the company I  bought them from...Exceptional service and shipping. One note...be sure to indicate if you want black or white lids when ordering. The roller balls fit tightly as well as the lids...you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of your precious essential oils spilling out if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re using them for as I am.&lt;br /&gt;Also...they make a lovely and unexpected gift!</li>
    <li> These roll-on bottles are perfect for carrying in my handbag, or sharing a sample with a friend.  Roll-on caps pop off easily, yet stay in place after they are snapped on.</li>
    <li> These bottles worked perfectly fine for my needs.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are great little bottles. They arrived in perfect condition and work really well. I even received them sooner than the estimated ship time which is always a plus. I would order them again if needed.</li>
    <li> Love these for my essential oils !</li>
    <li> perfect for my YL oil blends I make for myseld and give as gifts˜!  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Perfect! I use these for Peppermint essential oil. Great bottle, well made and the roller really rolls.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase! Quality bottles with smooth roller balls. Fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I guess the bottles are ok, a little small, but they came unassembled and there were 4 bottles, but only 3 roller balls, so essentially one bottle is useless.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I use them to pour patchouli oil in them and use them as a cologne dispenser. Work flawlessly for this. Plus, you keep the oil off your hands. Great product. Fast ship. Good packaging.</li>
    <li> Easy to assembly.  Lid and roller ball snap into place securely.  Great for making your own roll-on blends.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dispensing the essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, high-quality roller bottles.  These are perfect for my essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> I just love these!  I love the green color and have reordered them several times for essential oil blends.  They are easy to fill and refill and I have never had an issue with one leaking.</li>
    <li> These worked out perfectly for my needs.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to leak, Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles to mix EOs in and I am very happy with them. The ball moves easily enough to dispense oil but it does not leak. Personally, I prefer frosted bottles because they do not show fingerprints like unfrosted glass does. Good value product and functions exactly as it should.</li>
