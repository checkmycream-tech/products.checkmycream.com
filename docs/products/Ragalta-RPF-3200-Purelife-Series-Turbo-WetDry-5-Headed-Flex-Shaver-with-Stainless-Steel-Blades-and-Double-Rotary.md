      <li>awesome fathers day gift,</li>
      <li>Best  shaver.</li>
      <li>Great razor for the money</li>
      <li>It did a very nice job.  </li>
      <li>Awesome shaver, not as close as the blade shaver, but no discomfort, and easy to use!</li>
      <li>great razorI have tried many electric razor&#x27;s and this one does a excellent job.</li>
      <li>good news is that the shaver gives me a great shave.</li>
      <li>Overal a good product</li>
      <li>I have used one before and am very satisfied..</li>
      <li>The value is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the Norelcos and Remingtons I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>SURE</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my last shaver, but is good!!!</li>
      <li>The instructions say that the shaver will retain a charge up to 10 days; however, the most I&#x27;ve gotten is 3 days.  </li>
      <li>But once I learned how to snap the heads on and off cleaning was perhaps more efficient.</li>
      <li>This is more than what I was expecting love</li>
      <li>I tried charging it every day, but the on-off switch problem didn&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
      <li>THE SHAVER IS THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME.  </li>
      <li>The beard and mustache trimmer has a cheap plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; to cut hair to length.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it felt good to use, especially around my chin.  </li>
      <li>The shave isn&#x27;t very close, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge more than about two days shaving.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, I will say that it always eventually worked after pressing the switch several times, but I worried about the day that it wouldn&#x27;t work, so I bought a Norelco and put this one in a drawer.</li>
      <li>Close, comfortable, fast, easy.  </li>
      <li>Battery life, even with my older model, is nothing short of great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I have recommended it to a few friends.</li>
      <li>We sent it back and he got a better one.</li>
      <li>Despite the issues, I love using this shaver and would definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>way better than expected</li>
      <li>IT SHAVES VERY CLOSE</li>
      <li>Thanks anyway</li>
      <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;The prince was reasonable and not to high</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It takes a little getting use to the five heads, but once you do you will Love it.</li>
      <li>After searching a good rechargeable razor thar will cut my tough beard.</li>
      <li>and I thought there might be something wrong with it, but I&#x27;ve been using for weeks and experienced no problems.  </li>
      <li>I used my cell phone and ordered a new one from Amazon.</li>
      <li>And then there&#x27;s the time to get used to a new one.</li>
      <li>Finally a razor without the high cost!</li>
      <li>was surprised that the design was changed.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this razor when  I saw the big 5 blade head</li>
      <li>Buying a new one (different make/model) means I don&#x27;t need the replacement.  </li>
      <li>It does give off an odd odor when i first start it</li>
      <li>For less than the cost of replacing the shaving heads of other brands, I got a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;While shaving is a personal experience, I really favor the Ragalta.</li>

    <li> I like it better than the Norelcos and Remingtons I&#x27;ve used.  It gives me a close shave, even on my neck and chin (used with shaving gel in the shower).  Other models tend to give me a razor burn on my neck when I try to remove all of the stubble.  It does give off an odd odor when i first start it and I thought there might be something wrong with it, but I&#x27;ve been using for weeks and experienced no problems.  No cleaning needed (or as far as I can tell, possible) other than running it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update;  I&#x27;ve been meaning to do this for a while, but I wanted to let other potential buyers know that the unit died after fee months.  The switch stopped working and it also seemed to have issues holding a charge.  I didn&#x27;t pursue a waranty claim.  What&#x27;s the point?  I can&#x27;t wait a few weeks and go without shaving.  Buying a new one (different make/model) means I don&#x27;t need the replacement.  And then there&#x27;s the time to get used to a new one. Too bad.  It did a very nice job.  Maybe the failure had something to do with the odd odor?  Anyway, I can&#x27;t recommend it anymore.</li>
    <li> After searching a good rechargeable razor thar will cut my tough beard. Finally a razor without the high cost! Also the accessories are fanyastic.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver, not as close as the blade shaver, but no discomfort, and easy to use!</li>
    <li> and then sent it back because of the poor shave. This didn&#x27;t come close to controlling my boyfriends facial hair. He shaves daily and an hour or so later he noticed stubble. We sent it back and he got a better one. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Dreadful - I had used a Haband shaver for several years, which was very easy to clean unlike this Ragiatia model. I even telephoned Ragitiatia as the shaver received would not allow me to open the heads the way it is illustrated in the manual, but was not helped when the support staff just told me what was in the manual and could not explain how the head would not hinge. I packed up the shaver and returned it as I was not going to risk damaging the shaver and then it costing me. I purchased a much more expensive shaver which works well and opens up to be cleaned without any problems.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this razor when  I saw the big 5 blade head and I thought it felt good to use, especially around my chin.  On about the third day, I started having trouble with the on-off switch--sometimes having to press it several times to get it to turn on or off.  The shave isn&#x27;t very close, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge more than about two days shaving.  I tried charging it every day, but the on-off switch problem didn&#x27;t get any better.  To be fair, I will say that it always eventually worked after pressing the switch several times, but I worried about the day that it wouldn&#x27;t work, so I bought a Norelco and put this one in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This is more than what I was expecting love the product.&lt;br /&gt;The prince was reasonable and not to high i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great razorI have tried many electric razor&#x27;s and this one does a excellent job. It takes a little getting use to the five heads, but once you do you will Love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband only to find out it wasn&#x27;t what he wanted.  However, decided to keep it for myself.  In comparison to my woman&#x27;s electric shaver, this is a dream.  It floats over my legs without cutting skin, pulling hair, etc.  The beard and mustache trimmer has a cheap plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; to cut hair to length.  The plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; does  not stay in place.  The instructions say that the shaver will retain a charge up to 10 days; however, the most I&#x27;ve gotten is 3 days.  Despite the issues, I love using this shaver and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> THE SHAVER IS THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME.  IT SHAVES VERY CLOSE I AM SURE I TRYED THE RAGALTA RPF-3200.  I WILL WAIT AND SEE IF IT LAST AT LEAST A YEAR OR TWO.  THANK YOU RAGALTA</li>
    <li> I have used one before and am very satisfied..This is a great product and I have recommended it to a few friends.</li>
    <li> Finally the answer to all my shaving hopes and dreams.  Close, comfortable, fast, easy.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love. It. It. Is. The. Best  shaver. I. Use. In. A. Long. Time</li>
    <li> Shaver stays charged for weeks. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my last shaver, but is good!!! Overal a good product</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money</li>
    <li> Fell apart after two shaves, can&#x27;t shave with only 3 heads, don&#x27;t work that way.  Thanks anyway</li>
    <li> My wife and I took a few days for a vacation. My Ragalta shaver that has served me well for multiple years broke (snapped off) one of the heads. It snapped off because of my poor packing abilities. The shaver worked (minus one missing cutting blade) but it really was time for a replacement. I used my cell phone and ordered a new one from Amazon. Upon arrival home (two days latter) the shaver was waiting in front of my front door.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the design was changed. Instead of a hinged shaver head was a snap on and off design. Multiple charging indicators were removed. The multiple charging lights mean less to me then the hinged cutting heads. But once I learned how to snap the heads on and off cleaning was perhaps more efficient. It made the fifth (center blade) easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that the shaver gives me a great shave. Battery life, even with my older model, is nothing short of great. The value is outstanding. For less than the cost of replacing the shaving heads of other brands, I got a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;While shaving is a personal experience, I really favor the Ragalta.</li>
    <li> way better than expected</li>
    <li> awesome fathers day gift,</li>
