      <li>Her face looks amazing.</li>
      <li>It has quite a bit of positive effect on acne scars as well, a condition that a good friend had in abundance before utilizing this product (it truly is remarkable, her skin is SO MUCH BETTER!).</li>
      <li>it is by far the best thing i have ever used for acne!</li>
      <li>I find that using coconut oil, soap, and water removes the creme better than warm water and soap.</li>
      <li>It is also great for discolorations when used consistently over time.</li>
      <li>Well for one, it is good for mild acne.</li>
      <li>It took me a screw driver and a lot of prying to get the tin open, but once I did it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>and flaky.so MOISTURIZER is a must! :)</li>
      <li>Better than Vicks at night time on your face.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I find that it smells more like the</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!I</li>
      <li>It is meant to sit on top of your skin.</li>
      <li>I am now glad that I found something to treat it.</li>
      <li>I just apply it at night before bed, and shower it off in the a.m. After about five days, my chest looked drastically better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OK, ingredients for a BETTER DIY replacement for this stuff:</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>skin sops up all of the moisture and surprisingly ends up looking very vibrant instead of greasy!</li>
      <li>--only one I found remotely as effective was Terrasil which is much more pleasant in smell, but cost four-five times more.</li>
      <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell super and leaves a chalky residue, but that&#x27;s better than looking like you have chest acne when you know you don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is a magic serum i recomend it to any one who needs a good clear face!</li>
      <li>so it rubs in quite easily.</li>
      <li>You should dilute with vaseline if it is too strong for you.</li>
      <li>The other reviews made it sound so wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Makeup still blends and sits fine on my skin afterwards.</li>
      <li>It might burn light a bitch, but it sure as hell works.(For full effect use</li>
      <li>I created my own concoction based on these ingredients, bought everything on Amazon, and now I&#x27;ve got a year of high quality face masks in my pantry...and non-irritating like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>great, i look for a long time.</li>
      <li>and Night, After washing my face with Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash and patting dry, I swipe a little Nixoderm on my finger and dilute it with A&amp;D ointment which in itself is also good for the skin and used for scar healing so its perfect!</li>
      <li>I have tried antibiotics, diaper rash meds, special creams, violet extract, hundred dollar soaps, etc</li>
      <li>This has menthol so if it is close to your eyes or cheek, you will feel that cool feeling which can irritate some.</li>
      <li>this stuff burns, Its not a bad burn</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually been more proud of myskin going completely bare faced!</li>
      <li>The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
      <li>Not that tea tree oil is not a good product, but its not the best use for moist areas on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I researched and found that Jojoba Oil is the very best base for this, because it&#x27;s so good for your skin</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>you have a skin condition that seems immune to OTC creams and lotions, Nixoderm may be worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Yields 3 tins worth of</li>
      <li>It has a distinct smell and burns a bit</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s amazing and fast acting.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s mainly yeast and bacteria (the normal kind we all have on our skin overgrows), salicylic acid and antibacterials help clear things up.</li>
      <li>I tried a fucidic acid ointment first with no results.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hormonal - comes during my cycle, but first showed up after pregnancy when I was nursing.</li>
      <li>That being said, the Thai version seems to work better, both for myself, as well as for several people I have handed tins out to.</li>
      <li>no name tin be exactly what I need!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It is easier to contain if applied at first start of itching.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that has made ANY difference in my perioral dermatitis.</li>
      <li>The product is white and I first rub it in and then apply more on to &amp;</li>
      <li>smells funny and wonder where it is made.  </li>
      <li>This is definetly a better product and last much longer.</li>
      <li>purchased it for my acne, but it did absolutely nothing for my skin, it burnt for the first 2 minutes like it was working</li>
      <li>purely healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pry open the tin, and dilute with organic coconut oil, A &amp; D or even Vaseline if its too strong for you straight out of the tin.  </li>
      <li>The beauty in that is that you don&#x27;t need much...</li>
      <li>I think this stuff really works on preventing acne and excema flare-ups.  </li>
      <li>It works very well on skin problems, I&#x27;ve used this for years and will always continue to buy it .</li>
      <li>VERY WELL</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
      <li>and it really did nothing but</li>
      <li>I really like this nixoderm cream.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;ve cover the effected areas, I use Simple hydrating light moisturizer over the concoction to moisturize the rest of my face, rubbing it all in all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t decide if this really works or not.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Your skin will be so smooth, soft and clear.</li>
      <li>On some &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; cystic pimples that I get around my jaw during my time of the month, they&#x27;re gone the next day, while others of the same kind linger for days on end until i stop using the nixoderm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Nixoderm is the only product I have found to successfully eradicate these little annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, both versions are very good, it just seems the Thai version works a little better.</li>
      <li>This appears to be an old time remedy, but it really works!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this particular product is appropriate for african american skin.</li>
      <li>They are mainly antifungals and antibacterial.  </li>
      <li>but it makes me a little more oily</li>
      <li>I have very oily, acne prone SENSITIVE skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From what I can tell, Nixoderm is produced by two different manufacturers who license the product from SC Johnson Wax. One manufacturer produces in Thailand and the other in Lagos Nigeria. The ingredients are the same except for Titanium Dioxide which the Lagos version has, the Thai version does not. That being said, the Thai version seems to work better, both for myself, as well as for several people I have handed tins out to. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, both versions are very good, it just seems the Thai version works a little better. I would say 4 stars on the Lagos version and 5 stars on the Thai version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what can it do? Well for one, it is good for mild acne. It is also good to spot treat soon-to-be blemishes that you know are coming but haven&#x27;t turned into a white head yet. It is also great for discolorations when used consistently over time. It has quite a bit of positive effect on acne scars as well, a condition that a good friend had in abundance before utilizing this product (it truly is remarkable, her skin is SO MUCH BETTER!). Lastly, I don&#x27;t know what it is called but every once in a while I get what appears to be a white head but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, won&#x27;t pop and lasts for ages. It looks like a small white bump just under my skin. Nixoderm is the only product I have found to successfully eradicate these little annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a skin condition that seems immune to OTC creams and lotions, Nixoderm may be worth a shot. Use it liberally and leave it on for as long as you can, hours preferably. Also, Nixoderm DOES NOT rub in. It is meant to sit on top of your skin. Consider it a mask type product. Obviously for this reason you will probably not be applying Nixoderm and heading out into public and you should avoid sunlight (bleaching) while wearing the cream ;-)</li>
    <li> This ointment is very effective for the treatment of acne (blackhead, pimples, etc.), athlete&#x27;s foot and ringworm.  I am 26, and I have had terrible acne from since my late teens.  This ointment has worked wonders for me although I only use it in the night before bed.  The ingredients are not commonly known so I researched them.  They are mainly antifungals and antibacterial.  It contains some boric acid, menthol and salicylic acid as well.  Expect some heat and some burning when you use it.  This has not proven to be harmful in any way; I think this is caused by the menthol. When I used it for athlete&#x27;s foot, it provided instant relief.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff I was a kid. Works well on eczema.  Hard to find in the US.</li>
    <li> Stopped using it after I found the bentonite clay. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> This product has been used in my family  for generations.[[ASIN:B0036Z2HMK Nixoderm For Skin Problems 17.7 g.]] It works on pimples, eczema, blackheads, and especially razor bumps! I use it every night and my skin is flawless. However, please note, this product is not for everyone. I gave one to two of my friends and it caused an allergic reactions on both of their faces. I gave one to another friend who had facial eczema and it cured her eczema within one week. Her face looks amazing. So you just have to try it for yourself. The ingredients are: BENZOIC ACID, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, MENTHOL, PRECIPITATED SULPHUR, in a soothing, emollient base. You should dilute with vaseline if it is too strong for you. This product is strong but I don&#x27;t dilute it at all because I use a very, very small amount on my face every night. It doesn&#x27;t effect me negatively at all. I love this product. It will last a long time. There is a lot of it in that tiny green disc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Not too pleasant. Use it at night time and rinse off in the morning. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It is not offensive or anything but it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses either. There is no FRAGRANCE in this product. The ingredients are all for your skin&#x27;s repair period. No added nonsense. Your skin will be so smooth, soft and clear. I get compliments on how clean and beautiful my skin is. People think I am wearing foundation when I have on absolutely no make up on at all.&lt;br /&gt;Use: Every night/bedtime  or until the issue is resolved&lt;br /&gt;Color: The product is white, very, very white. You will look like you are wearing a mask if you put it all over your face. This is not something you can put on and then go outside. (Unless you use a very small amount and rub it in deeply)  I do that on my chin area sometimes and then apply makeup and it is not seen at all) To me, this product works best at night or when you are sleeping. It penetrates the layers of your skin and then next day your pores appear cleaner and smaller after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I use: Apricot scrub once a week along with this product. I also moisturize my skin with Jergens Ultra healing for Extra Dry skin [[ASIN:B0034F9K36 Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion, 32 Ounce]] and once a week I treat my skin to a vaseline (petroleum jelly) massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product works. If you have been struggling with skin problems, try a small amount on the area to see if your skin can handle it. I keep this in stock always. It is my skin remedy for almost everything!  Thanks.smaller after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I use: Apricot scrub once a week along with this product. I also moisturize my skin with Jergens Ultra healing for Extra Dry skin [[ASIN:B0034F9K36 Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion, 32 Ounce]] and once a week I treat my skin to a vaseline (petroleum jelly) massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product works. If you have been struggling with skin problems, try a small amount on the area to see if your skin can handle it. I keep this in stock always. It is my skin remedy for almost everything!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This thing is removing the skin disorder that I had little by little. Little bumps started coming out on my head, neck, and face and this is working so far. I went to a dermatologist and he told me he did not know what I had, so I am now glad that I found something to treat it. I find that using coconut oil, soap, and water removes the creme better than warm water and soap.</li>
    <li> smells funny and wonder where it is made.  It does not do all the stuff listed on container.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item that should be in everyones medicine chest since it&#x27;s a multi purpose ointment, that i think originates in Australia.</li>
    <li> Product started working immediately.  I tried a fucidic acid ointment first with no results.  Upon further research saw that a benzoic acid &amp; salicylic acid may work for my skin rash.  After 2 days, the itch was gone and within 7 days so was the rash.</li>
    <li> Opening this canister is nearly impossible.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS I USED TO BUY IT FROM THE FORIEGN MARKETS BUT THEYRE ALWAYS OUT OF STOCK ARE THEY JUST STOPPED ORDERING ALL TOGETHER IT WORKS VERY WELL ON SKIN RASHES AS WELL AS  EXEMA</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would.  The other reviews made it sound so wonderful.  Not so much.  It worked better on a cold sore than it did a pimple.  Probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item. It&#x27;s a tiny container with a large lid that is impossible to twist off. I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the time or effort. Anyone else have this problem?</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;JUST AS EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Everything met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  My son&#x27;s arm was like leather due to eczema but Nixoderm softened the skin.</li>
    <li> twice a day once in the morning once at night this works amazingly it is by far the best thing i have ever used for acne! it is a magic serum i recomend it to any one who needs a good clear face!</li>
    <li> my child has excema and it doesnt clear it up but it help sweve only used it for a week tho so we&#x27;re going to keep trying and see what happens did clear up my blemished on my face in one week in a half. it burns if applied directly, you have to have vaseline to dilute it, i used vaseline on my child and olive oil on my face for vaseline use i would use three table spoons of vaseline and all of the nixoderm mix it it in bowl/seperate container....for oil use use five shots of oil and the entire nixoderm mix and use...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this particular product is appropriate for african american skin. I gave it a try and it really did nothing but dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> works just like some of the other reviewers said - as soon as I see some spots coming on, I put some on - works way faster than Oxy - note - it will dry your skin, but I usually peel that off, but I would highly recommend !</li>
    <li> THIS product is very famous in Asia, grannies use it since her time. It does hurt and sting, but it works, i leave it on all night, and wash it off in the morning,.. BEWARE it makes your skin dry and flaky.so MOISTURIZER is a must! :)</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite product cap is just too hard to get off</li>
    <li> It works very well on skin problems, I&#x27;ve used this for years and will always continue to buy it .</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has made ANY difference in my perioral dermatitis. It&#x27;s a rash around the mouth and eyes that is incredibly hard to treat and for me it&#x27;s hormonal - comes during my cycle, but first showed up after pregnancy when I was nursing. So not much I could do about it. I have tried antibiotics, diaper rash meds, special creams, violet extract, hundred dollar soaps, etc and in TWO days I saw a huge difference with this cheap miracle in a little green tin. A week later it&#x27;s all almost completely gone. I am forever grateful!!!</li>
    <li> It might burn light a bitch, but it sure as hell works.(For full effect use once daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S it only really works if you can feel it burn</li>
    <li> I think this stuff really works on preventing acne and excema flare-ups.  The only problem is that you can smell a slightly distasteful sulfer smell, because that is one of the effective ingredients.  There is another manufacturer I have bought from in the past that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad - I think it is made in thailand maybe?</li>
    <li> With this product there&#x27;s really no need to purchase tea tree oil (unless you want to quickly clear up a zit), Lamisil or any anti-fungal cream if you are trying to get rid of a ringworm. Nixoderm immediately goes to work on the skin no matter the area on your body. Not that tea tree oil is not a good product, but its not the best use for moist areas on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the cleaning instructions on the Nixoderm container and apply as needed and you should be all cleared up from a ringworm in no time. And one last thing, when you feel the Nixoderm cream burning that means it is doing the job.</li>
    <li> I really like this nixoderm cream.  It makes my skin really clear from bumps and acne.  Its not even rough on your skin.</li>
    <li> Dries out pimples. Warning: If you have one of those deep down pimples that look like it will take a few days to emerge, don&#x27;t use this, that pimple will be staring at you the next morning if you try this. I recommend doing this on a Friday night where you can have time to heal that pimple. This has menthol so if it is close to your eyes or cheek, you will feel that cool feeling which can irritate some. This product is good. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month nightly and have yet to make a dent in it. The product is white and I first rub it in and then apply more on to &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34;.and leave it there. Another thing, the container looks like lip balm one and it TWISTS open. I nearly broke my pluckers trying to open the container, which does open but one day I realized it was a twist open container.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t open the travel tin. if I ever find the right tool to open the blasted thing I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> Pry open the tin, and dilute with organic coconut oil, A &amp; D or even Vaseline if its too strong for you straight out of the tin.  Great anti-fungal--only one I found remotely as effective was Terrasil which is much more pleasant in smell, but cost four-five times more.</li>
    <li> I used this on my son&#x27;s molloscum (with a combination of cvs wart bandaids) I used it every morening and every night. I like that it doesn&#x27;t rub in and it is thick and stays on the skin well. It comes in a very small container but for the price it last a long time. I have also tried terrasil which is twice the price and only last about a week or two. This is definetly a better product and last much longer.</li>
    <li> i didnt work out for my acne, maybe its my skin or maybe the product doesnt work!&lt;br /&gt;am out fishing for new products... TIPS!!!</li>
    <li> There was a tiny amount of product in a small case. It helped with my skin problem, however I certainly expected a larger amount .</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for fungus infections anywhere on the body.  After washing the area with soap...put peroxide on the area and see if it foams.  If it does, put a heavy coating of Nixoderm on at least 2 times a day, or anytime it starts itching.  It is easier to contain if applied at first start of itching.  It will take 2-3 weeks if already broken out.  This appears to be an old time remedy, but it really works!</li>
    <li> purchased it for my acne, but it did absolutely nothing for my skin, it burnt for the first 2 minutes like it was working but it was useless</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me but might for someone else. I used it and saw no visible improvement plus it has menthol in it which my husband is allergic too.</li>
    <li> meh- it&#x27;s ok I guess- has two products in it that were the gold standard for ringworm back when, but there are newer meds that work quite a bit better these days at least for ringworm- can&#x27;t say this is a miracle medicine- but it will help to heal skin problems faster than letting them heal alone</li>
    <li> great, i look for a long time.</li>
    <li> Holy cow! this stuff burns, Its not a bad burn but it definitely is a good. My face feels like Its being worked on with Nixoderm, I cant wait for the result after.</li>
    <li> just put a little on a pimple before going to bed and it&#x27;s gone in the morning.  That&#x27;s amazing and fast acting.</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne prone SENSITIVE skin. The Titanium dioxide is a total waste of a filler in this. After a few hours of wearing this, I break out. It seems to work to fight the pimples as long as the menthol is still pulsating and all, but it seems to clog and irritate my pores so I can&#x27;t wear it all night like the tin suggests. I created my own concoction based on these ingredients, bought everything on Amazon, and now I&#x27;ve got a year of high quality face masks in my pantry...and non-irritating like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they use as their &amp;#34;soothing, emollient base&amp;#34;...but I researched and found that Jojoba Oil is the very best base for this, because it&#x27;s so good for your skin, is not too oily, and fights zits with vitamins--purely healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, ingredients for a BETTER DIY replacement for this stuff: Yields 3 tins worth of Nixoderm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 tbsp Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;4 tsp Zinc Oxide Powder&lt;br /&gt;1 tbsp Benzoic Acid&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp Sulfur Powder&lt;br /&gt;4 drops Salicylic Acid&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Peppermint Oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that it helps some people, but my rash is as bad as when I started using Nixoderm. people also are offended by the smell. the case is extremely hard to open, as well.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! From proactiv to different washes. most things just made my face worse, and I&#x27;m pretty impatient so I stopped using things when I saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nixoderm LESS THAN A WEEK and I see my skin getting sooo clear already! I noticed it in a beauty supply store for like $3! I thought &amp;#34;I have nothing to loose. watch this little no name tin be exactly what I need!&amp;#34; (the Johnson n Johnsons stamp helped my weariness). I was drinking only water with fresh lemon and mint and only fruit juices and thought that it would help my skin clear... that was moving too slowly I only saw slight changes. I&#x27;m on about day 5 and I see the pesky dark marks that I&#x27;ve had for about 6 years finally fading. pores are smaller, skin underneath the surface is just starting to look smoother. I&#x27;m in Awe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nixoderm is pretty pasty and thick not creamy at all. The beauty in that is that you don&#x27;t need much... but its consistency is off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning and Night, After washing my face with Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash and patting dry, I swipe a little Nixoderm on my finger and dilute it with A&amp;D ointment which in itself is also good for the skin and used for scar healing so its perfect! There is a little burn... more like a tingly feeling but not as bad as others have stated (I think the a&amp;d combats for it) so I only focus on my known trouble areas rubbing it into my skin. I don&#x27;t get white blotchy problems because of the ointment so it rubs in quite easily. I don&#x27;t use a lot of ointment, just enough to get the Nixoderm rubbed in. Once I&#x27;ve cover the effected areas, I use Simple hydrating light moisturizer over the concoction to moisturize the rest of my face, rubbing it all in all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin sops up all of the moisture and surprisingly ends up looking very vibrant instead of greasy! Makeup still blends and sits fine on my skin afterwards. I&#x27;ve actually been more proud of myskin going completely bare faced! The smell is not bad, but also not pleasant. I find that it smells more like the A&amp;D. But the smell does fade after a while so some perfume will distract from it if your worried about it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone ! Sure helped me :D</li>
    <li> This is a great product... When you can get the tin open. It took me a screw driver and a lot of prying to get the tin open, but once I did it worked wonderfully. I would definitely recommend it, just be warned that getting it open is very frustrating... EVERY time.</li>
    <li> This product is really great for the skin. Especially when you&#x27;ve been bitten, or burned. Works great for pimples too.</li>
    <li> this I use in the morning and at night so it helps fight me acne skin but it makes me a little more oily then i like</li>
    <li> I have struggled with perioral dermatitis for 3 years and I decided to try this for my face. It is amazing! Cleared my face up in just 4 days. It has a distinct smell and burns a bit but it is worth it. I wash my face with African black soap then apply a thin layer morning and night and I am good to go. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
    <li> Try it and you will be seen the difference in just weeks. Better than Vicks at night time on your face.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I use it with a dab of vitamin c serum and apply all over my face at night.  I&#x27;m happy with results in just one week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: the cap is screw on!  Like so many others, I didn&#x27;t realize that and had a hard time getting it off.</li>
    <li> Not anywhere near what I wanted or needed.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t work for my skin. But it seems like it was still a good product. A friend tried it and it they loved it.</li>
    <li> I knew I had pityrosporum folliculitis -- it&#x27;s when yeast overgrow in hair follicles and cause what looks like acne. But it&#x27;s not acne! My derm kept prescribing me acne mess when I KNEW and told her that wasn&#x27;t the cause. Nothing helped, so I set out to research the problem and it&#x27;s cause. Since it&#x27;s mainly yeast and bacteria (the normal kind we all have on our skin overgrows), salicylic acid and antibacterials help clear things up. Well, this product has an abundance of them! Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell super and leaves a chalky residue, but that&#x27;s better than looking like you have chest acne when you know you don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution? I just apply it at night before bed, and shower it off in the a.m. After about five days, my chest looked drastically better. Now I just use it when I notice a bump or two, and I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: I almost cried trying to open this lil tin... And then I realized it screws off, not pops off. Use your teeth to get a grip on the lid to unscrew, otherwise it&#x27;s really tough to open!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t decide if this really works or not. On some &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; cystic pimples that I get around my jaw during my time of the month, they&#x27;re gone the next day, while others of the same kind linger for days on end until i stop using the nixoderm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use but not entirely sure the buzz about this product is genuine or just hype.</li>
