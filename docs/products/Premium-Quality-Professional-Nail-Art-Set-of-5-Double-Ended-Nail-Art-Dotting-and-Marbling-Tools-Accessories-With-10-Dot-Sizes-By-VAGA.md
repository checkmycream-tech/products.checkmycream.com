    <li> These dotting tools are easy to use and easy to clean. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are just what I needed - very happy with them! Quick delivery and the price was right.  Now I can teach myself more nail art skills!</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend who loved doing nail art and I saw that she was always using pencil leads to do her art and I thought this tool kit was cool. She loved it and even though it took some time to get here, but she didn&#x27;t mind. Overall, great tool kit with different size tips and great price as well</li>
    <li> I loved these... UNTIL about a week later when they all started to break. I think only 2 of the 5 have not had a tip break off.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fun colors, Easy to use. I use them for other crafting projects as well. It did take a while for them to ship</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these, says they work very well!  They are fun and easy to use, she has painted many designs on her nails with these.</li>
    <li> They are a perfect weight for a beginner with nail designs, not too light and not too heavy or imbalanced.  A great start.</li>
    <li> I was worried they might all look the same or close to the same size but there are definitely 10 different sized dotting ends. I&#x27;ve already used them once and can&#x27;t wait to create more designs! I thought they came in a case, which was disappointing (just in a clear plastic sleeve) but still a great buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool for detailing your nails.</li>
    <li> I paid 2.99 I had mine since 2013 and it still looks good. If you starting to get into nais I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it got here in great condition although they were smaller then I expected</li>
    <li> Good quality but I won&#x27;t give 5 stars because of the awful customer service.</li>
    <li> Works great. One of the metal end fell off, which was a bummer.</li>
    <li> Great kit to have. My 12-year old daughter loves using them to put dots on her nails. The size choices are great. Very versatile set. Took awhile to deliver as it comes from China, but it said that when I ordered it so I was ok with that.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my set of nail art dotting they work just fine. Also, they were very affordable.</li>
    <li> now I can do any design I want that I have the correct tools.  no more paying for designs on nails.</li>
    <li> Try to clean it on cotton after used but its end broken with one press. Have to tape around the ends</li>
    <li> Cute tools to use for simple dotting process on your nails. Colorful and sturdy. Although a couple duplicates it helped my grand daughters work together at the same time.</li>
    <li> After a couple of use one broke</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these. They arrived through the mail a whole week before i expected them to arrive. Of course i wanted to try them out and they work wonderfully! I plan to use them to decorate my nails in the future for a long time. I have yet to run into any problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do order these though, make sure you have something to store them in. Because they don&#x27;t come with a little storage bag or anything.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, looks great Thank you!</li>
