      <li>I was very happy because my order arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>Amazing cologne, lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>This aroma is amazing.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it more then the others I own.  </li>
      <li>Is very light</li>
      <li>It may be the most seductive cologne you can wear as a man.</li>
      <li>I find myself using it when I get a bit more dressed up as it feels like a sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle style is cute too.</li>
      <li>I love Amazon, but c&#x27;mon.</li>
      <li>For your information, I would not be able to return it if I wanted to because it is &amp;</li>
      <li>So do most of the women I interact with.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I decided to give it one more chance and smell it.</li>
      <li>It has very strong cheap sent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spicebomb is an exotic extrovert, oriental spicy, sweet, and aromatic fragrance for men that is most suitable for individuals over the age of maturity.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not too strong and a great spicy smell, definitely can be considered unisex.</li>
      <li>Huge fan of this fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The fragrance is available as 50 and 90 ml Eau de Toilette with 200 ml shower gel and 100 ml after shave balm.</li>
      <li>His comment was positive in the odor and resiliency of the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are considering one for me! :)</li>
      <li>A full selection of sizes and choices made it easy to order.  </li>
      <li>It makes me wonder if it is the original.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and easy!</li>
      <li>It is a woodsy, sweet and spicy explosion of scents; a mixture of fire and ice.</li>
      <li>After receiving a sample, we went right to Amazon to consider the full size options.  </li>
      <li>bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite unique and every woman that has had the opportunity to smell it up close has commented positively on it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re willing to pay full retail, it is so worth it.</li>
      <li>reviewers liken SB to Paco Rabanne’s “One Million”, Thierry Mugler’s “Pure Havane” or “London Burberry”; it maybe be so</li>
      <li>Very suspect.</li>
      <li>top notes are bergamot, grapefruit, pink pepper and elemi.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this cologne before and it did not smell anything like the real Spicebomb.</li>
      <li>At first the spice and citrus manifest vibrantly with a touch of sweetness from cinnamon and elemi; after a few minutes it dissipates and a spicy aroma with fresh sweet tobacco envelops your nose.</li>
      <li>This blend gives it substantial longevity and a robust sillage, therefore minimal application is advised and it is best used in cool to cold weather, it is a winter</li>
      <li>It still smells pretty close, but it&#x27;s not NEARLY as strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat this price as far as I know</li>
      <li>I got a sample of it at a department store and regret holding off so long on finally buying the full</li>
      <li>It may be similar in composition to some other fragrances but the proportions of its blend makes it unique.</li>
      <li>As it settles on the skin within the first four hours, cinnamon diluted with tobacco and pink pepper dominate.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>This item had obviously been opened before, tampered with, and then sold to me as new.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t going to go down in history as a classic, but it&#x27;s a very laid back scent that I can see myself using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I&#x27;m very serious about that statement.</li>
<li> /&gt;Only real complaint I have is that the fake &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; you pull out to prevent accidental sprays feels like it will probably break.</li>

<li> Fake?</li>
<li> I am beyond angry.</li>
<li> My girlfriend goes crazy when she smells it.</li>

    <li> We bought this cologne as a gift. The recipient loves it and he uses it. His comment was positive in the odor and resiliency of the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are considering one for me! :)</li>
    <li> After reading good reviews for this product, I took a chance, ordered cologne online. I was very happy because my order arrived very fast. Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I noticed the cologne box wrapped in plastic looked like it was opened and repackaged. How can I give it to my sweetheart for his birthday? I couldn&#x27;t. I decided to give it one more chance and smell it. It has very strong cheap sent. It makes me wonder if it is the original. For your information, I would not be able to return it if I wanted to because it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; according to return site.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing on my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> We bought this cologne because we had a sample from a magazine. My husband loves it and so do I!</li>
    <li> Love this for myself!!  I smelled this in a magazine and bought it for myself and I&#x27;m a woman!  Not too strong and a great spicy smell, definitely can be considered unisex.</li>

    <li> Great price on a great cologne for men. I&#x27;ve bought this in stores numerous times and the smell is intoxicating. My wife loves it more then the others I own.  Can&#x27;t beat this price as far as I know and this is not a knock of product. Came in legit packaging sealed and all.</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample, we went right to Amazon to consider the full size options.  A full selection of sizes and choices made it easy to order.  The aroma is heavenly on my husband.  The bottle style is cute too.</li>
    <li> Spicebomb came out in January 2012 from the perfume lab of Olivier Polge, working in the division of Viktor &amp; Rolf of l’Oreal.  It is a woodsy, sweet and spicy explosion of scents; a mixture of fire and ice. The heat is provided by pepper, tobacco, white leather, saffron and cinnamon. The chill includes a fragrant burst of bergamot, elemi, grapefruit and pink pepper.  This blend gives it substantial longevity and a robust sillage, therefore minimal application is advised and it is best used in cool to cold weather, it is a winter fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The top notes are bergamot, grapefruit, pink pepper and elemi. Mid notes are cinnamon, saffron and paprika. Base are tobacco, vetiver and white leather. It may be similar in composition to some other fragrances but the proportions of its blend makes it unique. At first the spice and citrus manifest vibrantly with a touch of sweetness from cinnamon and elemi; after a few minutes it dissipates and a spicy aroma with fresh sweet tobacco envelops your nose. As it settles on the skin within the first four hours, cinnamon diluted with tobacco and pink pepper dominate.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers liken SB to Paco Rabanne’s “One Million”, Thierry Mugler’s “Pure Havane” or “London Burberry”; it maybe be so but I disagree, it reminds me somewhat of “Hermessence”.&lt;br /&gt;Fabien Baron designed the grenade-shaped bottle to emphasis the explosive motif.  Olivier Polge (Dior Homme!, Kenzo Power, Midnight in Paris) has since been hired by Chanel, in July 2013, to work in the perfume lab with his father Jacques and Christopher Sheldrake.&lt;br /&gt;Spicebomb won 2 FiFi awards (the Oscars of the fragrance industry) for 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Spicebomb is an exotic extrovert, oriental spicy, sweet, and aromatic fragrance for men that is most suitable for individuals over the age of maturity.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is available as 50 and 90 ml Eau de Toilette with 200 ml shower gel and 100 ml after shave balm.</li>
    <li> Love this on my man, even he loves the smell, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Every year I get my dad a different cologne for Christmas. I had a sample in my purse of this and every time I got a whiff it again I loved it all over again. My dad loved it as did my mom.</li>
    <li> I am beyond angry. This item had obviously been opened before, tampered with, and then sold to me as new. There were product codes on the inside of the cologne box that had been carefully removed with a razor blade which seemed very odd. And when I sprayed the cologne I immediately knew it was not Spicebomb. I have purchased this cologne before and it did not smell anything like the real Spicebomb. I&#x27;m hoping I can get some assistance and satisfaction through customer service but I&#x27;m guessing I just wasted almost $60 on this fake cologne because I&#x27;m not allowed to ship it back since it is flammable.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Valentine&#x27;s gift for my boyfriend. He loves deep earthy scents. Shipping was fast and easy!</li>
    <li> Amazing cologne, lots of compliments. Really great gift.</li>
    <li> This aroma is amazing. It may be the most seductive cologne you can wear as a man. I&#x27;m very serious about that statement. I love it. My girlfriend goes crazy when she smells it. So do most of the women I interact with. Unfortunately, this seller is selling a knockoff and Amazon is not a licensed seller so it&#x27;s not possible to get this scent on this site. It still smells pretty close, but it&#x27;s not NEARLY as strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  Just go to the store and get it. If you&#x27;re willing to pay full retail, it is so worth it. I love Amazon, but c&#x27;mon.</li>
    <li> Fake? The secret code was cut out on the box. Very suspect.</li>
    <li> Is very light but it last all day</li>
