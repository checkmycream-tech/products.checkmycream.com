### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Good item.</li>
      <li>I love Eucalyptus oil!  </li>
      <li>just what i asked for, great product and extremely cheap.</li>
      <li>Very clean aroma!</li>
      <li>But it is okay.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell safe.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this</li>
      <li>This definitely should be diluted for use because its very potent but it works wonderfully well to disguise other smells that aren&#x27;t as pleasant.</li>
      <li>and it seemed perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I received the product in a timely manner and we enjoy using it at home.</li>
      <li>Used as a Natural way to repel spiders in the house and it smells good.</li>
      <li>I was pleased at the seemingly good quality as I use it to clean delicate surfaces and freshen my laundry in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Came right on time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This is an absolute scam!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product the first time in the 8oz</li>
      <li>and I noticed it did not leave the same shiny clean with menthol-y fresh scent.</li>
      <li>smells different than the original eucalyptus</li>
      <li>I too decided to go back to my former, more consistent and trustable brand.</li>
      <li>for sure i will buy the same products in the future</li>
      <li>As other reviewers mentioned, there was a strong chemically smell to the container</li>
      <li>this product did not meet my expectation , not smell right, will not order again, a friend had the same thing, but his smell different</li>
      <li>Not what I expected, more diluted and cheaper than my other choice.</li>
      <li>My laundry also suffered, the clothes were super dry and had a rough feeling.</li>
      <li>I used it to disguise the smell of neem oil and it worked really well, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used around small pets as it can really hurt their noses.</li>
      <li>Compared to the other brands I use that come in glass bottles, this one has a very chemical solvent smell in the steam shower.  </li>
      <li>I could not fathom what was going on until I went back on Amazon to check out a few more reviews and realized there were other customers who faced the same problem.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It is the worst scam ever! It is not eucalyptus oil-it is floor cleaner. Very obvious. Read all the reviews before you buy it. I wish I would have!</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus does not smell like eucalyptus but like Pine Sol.</li>
    <li> I love Eucalyptus oil!  I use it in cleaning water as well as put some on a cotton ball and put it in my vacuum!  Very clean aroma!</li>
    <li> smells different than the original eucalyptus</li>
    <li> This is an absolute scam! Our Eucalyptus oil arrived and smelled like a mix between pine sol and water. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> This definitely should be diluted for use because its very potent but it works wonderfully well to disguise other smells that aren&#x27;t as pleasant. I used it to disguise the smell of neem oil and it worked really well, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used around small pets as it can really hurt their noses.</li>
    <li> just what i asked for, great product and extremely cheap. for sure i will buy the same products in the future</li>
    <li> Used as a Natural way to repel spiders in the house and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This oil is bad smelling and had there was foreign particles in it.  They DID refund my payment though.  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it as well as another brand I have used.  But it is okay.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised. Good item.</li>
    <li> this product did not meet my expectation , not smell right, will not order again, a friend had the same thing, but his smell different</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this</li>
    <li> I ordered this product the first time in the 8oz and it seemed perfectly fine. It smelled and functioned like Eucalyptus should. I was pleased at the seemingly good quality as I use it to clean delicate surfaces and freshen my laundry in the winter months. So after my second purchase of the 8oz, I decided to get the 16oz.  Shockingly, it was all downhill from there. As other reviewers mentioned, there was a strong chemically smell to the container and I noticed it did not leave the same shiny clean with menthol-y fresh scent. My laundry also suffered, the clothes were super dry and had a rough feeling. I could not fathom what was going on until I went back on Amazon to check out a few more reviews and realized there were other customers who faced the same problem. I too decided to go back to my former, more consistent and trustable brand. When my NOW brand 16oz Eucalyptus came and I opened the bottle I knew immediately that this brand had deceived me with their \\&quot;eucalyptus\\&quot; substitute. I will be purchasing NOW brand going forward. It is a pity this brand was so disingenuous, they could have had a faithful customer. I purchase Eucalyptus at least twice a month.</li>
    <li> this appears to have something other than the oil in the mix.  It sweats through the plastic bottle somewhat dissolving the plastic.  Compared to the other brands I use that come in glass bottles, this one has a very chemical solvent smell in the steam shower.  It doesn&#x27;t smell safe.  It is almost a gasoline smell mixed with the Eucalyptus.  I fear using it in my steam.</li>
    <li> Came right on time and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Delivery was also prompt.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner and we enjoy using it at home.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like eucalytus, doesn&#x27;t feel like oil. foams up when shaken, if I were to guest what this liquid is I would say its Lysol.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy this ever again.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, more diluted and cheaper than my other choice.</li>
