      <li>Add to that the inconvenience and damage from having to wash and blow-dry every day or so, and the value decreases even more.</li>
      <li>Maybe it belongs in the bamboo category of scents, but more feminine....</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff makes my hair smell.</li>
      <li>Depending on length on hair you made need more product and to leave it on longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This has menthol or some other irritating substance that made my scalp quiver!  It was a very unpleasant sensation and I immediately rinsed it out.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it left my hair in good shape or not because I could not get over the terrible feeling I got when I applied this stuff to my hair.  I have used Wen (and loved it) and only stopped because it was really expensive.  Now I use VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner as my CO washing mainstay.  It leaves my hair in beautiful condition and because it&#x27;s a clarifying formula, it completely got rid of styling product buildup and hairspray.  It also smells really nice.  It&#x27;s very cheap (I bought three bottles at the Dollar Store recently) but works great. I don&#x27;t CO wash as much as I used to because I&#x27;ve found a great shampoo and conditioner that I really like and I have come to realize that I miss the soapy suds of shampoo.  My main reason for using Wen was to keep my precious hair color (then red) from washing down the drain. Right now, I&#x27;m loving  Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner (sulfate free) and I great results from them.  I&#x27;ve had good hair days nearly every day now so I&#x27;m not changing a thing.  This Pantene product is the worst thing I&#x27;ve used for a long, long time.  I have a considerable amount left and I&#x27;m just aching to throw it out.  I wouldn&#x27;t even dare to use this on my dogs!  The company should do a recall and get every single bottle off the shelf.  Pantene products have never worked for me so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that this didn&#x27;t suit the purpose.  But whatever skanky ingredient is in this stuff should be taken out and then it should be totally reformulated. If you have a sensitive scalp or are bothered by strong chemical fragrances, then this is not for you.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product!</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves my hear smooth and clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months now.  After applying this product, my scalp has a tingling sensation after about 30 seconds and I rinse after 1 minute. You must take the time and do a good job of rinsing your hair.  Then I style as normal with a styling product and blow dryer.  I have a lot of hair but it is fine and wavy. It is medium length and I color it every 6 weeks to cover the grey. My scalp is very oily so I shampoo every day which makes my ends dry. This cleansing conditioner really helps. I use it everyday. Now by the end of the day my hair is still full of body and no greasy scalp. The ends of my hair are less dryer now too. I still need to color every 6 weeks but that is just because of grow out, not from fading. My hair dresser noticed that my hair was in much better condition too.</li>
    <li> The fumes from this product burned my eyes. It left my hair dry and tangled. I have mild frizzy wavy hair. My daughter who has very thick curly hair was left with a zillion knots and brittle feel. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> After first use I must write a review. This is he best hair product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve purchased a cleanser dor sixty dollars and this pantene pro v product blows it out of the water. I have course hair, 4b - c, and this product not only makes my hair soft it defined my curls! I usually have to use deep conditioners, leave in conditioners and oils after I&#x27;m done washing my hair and I avoid washing my too often for this reason but now I can wash without fear as this is the only product I need and it has dandruff control. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this one.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I prefer the Loreal non sulfates....I use this one in between to break it up.  I love the price and you only need one product.  Those are both good selling features.  Worth a try.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way compared to Wen.  Good alternative product.&lt;br /&gt;No 5 stars because hair is more silky with Wen.</li>
    <li> great conditioner  shampoo combo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used shampoo in over 2 years, and I will never use shampoo again.  However, I could not see paying $40 for 16 ounces of &amp;#34;Cleansing Conditioner&amp;#34;, as seen on TV.  As a biochemist, I checked the list of ingredients in the average conditioner and found that there were enough surfactants to clean, so I started on my journey of cowashing.  I&#x27;ve tried many different conditioners.  Some work and some don&#x27;t on my ultra fine, straight, blond hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.  Interestingly, my favorite so far, is Pantene Pro-V, Volume conditioner for Fine Hair (purple label).  I was thrilled when I saw Pantene enter the Cleansing Conditioning arena.  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make one aimed at my fine, limp hair.  I&#x27;ve found that &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; conditioners work best for my hair, since they are light weight.  I tried this particular cleaning conditioner with high hopes.  The Pantene Cleansing Conditioner started building up after a couple of weeks.  It works better for my hair type, than the Pantene Pro-V Cowash (in the gold container), which made my hair oily.  I will stick to the older Pantene Volume conditioner, until I find a better alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of cleansing conditioner on the market, including the most expensive. While this doesn&#x27;t perform as well as Wen, it is the closest I&#x27;ve come across. I have baby fine hair that&#x27;s naturally wavy/curly. This does a great job of cleansing and moisturizing without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for a long time but after a while having to order it online and paying top dollar I decided it was just not worth it. I&#x27;ve used bed head, sexy hair, and a bunch of other salon quality hair stuff that I liked but wasn&#x27;t great.  At Walmart I saw this and decided to try it, it was so cheap I didn&#x27;t see any risk if I hated it.  Bottom line I like it just as much as I liked Wen, it&#x27;s super cheap and if I forget to order it I can run to Walmart.  Note: if you have healthy hair, or hair that borders on oily I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great on super thin or short hair either but I can&#x27;t attest to that.  I have very thick shoulder length dry/damaged hair that is colored and highlighted (and layered if that matters), my younger sister with long healthy thick virgin hair heard me raving about Wen and tried some of mine, her hair was an unruly oil slick within an hour.</li>
    <li> Ok but not as good as others</li>
    <li> This is just as good as the $30 equivalent.  It smells great, gently tingles my scalp as it is cleaning, and leaves my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing shampoo for a while now. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. At first I was concerned that my hair and scalp weren&#x27;t getting cleaned enough, so I would use regular shampoo and conditioner once or twice a week. But I noticed every time I used regular stuff my scalp would be itchy after showering. So I decided to use only Pantene Color Preserve Cleansing Conditioner and I&#x27;m loving it!  I have NEVER liked a hair product as much as this. My thick, medium-textured hair now has great, manageable body. No more puffy hair. No more itchy scalp. No more dandruff. Just nice, smooth, soft and naturally shiny hair.  I think the scent is fine. A fairly mild mint and citrus scent. I haven&#x27;t experienced any tingling or scalp irritation. In fact, my scalp feels better than ever.   Procter and Gamble: If you&#x27;re reading this, please don&#x27;t change a thing and keep making this product forever!  01/20/17 Update Best product EVER for my hair!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling dirty</li>
    <li> I Love this product. My hair feels soft and more manageable since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> This was a great find. I have fine hair and have found that you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Just follow the directions, it can be too easy to fall into wanting to use more than you need.  Get to your roots, massage it in, let it sit, add a little water, massage some more and rinse. My color doesn&#x27;t fade and my hair doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy and frayed on the ends anymore like it did with regular shampoo&#x27;s, because there are no sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;Be glad that you can try this for such a good price.  My trial and error was with Wen and that was $$$$.</li>
    <li> It’s amazing! The product arrived well packaged and the item’s labeling presentation itself is pretty mesmerizing to look at as it’s unlike anything Pantene’s done before with any of their other products. I use this every other two days but my hair can go up to 4 days max without looking greasy (however, I do use a clarifying shampoo every two weeks or so just to make sure the hair has a fresh start and use some homemade dry shampoo if any physical activities make my hair roots appear a bit greasy throughout the 4-day period). My hair’s color-treated strands are still in great condition and overall, my hair is strong and super shiny. Since I have thick hair - and a lot of it - I make sure to dab some real conditioner throughout the midshaft of my hair to the ends even after rinsing off the cleansing conditioner just to make sure my waves are extra pronounced. My hair reaches my hips so I use about 8 pumps (this totally depends on your hair length so you may not even have to surpass a total of 3-4 pumps) and leave it on for 5 minutes. I mainly apply it to the scalp but also like to spread the product remains throughout. If you’re in a hurry then don’t worry; the cleansing conditioner by itself is enough to keep the mane moisturized. It even comes in handy after I’m done surfing as it softens the stiffness of my hair due to the saltwater. This cleanser is a keeper, honestly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s similar to the expensive &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; products out there.  I use Diva No-Poo and my hair feels almost the same after I wash it.  It&#x27;s smooth and can be brushed easily without using conditioner.  It&#x27;s a little thicker and you have to use a little more to get the job done, but overall I like it and it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to the expensive stuff.  I still use my Diva every 3 washes or so though.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 different co-washes this one, macadamia flawless cleansing conditioner and as I am coconut co-wash and this pantene product was my least favorite.  it works fine and for the price is a really good deal.  It has a minty scent and sensation on the scalp that I could do without. The very first time I used it I didn&#x27;t like it at all, the second and third time I liked it more and more.  Makes my long, thick, double processed blonde hair soft, extremely shiny, and manageable.</li>
    <li> I like the pump action. Wish it was bigger.</li>
    <li> Its lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Leaves it clean soft and manageable. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> lots of product for the price. it replaces my usual, l&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner. i swim in a chlorinated pool every day, and when i get out, i apply about 5 squirts of this to my long, color treated hair, leave in for a minute or two and rinse out with the hose. seems to be protecting my hair from the usual sun/chemical damage. only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. smells medicinal to me.</li>
    <li> I was a dedicated wen girl for the longest time- I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine and pretty long. This product is just as good as Wen- and living in the desert, that little mint tingle is pretty nice. NOTE TO THOSE OF YOU GIVING THE BAD REVIEWS FOR THIS PRODUCT:: do NOT follow the instructions on the bottle- remember your WEN instructions!! Clean the roots on the crown and the back underneath and the sides of your head- rub it in there- then add some more water and rub in more- the product feels like it &#x27;doubles&#x27; in volume!! Then rinse some of that though the rest of your hair- add just a pump more for the length- comb it through - leave it in while you shower- rinse it out &amp; put a little bit on your ends &amp; don&#x27;t wash out. - hopefully you&#x27;ll change your mind- as for that 6-8 pump thing- use your judgement. I never have used that much and my hair stays clean for 3-4 days.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product - I&#x27;m so happy to have stumbled across it here for THAT price!!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous at first to try co-washing. I was doing some research on my colored thick naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s dry and frizzy. I needed something new and then I discovered this!!!! I read that co washing is the best thing for your hair. The first time I tried this product I was hooked!!! I love the smell and he way my hair looks now. I have been using this since June and the difference is huge!!! Not frizzy anymore even on the really hot days!! I go about 1- 1 1/2 weeks and I shampoo. This time I went almost three weeks and I couldn&#x27;t even tell. Amazing!!!!! Love this product!! Never tried Wen or any other co washing so I have nothing to compare it too. I would definitely recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> As a natural curly girl who regularly colors her hair I must say I really like this! It smells great and it leaves my hair feeling moisturized. I have also noticed less color fade from the old cleanser I used to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for around 2 years now and love how my hair and color are doing since I stopped shampooing.  But lets face it WEN is expensive especially the way it&#x27;s meant to be used and the amount.  The one complaint I&#x27;ve had is no matter how I use it (and I&#x27;m a perfectionist with instructions) my hair is flat.  So I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing conditioners and this Pantene is the holy grail! Love it, love it!!  Makes my hair softer and way more full than WEN.  Not knocking WEN still use it because I have a supply of it but this Pantene is the first step then WEN is more of the conditioning step (BTW you do need to do two steps with a cleansing conditioner just like your shampoo and conditioner).  Also with a cleansing conditioner you need to really massage it into the hair and scalp.  I do about 5 - 7 pumps and massage in 3 minutes for first cleansing, rinse then another 5-7 pumps and massage in, let it stay as I take my shower then rinse.)</li>
    <li> As a guy, I shampooed my hair almost daily growing up. On the days I wasn&#x27;t able to, my hair would gets very oily. If I went longer than a day without shampooing, I would look disgusting. Saw a couple articles on cleansing conditioners and figured &amp;#34;what the hell&amp;#34;. I picked up a bottle of Pantene and almost immediately after my first use, I saw a lot of changes. My hair no longer felt super greasy if I missed a day (and have now regularly gone a couple days without needing to use the product), my hair feels cleaner overall, and it never feels &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34; like it would if I were to use a regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> After only one use i would say I&#x27;m sold. It&#x27;s fully conditioned not flyaway. I put on argan oil too but I always do that. It feels thick! A little color came out though.</li>
    <li> Works ok. The smell is rather strong but not unbearable.</li>
    <li> I reviewed herbal essences (HE) cleansing condish, so I want to mention this too. Everything I said about HE holds true here: heavenly fragrance, buttery consistency, takes getting used to since we&#x27;re so used to our sudsy shampoo. I won&#x27;t toss my shampoo but I have wavy hair prone to tangles so this makes brushing out after washing much easier.</li>
    <li> Works as well, if not better, than WEN for a fraction of the price! I have very long hair and this worked great at conditioning and detangling...hair is left feeling soft and no frizz!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been shampoo free for 18 months (baking soda, apple cider vinegar), but last night I fell off the wagon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have fine straight hair nearly down to my elbows, and the reason I went off shampoo was that shampoo made my hair disgusting.  Thinning, dandruffy, greasy, frizzy, etc, etc.  I converted to the no poo religion and swiftly became a zealot.  All of the aforementioned problems went away.  I tried to get everyone I know to go no poo with me.  I removed the shampoo bottles from the guest bathrooms, even, so I could lecture people about how awesome my new cleansing method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had 2 other problems with baking soda/acv.  One was:  My hair got so dry I was afraid to wash it more than every 10 days or so.  Not so good for someone who aspires to sweat every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other was:  I couldn&#x27;t keep dye in my hair for more than a day or two.  My cleansing methodology was so extremely effective, the dye would just run away in terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night in the store, I thought--what the hell--I&#x27;ll just try this Pantene stuff once and see what happens.  Now mind you, years before this I&#x27;d tried some lovely smelling L&#x27;oreal cleansing creme that left my hair so indescribably limp and ugly I decided just to stay home and smell my gorgeous smelling hair, because I was worried if anyone *saw* my hair, they&#x27;d presume I was dying or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as the L&#x27;oreal stuff did, but aside from that this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that left my hair looking, dare I say it, perfect.  Neither dry nor greasy.  No tangles.  No frizz.  Just looks healthy.  I&#x27;m so impressed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleansing conditioner to use after workouts.  I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair frequently to prevent color treatment from fading.  This is a great compromise between using only shampoo or conditioner.  It works better than the L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner and is cheaper too.</li>
    <li> The Pantene Cleansing Conditioner line is wonderful.  I use this one and the repair cleanser.  Both products leave my oily hair clean, soft, and shiny.  I recommend both!</li>
    <li> Compared to Wen this product needs extra conditioner...too drying</li>
    <li> This has completely replaced shampoo for me. I originally bought it because when I&#x27;d go for a run, I took a shower but didn&#x27;t want to shampoo my hair twice a day. After I while, I started using it every morning, and it makes my hair look great. Shiny, easy to style, and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to leave it in for a full two minutes and work it in at the roots to avoid oily hair. If I get lazy washing with it, my hair winds up looking a little greasy about 12 hours after washing. If I do it right, my hair looks clean all day.</li>
    <li> It is a great product but does not work as well as Wen.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  It&#x27;s like Wen, but better and amazingly cheap.  Highly recommend.  My hair gets clean but doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  And I had my hair colored and usually when I do my first wash, I see some color go down the drain.  No color washed away when I used this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using nothing but Wen Cleansing Conditioner for years, and the price has become a real challenge. So I decided to give this a try. The only great thing is the scent. It&#x27;s wondrous. But my hair seems drier and it starts feeling dirty and my scalp starts feeling itchy after just a day or so. With the Wen, I&#x27;m used to only washing my hair twice a week. That&#x27;s not an option here. So since I would have to use three times as much, the cost isn&#x27;t that much less than Wen. Add to that the inconvenience and damage from having to wash and blow-dry every day or so, and the value decreases even more. I&#x27;m back to Wen.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this product, and have all my friends using it. Its the best beauty product Ive found in 20 years! It leaves your hair soft and with tons of body, even the next day. It improved the condition of my hair dramatically, and it does not weigh down a style...its amazing. If they ever stop making it, I&#x27;ll buy a lifetime supply! Even my husband noticed.&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried WEN, and didn&#x27;t like it...try this one. I threw away the bottle of WEN I had, after trying this. ;-))</li>
    <li> I first was using WEN and loved it but the price tag, not so much.  I&#x27;ve bought at least 8 bottles of the Pantene Cleansing Conditioner and although not a perfect match to WEN I like it a lot.  The price makes it a no-brainer.  My hair response just as well as it did with the WEN and my color last indefinitely.  The only reason I have to recolor is root growth never the rest of the length.  That&#x27;s the beauty of this type of non-shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more bottles because I&#x27;m so afraid they&#x27;ll stop making this stuff.  I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores, but I saw it talked about on the Today Show and had to try it.  I have extremely fine, curly &amp; wavy hair.  I can&#x27;t explain the magic that happens using this, but it gives me more control, I use less hairspray and  my hair feels wonderful.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, but can recommend you give it a try.  The price is right so why not try something different and see if if it works for you.  The only caveat is you have to be willing to give up the suds, but it leaves my scalp with a wonderful tingly feeling.  Just LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is even better than the very expensive competitor.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo (cleansing conditioner).  It’s great for thick hair and getting the tangles out.  Tomorrow it’s time to decided whether to get it cut or not.  I’m tired of the long hair.</li>
    <li> Hair feels amazing, back to life. Felt dry at first, took about two weeks to get my hair used to it, now it feels good. I alternate with the Wen cleansing conditioner, this saves me money.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try the similar Wen product but would not pay the price . .a friend recommended this product and I love that my hair is easy to style and color  is protected.</li>
    <li> Just has good as a famous brand.  At a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as good as Wen and a fraction of the cost. I have super long hair and it just wasn&#x27;t financially feasible to keep spending $90 every three weeks. One bottle of this Pantene lasts me about two weeks (washing every other day) $10 every 3 weeks makes my wallet much happier. And it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I absolutely love this stuff. I only wash my hair once a week and this stuff helps my hair last until the next wash. The bottle is perfect. I love how the pump is able to dispense the right amount each time. When I used this product I used about 6 pumps to make sure my shoulder length hair was completely saturated. I left it in for about 5 mins and washed it out and my hair was so soft and moisturized. I was pleased. I then let my hair air dry and the next morning my hair was still soft and silky. I have used Wen before which I honestly think works better than this if you can afford it but this is definitely second best. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry, curly, color treated, frizzy hair like mine. Depending on length on hair you made need more product and to leave it on longer.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair smell. It&#x27;s so hard to describe the scent. Not floral or fruity, or citrusy... Maybe it belongs in the bamboo category of scents, but more feminine.... I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;What I do know is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Wen, but for a fraction of the price it&#x27;s not a bad alternative. The herbal essence brand makes my hair look less oily, but wow... The smell is just superior by far. My hair is a little heavy the first day, you just have to make sure to rinse super carefully to get out any access oil. But after day one, I need the dry shampoo to go out into public. The reason I gave 4 stars is because for a healthier shampoo that smells this amazing, I can put up with the overhydration because I work from home.</li>
    <li> I did not like it so much, I feel that it dries up my hair more than regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It is winter and the air is dry so my hair is also dry. I bought this to help and it does. I will say that it does leave residue on the hair that makes it flat. Not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is ok if you want to wash your hair every day.  If you have a lot of hair and don&#x27;t wash everyday it isn&#x27;t that great. Probably nice for pool swimmers and such.</li>
    <li> The Wen products are much better</li>
    <li> great stuff, but i use shampoo sometimes too</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair and have been on biotin for over a year (btw it&#x27;s working).  Needed a shampoo that would be gentle &amp; save my hair color too.  Pro&#x3D;V is working great.  A side benefit is that it is great as a body wash too.  Leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> After reading some other reviews, I decided to give this a try.  I have waist-long hair &amp; was hoping that this product would be fantastic in keeping my hair in condition.  Boy was I disappointed!! I absolutely LOVE Pantene products but this one gets a big &amp;#34;thumbs down&amp;#34;.  When washing my hair, I used a very generous portion with the understanding that it does not &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; like regular shampoo.  That was fine but after leaving the product on my hair for the suggested time, my hair did not  feel like I had used ANY conditioner.  It felt very coarse &amp; not soft at all.  I continued to try it several times to give it a fair chance but to no avail.  I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I do really like this product, however it&#x27;s only sort of like Wen, I like the fact that my hair always felt really soft and moisturized with Wen, but never heavy, this product is great for a deep conditioning feeling, however I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily, I use this every other time I shampoo, I use regular shampoo &amp; conditioner in between so that my hair never feels too weighed down.  I have naturally very, VERY thick hair that is semi wavy so when it gets weighed down it looks just terrible.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
    <li> Great product. Same quality as Wen at much, much lower price.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well..smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a month now.  Ive used wen. And of course its way over priced.&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful it works well.  I have long thick j lo type hair.  It is restoring the natural bounce and smoothness to my hair. No build up and making my hair look and feel healthier the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> healthier for your hair than regular shampoo and conditioner, but it also works like a two-in-one. Plus the bottle was bigger than I expected. I thought it was going to be like a travel size or something, but It&#x27;s like your regular size Pantene shampoo bottle.</li>
    <li> Oh how this smells SO NICE!!! I love how you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product, and that you don&#x27;t need two different products to clean your hair now! I have very thin hair, and this does not weigh it down, nor over clean for fly away hair either. Seems like a perfect exchange of products to me!</li>
    <li> Hair type: colored, thin, flat-ironed, shoulder length&lt;br /&gt;This stuff ROCKS&lt;br /&gt;For the first time ever, my hair color truly has a brilliant shiny depth after I clean it. It is soooo much cheaper than other cleansing conditioners-- but I would pay far far more for it. I&#x27;ve used 3 cleansing conditioner products: Wen, Loreal, and Pantene. Wen worked well, but left my hair a bit greasy at times, requiring frequent cleansing. Wen is quite expensive-- more than 2.5x the cost of the other 2 products. Loreal was fairly comparable to Wen, and cheaper. This Pantene product is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve used 3/4 of the container and it is hands down the best performer on my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> It seems to work well enough.  I can easily comb through my hair and it feels clean.  I was just a little disappointed because it contains silicone and I was actually wanting to stop using all of that stuff that just builds up on my hair.  All in all it seems to be a good cleansing conditioner as long as you don&#x27;t mind the silicone.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!! I went from WEN to this and it works just as good!!!  It is a quarter of the price too!!!  Plus I can get it at my local Walmart, or have Amazon deliver it with Prime for no charge.</li>
    <li> Was surprised by the minty tingle, but pleasantly. Leaves my color vibrant and my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I have used Wen and it got too expensive. I didn&#x27;t quite love that either. I did like the Loreal Evercreme, which is the same idea. The Pantene smelled really good but it made my fine blond hair more limp. Though, it did help with frizzies. The price was great for the size bottle. The loreal is much smaller and costs a bit more but,  I did feel my hair had more body to it, which I really need.  I will use this in between shampoos. It smells yummy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to start comparing this or any other pantene cleansing conditioner to Wen like some others do. I dont understand why people are shocked a $5 bottle of something doesn&#x27;t do as well as a $30+ bottle of something half it&#x27;s size. That said, I really like this. I&#x27;ve tried the Pantene Pro-V Damage Repair cleansing conditioner as well, but the color preserve left my hair with more body &amp; shine. I think it would be good even if you don&#x27;t color your hair. Since I have been using cleansing conditioners (I&#x27;ve tried many) my hair is so much easier to control plus a major positive is I no longer have dandruff! I was spending a fortune trying to control my flakes, but all I had to do was stop shampooing!</li>
    <li> Fantastic alternative to the drying effects of shampoo. Awesome value. Smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, but I&#x27;m not in love with it, therefore the four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene Pro-V Damage Repair Cleansing Conditioner for a long time; made my hair feel clean but conditioned. Bought this product because the Damage Repair version was much more expensive at the time. Not nearly as good as the former. Yeah my hair feels clean, but it is practically a shampoo , not a cleansing conditioner. My hair feels dry, not smooth, after using it. Kind of disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Pantene&#x27;s product is comparable to the more expensive mail order product I have used in the past.  I use it every other day and my hair is clean, soft, and well managed.  The menthol tingle on my scalp took a few applications to get used to but now I barely notice.  I plan to order this product again.</li>
    <li> A very nice overall quality and scent.  I believe this is actually sulfate free, which is important for maintaining my hair color.</li>
    <li> A very inexpensive alternative to Wen. Works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen, Lisa Rachel, Renpure and several other cleansing conditioners. This Pantene is absolutely as good as Wen, and far better than any of the others. It smells awesome and my hair feels incredible! I have shoulder-length, fine, thin, colored hair which gets very oily. With this, my hair has volume, shine and is easier to style. The product in itself is comparable to Wen, but when you factor in the price, it blows Wen out of the water. I will definitely keep using it. And I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Wen-like product in a reasonable price range.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have limp straight hair, so I didn&#x27;t expect this to work out.  Strangely, it does!  My hair feels super clean after using it and actually behaves better than usual.  It got rid of the static electricity that I have to cope with in the winter without making my hair feel oily or heavy.  I&#x27;m going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been a Pantene user for years and was looking for a cleansing conditioner to use instead of the WEN products. This is ok- not wen, but it makes my hair very heavy. I could probably use regular Pantene conditioner and get the same results</li>
    <li> I have fine yet course hair that&#x27;s naturally damaged. This stuff makes my hair so soft. I love it! I use it or alone or with a quick Head and Shoulders Strong beforehand.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this works great.  It leaves my hair feeling hydrated and much more manageable. Good for everyday use but not for oily hair.</li>
    <li> Its ok.  I have better results with shampoo and a good conditioner.  It does prevent fade on my blue black dyed hair.  However,  it does not condition my very dry split ends as well as conditioner.  It also smells very minty,  so that may bother some people.  They also recommend shampoo and conditioner every other wash on the bottle,  I guess bc it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as well?  Either way, I wasn&#x27;t largely impressed. My hair type is VERY long,  fine,  dyed,  and although I have a lot of hair it lies pretty flat and straight and never holds a curl.</li>
    <li> Sulfate-free &#x3D; tangly hair. Little confusing because one photo has &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; on the bottle and the other image shows the bottle without that phrase. Also, not listed anywhere in the description or title as sulfate-free.</li>
    <li> Been using about 1.5 weeks.  My hair looks awesome &amp; color stays vibrant.  I have become a believer.</li>
    <li> After using WEN for the last 4 years I thought I&#x27;d give Pantene a try. So glad I did. I have natural curly hair and regular shampoo is terrible on my hair. At a fraction of the cost of WEN, my hair is soft, frizz free, and very clean feeling. I also can go longer between shampoos. Pretty sure I won&#x27;t be ordering WEN anymore.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; at 1/4th the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for a couple of years now, while out of town I ran out and tried this PANTENE Pro-V Color Preserve CLEANSING CONDITIONER.  The scent reminds me of one of the WEN scents and that was a great plus.  It feels very much the same on your scalp and hair.  I got great results. Overall I was very pleased and will use this on and off with my WEN, since I love the almond mint scent most that this one does not have..  This is a great product from PANTENE and I  will use it as another great scent and conditioning cleansing... My hair is fine and limp and color treated.</li>
    <li> My bf and I love this. Just as good as WEN cleansing conditioner to me. Use a clarifying shampoo at least every so often so hair doesn&#x27;t get oily. My hair is dry and wavy so this works well with my mane.</li>
    <li> Great product and the cost makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok but after using WEN for two years I can honestly say this is no where near as good.  It started out well but no matter what I did I ended up with a greasy buildup.  With WEN I have never had that issue.  It may work for some but I am just not a fan!</li>
    <li> Low lather - so know this before you buy, but that&#x27;s exactly what you want when looking for gentle cleansing and to preserve color.&lt;br /&gt;If you like a big soapy helmet of lather all over your head - this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m really loving this product - leaves my long hair soft and silky - no frizz.</li>
    <li> Well it works just fine but I cannot take the smell.  It kinda smells like the pomegranate one from Wen, but stronger than that.  Unfortunately, when I hate a smell, it&#x27;s all I can smell all day long.  I had to toss it because I cannot deal.  I don&#x27;t find the smell to be so strong that it will bother other people and in fact I&#x27;m normally the one to want things MORE fragrant but this particular smell just doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.</li>
    <li> Although I purchase the wrong item, realised after I had already used it, I like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the Wen commercials and was very curious about it, but can&#x27;t afford to spend that much for shampoo. Somehow I found a forum where people were talking about comparable products.. I didn&#x27;t know there was such a thing! Started doing research and discovered Amazon carries quite a few of these alternative products..I ordered a couple from Amazon, then discovered that Walmart carries this one. Before my Amazon shipment arrived, I started using this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and I really love it.. I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair that is naturally gray.. I realize this product is intended to preserve your color, but it&#x27;s the only one Walmart had, so I tried it anyways.. But in truth, it makes my gray look much prettier than it was before.. It&#x27;s in the battle ship gray stage..yuck..But with this product, it looks shiney rather than dull gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop dying my hair about 4 years ago after having an allergic reaction to the dye.. Since then, my scalp has been very sensitive and I haven&#x27;t been able to use over the counter shampoos/conditioners.. They make my head itch terribly.. I knew I was taking a chance with this product, but I wanted to give it a try anyways.. To my surprise, it does not cause any irritation to my scalp.. It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, and it&#x27;s so much more economical than buying the expensive natural shampoo/conditioner I was using before. I get my hair super wet in the shower, then pump 10 squirts of this in my palm, divide it in my hands, and start rubbing it into my hair.. I use the tips of my fingers to massage it into my scalp, and then I leave it while I shower... It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s more of a cream, like a conditioner would be, only thicker... After I finish bathing, I get a little water in my hands and then start rubbing in the product even more.. After sitting on my head while bathing, it gets much creamier and adding a little water makes it even more creamy, so I can really rub it into my hair.. It feels like a lather, but it isn&#x27;t a lather.. It&#x27;s like really creamy conditioner.. It feels really good... Then I rinse it completely, turn off the shower, ring my hair out, then add just a dab (like a dime size dab) of this to my hair for a leave in conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my age (60), I can no longer wash my hair as often as I used to because it&#x27;s gotten dryer with age (curly hair tends to be dry) plus gray hair is just dryer... I can only wash it every 3rd or 4th day now, and amazingly, after a month of use, I still have at least 1/3 of this shampoo left.. The natural product I was using before cost $6 for the shampoo and $6 for the conditioner, which I had to use a lot of.. I was going through 1 bottle of shampoo and 2 bottles of conditioner a month before... This product is a much better buy, plus it&#x27;s leaving my hair in a lot better shape..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, too....It has a very, very mild scent, you almost can&#x27;t smell it.. It isn&#x27;t over whelming like some shampoos.. Some other reviewers said this has a minty scent, but I&#x27;m wondering if they are actually using the black label Pantene Cleansing Conditioner, as this one does not have a minty scent.. It&#x27;s just a clean scent. I washed my hair yesterday and it just smells clean right now.. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.. It&#x27;s not overly flowering, it doesn&#x27;t smell gingery, it doesn&#x27;t smell fruity, it doesn&#x27;t smell minty.. it just smells like clean hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still use a dab of a anti frizz serum (as I have for years) and sometimes add a little Garnier Fructis Style Curl Shaping Spray Gel, but other than that, no other products are needed for my hair.. I can now even straighten my hair with a flat iron when I want to, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsed out, this product just makes my hair feels clean.. You know how conditioners leave a film on your hair, making it feel silky? Well, with this product, it feels silky smooth without the filmy feel.. I have to believe this is really much better for my hair as well as my scalp.thout the filmy feel.. I have to believe this is really much better for my hair as well as my scalp.</li>
    <li> Have been using WEN ( VERY VERY PRICY) for years...THIS IS AMAZING!...about time WEN has competition!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair too limp. Cannot use regularly.</li>
    <li> Just a good as Wen and a whole lot less expensive</li>
</ol>
