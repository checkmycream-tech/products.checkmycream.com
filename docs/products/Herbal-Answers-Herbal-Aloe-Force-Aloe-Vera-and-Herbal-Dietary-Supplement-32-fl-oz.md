      <li>However, the formulation is good.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say what all it is doing for me, but I know it is one of the best available and am looking forward to all the health benefits it can supply.  </li>

      <li>the ER with acute gastritis.</li>
      <li>it is supposed to work wonders though for any kind of a health problem.  </li>
      <li>, this company certifies and feels very strongly about &lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple liquid Aloe drinks on the market and this tastes by far the best!</li>
      <li>However, I can honestly say i can tell a difference from taking it, and though it deserves better than a three-star, not quite sure it deserves a four, but that&#x27;s just a matter of opinion.</li>
      <li>from the taste issue, I absolutely love the product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>have  purchased Herbal Answers Aloe Vera for many years online and never had any issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing a bottle from Toys and Games and using it</li>
      <li>It is better than using a prescription drug.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
      <li>This is good stuff; and it came fast.</li>
      <li>BE AWARE OF THIS FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH-</li>
      <li>Within one hour of taking the sips every fifteen minutes, my chest was weight free, I was breathing easier and within a day we were over the flu.  </li>
      <li>Being a Stage 4 Metatastic Melanoma patient it is important to keep PH levels in your blood even.  </li>
      <li>Many things are good for your skin and insides, but aloe &lt;br /&gt;vera has an innate ability to penetrate deeply.  </li>
      <li>I most certainly will.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this is a good product to take on a daily basis if you can afford it.</li>
      <li>Digestion seemed to become better as I started to gain the holiday weight much easier with this product.</li>
      <li>Does not cause diarrhea, but really does promote healthy bowel habits.</li>
      <li>am almost finished with this bottle ( I take a cap full 3 x a day).</li>
      <li>No bad after taste.</li>
      <li>It has helped tremendously with my stomach issues.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine suggested i give this a try and within a week I was able to live a life where I did not have to consider where the bathroom was at all times.  </li>
      <li>We bought this for my wife because she went through Chemotherapy and wants to keep her immune system strong.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was as expected with good packaging.</li>
      <li>i was skeptical when i started to use, but now that its been more than one month that i am using this product i am really happy</li>
      <li>I shared the Aloe Force product with someone on a daily basis to test out the effects with some interesting results.</li>
      <li>This was first given to us when we were battling the flu.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Aloe Vera juice.</li>
      <li>really works!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if the price doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is probably one of the better, natural choices for decent tasting Aloe Very juice.</li>
      <li>I, on the other hand, liked it.</li>
      <li>We both had very high temps</li>
      <li>Very high quality.</li>
      <li>Really cures all my digestive issues.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m going to have to use it for a while longer to see what it really will do</li>
      <li>So this might work very well for others.</li>
      <li>but some things that are good for the body do taste bad but it is easy to swallow quickly.</li>
      <li>Herbal Aloe Force makes such a positive difference and helps calm inflammatory bowel.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it has allowed me to have regular bowel movements when used daily and help with my severe diverticulosis</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>high standards by which they operate and process the aloe vera.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest buying from another Seller on Amazon- and would stay away from purchasing a health product from</li>
      <li>We highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
      <li>so I add it to juices, which makes the taste a little more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
      <li>However, it is one of those products that I would have to buy and take over a long period of time to assess the true value and benefits of consuming Aloe Force.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few liquid aloe brands and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Clearly the damage happened in shipping.  </li>
      <li>I definitely don&#x27;t like the taste straight from the bottle</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the price, I&#x27;d buy several more bottles and give it a few months to see the effects it would have on my voice and body.</li>
      <li>My family all came down with the flu, normally I would get it within the first week of one of my family members getting, this bug went through my house and I remained flu</li>
      <li>It was expressed in the other person consistently after consuming the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically, this company is one of the rare few and perhaps the only &lt;</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t had this very long</li>

<li> I base my rating (really a 3.5) on the price.</li>
<li> This product has never given me bathroom side effects, if you know what I mean.</li>
<li> Way too expensive to use if you plan to do 3-4 ounces per day.</li>

<li> the taste is bad though</li>
<li> If the aloe is bad watch out.</li>
<li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
<li> so sick</li>
<li> I was having a very bad bout with IBS-d and everything I tried ie probiotics yogurt eating no processed food - none of this was helping me.  </li>
<li> I became very very sick-</li>

    <li> I used this raw aloe juice along with licorice to help me get over a pretty bad stomach ulcer. The best aloe juice--others don&#x27;t even come close!</li>
    <li> I was having a very bad bout with IBS-d and everything I tried ie probiotics yogurt eating no processed food - none of this was helping me.  A friend of mine suggested i give this a try and within a week I was able to live a life where I did not have to consider where the bathroom was at all times.  Awesome stuff</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping somewhat..With what, I&#x27;m not exactly sure. Customer service was quite knowledgeable and helpful..Getting used to the taste.</li>
    <li> Herbal Aloe Force is the best quality Aloe Vera Juice that I have &lt;br /&gt;ever come across after hunting around and researching. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Namely, this company certifies and feels very strongly about &lt;br /&gt;the high standards by which they operate and process the aloe vera. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Basically, this company is one of the rare few and perhaps the only &lt;br /&gt;company who in bonafide manner maintains the \\&quot;living\\&quot; / \\&quot;raw\\&quot; quality &lt;br /&gt;of the aloe vera. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can find cheaper aloe vera juice, but living aloe vera juice &lt;br /&gt;is a powerhouse healer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read that aloe vera is one substance that has the ability to penetrate deeper thru layers of skin / tissue than other substances.  This is a good thing.  Many things are good for your skin and insides, but aloe &lt;br /&gt;vera has an innate ability to penetrate deeply.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are going to spend a bit more for a \\&quot;best of\\&quot;, this would &lt;br /&gt;be a good one to chose to do just that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For me personally, it has changed the look and feel of my stomach, &lt;br /&gt;from the inside out.  This product has never given me bathroom side effects, if you know what I mean. This is a mis-conception perhaps &lt;br /&gt;because for me this does not happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I make herbal ice teas - - all kinds - - and I add some of this product &lt;br /&gt;to that tea. I sweeten with (herbal product) stevia</li>
    <li> I have diverticulitis and this stuff keeps them from cutting out a piece of my colon.  I swear by it</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t about tasting good it&#x27;s about helping your immune system.  It tastes \\&quot;different\\&quot; but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt inclined to write to all who are thinking of buying this product from Toys and Games.&lt;br /&gt;I have  purchased Herbal Answers Aloe Vera for many years online and never had any issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing a bottle from Toys and Games and using it - I became very very sick- so sick I ended up&lt;br /&gt;in the ER with acute gastritis. I have been using aloe for years and never had a problem with it until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest buying from another Seller on Amazon- and would stay away from purchasing a health product from&lt;br /&gt;a company that is known for selling Toys and Games and Hardware. Im not knocking the product- just the quality of the product the sell- because it gave me poisioning and gi issues. If the aloe is bad watch out. I buy now only from Health Companies on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH- DO NOT BUY FROM TOYS AND GAMES anything you plan to ingest.</li>
    <li> The product, Aloe Force, tastes a lot like diluted apple cider vinegar, so I am skeptical as to the actual Aloe part of the force. I found the product to increase my hunger often times and feel good while eating food. Digestion seemed to become better as I started to gain the holiday weight much easier with this product. I gained like 10 lbs in a month, but am slowly dropping it - 5 lbs so far. I shared the Aloe Force product with someone on a daily basis to test out the effects with some interesting results. The other person has some digestive issues, like indigestion, bloating, belching, and acidy feelings in the stomach. After taking the Aloe Force, it improved digestion minimally, but with some improvement based on our conversations. I believe the extra herbs in the product can cause excitement or panic after consumption. It was expressed in the other person consistently after consuming the product. I, on the other hand, liked it. However, it is one of those products that I would have to buy and take over a long period of time to assess the true value and benefits of consuming Aloe Force.</li>
    <li> great stuff, raw---the best!</li>
    <li> i was told that this products helps a lot with digestive tract, especially with heartburn. i was skeptical when i started to use, but now that its been more than one month that i am using this product i am really happy and i will use as long as i can</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I feel the difference.</li>
    <li> One of the two bottles ordered was damaged in shipping.  It had a small dent near the top, the cap was loose, and the inner seal broken.  Some of the fluid had leaked into the plastic bag in which the bottle was encased.  Clearly the damage happened in shipping.  The air packs inside the shipping box did not provide enough protection.</li>
    <li> We have been using Aloe Force for over thirteen years.  It is a product that we never want to be without.  If either of us gets a scratchy throat, we start sipping it.  It is amazing how any type of virus is stopped in it&#x27;s tracks with this Aloe Force.  We highly recommend it to everyone.  Even our grandchildren want it when they start coming down with something.  It is better than using a prescription drug.  This was first given to us when we were battling the flu.  We both had very high temps and I was close to pneumonia.  My chest felt like it had a twenty pound weight on it.  Within one hour of taking the sips every fifteen minutes, my chest was weight free, I was breathing easier and within a day we were over the flu.  We praise the Lord for this product.</li>
    <li> do you want a great complexion?? Take this -it really works!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Really cures all my digestive issues.</li>
    <li> taste needs help but it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has allowed me to have regular bowel movements when used daily and help with my severe diverticulosis</li>
    <li> Being a Stage 4 Metatastic Melanoma patient it is important to keep PH levels in your blood even.  I have been using this product since January 2014, and my blood work has been perfect, better than pre cancer!  I just add about 1/3 to 1/2 a capful to ice, water, and juice and take each morning with breakfast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Aloe Vera juice. This particular brand sin&#x27;t as harsh tasting as others. I bought it because one of my singing students uses it. And I like it has the esiac herbs in it too. However, I can honestly say i can tell a difference from taking it, and though it deserves better than a three-star, not quite sure it deserves a four, but that&#x27;s just a matter of opinion. I base my rating (really a 3.5) on the price. Way too expensive to use if you plan to do 3-4 ounces per day. If it weren&#x27;t for the price, I&#x27;d buy several more bottles and give it a few months to see the effects it would have on my voice and body. But, for now, I&#x27;ll have to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if the price doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is probably one of the better, natural choices for decent tasting Aloe Very juice.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff; and it came fast.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my wife because she went through Chemotherapy and wants to keep her immune system strong.  We can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.  The problem we have with this is the cost is too expensive to take twice a day (especially after trying to recover from all the out of pocket insurance expenses from breast cancer)...So she uses one ounce per day whereas she was using 2 ounces.  She can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> this is a good product to take on a daily basis if you can afford it. in order to take 4 oz per day it would cost a couple of hundred dollars per month..it is supposed to work wonders though for any kind of a health problem.  the taste is bad though but some things that are good for the body do taste bad but it is easy to swallow quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this very long so I can&#x27;t say what all it is doing for me, but I know it is one of the best available and am looking forward to all the health benefits it can supply.  Shipping was as expected with good packaging.</li>
    <li> Great aloe vera juice supplement. Special cold processing that removes the alantoin in the aloe plant. Very high quality. Does not cause diarrhea, but really does promote healthy bowel habits. Also, helps with my energy levels. I&#x27;ve been taking this product for five years, now, with no side effects and no problems. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Herbal Aloe Force makes such a positive difference and helps calm inflammatory bowel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I believe it is helping.  I think I&#x27;m going to have to use it for a while longer to see what it really will do but it seems to have helped my silent reflux. I&#x27;ve now used this product for a few months and it really has controlled my silent reflux.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I took three bottles of this but I&#x27;m not sure I saw any big difference in how I felt..... However, the formulation is good. So this might work very well for others.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few liquid aloe brands and this is my favorite.  The taste isn&#x27;t bad.  I feel like my skin improved a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple liquid Aloe drinks on the market and this tastes by far the best! No bad after taste. My doctor recommended this over all the others too!</li>
    <li> Drink twice a day to heal my insides.</li>
    <li> Keeps me regular. Sometimes I run out and forget to order it. I can tell the difference in my body when I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile.</li>
    <li> This product helps my digestive processes and help me with gerd discomfort.</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t like the taste straight from the bottle so I add it to juices, which makes the taste a little more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the taste issue, I absolutely love the product. It has helped tremendously with my stomach issues. I also found that since taking Aloe Force that the persistent itchy, blistering rash on my hand has cleared up. My skin texture has improved. My family all came down with the flu, normally I would get it within the first week of one of my family members getting, this bug went through my house and I remained flu free!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am almost finished with this bottle ( I take a cap full 3 x a day). Will I buy this product again? I most certainly will.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
