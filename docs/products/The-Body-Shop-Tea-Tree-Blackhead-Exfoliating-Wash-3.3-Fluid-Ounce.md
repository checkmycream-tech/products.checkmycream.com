### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy to have experienced this wash and plan on continuing using it.</li>
      <li>BUT his skin looks great with it and mine was peeling from 3 uses.  </li>
      <li>However it feels great</li>
      <li>I find I have to use a bit of product to feel well-exfoliated. :P</li>
      <li>and I know tea tree is good for acne.  </li>
      <li>but after a week of using this scrub my skin has some restored softness and many of the blackheads have dissapeared!     </li>
      <li>I got this for my husband, he liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice, but did not see any difference in complexion.</li>
      <li>i deff love it.</li>
      <li>but i seem to have more than ever.  </li>
      <li>got 3 more just in case :)</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel tingly when I use it, although I wish there were more scrubby bits in it</li>
      <li>Smells great and is gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day and it is wonderful!</li>
      <li>This product smells nice and does feel good on the skin, but I feel like it did not make much of a different in my skin when it came to lessening the amount of blackheads I had.</li>
      <li>Nice and gentle on skin, doesn&#x27;t dry your face after use, feels good, smells good</li>
      <li>I have tried many other The Body Shop products and loved them!</li>
      <li>I have been using this about two weeks,and I feel just fine.</li>
      <li>Because it has this tingly/cooling feel, I think it would be great for the summer after a sweaty day outside.</li>
      <li>But so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>The bright green and dyes in it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
      <li>one doesn&#x27;t make your face feel clean or exfoliated.  </li>
      <li>kind think smart) because your skin with have some, irritation but after using the product for a while its will go away ;-)</li>
      <li>I wanted my face to feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting blackheads on my nose forever, and this is the very first product that has worked.  </li>
      <li>Wanted a more natural feel.</li>
      <li>I have found no other product better than this one.</li>
      <li>Basically, it is not any better than your typically scrub but costs substantially more.</li>
      <li>I have dry, acne prone skin and pair the Tea Tree cleansers with the Vitamin E moisturizers for an amazing finish.</li>
      <li>this product came in very fast.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>, overall - good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Really a nice contrast comparing to the most of the facial products - I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This is not just another face wash...it really works well!</li>
      <li>Other than this, I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>One Size first and tried it out before I bought this</li>
      <li>pores got smaller and face less oily :) love this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, lacks the nice tea-tree fragrance the other products in this line have.</li>
      <li>Product came quickly but cap had popped open so inside of bag was full of cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie about the effectiveness it works great make such to rub the little apprcrot rocks ( or whatever they are) thuroly</li>
      <li>But this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>I recommend gently massaging your face for about a minute, then leaving the product ON for a minute.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth and my pores are smaller.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed</li>
      <li>but I really like this product &amp; just because I got jipped on shipping</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviews that there aren&#x27;t many scrubbies within the product itself.  </li>
      <li>I only use it sometimes, and found it comfortable, only downside is it&#x27;s not cleaning very throughly,</li>
      <li>A few notes  *doesnt have as many grains as you would expect but the ones it does (apricot) can sometimes be a bit scratchy.   </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s mostly a lotion-like wash with a few scrubbing bits thrown in).</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish this product had was more crushed apricot shells for exfoliation purposes.</li>
      <li>This stuff is hardly an exfoliater... more like a lotion.  </li>
      <li>was sensitive skin probs</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it regularly enough to comment on it&#x27;s zit-vanquishing skills.    </li>
      <li>I never had acne as a teenager which might explain why I have adult acne now</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin clear and soft.</li>
      <li>*the first few times were tingly and there was a minor degree of discomfort but this will fade after the first two or so uses.    </li>
      <li>All the other Body Shop Tea Tree products are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>apply directly on area&#x27;s that needs attention to scrub for a long time &amp; wash</li>

<li> I have blemishes on a regular basis now, my pores are enlarged and the texture is uneven.       </li>
<li> (i believe leaving the product on the face allows it to penetrate somewhat, think of how silly it is to wash it off right after you apply, how can it work?)  </li>
<li> I use this every day or every other day, depending on what time of the month it is.</li>
<li> The scrubbing particles are crushed apricot stones and silica particle, but there seem to be too few of them to do any exfoliating.  </li>
<li> After using this it feels like my dead skin is still there.</li>
<li> my guess is that his skin type can handle the drying effect, which is weird because his skin is soo dry in winter months that he gets red/rashy areas</li>
<li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  The grains are too coarse and the scrub does not have an overabundance of grains in it.  Basically, it is not any better than your typically scrub but costs substantially more.</li>
    <li> I like this scrub overall. It makes my skin feel tingly when I use it, although I wish there were more scrubby bits in it (it&#x27;s mostly a lotion-like wash with a few scrubbing bits thrown in). I don&#x27;t really use it regularly enough to comment on it&#x27;s zit-vanquishing skills.    Because it has this tingly/cooling feel, I think it would be great for the summer after a sweaty day outside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product once because I got a little sample from a salesperson.  But so far, so good.  I agree with the other reviews that there aren&#x27;t many scrubbies within the product itself.  However, I bought a facial cleanser brush for $3 (also at The Body Shop) and used it with my sample and I think that&#x27;s what helped remove the blackheads.  I immediately saw a reduction in the size and appearance of the blackheads on my nose and chin.  The facial brush may be a little harsh for some, but if you can handle using the brush along with this blackhead exfoliator scrub, it certainly does the trick.</li>
    <li> I use this every day or every other day, depending on what time of the month it is. It helps keep my skin clear and soft. I have dry, acne prone skin and pair the Tea Tree cleansers with the Vitamin E moisturizers for an amazing finish.</li>
    <li> I use this product three times a week and the tea tree cleanser ever day, and the tea tree facial mask once a week. This product has done wonders! The only thing I wish this product had was more crushed apricot shells for exfoliation purposes. I find I have to use a bit of product to feel well-exfoliated. :P Other than this, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting blackheads on my nose forever, and this is the very first product that has worked.  I use it twice a week.  Smells great and is gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Care Kit One Size first and tried it out before I bought this, so I knew this product worked for me. The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly but cap had popped open so inside of bag was full of cleanser.  Probably only 1/2 of product is still in tube. ;o/  I recommend sealing cap with tape for future deliveries.</li>
    <li> Nice and gentle on skin, doesn&#x27;t dry your face after use, feels good, smells good, overall - good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Really a nice contrast comparing to the most of the facial products - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> this is my first experience with tea tree oil products because i previously believed that tea tree was too harsh. Previous to the birth of my last son i usd only cleansers geared towards sensitive skin, such as a very simple shea or olive oil soap, but since then my skin chemistry has changed. I have blemishes on a regular basis now, my pores are enlarged and the texture is uneven.       but after a week of using this scrub my skin has some restored softness and many of the blackheads have dissapeared!     A few notes  *doesnt have as many grains as you would expect but the ones it does (apricot) can sometimes be a bit scratchy.   * I recommend gently massaging your face for about a minute, then leaving the product ON for a minute. (i believe leaving the product on the face allows it to penetrate somewhat, think of how silly it is to wash it off right after you apply, how can it work?)  *the first few times were tingly and there was a minor degree of discomfort but this will fade after the first two or so uses.    But i definetly recommend it and think it you should try it if you are looking fro something different.</li>
    <li> This is not just another face wash...it really works well! My skin feels smooth and my pores are smaller. It only takes a dime size per wash, so it lasts a while and is well-worth the price. I am happy to have experienced this wash and plan on continuing using it. I only wished I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> I have found no other product better than this one. I use it every other day and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, he liked it a lot. I only use it sometimes, and found it comfortable, only downside is it&#x27;s not cleaning very throughly, i guess that&#x27;s same for all similar products.</li>
    <li> I never had acne as a teenager which might explain why I have adult acne now (i guess).  This stuff is DRYING.  I use it maybe once every 14 days.  My husband&#x27;s skin is different and he has no problems with the product.  my guess is that his skin type can handle the drying effect, which is weird because his skin is soo dry in winter months that he gets red/rashy areas yet he has no problem with this - does not make sense, i know.  BUT his skin looks great with it and mine was peeling from 3 uses.  It has helped his blackheads but i seem to have more than ever.  Will continue to buy it for him, but was looking for something for me!  Oh, well.</li>
    <li> I like the scrub but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of any blackheads.  However it feels great and I know tea tree is good for acne.  Want to try the other face wash next without the scrubby bits in it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hardly an exfoliater... more like a lotion.  I had to use handsoap to wash it off because I could feel the sticky layer of lotion left on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wanted a more natural feel. The bright green and dyes in it doesn&#x27;t feel good. We havent seen any improvement. I wanted my face to feel fresh and clean. After using this it feels like my dead skin is still there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about two weeks,and I feel just fine. I will keep trying, and then see what happen.</li>
    <li> this product came in very fast. i deff love it. i recommend this product to anyone was sensitive skin probs</li>
    <li> All the other Body Shop Tea Tree products are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t make your face feel clean or exfoliated.  The scrubbing particles are crushed apricot stones and silica particle, but there seem to be too few of them to do any exfoliating.  Feels like rubbing cream with a four grains of sand on you face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, lacks the nice tea-tree fragrance the other products in this line have.</li>
    <li> pores got smaller and face less oily :) love this product! got 3 more just in case :) God bless!</li>
    <li> This product smells nice and does feel good on the skin, but I feel like it did not make much of a different in my skin when it came to lessening the amount of blackheads I had. I have tried many other The Body Shop products and loved them! But this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> I like a gritty exfoliation, this seemed too creamy.  The smell was nice, but did not see any difference in complexion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it it  dries my skin ! But you know maybe is for different skin tipe !</li>
    <li> I look this product works wonders however, if your not a amazon prime member shipping is rediclous! 12 bucks shipping for this I bought it PS3 &amp; shipping was lesson I&#x27;m disapointed that it didn&#x27;t tell me the shipping price until it was shipped. So next time I&#x27;ll just \\&quot;walk\\&quot;  to the mall! Very disapointed but I really like this product &amp; just because I got jipped on shipping I&#x27;m not going to lie about the effectiveness it works great make such to rub the little apprcrot rocks ( or whatever they are) thuroly apply directly on area&#x27;s that needs attention to scrub for a long time &amp; wash face simple I will note that you should apply some loation (not greesy kind think smart) because your skin with have some, irritation but after using the product for a while its will go away ;-)</li>
