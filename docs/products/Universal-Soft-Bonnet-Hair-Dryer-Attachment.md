<ol>
      <li>then this is a perfect alternative to going to the salon or blow drying.</li>
      <li>AWESOME RESULTS!</li>
      <li>I use rollers and this is a perfect solution using a hand held dryer....</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>The bonnet attachment fits over my dryer perfectly because of the elastic sleeve.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST PURCHASES.</li>
      <li>Great product and quality is very good.</li>
      <li>Works great when using curlers.  </li>
      <li>It would be good for seniors.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; relaxing reading a book while drying my hair.</li>
      <li>Just beware that it fits blow dryers with the more slender air vent...</li>
      <li>and hi was way to hot!!!</li>
      <li>It works great, you shouldn&#x27;t use high heat.</li>
      <li>I also love that I could lie on my belly and read a magazine comfortably without the drama that comes with setting up the table top bonnets.</li>
      <li>It should fit most dryers.</li>
      <li>Just make sure your ears don&#x27;t get too hot!</li>
      <li>Great for deep conditioning treatments as well as curlers</li>
      <li>but it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Did a lot of searching to find a well rated bonnet cap or cheap dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for deep conditioning</li>
      <li>fun!</li>
      <li>was too cool</li>
      <li>This is a quick save and works fairly well, although it works slower than a regular hood dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super convenient.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced and originally recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for a universal bonnet.</li>
      <li>Loved this product it&#x27;s inexpensive and made deep conditioning my hair so much easier.</li>
      <li>If it lasts for a year, I will get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>I have a pretty large head and my head fits comfortably in the bonnet without slippage.  </li>
      <li>Does get hot around the scalp but a wash rag solves that.</li>
      <li>and I figured that if a company was willing to stick its name on it then it must be of some quality</li>
      <li>I really like this item.  </li>
      <li>Works but very cheap--would not buy again</li>
      <li>After much searching, I came across this one, and, having just used it, can report it works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>I have locs and wanted the soft bonnet to use for hot oil treatments and for loc retwists.  </li>
      <li>I’m not sure if it will fit over very large rollers used in roller sets.  </li>
      <li>Buy it if you are looking for a soft bonnet dryer or the attachment!</li>
      <li>but once you attach the hood just put the dryer down on a towel (hands free), read a book  like you would at the hairdressers .  </li>
      <li>I read on another review that the heat with the large rollers will stretch the bonnet out, not sure how true that is, but this one works for my head.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, so I think it will last longer.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed is that I could only use it on medium or low heat or the bonnet would start to move other than that I love it</li>
      <li>Initially I was going to buy the Laila Ali or Andis Soft Bonnet Dryer which both retail for about $30.</li>

<li> the only thing I find wrong is that the elastic holding the product on to the hair dryer is too narrow.  </li>
<li> Not sure what those stickers mean,</li>
<li> , medium was not warm enuff</li>
<li> I hate sitting underneath a stiff dryer, and I don&#x27;t have the money to buy one nor the space to place one in my apartment.</li>

    <li> I used this on several women with Velcro rollers - the mid point from the crown to the nape didn&#x27;t dry in the half hour time allotted as did the rest of the hair... And it was hard to adjust for heat comfort - low was too cool, medium was not warm enuff and hi was way to hot!!! So unless u have a 5 heat level adjusted blow dryer, I wouldn&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> This is literally my saving grace. I hate sitting underneath a stiff dryer, and I don&#x27;t have the money to buy one nor the space to place one in my apartment. This is a quick save and works fairly well, although it works slower than a regular hood dryer. It is practically impossible to use this with the blow dryer on high heat, as it traps heat QUICKLY AND will burn you if you&#x27;re not careful. If you have time (my hair takes about 2 hours to dry fully in rollers, it&#x27;s pretty thick) then this is a perfect alternative to going to the salon or blow drying. I love it! It&#x27;s also great for deep conditioning and I prefer it to a heating cap, as you can literally feel the air whooshing in the unit.</li>
    <li> Great for deep conditioning treatments as well as curlers</li>
    <li> I use rollers and this is a perfect solution using a hand held dryer....but once you attach the hood just put the dryer down on a towel (hands free), read a book  like you would at the hairdressers .  This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought .  Eventually after several years the elastic gets stretched that attaches to the dryer. Very reasonably priced and originally recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> fun! and it works.  won&#x27;t last long but it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of searching to find a well rated bonnet cap or cheap dryer. After much searching, I came across this one, and, having just used it, can report it works very well. Bonnet stays well on your head, as does the elastic sleeve on your blow dryer.  After receiving a product that had a warning  sticker on it that it was meant to be only sold at Walgreens, I returned it to the seller since they were not Walgreens. Not sure what those stickers mean, but I did honor it. Thankfully, too, since I then discovered these sell for under ten at target online.</li>
    <li> the only thing I find wrong is that the elastic holding the product on to the hair dryer is too narrow.  I followed someone else&#x27;s advice and attached 2&amp;#34; inch elastic to the end of the hose, and while it does slip from the dryer occasionally, it does not slip nearly as often as it did with the narrow elastic.  I am finding this dryer really helpful and use it at least three times a week.</li>
    <li> Works great when using curlers.  Just beware that it fits blow dryers with the more slender air vent...and you may need to use an extra rubber band to keep it on snuggly...I use the type wrapped in fabric that is used for hair pony tails.</li>
    <li> Loved this product it&#x27;s inexpensive and made deep conditioning my hair so much easier. The only thing I noticed is that I could only use it on medium or low heat or the bonnet would start to move other than that I love it</li>
    <li> Works but very cheap--would not buy again</li>
    <li> Works well. Stays on and fits my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Does get hot around the scalp but a wash rag solves that.</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  It&#x27;s super convenient.  I have locs and wanted the soft bonnet to use for hot oil treatments and for loc retwists.  I have a pretty large head and my head fits comfortably in the bonnet without slippage.  I’m not sure if it will fit over very large rollers used in roller sets.  I read on another review that the heat with the large rollers will stretch the bonnet out, not sure how true that is, but this one works for my head.  Initially I was going to buy the Laila Ali or Andis Soft Bonnet Dryer which both retail for about $30. I do not like to be wasteful, so I thought why not my current blow dryer... which is a Conair Ion blow dryer and buy an attachment.  The bonnet attachment fits over my dryer perfectly because of the elastic sleeve.  It should fit most dryers. My blow dryer has six settings, high-hot, high-medium, high-cool, low-hot, low-medium and low-cool.  The Laila Ali and Andis dryer systems have only four settings.  Also, I noticed that my ears burned a bit, but that was because I did not have it tied properly.  I also love that I could lie on my belly and read a magazine comfortably without the drama that comes with setting up the table top bonnets. I really like this.  I wish I had known about this bonnet years ago.  If it lasts for a year, I will get my money&#x27;s worth.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, so I think it will last longer.  There are other bonnet attachments on Amazon, but I decided to go with this one because it’s a brand name and I figured that if a company was willing to stick its name on it then it must be of some quality and it is!  Buy it if you are looking for a soft bonnet dryer or the attachment!</li>
    <li> Pretty good for a universal bonnet. Just make sure your ears don&#x27;t get too hot!</li>
    <li> It works great, you shouldn&#x27;t use high heat. I was disabled for a month &amp; couldn&#x27;t blow dry my hair so this saved me. It&#x27;s nice &amp; relaxing reading a book while drying my hair. It would be good for seniors.</li>
    <li> Great product and quality is very good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST PURCHASES. AWESOME RESULTS!</li>
