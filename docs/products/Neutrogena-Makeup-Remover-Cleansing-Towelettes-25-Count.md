      <li>and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
      <li>Despite having sensitive skin, I like these better than the ones made for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>If your like me and your lazy about removing your make-up then you will love these because of how easy they are to use.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>These remove makeup very well, including waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>Removed my waterproof mascara, waterproof eyeliner, eye makeup and foundation very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also very prone to break outs and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
      <li>Much better than other wipes I have tried</li>
      <li>These towelettes are easy to use (the pack reseals itself), and leave your face and throat feeling soft and clean, but never tight or dry.</li>
      <li>I always have them on hand, and they work wonders on my waterproof mascara... and are still gentle on my sensitive eyes!</li>
      <li>This product has minimal odor and is fine on my &amp;#34;touchy&amp;#34; skin.</li>
      <li>After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
      <li>product itself is nice enough but they arrived really dried out.</li>
      <li>I feel the pads dry out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I have to use more than one, but that is a small price to pay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For waterproof eyeliner I find I have to put the wipe on my finger and gently wipe the makeup lining my eye back and forth until it all comes up.</li>
      <li>They are not harsh on my sensitive skin and are not drying.</li>
      <li>Even my face wash doesn&#x27;t completely remove my mascara</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to be harsh on your eyes and leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and find that this product doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation to my skin.</li>

      <li>Those are used daily, while I use lip products and eyeshadows very occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 81 years old and have no wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These facial wipes remove makeup with gentle wiping.  </li>
      <li>I am  always in a rush and the towelettes clean my face with little effort.  </li>
      <li>The only thing it doesn&#x27;t completely remove is waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>The are big and soft and all you need is just one each time.</li>
      <li>a 3 pack on amazon is much cheaper than just buying a single pack at your local store so your definitwely saving money this way...</li>
      <li>This is great for when I have a late night and am too tired to wash my face before bed.</li>
      <li>I primarily use black waterproof liquid eyeliner, black waterproof mascara, and various shades of brown pencils to fill in my brows.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use these every night. I wear a lot of makeup daily, especially waterproof eyeliner and mascara. This sheet gets rid of all the makeup on my face including thick foundation and dark lipsticks all in one sheet. It also doesnt dry out my skin like the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; ones do.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;My GF loves these wipes. It makes it way easier to remove her make up.&lt;br /&gt;The wipes doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes when she wipes with them</li>
    <li> I got the Neutrogena Make-Up Cleansing Towelettes because I was having a hard time getting my mascara off with the Cetaphil and water that I&#x27;ve always used. The towelettes work as described, I can see that all my make-up comes off when I use them, including the mascara (though I still have to rub a bit). When I am at home, I still wash afterward with Cetaphil and water, just to make sure my skin is clean since my pores tend to clog up. At the gym the towelettes are great to get my make-up off quickly before a workout or sauna without hauling around a pile of products. The frangrance is pleasant too, not overwhelming or super perfumey.</li>
    <li> I have strayed from these and boy do I regret it.  Nothing has worked as well as this, no matter what I have tried.  It is unbelievable how well these work.  They get off every bit of makeup and they leave your skin smooth, soft, and with a beautiful glow.  I never break out when I use these and my skin glows.  They even get makeup off after I&#x27;ve washed my face with soap and a cloth or after I get out of the shower.  I have yet to find anything to work as well as this.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at the market and found them muchness expensive on Amazon. Good makeup remover wipes, takes the makeup off without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried anything else after this! It&#x27;s easy and always reliable. No waterproof mascara can stand it!</li>
    <li> I love his product.  I &#x27;ve used it for several years now.  It is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the same product you can buy at any retail store. It was so convienent to have this product delivered to my door. Deliver was swift and now I have enough to last me months.</li>
    <li> The pads are not always that moist.  I feel the pads dry out too quickly.  But I continue to re-order.</li>
    <li> I buy these on a regular basis. Fragrance free, one does a good job. Excellent for removing makeup and especially waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Relatively cheap makeup remover towelettes that get the job done without leaving behind greasy residue. The only issue is that sometimes they dry out if not resealed properly.</li>
    <li> I think thes are the best makeup wipes! I always have them on hand, and they work wonders on my waterproof mascara... and are still gentle on my sensitive eyes! Have been using these for years, with no plans to stop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Oil of Olay makeup remover and that removed my makeup but burned my eyes. This removes the makeup without burning my eyes. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t completely remove is waterproof mascara. This is great for when I have a late night and am too tired to wash my face before bed. It cleans my face without leaving it feeling dry. I have naturally dry skin so this is awesome. Even my face wash doesn&#x27;t completely remove my mascara the in the first wash.</li>
    <li> I buy them for that sole purpose - it removes eye makeup instantly.  Any other make up removal is a bonus.  I will continue to buy these on a regular basis.  I use a lot of Neutrogena products, and this is up there on the list.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wiping away my makeup at night, including my waterproof mascara without stinging my eyes. Buying in bulk saves me money.</li>
    <li> The only towelette I have found that removes waterproof mascara without scrubbing.  They don&#x27;t seem to be harsh on your eyes and leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I just not could believe how wonderful this product is! Only one sheet is enough to remove all the heavy make up. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite makeup remover. It does the job!! Easy, no fuss and cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always worked just right for me</li>
    <li> These are so handy for traveling, work well and don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Additionally, the price was right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! I have really sensitive skin and find that this product doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation to my skin. It easily removes my make up without scrubbing, and then I like to wash with a gentle cleanser afterwards. It&#x27;s moisturizing without leaving your face feeling greasy. I&#x27;m also very prone to break outs and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all. I love it and will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> essential for anyone who wears makeup</li>
    <li> They work well. Removed my waterproof mascara, waterproof eyeliner, eye makeup and foundation very well. For waterproof eyeliner I find I have to put the wipe on my finger and gently wipe the makeup lining my eye back and forth until it all comes up. For other makeup like foundation it&#x27;s easier to come off, but these wipes do work well. I find they make my already oily skin even oilier, so I always follow up with a wash. I would not use them as a face wash, but a makeup remover wipe. Will repurchase</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these towelettes. I keep a pack of these everywhere, in each bag, in the vehicles, in the camper.... They feel so good and make my face feel clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> When I first received these and pulled one out I was a little doubtful as it looked like a simple moist towelette that comes after a rib dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these things work extremely well, even for waterproof and heavily troweled-on makeup. The wipes have no odor, no chemical feel, and they cause no irritation, nor seem to leave behind any residue. They just take the makeup off leaving a clean feeling behind. Sometimes I have to use more than one, but that is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are just fresh and pleasant to use. Finding a product that removes any and all makeup without feeling harsh on the skin is almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makeup remover is perfect for someone on the go.  I am  always in a rush and the towelettes clean my face with little effort.  They were less expensive on Amazon than Wal-mart.  Will be ordering  again.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the commercials. I thought a towelette would be easier than using several cotton balls. I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!! I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well. After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin). It works great and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
    <li> These are by far the BEST make-up remover cloths I&#x27;ve ever used. The are big and soft and all you need is just one each time. They smell good and they leave your skin nice and soft afterwards. I normaly don&#x27;t use make-up remover cloths but I&#x27;ve been trying a few out and these are the ones I&#x27;m sticking with! I just love them and talk about easy to use, If your like me and your lazy about removing your make-up then you will love these because of how easy they are to use. No soap, no water, how much more easy can you get then that, Just pull one out, wipe off and your done. I will forever be a customer for life. :)</li>
    <li> Good quality. Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. No complaints.</li>
    <li> love this product, easy to use, no mess with rags etc, works on eyes and causes no breakouts for my skin</li>
    <li> I needed a pack at work and one in my room for those days I just need a pick me up cleanse and for the nights I need to take off my make up without getting up and going to the sink (yep mega lazy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is nice enough but they arrived really dried out. Disappointed. Probably won&#x27;t buy them in bulk again - could just be product design? Some companies use hard plastic doors instead of the sticker...not sure if that&#x27;s part of the problem. Oh well!</li>
    <li> They work great at removing makeup; leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I  love these wipes as a gentle way to remove make up or to refresh a clean face.  This three pack is a great deal too.</li>
    <li> These facial wipes remove makeup with gentle wiping.  They are very effective in removing eye makeup.  Despite having sensitive skin, I like these better than the ones made for sensitive skin.  This product has minimal odor and is fine on my &amp;#34;touchy&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001E96NYS Neutrogena Make-Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Refill Pack, 25-Count Packs (Pack of 3)]]  Taking of my makeup and the grime of the day from my face is something I never skip - at home or traveling, even camping.  These towelettes are easy to use (the pack reseals itself), and leave your face and throat feeling soft and clean, but never tight or dry.</li>
    <li> They do such a great job</li>
    <li> i orignially started buying these wipes at my local harmons store, they are not too expensive and they definitely do the job! i hate spalshing cold water on my face and scrubbing it right before i am about to go to bed... the cold water wakes me up!! and i cant just go to sleep with make-up left on my face otherwise i will break out!!this wipe leaves me feeling refreshed without having to use cold water and it takes off virtually all of my makeup... a 3 pack on amazon is much cheaper than just buying a single pack at your local store so your definitwely saving money this way... same quality product with half the cost</li>
    <li> Good buy - great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these makeup remover wipes for a couple years now, after having experimented with different brands of wipes and liquids. I primarily use black waterproof liquid eyeliner, black waterproof mascara, and various shades of brown pencils to fill in my brows. Those are used daily, while I use lip products and eyeshadows very occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes have been very successful in removing the entirety of my makeup each night. Yes, I do still feel the need to wash my face after using them, but I would wash my face before bed anyway. And compared to some of the (even supposedly oil-free) makeup removers I have used in the past, the trace that these leave is miniscule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had problems in the past with makeup remover doing funny things to my skin... either drying it out or making me break out pretty badly. So far I haven&#x27;t had any of these issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, as far as these products go, this definitely seems to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum, so that&#x27;s bonus points right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be bad? A product that works well and does what it says it will, and doesn&#x27;t make you shell out extra cash either. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands, but keep coming back to Neutrogena.  They do an excellent job of cleaning, don&#x27;t rip apart and stay moist in the package.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every day. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, especially at nite time when I remove my makeup.  I am 81 years old and have no wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that putting on moisturizer before make up and also using these towelettes are fantastic and help protecting my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have these on my subscriptions from Amazon so I will never run out.Always think that you have to use one a night.</li>
    <li> I use these and LOVE them. They are by far the best make up remover towelettes out there, and I&#x27;ve tried many. It&#x27;s true, they even remove waterproof mascara with ease. They are not harsh on my sensitive skin and are not drying. Gentle Yet Effective! Love These.</li>
    <li> Cleans and moisturizers your skin, love them.</li>
    <li> This is good for my dry skin. I hate using soap everyday so I use this at night and a gentle cleanser in the morning at its perfect.</li>
    <li> These remove makeup very well, including waterproof mascara.  The only issue I&#x27;ve come across is that I feel that the wipes are a bit dry and therefore I sometimes feel that I have to rub my face harder than I would like to when removing my makeup.  Overall though, I think these are a great product and better than a lot of other makeup remover wipes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> These wipes are terrific.&lt;br /&gt;They leave your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Much better than other wipes I have tried</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them for removing eye makeup!! Gets the job done! Highly recommend! AAAA ++++ And also smells nice!</li>
