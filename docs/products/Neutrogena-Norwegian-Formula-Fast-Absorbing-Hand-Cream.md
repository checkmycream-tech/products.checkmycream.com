    <li> This lotion is Unbelievable- the amount of moisture it will give your skin is unreal.

The scent is wonderful not strong in the least just a faint fresh and clean smell.</li>
    <li> Really great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;My brother has very very dry skin and especially when he travel to dry country, his skin would crack! After using this product, his skin is so moisturized!

    <li> Love this product.  When I put the lotion on  - it absorbs into the skin and leaving it smooth and smelling good.  It&#x27;s great for my skin and my elbows are nice an smooth now.  Even talked my husband into using it.</li>
