      <li>She is so happy that her hair is now &amp;#34;controllable.&amp;#34; I think she is hooked!</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this conditioner.  </li>

      <li>Great product!!</li>

      <li>The ingredients aren&#x27;t that great-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great conditioner.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>I use more like a pea sized, and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>Has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling grimy.  </li>
      <li>I use this instead of conditioner in the shower, and it makes my hair smell so good.</li>
      <li>I loved this product.  </li>
      <li>Spray-in products are easier to use, but this is a good product to comb through and use your hands to distribute.</li>
      <li>The scent is particularly good because it is practically absent.  </li>
      <li>I gave this a try and was happy with it for the most part.  </li>
      <li>and it works great to protect hair in between trims to keep the ends looking healthy.</li>
      <li>It stops the frizz and the static!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even use a walnut-sized amount of conditioner in the shower, with the rinse-out kind.)</li>
      <li>Also, since this product has a nice fragrance, smoothing it on in between shampoos just helps my hair smell a bit fresher.</li>

      <li>I think the glimmer of hope got her to try it, and she is thrilled.</li>
      <li>It is a nice consistency that spreads through the hair well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice and convenient.</li>
      <li>I took off one star for the smell, because even though it&#x27;s pleasant, it&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and smells pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it to be one of the more effective hair products I have used in my wavy curly hair.</li>
      <li>the best so far.  </li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t stop the static.  </li>
      <li>For many years I have used Sebastian Potion #9.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have to use even more product to boost the volume when I style.</li>
      <li>One of the better leave in conditioners that I have tried.</li>
      <li>It handles frizz better than most conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been looking for the perfect conditioner for my hair, and I have finally found it!  </li>
      <li>I just love this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed trying the Toni &amp; Guy products this month</li>
      <li>I wonder how many people buy BOTH</li>
      <li>When I use up this batch, I will purchase more.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell too.</li>
      <li>i love all 3 of there</li>
      <li>I love this products...</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of leave-in products and this ranks toward the top.  </li>
      <li>It is the best conditioner I have ever found, and I will be using it, and only it, from now on!</li>
      <li>amount and I would suggest not using much more than that.  </li>
      <li>It made it very easy to comb through the tangles, and after blow drying, my hair looked really healthy and was easy to manage.</li>
      <li>It made the hair soft and what was really great is that you don&#x27;t need to rinse out the conditioner.</li>
      <li>So, take it easy with the application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, and it&#x27;s easy to brush</li>
      <li>It adds some body and bounce while making hair easy to style.</li>
      <li>So, I would not use this when I am going for the more natural shaggy style, but it makes a good companion to gel or pomade.</li>
      <li>I found the scent to be way too strong.  </li>
      <li>This is ok, nothing special.</li>
      <li>It gives a lovely silky finish but leaves it clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I take my towel off, and my hair is smooth and easily manageable.  </li>
      <li>(I am so glad that I read those reviews first!)</li>
      <li>Makes it feel full and clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>conditioner has a light scent which is not over powering or perfumey.</li>
      <li>This has a nice scent and the wax-like ingredients keep the hair straight and without frizz during the day.  </li>
      <li>, almost like I have used a light gel.  </li>
      <li>Some are fabulous ... and some weigh-down my hair.</li>
      <li>I recently tried Toni &amp; Guy shampoo and conditioner and loved it, so I was excited for the leave</li>
      <li>It has that signature sweet</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>This is a good product to combat the dryness from blow drying and flat</li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too perfumey.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s white, it smells ok, but just ok.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, this particular product gave my hair a polished, healthy look.</li>
      <li>texture is much more smooth than many other leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>You might not have an issue with these things if you have shorter hair that is more uniformly dry, or if you shampoo more often than every 3 days.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine, completely straight hair.  </li>
      <li>I used this several days in a row very lightly on a blow out to smooth fuzzies.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just not great if you like really great smelling hair that is uniformly conditioned in a way that lasts more than a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>I liked this leave in conditioner well enough.</li>
      <li>problem that I have with this product is that it is not any better than most other leave-in-conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Leave-in conditioners are pretty &amp;#34;hit or miss&amp;#34; with me.</li>
      <li>A shame, really!</li>
      <li>She is even telling her cousin, (whose hair gets VERY frizzy), and she rarely recommends hair products to anyone.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant to leave a conditioner in my hair, without rinsing.  </li>
      <li>This might or might not bother you, but you should be aware of it.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>so you may wish to do a patch-test first.</li>
      <li>In Conditioner is exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different leave in conditioners</li>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance reminds of Summer and my hair is left feeling clean, soft, silky shiny and smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
      <li>I go through products pretty often because it is rare to find something that keeps my hair smooth for an entire day.</li>
      <li>(Any more and my hair would have looked flat and greasy).</li>
      <li>My main concern when it comes to leave in conditioners is that I haven&#x27;t found many that work better than regular conditioner in the shower and are therefore an extra burden.</li>

    <li> Just like many products that I&#x27;ve tried, my hair reacts favorably to the first application, then reacts poorly the second time. I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while. I&#x27;m still experimenting so can&#x27;t draw any conclusions yet. Just had to try this conditioner because it has my name on it!</li>
    <li> Nice leave in conditioner.  Has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling grimy.  One of the better leave in conditioners that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of these Toni &amp; Guy products with both good and bad results I would have to say that this is the best, so far, that I have tried on my brown hair. Makes it feel full and clean and refreshing. Love the smell too. The only thing was the bottle itself seemed a little cheap for the product but the product itself was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use again!</li>
    <li> While this product is meant to be used on damp hair, I prefer to use it on dry hair in between shampoos. Just a little bit smoothed over my dry hair helps to control flyaway hair that otherwise refuses to lay flat. Also, since this product has a nice fragrance, smoothing it on in between shampoos just helps my hair smell a bit fresher.</li>
    <li> Toni&amp;Guy Prep Leave in Conditioner is really great! It made the hair soft and what was really great is that you don&#x27;t need to rinse out the conditioner. It&#x27;s really nice and convenient.</li>
    <li> I have used Bed Head&#x27;s Ego Boost, leave in conditioner for over 12 years. Which is/was manufactured by Toni &amp; Guy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hair needs a leave in conditioner for the ends because my hair tends to be dry but I don&#x27;t want to have my roots too oily.  Leave in conditioner is the perfect solution because I have thick, coarse, dry, naturally wavy/curly, virgin hair that I flat iron daily and wash twice weekly. So I need that extra protection that leave in conditioner adds. I recently tried Toni &amp; Guy shampoo and conditioner and loved it, so I was excited for the leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this leave in weighed my hair down and made it feel oily after the first day. I much prefer the Bed Head version. I can&#x27;t recommend this product, but check out the shampoo/conditioner - it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I liked this leave in conditioner well enough. It did help tame the frizz on my curly hair, smelled great and my hair was soft. One thing to remember is not to put in too much. Will make hair clump together and it will be hard to the touch. It says a &amp;#34;walnut sized&amp;#34; amount and I would suggest not using much more than that.  The only thing about this product is my regular leave in conditioner works just as well and is more than half the price. I think I will stick with my usual. Would recommend if you have dry frizzy hair and haven&#x27;t found anything to work for you yet.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  At first I was hesitant to leave a conditioner in my hair, without rinsing.  I thought my hair would be greasy.  Far from it!!  This conditioner seemed to &amp;#34;texturize&amp;#34; my hair.  My hair felt grat and looked thick and healthy.  When I use up this batch, I will purchase more.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent and the wax-like ingredients keep the hair straight and without frizz during the day.  In hot weather, it does wear down hair a bit and you&#x27;ll have a flat style.  The scent is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is a decent leave in conditioner.  For many years I have used Sebastian Potion #9.  I stumbled upon this by accident when traveling for business and I couldn&#x27;t find a salon that had Potion #9 for retail.  I gave this a try and was happy with it for the most part.  It is a little heavy which is good if your hair needs the weight of a thicker conditioner to help manage it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel though.  I still use Potion #9 but this my back up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks after my hair dries from swimming. My main concern when it comes to leave in conditioners is that I haven&#x27;t found many that work better than regular conditioner in the shower and are therefore an extra burden. But this leave in conditioner is in a whole different league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is much more smooth than many other leave in conditioner. The results resemble that of a deep conditioner. It handles frizz better than most conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave in conditioner will give you noticeable results. It does take a little longer to dry in your hair than other leave in conditioners, but the results are far better. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect conditioner for my hair, and I have finally found it!  This conditioner leaves my hair soft, without weighing it down, and keeps the static away!  It&#x27;s easy to use, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair, so it&#x27;s easy for conditioner to weigh it down.  I have tried numerous conditioners, and finally settled on the [[ASIN:B00ADR6M2U OGX Conditioner, Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen, 13oz]] conditioner.  However, it doesn&#x27;t stop the static.  I have a down coat that I wear in the winter, and my hair is a static mess after having it on, which pulls the natural curl out and leaves it flat.  I have been looking for something to eliminate this, and the Toni&amp;Guy conditioner does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use a walnut sized glop.  I&#x27;m not sure who decided that, because you definitely don&#x27;t need that much.  I use more like a pea sized, and it&#x27;s perfect.  I always put my hair up in a towel while I am doing my makeup, therefore, it dries quite a bit by the time I am ready to style it.  With other conditioners, when I take my towel off, I already have frizz.  Not with this one!  I take my towel off, and my hair is smooth and easily manageable.  I love this!!!  It stops the frizz and the static!  It also makes it easier for my hair to hold its natural curl, without me having to fight with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this conditioner.  It is the best conditioner I have ever found, and I will be using it, and only it, from now on!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT LEAVE IN!! I Used it right after using there damaged shampoo &amp; conditioner,..then blow dried my hair!! My hair felt very manageabley soft with no weight to my hair..Plus...this leave in DOESNT FEEL oily..a big PLUS for my caucasian fine hair..I love this products...A BIG THUMBS UP with there shampoo for damaged hair and damaged conditioner!! i love all 3 of there products i bought it from bed bath and beyond.</li>
    <li> From my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, thin, flat, and professionally colored. It is actually very knotty and I usually use a spray detangler after I shampoo and condition. I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner without the additional use of a detangler and it works really well. I have never used a leave in conditioner before, but I&#x27;m actually preferring this to a trational conditioner. It is light weight and smells pleasant. I do not use the recommended walnut size amount, because my hair is thinner and flat. I don&#x27;t want to risk weighing my hair down. Using a smaller amount has not interferred with its effectiveness. This is a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> that being said, my hair has come to no harm. I live on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and while the product has not not helped with the humidity it has also not weighed down my thick curly Irish hair. So while my hair does become frizzy at the end of the day it is still soft. FYI - I tested this after going to my salon to trim all the split ends.</li>
    <li> Helpful for easier hair management</li>
    <li> Leave-in conditioners are pretty &amp;#34;hit or miss&amp;#34; with me. Some are fabulous ... and some weigh-down my hair. After trying several Toni and Guy products, I guess you could say that I am not a fan. They seem overpriced for the overall average effect. Nonetheless, this particular product gave my hair a polished, healthy look. That&#x27;s a positive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by several reviewers, DO use much LESS than is recommended (I am so glad that I read those reviews first!) My hair is perfectly smooth and I used half the recommended amount. (Any more and my hair would have looked flat and greasy). So, take it easy with the application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, it&#x27;s just a basic leave-in (like you would get anywhere). It does not improve hair over time, it merely smooths the cuticle. Additionally, it is not organic/natural so you may wish to do a patch-test first.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have fairly thick, but fine hair and most leave-in products weigh it down or make it look oily. This one doesn&#x27;t. I only used a tiny amount, like a couple of pea sized blobs, and massaged them into my freshly shampooed and tangled hair. It made it very easy to comb through the tangles, and after blow drying, my hair looked really healthy and was easy to manage. It has a very nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t overwhelming and is subtle enough when dry that I don&#x27;t smell it unless I pull a section of hair right up to my nose. This is everything a leave-in conditioner should be. Two thumbs up!  👍 👍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used leave in conditioner for a long time to help keep my fly-aways in place.  I have extremely fine, completely straight hair.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed this conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or greasy.  When my mother, who has very curly hair was talking about trying something to keep her curls from frizzing, I gave her a bottle of this.  She loves it!  First, it doesn&#x27;t weigh her curls down, but she can finger them into a spiral without worrying about adding more things in to hold her curls.  The only issue is that it takes a lot.  The recommended use is a walnut size amount.  That&#x27;s like a half palm full.  So, for my mom (who actually needs the walnut sized amount), this won&#x27;t last very long.  For me, I can get away with using much less because I just don&#x27;t have as much hair.</li>
    <li> I like the Toni&amp;Guy leave-in-conditioner. It makes my hair feel soft and smooth. It also makes it easier to comb through my hair. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with this product is that it is not any better than most other leave-in-conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried. I would not purchase this product at this price. There are plenty of other really good leave-in-conditioners that cost much less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this Toni &amp; Guy Prep Leave-in Conditioner. It seems like a high quality salon type product, but it weighs my hair down. Perhaps I&#x27;m using too much? (Although the directions say a &amp;#34;walnut size amount&amp;#34; and I used less, because a walnut...maybe I&#x27;d use that much mousse, but that much conditioner? I wouldn&#x27;t even use a walnut-sized amount of conditioner in the shower, with the rinse-out kind.) It made my naturally wavy, chin-length bob too soft and hard to style with any body. I&#x27;d have to use even more product to boost the volume when I style. So like I said, not sure how to rate this. Maybe for people with very long hair with very damaged ends, it would be just the thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great conditioner.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to be trying this conditioner around the same time that I tried another of the company&#x27;s products, [[ASIN:B00GJ7WV8M Toni &amp; Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion]].  I noticed that the ingredients are EXACTLY the same.  I can see how a leave-in conditioner could also be used as a smoothing lotion, but selling the same product as two different products seems a little dishonest.  I wonder how many people buy BOTH (and that, of course, is probably T&amp;G&#x27;s objective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it work?  Well, it&#x27;s okay, but not great.  It will make your hair feel softer, and it will smooth it down, but with mineral oil as the second ingredient, it&#x27;s also likely to be too heavy of a product for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of ingredients, this thing is LOADED with parabens (a type of preservative).  This might or might not bother you, but you should be aware of it.  Google it and see what you think.  There has been a lot of consumer demand to remove parabens from products because some studies have indicated that they have estrogen-like properties, and some researchers say there might be a link between parabens and breast cancer.  MIGHT.  Read up on it and you decide how you feel about it.  I don&#x27;t typically get too alarmed about additives, but there are FIVE different kinds of parabens in these conditioners.  This also smacks of some labeling dishonesty; I feel like they used several different kinds to make them appear lower in the list of ingredients (kind of like when a food manufacturer uses sugar, cane syrup, dextrose, and fructose all in the same product so that SUGAR doesn&#x27;t appear as the first ingredient).  I could be wrong, but why would T&amp;G use so many different kinds?  I checked the labels on other conditioners on my shelf (mostly Pantene and Tresemme products), and none of them had ANY parabens.  So why would T&amp;G use FIVE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not a chemist, but I believe there are at least NINE ingredients used in these T&amp;G products that are solely there for the purpose of scenting the product.  And you can tell!  I found the scent to be way too strong.  It wasn&#x27;t a *bad* smell, but it was nothing special, and there was just too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last issue I take with these products is that they seemed to make my hands itch.  I have moderately sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a conditioner make me itchy before.  Some people are allergic to parabens, though, so maybe I&#x27;m one of them.  Or maybe it was one of those nine fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are just far too many drawbacks to these products to recommend them, especially when there are so many other hair products that work better, don&#x27;t have as many questionable ingredients, and are a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> The texture and scent of this conditioner are great.  The scent is particularly good because it is practically absent.  It applies easily and without and strange residue in wet hair, leaving the hair nice and soft without frizzies when it is dry.  However, in my experience the hair kind of sticks where it was dried, almost like I have used a light gel.  This also can make the hair look thinner.  So, I would not use this when I am going for the more natural shaggy style, but it makes a good companion to gel or pomade.</li>
    <li> I really like the way Toni&amp;Guy products smell. It has a clean, fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too perfumey. The leave-in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and not frizzy. The directions say to use a walnut size portion, but that&#x27;s way too much. I&#x27;d say a grape size dollop is probably enough for long hair, and less for short hair. I don&#x27;t use it all over, just on the lower half of my hair where it needs it the most. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, and it&#x27;s easy to brush while wet and style it. This product is perfect for dry, winter weather when my hair usually feels dried out and full of static electricity. It tames my hair and makes it much nicer.</li>
    <li> My straight colored hair only needs a little help with a leave-in conditioner for fly-a-ways and dry ends. I used this after styling my hair, adding a dab. It works fine, but has a scent that is a little too strong for me. Bottom line is that I have found other less expensive ,better smelling products that provide the same results. This is ok, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of leave-in products and this ranks toward the top.  It is a nice consistency that spreads through the hair well.  It made my hair soft and less frizzy.  Spray-in products are easier to use, but this is a good product to comb through and use your hands to distribute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed trying the Toni &amp; Guy products this month and it&#x27;s a brand I will look for and purchase in the future, especially their regular conditioner which is fabulous. This product is a leave in conditioning product that you put on after you wash and condition your hair and before blow drying and styling. It takes a quarter size portion for my hair so a little goes a long way. It adds conditioning and helps my hair deal with harsher treatments of blow drying and flat iron use which can really leave the ends of my hair dead. This is a good product to combat the dryness from blow drying and flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has a light scent which is not over powering or perfumey. I like the idea of the leave in conditioner when my hair has been over worked and it works great to protect hair in between trims to keep the ends looking healthy. It adds some body and bounce while making hair easy to style.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Good effect! Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter has hair like Hermione Granger, but even curlier. In this dry heat, keeping it manageable is always an issue. This product seemed to look really well. I took off one star for the smell, because even though it&#x27;s pleasant, it&#x27;s a bit too strong. She&#x27;ll wear her hat to school for 10 minutes, and at the end of the day the hat smells like it soaked in the conditioner all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that it&#x27;s pricey. However, reduced tangles &#x3D; priceless. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, but I actually feel it does nothing to my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quit difficult to find. I have been using Toni &amp; Guy&#x27;s leave in conditioner for about 3 years now. Which has been going well with my hair and helped me to reduce dandruff and oiliness on my face.</li>
    <li> I have long, flat, not-very-dense hair, and finding the right products is a challenge. I like this whole line from Toni&amp;Guy. It has a sensuous scent, and this leave-in conditioner was just enough for me-- it helped to detangle and defrizz without weighing my hair down any further. I don&#x27;t apply it by the roots, but just throughout the length of my hair, and it improved the look and texture. As others have noted, a walnut-sized amount is excessive; even on my long hair, I used a smaller amount and it was enough.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different leave in conditioners and I must say I like this one the best so far.  Wonderful fragrance reminds of Summer and my hair is left feeling clean, soft, silky shiny and smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  It&#x27;s so hard to find a decent product but when you do you just want to buy up as much as you can so you never run out.  This is one of those products.  I recommend it to all hair types and cuts.</li>
    <li> My hair is softly curly at best and frizzy at worst. I go through products pretty often because it is rare to find something that keeps my hair smooth for an entire day. I need look no further. Toni&amp;Guy Leave In Conditioner is exactly what it says. It conditions my hair and leaves it smooth without an oily sheen that most products leave behind in your hair. I have shoulder length hair and use about a nickel sized amount in my wet hair just prior to blow drying it. This conditioner also eases the way for any styling that is needed. I definitely will be purchasing this product again, especially with its affordable price. It&#x27;s a no brainier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. For Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> My wife always complains about her hair &amp;#34;frizzing.&amp;#34; I told her to give the Toni &amp; Guy Leave in Conditioner a try. Her response was, &amp;#34;nothing works on my hair, you know that.&amp;#34; Well, since nothing she has used before has done much, what could this hurt. Her concern with leave-in conditioners was that it would leave her hair greasy. I think the glimmer of hope got her to try it, and she is thrilled. She is so happy that her hair is now &amp;#34;controllable.&amp;#34; I think she is hooked! No complaints of greasy feeling or anything. She is even telling her cousin, (whose hair gets VERY frizzy), and she rarely recommends hair products to anyone. Good job T &amp; G!</li>
    <li> It might work for some but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this conditioner.  It&#x27;s white, it smells ok, but just ok.  The ingredients aren&#x27;t that great- these days I&#x27;m looking for quality oils and less paraffin in my hair products, which I feel masks unhealthy hair more than fixes it.  Nexxus/Pantene, even Suave make leave in conditioners that work just as well, and the Pantene and some of the Suave professional brands smell a LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;It did leave my hair soft and shiny, but it did feel a bit oily at the roots.  It might work better for others, but for my long, fine, wavy hair, it was a bit heavy at the root and after a couple of days, the ends of my hair began feeling dry and unconditioned.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great if you like really great smelling hair that is uniformly conditioned in a way that lasts more than a couple of days.  You might not have an issue with these things if you have shorter hair that is more uniformly dry, or if you shampoo more often than every 3 days.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner for fried hair. It gives a lovely silky finish but leaves it clean and smooth. It is not tacky or sticky so it doesn&#x27;t encourage tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed. I used this several days in a row very lightly on a blow out to smooth fuzzies. It didn&#x27;t build up or weigh my hair down. It didn&#x27;t look dirty. I just love this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product! I use this instead of conditioner in the shower, and it makes my hair smell so good. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky after you wipe the excess off, which is a plus. A tube lasted me an entire semester at school, so it was definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this stuff. For one, as everyone has commented on already, this stuff is loaded with parabens--which are not good for you! Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this stuff--as all Toni&amp;Guy products do--smells wonderful. It has that signature sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it to be one of the more effective hair products I have used in my wavy curly hair. While living in Iceland, I regularly would swim in the geothermal pools there which are loaded with sulfur (which WRECKS hair of all types). They warn you to wear your hair in a swim cap but if you have long hair, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;d tried a few other conditioners which didn&#x27;t work as well, but T&amp;G was the only one that kept my hair from getting fried by the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, this stuff does work wonders but it comes at the cost of being a potential health risk. I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it around times where my hair is in bad shape and needs a bit more love than usual (before/after bleaching + coloring, namely) but maybe stick to something more natural for normal use. A shame, really!</li>
