<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I will use this from now on.  I am practically bald on top with very dry skin.  I have tried everything and nothing compares to this.  My head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom instead of dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> Given time, product does make hair thicker.Will continue to use. well worth a try</li>
    <li> My husband Jack uses Vita Tress Biotin Creme together with their Biotin Shampoo and Cystine Treatment and it has helped start a lot of new hair growth. Within a few weeks of use I noticed hair starting to return to areas that were almost completely bald. He never wants to use another product and says, \\&quot;I would recommend the use of this product together with the shampoo and treatment to anyone wanting to prevent hair loss and help regain lost hair. It also leaves your hair and scalp feeling   clean, and hair soft and very easy to manage and style.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have very fine and easily damaged hair, and have to be careful about it.  I used Henna to color it since it strengthens it, but it still has a lot of breakage.  This cream really has helped in the problem spots thickening the hair and making it break less.  I&#x27;ve tried the pills, but this gets directly to the problem which is a much better way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a conditioning effect on the hair which helps too.  I&#x27;m considering mixing it in a cream and applying it to the tips to see if it helps with the ends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (combined with the shampoo), and over the last few months, I have noticed that my hair does not look as thin as it has in the past.  It took a while for people to start noticing a difference though.  If you are looking for an over night miracle, this isn&#x27;t it.  But if you are wanting real results and a solution to mother nature&#x27;s evil jokes, I recommend this.  It appears to have stimulated new hair growth, and has made my hair thicker and stronger.  I plan on using these products forever.</li>
    <li> Wife and I both use it for thinning hair.  Not necessarily Rogaine, but we don&#x27;t need that (yet).  Seems to help us have thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with thinning at my part and hairline. I have used this product sparingly, to say the least. Not because it&#x27;s bad, because I&#x27;m lazy. The directions recommend using twice daily and focusing on problem areas. I&#x27;ve never used it twice in one day. I apply it 3-4 times a week, after a shower usually, but sometimes it&#x27;s whenever the mood strikes me. All of this being said... it worked. Period. The &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; areas of my scalp, the ones that practically glowed under moonlight, are no longer blatantly disregarding my self-esteem. I have new growth and my scalp feels good. I&#x27;ve had this product about 3 months and I am very pleased with the results. I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my folks and mom says she really likes it.  My dad uses it and his hair is actually getting more full after using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product helps with thinning hair or hair growth, because I don&#x27;t use it twice a day everyday as the product suggests. The best way I can describe it is VERY thick and when you put it on your roots it is VERY visible and looks like paste (almost like tooth paste) I put it on before I went to bed and slept with a towel over my pillow case, because I didn&#x27;t want it all over, when I woke up it was dry and flakey almost like the worst case of dandruff ever...I don&#x27;t know if I put WAY too much on or what, but it says to massage it into your scalp and I wanted to make sure I got it into my scalp. I use it maybe once a week and ONLY before bed since it is such a process...and the next day is kind of a pain to make sure I get it all out when I wash my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend it, but maybe it would work better on mens hair and is just a mess cause I have LONG thinning hair?</li>
    <li> I bought the 3 step system, and it stripped my hair so bad it felt worse than what it claim to help.  I used my sister&#x27;s Garnier Frutis to bring my hair back to the state it already was.  I just don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!  BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product for my mom she seems to really like it. Though sometimes I use it I can see a small difference in my thin hair that I have its gotten a bit thick. I also love the smell it has (minty). oooo..and not to forget the packaging was good!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I also sell it to my customers, it really works for tinning edges .</li>
    <li> not sure if it helps, too many chemicals in it</li>
    <li> this product is excellent I would recomend it to every one that have a hair thinning problem</li>
    <li> I overplucked my eyebrows and put this on once a day. My eyebrows started growing back after first application. They were only tiny stubbles, but I was impressed.</li>
    <li> I credit Nexxus VitraTress Biotin Creme with saving my hair.Along with Biotin shampoo,these two products deserve the credit for me not being bald.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product for dry scalps</li>
    <li> Not sure if it does my scalp much good but it smells fresh like peppermint and leaves a nice tingle. Can&#x27;t use more than a smidgen or my hair feels a bit gummy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month--and although I cannot swear it is working on my head, it is doing wonders for my eyebrow after only a week.  I was not seeing any improvement YET on my hair edges do I decided to try it on my eyebrow that has been over plucked and I had been trying to grow it back and started using this creme day and night and amazingly enough the hair has grown in quite well.  Not sure if it was overplucking or not but the hair on my left brow was so much thinner than the right and right where the arch of the brow was supposed to be I had no hair and always had to fill it in with a brow pencil---now it has filled it exactly like I wanted.  I will have to start using it on the right to ensure they stay in balance.  Now that I do know it does work I will continue using it on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by the consistency of this creme. It was thick so that makes for an easier application without a runny mess &amp; it absorbs really well. It gives your scalp a nice tingle when you are rubbing it in. I can see a small difference and I will keep using this creme to fill in some thinning areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for people like me with baby-fine hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past twenty years and it has really helped my  hair to look thicker and healthier.  Unfortunately it is no longer carried in many local beauty supply and drug stores in my area. I&#x27;m delighted to be able to purchase it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> The biotin scalp cream really does help my hair to grow back in areas that are thin. I use it once a day and within 2 weeks I could see a difference. This is the only product that I have ever used that actually did help the hair to grow back.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It seems to be working for me.  I am going to order another tube so I can continue with it.  Hope it works for others too.  It is a great product for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is interesting.  It hasn&#x27;t done much for growing my hair, but it does grow my eyelashes (smile).  I know.  Peculiar, but it&#x27;s not out of the realm of possibility.  Therfore, it gets the 4 stars because I have very short lashes, but this cream has changed that.</li>
    <li> Good for scalp - works well.  Doesn&#x27;t mess up your hair like other biotin scalp products from other companies.</li>
    <li> Nexus is a good brand, and I loved the vitatress shampoo so much I decided to try this scalp creme. However, it says use twice daily for best results. I don&#x27;t think I can use this during the day as it makes my hair look a bit greasy and there is a menthol smell which, though not unpleasant, I would not like to wear to work. So I just use this at night but will not reorder. Will go back to Pantene.</li>
    <li> I tried this product due to all the 5 star reviews. I love Nexxus products. Nexxus products are always top quality but as far as stopping hair thinning I found no difference after a year of use along with shampoo..</li>
    <li> I love this scalp creme.  I use it inbetween washes.  It soothes the scalp and calms it down when my hair scalp starts feeling itchy.  The only time I seem to go through having an itchy scalp is after my hair has been colored.  This helps a lot.  This is my second time ordering.  It also seems to be helping with a thinning area of my scalp.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference it just leaves my hair a bit oily.</li>
    <li> Works great for scalp conditions, helps with itching and more.</li>
    <li> my sister  loved this more than I did,  so she took it ,made her hair smooth and tangle free</li>
    <li> Waiting to see if there is any change in hair thickness.</li>
    <li> Wife is loosing much less hair and her hair is noticeably fuller.  She is using this and the Nexxus Vitatress shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am going to try this product but thought I&#x27;d mention that eggs are very high in biotin which might be another idea to add to your other efforts.  I have had slow, constant hair loss for 30 years due to CFS and when I went vegetarian (for heart health) a year ago, a few months later, my hair loss increased more than normal.  But lately, I&#x27;ve added an egg to my diet ever couple of days, and this has lessened my hair loss. Biotin pills do not agree with me so this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> This product helps thinning hair to grow healthier.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything else on the market that even comes close.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very healing for hair...heals all hair illness.  Cures dryness, redness from coloring. Wonderful for scalp stimulation for more blood circulation which draws vitamins to hair roots for rapid hair growth.</li>
    <li> I like this scalp creme, it seems to be improving my scalp condition and it has a pleasant smell, however, it does leave your hair rather oily. I would recommend using this product at night so you can wash your hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> Left my hair really heavy &amp; greasy looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scalp cream for 4 or 5 years now, and my hair sheds very, very little, whereas it used to shed a lot. I like the way this cream gives my hair body and hold, and leaves it feeling \\&quot;anti-slippery.\\&quot;  (I hate products that leave my hair feeling \\&quot;slippery\\&quot;.)  Be aware that this cream is not for adding moisture, nor does it have conditioning properties.  It is exactly what the name states: a scalp cream for the purpose of diminishing hair loss.  I find that it works nicely for me.</li>
    <li> it is OK if you plan to wash your hair immediately after application.  Like using LARD!!!!  It&#x27;s a mess....a bad news pdt</li>
    <li> Nexxus the best product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Honestly I only used it for about 1 mth.  I didn&#x27;t like how it felt once I put onto my scalp and hair. Although I disliked it, I continued to use it hoping for results, but did not see any like some that have stated (within 2wks).  Anyhow, I will not purchase again.  I am trying the black castor oil instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scalp treatment for about 3 weeks. I use it faithfully, every morning &amp; night. I am using this with the Nexxus biotin shampoo, which I love. This feels tingly on the scalp as it must contains some tea tree. I do not see any change with this product. I will try something different next time. For the price it was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, if you need to grow hair back this is the right thing for you. This cream sends a tingly feeling on your scalp and can grow your edges in and anywhere else where you are having balding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a more astounding product such as this. I looked high &amp; low for Nexxus&#x27; products and in Wilson, N.C. they&#x27;re very hard to find. Thank God for Amazon!  I finally found my favorite hair products, Nexxus!!!</li>
    <li> I use it morning and evening. It&#x27;s my favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; cream when experiencing thinning or damage. I&#x27;m only using it on the crown of my head. I&#x27;m beginning to thin in that area. The minty cream spreads on nicely.* Make certain it is massaged on the scalp and not on the hair for best results. I use a drop of olive oil on the roots to tip to moisturize my hair.  I used it 20 years ago on a little spot at the base of my head and it helped hair grow in that spot. It still works! (Transitioned Natural, dry hair, 4B)</li>
    <li> very hard to spread on the scalp (which is what the directions say) if your hair is just starting to thin and has a smell that isn&#x27;t necessarily bad but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant</li>
    <li> This product is what I expected along with the right quantity!  I will refer this to a friend. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Scalp Cream repaired the dry scalp,split end and i felt a tingling sensation my scalp felt vibrant and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister keeps smelling and telling me how clean and fresh my hair smells, she can not believe the drastic change my hair has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if anyone at their wits end, your hair will love you fro the treatment.</li>
    <li> I like the way it slightly tingles, not much but you can feel it working.i will definitely&lt;br /&gt;will be reordering this scalp creme.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality cream that does not get the hair greasy while moisturizing the scalp.  Very nice mint essence is soothing.</li>
    <li> Opens the pores of your head for healthy breathing. You gotta try this product you will really love it, I know I do.</li>
    <li> The tube is small, making this product rather expensive. Fortunately, a little of this stuff goes a long way, especially if you have short, thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon also slabs a big sticker directly on the tube itself, which is hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, however, is very nice. It feels good, smells good, and makes my hair softer. (I don&#x27;t know if it helps block DHT or not, however.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-star deduction only for the high price.</li>
    <li> Horrible like a applying a bottle of hair gel. leaves hair concrete hard and greasy not recommended. stay away from it</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product.  But it takes time to work.  I am also taking Biotin supplements, and I am beginning to see an improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> I only use this one time a week after I wash my hair and blow dry it.  Then I put this on my scalp at the top I have used it one time so fine it is fine.  I will do a update on the item after I use it for a month.  Right now I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> These profucts are the best ever for thinning hair.in a very shirt time you will see results taking pkace.  It&#x27;s not an overnight cure, but with some patience and continuous use, your hair will  look and feel better, shinier and stronger thsn it has in a whike</li>
    <li> not sure, too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this product would help me with my thinning hair. However, I noticed that my bald spots got bigger!! Will not buy again...</li>
    <li> It did not seem to show that  much of a difference with my hair and I used it as stated...</li>
    <li> I have very dry, coarse hair, so imagine my shock when after just 1 use, my hair was turned into a major greaseball!  I followed all the instructions on the package, I used only a small amount, and yet, it took two hair washes to clean up my hair from this product&#x27;s gunk!  So no, I won&#x27;t use it ever again. On the other hand, the Biotin shampoo felt very nice.</li>
    <li> No good on African American hair</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  i like that I can apply it to my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  I am using it to treat hair loss and will re-assess after treating my scalp for a few months.  I only wish I could have this product shipped directly to me in Canada instead of having to use a mail delivery postal address across the lines.</li>
    <li> I love the tingly feeling on your scalp.  It also made my dry hair softer.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few years ago and used it off and on.this is my second time ordering this.it does work but not over night.to grow hair it will take at least six months to two years.I massage the  areas of scalp  where the hair is thin.I wash my hair once a week.you can use this product whenever you want to.you can leave it in or wash it out.you can not go wrong with any nexxus products.they are made for all types of hair.please be patient.use a small amount in the areas of the scalp where the hair is thin.one tube should last you at least one year,so don&#x27;t be heavy handed with this product.you can also use other products with this.</li>
    <li> To use this along with the shampoo is important. They are a step 1 then 2. One works better with the other.</li>
    <li> I am trying to grow my hair out, especially in the front.  I find this product to be smelly and messy, but my hair is growing.  I also use a special shampoo and vitamins so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this or not.  But either way my hair is growing very quickly.</li>
    <li> Increase fullness of hair especially in thinning and trouble areas of the hair. Biotin works to increase faster hair growth.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-VitaTress-Biotin-Scalp-Creme/dp/B000JR59LY/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_hpc_text_b  I just bought the type of Nexxus scalp cream like the one in the link above from 2 different vendor here. Which I was told by NEXXUS that(the product picture in the link above) is what their current product should look like.   But the other store send me scalp cream with a white cap, instead of purple.  Also the Logo/Word \\&quot;Nexxus\\&quot; looks  different... like the picture in the link below.  http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Biotin-Scalp-Creme-Pack/dp/B004V50HJE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_9  I will mention the name of the seller if I found out is to be fake or expired product and when I feel is necessary to do so.  Currently I am waiting for a response from the seller I bought the scalp cream with white cap and have the same Nexxus logo in the 2nd link.  I hope someone will tell me why \\&quot;Nexxus\\&quot; is different between the two and if there is anyway to tell if it is OLD product from the past(which according to Nexxus that they been using purple cap since ~2 years ago and they told me they only sell to saloons)</li>
    <li> a hard to find item in the salons and stores. happy to have been able to locate it here. good price.&lt;br /&gt;will be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s going to take a longer time to use the product to actually see results.m</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, it had so many positive recommendations but the truth is for me it doesnt do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, I rub it in and bald spots are still bald.  In some cases this gives me a headache.  Not much more to say, it just doesnt work as anything other than to grease the hair.  It will not grow in bald spots.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;m using this product to help with thinning hair edges.  It works.  My sister is using the Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Scalp Creme and have seen results as well.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s just waste of money. I tried it for my scalp no results at all. Tried it for my eye browns to get thicker eye brows no results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where all these glowing reviews are coming from unless it&#x27;s the \\&quot;placebo effect\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months now COMBINED with the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo, and I have seen absolutely no change in my hair.  This stuff is an overpriced joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this stuff at all and I am done with Nexxus products.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product! I have never experienced anything work so fast on my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from a chronic hair fall, which had worsened over the past few weeks. My hair had become brittle, dull and had started to split at ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been less than a week since i started using this creme on my hair, and the texture has visibly improved! my hairfall is starting to reduce a bit, but I am amazed at how fast this worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit of trouble to get it delivered - the seller was out of stock and it took me around 2 weeks to procure it. I was about to give up and cancel my order, but was lazy to do so:) I am so glad i did not cancel it and waited to get it delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its simple to apply, you just take a little quantity on your finger and massage it into the scalp. I part my hair in the center and start applying and then keep taking a little bit of it, parting one line at a time, till I have my full scalp covered. you need to use the right quantity - it can get pasty otherwise. I suggest that you use a heavier quantity at night - if you plan to wash your hair the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying it twice a day so far, with a heavier doses over the weekend if I dont plan to go out anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage of this product is that when you take edible biotin supplements - it increases hair growth all over your body. Since this creme gets directly applied to your scalp - you dont get excessive hair growth on other areas. Also, its quite thick, so it doesn&#x27;t drip over your face like liquid biotin does. Nobody wants the excess facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downsides:&lt;br /&gt;- it smells like tooth paste. But the smell goes after a while. Just to be safe - do not put it if you plan to be out on a date! I am sure you dont want your hair to smell like toothpaste when getting intimate with someone&lt;br /&gt;- dont put extra quantity or it might become flaky and look like you have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having saidthat, these are just very minor downsides to a fantastic product. it is a must buy if you want instant improvement in your hair texture.I absolutely LOVE this creme!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000JR59LY Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Scalp Creme 2.1 oz.]]</li>
    <li> honestly I can not give a good rating because I have not used it enough to really see results...so I will give a better result next month.</li>
    <li> Great product! It definitely packs a powerful punch, you can literally feel the tingling and refreshing feeling it brings to your scalp. While this is a great product, you definitely want to be careful to use lightly and NOT use too much of this product at one time, as it CAN and WILL make your hair feel temporarily a bit \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; and a bit \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; for lack of a better word but ONLY if you use too much of the product at one time. Nonetheless, I have purchased this product a number of times over the past 2 years and really like it.</li>
    <li> lasts a long time, well worth the money</li>
    <li> My wife is been using it for years... It has helped her.</li>
    <li> Terrible product for my hair. Did not like it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month, every day twice a day.  I use it once in the morning after I get out of the shower and once an hour or so before bed.  I have literally seen ZERO results from this product.  I read all these amazing reviews but they have to be paid for.  I am not going bald, but I definitely have some thinning and thought this product ALONG with the Natrol Biotin 10,000mcg tablets would help with thickening of my hair.  I have seen nothing at all but having a pasty head and hair after applying.  I could tell with the pastiness if I was getting results but its not doing a dang thing.  Stinks cause I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son.  After using 2 tubes there was no difference in his hair.</li>
    <li> Gives a great boost of volume!</li>
    <li> This seems to thicken my hair. I do not like it is a bit clumpy. I do feel  when rinsed out my hair is shinier and feels fuller after a few weeks of regular use.</li>
    <li> I am still unsure about this product.  This is the second time I am buying it, hoping to see results but still not much change in my hair line.  A little goes a long way though, so be careful with usage.  It does feel and smell great but still waiting to see results after two months.  Will try one more.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt and as I said it feels great on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been using this product long so I am not sure if it works or not? I will leave another review after I&#x27;ve used it a little longer.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more this week.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I see new growth, where I had thinning hair.  Not certain if I am seeing things. But, I am not losing hair either.  I used it on and off for 5 to 10 days.  stay tune. More to follow.</li>
    <li> Part of an overall treatment with Biotin tabs, was able to get hair back in 28 months.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itch and turn red.  In its defense, I have sensitive skin.  Gave it to a coworker.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to do my hair a favor and I recently tried Nexxus products and I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t tried them sooner. This particular hair Biotin Scalp cream has strengthened my hair in places where it had begun thinning. I noticed the difference in less than one week.</li>
    <li> will always use this product.  cannot live without it.  makes hair feel good and keeps its thickness.  will always use and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will need to use it for a bit longer before I can tell if it is really helping my hair.</li>
    <li> Works with sustained use</li>
    <li> I bought this product as well as the shampoo. I like this product both in texture and application. I have tried a few other products that were messy and something that would have to be used the rest of my life if I actually saw results. My hopes are that the Nexxus products are a right fit for me.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning where I used my hot iron too much. I saw a difference in the hair growth shortly after using the cream. I will continue to use it as directed to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I use other Nexxus products.This compact size is easy to carry or just place around just about anywhere. The cream has a unique smell, but not over powering.  Actually I like this smell. It goes on and disappears quickly into the scalp. It does leave some surface traces but not a greasy kind. I believe this could be an excellent and easy way to replenish your scalp. Hopefully it will help the growing process. If I see indications that this works- I will surely buy many more tubes and use regularly. I supplement this with Argon certified oil. Time will tell if this helps.</li>
    <li> been using this product for many many years, it has always been my favorite and completely satisfied. have tried other creams but always return to this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference on my scalp. I am loosing my hair like crazy, so it was nice to try. I did like the sensation on your scalp, like a mint for your head. :)</li>
    <li> I received the order in a tmely manner and I loved the creme. It works. Seems to work best with the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo also.</li>
    <li> Recently dealing with hair loss and this creme really soothes the scalp.  After washing my hair with Vitatress Biotin Shampoo which I also love.  I put this on my scalp and leave it in until my next wash.  It feels cool to the scalp almost like it&#x27;s medicating it :)  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. But having problem reading the date</li>
    <li> You have to be consistent with the use. It works. It&#x27;s worth the money you spend on it. Help with hair growth too.</li>
    <li> I use oral biotin daily along with a biotin shampoo 3 times a week which have demonstrated good results.  However, in using this product I didn&#x27;t see any benefit at all and it left my hair feeling greasy in the area of use.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for thinning hair and used it as informed.....twice a day.  I have been using this for several weeks and do not see any improvement in hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love it this does what it says it it has a tingling sensation smells like peppermint it, I work out so when my hair is wet I use this on my scalp and edged and brush it put on my scarf next day it look like I got a perm don&#x27;t use to much if you do it will look like dandruff when it&#x27;s dries</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t see where contain biotin. The product get flakes in my hair and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
    <li> I use this as a conditioner. Although I do not leave in as stated in the description. I rinse it out a little and still works great.</li>
    <li> Brought it for a friend, she told me it&#x27;s not working :(  I would not buy it again. Her hair is still falling.</li>
    <li> the nexxuss vitatress shampoo is full size, however this is only trial size good for 2-3 uses.  And don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you only need a little bit... the shampoo leaves your hair very dry so it soaps up any moisture it can get.  R I P O F F !</li>
    <li> It does not work!!! I didn&#x27;t see any difference. It is pricy for the quality and size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I really se no benefit at all. It just promise what it doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> it seems to make a difference in how my hair looks.  healthier, thicker.  have tried other products, but like this the best so far</li>
    <li> This is a must have when using the shampoo . It helps to detangle your hair and make it soft and manageable .Just remember  a little dab will go a long way.. Maxine</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of my hair after my accident, not sure it is was the medications or just the stress, but I really think my hair is growing back.</li>
    <li> too strong of a smell, very chemically smell, if you are sensitive to smells and chemicals this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I really like the tingling feeling.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day for the last six  months along with # 1 and # 3 but I see absolutely no progress.</li>
    <li> I like this and it seems to be helping my scalp. When you put it on it is a bit tingly but that only lasts a few mins and then you forget about it as it goes away.</li>
    <li> Got it within a couple of days and used it as soon as I got it. I apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the night. It has a mint smell so it doesn&#x27;t smell funny. It&#x27;s helping my hair along with shampoo to restore it back to normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with 5 stars since I see it has high reviews but I am not sure if it will work for me. I am hoping it does. I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon but got it from my local beauty supply. The tube is so tiny. I wish it could be at least 4.5 OZ or even 8. Well, I guess a little goes a long way huh?</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I am taking several different medications some of which have the side effect of hair loss. I didn&#x27;t want to take anymore pills so I decided to try this creme. Although, some reviewers have state that it doesn&#x27;t work.. I can say that it does but requires patience. I have been using this for several weeks as instructed and the hair in my thin area is starting to fill in and grow back.  I will continue to use as I&#x27;m sure consistent use will continue to provide results.  If buying this product please realize that it is not a quick solution it will probably take some time before you see results</li>
    <li> This scalp creme keeps my scalp from peeling or having a rash.  It is easy to use and smells good.</li>
    <li> I take both biotin internally and used this only for just for 2 weeks felt a funny sensation in my head so I stopped taking both products. So I cannot give a true review.</li>
    <li> I like the way my scalp feels with this crème - smells a little medicine-y but my scalp was a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> Excellent - fast shipping, great price, item as described. Will visit again.</li>
    <li> It met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It stimulates my scalp and relieves the dryness and itchiness. Very soothing and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product. The price was great and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
    <li> This creme was recommended to me by a beautician when I was losing hair due to stress.  I was told to use this creme and don&#x27;t wash out until the next day.  It takes time but all my bald areas filled in completely you would have never known I was balding due to stress.  This is a great product I would recommend to everyone meaning ladies... that has been stressed or wear your hair to tight.</li>
    <li> nice , feeling fresh , does what it says : when i use it , no hair fall ... when not .. it falls . that&#x27;s it , so u have to use it at least once each 2 days .</li>
    <li> I just started using this about 3 weeks ago, with Biotin shampoo from Nexxus. I&#x27;m willing to wait and see if it does what it claims to be able to do. Otherwise, I love that it has no other effects on my hair. It doens&#x27;t dry them out, doesn&#x27;t make the greesy and doesn&#x27;t stink. It does have a light scent. It also makes my scalp feel tingly (My favorite part). I hope I&#x27;ll come back to write another review saying \\&quot;I have more hair now.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I like the smell and texture of this product.  It absorbs quickly and the mild warming sensation fades rapidly, allowing me to add leave in conditioner in a matter of minutes.  Time will tell if it works, but will re-order.</li>
    <li> Nice cream for the scalp, especially those balding areas. I normally have those dry scalp that looks like dandruff but after using this daily, it tried to moisturize the scalp and helps keep the nice cool feeling. The cream is white but will eventually disappear and does not leave the oily effect.</li>
