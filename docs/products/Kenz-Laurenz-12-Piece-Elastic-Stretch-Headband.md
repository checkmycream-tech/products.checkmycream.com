<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would definitely order these again!  They came quickly and were great for our Volley for the Cure game!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a spa party for a group of 9 year old girls. They were not very stretchy and did not fit all girls.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and love the matrerial. Only if youo have a large head they are alittle small.  But not unbarable. Eap. enjoy the colors.</li>
    <li> Really good headbands. The black ones are a little too tight for my head and the white ones are a little looser. But the tye dye are the nicest in terms of fabric quality and stretchability. I would definitely recommend the tye dye for how much stretchier and softer they are.</li>
    <li> The customer service is excellent.  The company responds to emails right away. THAT BEING SAID. I found the bands to be tight for my size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;head. It is more suited for kids.  The colors were very pretty though.</li>
    <li> These are perfect &amp; came so quickly!!! I&#x27;m impressed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Our granddaughters each received 6 of these.  They loved the colors and were happy with their gift at Easter.</li>
    <li> Great customer service, very fast delivery, and great product. I wear headbands most days because I live in Phoenix which is about 1/2 mile from the sun. I love having so many colors!</li>
    <li> The price is great and the headbands are great quality!  I love that you can choose what color/pattern you would like!</li>
    <li> I got all twelve with all the colors I wanted, the feel of them is really comfy and they fit good, and they came fast then I expected .I will definitely order from y&#x27;all again thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife says she loves them.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service emailed me to ask what colors great product I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> Great headbands, great communication from seller and very fast shipping! ! Highly recommend! !</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a whim because they were such a great price &amp; I&#x27;m so happy I did. I have a hard time finding headbands that will actually stay on my head &amp; these are perfect. I wear them all the time now. I also picked my colors &amp; got exactly what I asked for. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more in different colors.</li>
    <li> Kenz Laurenz offer only the best designs for their bandannas I love how they offer variety and color to make any hair style stand out on any day</li>
    <li> great colors, fits well on my daughter that uses it for softball. :)</li>
    <li> I got these for my volleyball team and my mother-in-law embroidered the girls&#x27; names and a volleyball on each one.  The headbands held up well with the embroidery and the girls loved them!  Plus each girl got their favorite color since I could pick the colors I wanted!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she LOVES them!  They are fashionable and do a great job of keeping her hair out of her face. The fact you get to choose which 12 colors/designs you want a great perk!  The seller did a great job communicating with me via email and they arrived within 3 days of me placing the order!  I will for sure be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> My 12 yo daughter loves these, and especially that we could pick the colors she wanted.  They stay in her thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, good quality, just as advertised and just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> The best part about these headbands was that my daughter got to personally pick out each one from many options.  She rcvd the exact ones that she chose (which looked exaclty like the pictures), and she is very happy with them.  Also, you couldn&#x27;t beat the price either, for how many she rcvd.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands!!!&lt;br /&gt;They are tight, and don&#x27;t slide up your head throughout the day. Plus not many people have these, so that&#x27;s always cool!</li>
    <li> I actually bought these to try and use for ponytail holders. They&#x27;re just too big and not stretchy enough for that, but it&#x27;s not their fault. They are great quality, plenty wide, which I would like if I wore headbands, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be too tight. They give you BOOKOOS of colors to choose from!! The company contacts you personally asking for your color choices and LISTS EVERY SINGLE ONE to choose from!!! How&#x27;s that for service??!!!!! They give big stars from me!!!!</li>
    <li> So many colors to choose from, and I received exactly what I asked for.  Will definitely be ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> Love the colour options.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal and product!</li>
    <li> These headbands works great and shipped very quickly!  Loved them so much, I just ordered more!</li>
    <li> I tried picking my colors and was unable to choose any.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, got just the colors i picked!</li>
    <li> Perfect, did not mess up the colors i wanted, got them very quick and they are great quality! loooooove these</li>
    <li> These were for my wife and she loves them. Great bargain and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Your directions were not clear</li>
    <li> Wonderful seller!Wonderful concept:)&lt;br /&gt;Once I placed the order,the seller contacted me by E-mail with in like 15 minutes and gave me a huuge variety to select my hairbands from!&lt;br /&gt;I had to choose 12 colors out of like 30,I sent my selection by email,seller confirmed it and here we are:)&lt;br /&gt;I got the item almost with in 36 hours delivered!AND THIS WAS NOT OFFERED ON PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;The colors are so nice and so many,almost 1 USD per headband!&lt;br /&gt;The concept of choosing your own colors in such a deal is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Yay:)&lt;br /&gt;Will order from the seller again:)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars,very happy:)&lt;br /&gt;-#Girlboss</li>
    <li> The customer service was PHENOMENAL and each one of these headbands is individually wrapped! The width is perfect (not too wide or narrow), and the colors are really vibrant and pretty. It&#x27;s rare to have any product or company exceed your best expectations, but this one does.</li>
    <li> Great headbands for the price! You can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Bright colors. love them</li>
    <li> Great headbands and customer service. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping, great customer service. Sent me exactly what I asked for. The headbands seem to be good quality, and the colors are very true to picture. I use these for crossfit, and they work great and don&#x27;t slide off. They also fit my toddler and big kid, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth out of this!</li>
    <li> Cute headbands. ..lots of colors and patterns to choose from.  The material is nice and soft for younger girls but still keeps hair out of their face.</li>
    <li> Fine for what I needed. Price very reasonable. Fine for adult with small head.</li>
    <li> I sent an email to the seller in regards to which ones I wanted, I received exactly what I wanted. Good vibrant colors. Unfortunately, several of the bands arrived with a hole at the seam. Within wearing them a few times, all of them had holes at the seams. I easily  fixed them with hot glue. Yes they required  some repairs but I would still buy them since you get so many for a low price and the fix for the defect is rather easy</li>
    <li> Great headbands, great price!</li>
    <li> I loved the headbands. I found it a bit difficult to order the color I wanted but I would order from this place time and again. Hopefully I will be able to order from him again as I embroider headbands and need the headbands from somewhere.</li>
    <li> Brilliant colors, but sized for children, not adults</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter for her birthday and she just love them. I chose your &amp;#34;Best Selection&amp;#34; and my daughter love the different colors. They was deliver when you said it would. I would use you again and commend to a friend. Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamela</li>
    <li> I own an embroidery business. During the summer we live our headbands and so do my clients. They are thick, great quality, and we just can&#x27;t get enough!! We only purchase from them now.

    <li> I ordered 12 and got every color of the rainbow PLUS, and a cheetah print and a tie dye. I love them simply because I wear head bands to keep my hair out of my face. They are tight at first but they stretch out  to a comfortable fit quickly. You cannot beat the price ANYWHERE!  I got an email to pick my colors and designs shortly after placing my order..</li>
    <li> great and inexpensive</li>
    <li> Nice headbands. Great color choices. Me and my girls love them!</li>
