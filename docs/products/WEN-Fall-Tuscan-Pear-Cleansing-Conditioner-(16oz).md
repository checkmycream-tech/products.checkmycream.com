      <li>Amazing Scent - Love all the Wen products, but I think this is my favorite.</li>

      <li>I would hided  it under a stylish hat or up in bun to hide the damage.  </li>
      <li>I Love all the Wen Cleansing conditioners, this one is not my favorite</li>
      <li>but I still love it and love the smell</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>I love this product... Have been using Wen for 3 years now</li>
      <li>I just love WEN products.</li>
      <li>I love WEN shampoo and it is all I use on my hair.  </li>
      <li>The Fall Tuscan Pear is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>the one has a stronger smell than the rest but is quite refreshing in the fall :)</li>
      <li>Love this seasonal cleansing conditioner, leaves my hair full of volume and manageable! :)</li>
      <li>The creamier feel of this particular formulation surprisingly straightens my wavy hair a bit--which I consider a plus.  </li>
      <li>Clean with a mild fruit scent.</li>
      <li>It seems to work fairly well leaving my hair nice and manageable, but not spectacular.  </li>

      <li>Love the new Fall Tuscan Pear.</li>
      <li>Smells so wonderful and works well for my super fine thin hair!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t categorize this as a fall scent, but rather a spring scent because it&#x27;s crisp and sweet.</li>
      <li>I normally use WEN, this did a nice job but the scent is very, very soft...</li>
      <li>Thanks Chaz!</li>
      <li>The lack of lather is definitely weird, but won&#x27;t matter if it leave a clean scalp and beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great when you use it, but loses the scent very quickly (even as you dry your hair).  </li>
      <li>how much easier this consistency is to spread in my hair...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also more creamy than some of my other Wen products (cucumber aloe and fig).</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair (but a lot of it)</li>
      <li>To thick, silky healthy hair.</li>
      <li>I really like how it cleans my hair, leaves it soft - but not greasy like some of the other WEN products.  </li>
      <li>While the initial scent is definitely a fresh, crisp pear perfume, there is a slight after-smell of something that hints of wet sand.  </li>

    <li> This is a great scent!  I really like how it cleans my hair, leaves it soft - but not greasy like some of the other WEN products.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> All WEN is very good, best thing for your hair in the market</li>
    <li> It made my hair smell good  and strong</li>
    <li> Amazing Scent - Love all the Wen products, but I think this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this product... Have been using Wen for 3 years now and this scent gets my hair even softer.  It is. a bit easier to use and a slightly creamier consistency... Leaves hair smelling great too!!  I feel like I don&#x27;t have to use quite as much due to how much easier this consistency is to spread in my hair... Highly recommend for Wen lovers :)</li>
    <li> I Love all the Wen Cleansing conditioners, this one is not my favorite but I still love it and love the smell just wish the smell stayed in my hair longer like some of the other Wens.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for my frizzy curly hair!</li>
    <li> I just love WEN products. I start using WEN about a year ago for my severely damage  hair. I was so embarrassed by my hair I would hided  it under a stylish hat or up in bun to hide the damage.  My hair went form thinning, broken  with dry damaged ends. To thick, silky healthy hair. I LOVE LOVE The Tuscan  Pears scent. It smells  like warm baked pears. I find the only thing that works on my hair is WEN. I AM ONE HAPPY  GIRL WHO NOW LOVES HER HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> I love WEN shampoo and it is all I use on my hair.  I have noticed that my hair is healthier and shinier.  The Fall Tuscan Pear is one of my favorite scents.  It works extra well on my hair type which is thin and highlighted.</li>
    <li> the one has a stronger smell than the rest but is quite refreshing in the fall :)</li>
    <li> I understand that traditional shampoos that lather up are not good for you however, the amount of WEN I have to pump into my hand to cover my scalp makes this product cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> I only use Wen products. I love my hair. Thanks Chaz!</li>
    <li> I normally use WEN, this did a nice job but the scent is very, very soft...it was hard for me to catch the aroma.</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently along with some other scents. I wouldn&#x27;t categorize this as a fall scent, but rather a spring scent because it&#x27;s crisp and sweet. It definitely smells like pears. It&#x27;s also more creamy than some of my other Wen products (cucumber aloe and fig).</li>
    <li> From the wife - I absolutely love the smell of this one!  Clean with a mild fruit scent. Love Wen all together!!!</li>
    <li> Fall Tuscan Pear Cleansing conditioner deserves a 4-star rating.  While the initial scent is definitely a fresh, crisp pear perfume, there is a slight after-smell of something that hints of wet sand.  Mercifully, that smell dissipates in a few hours.  The creamier feel of this particular formulation surprisingly straightens my wavy hair a bit--which I consider a plus.  While I would consider reordering Tuscan Fall Pear, because of the earthy overtones I would not give it a rave notice.</li>
    <li> Love the new Fall Tuscan Pear. The Wen cleansing conditioners never disappoint!</li>
    <li> Love this seasonal cleansing conditioner, leaves my hair full of volume and manageable! :)</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair (but a lot of it) and this product is very interesting to try.  It smells great when you use it, but loses the scent very quickly (even as you dry your hair).  It seems to work fairly well leaving my hair nice and manageable, but not spectacular.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, yet, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes.  The lack of lather is definitely weird, but won&#x27;t matter if it leave a clean scalp and beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Smells so wonderful and works well for my super fine thin hair! I love most ALL WEN products, and can see great improvements from using them! Styling products have to be used sparingly on thin hair. FYI.</li>
    <li> Love Wen. !  Love this fragrance !</li>
