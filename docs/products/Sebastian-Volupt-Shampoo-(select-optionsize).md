<li> A little goes a long, long way.</li>

<li> To me, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> I typically use Garnier Fall Fight for about a tenth of the cost of this shampoo</li>
<li> When they were gone I ordered it from a seller on Amazon and it was delivered  in a few days.</li>
<li> i have purchased quite a few sebastian products in the past and while i am pleased with the volumizing aspect of this shampoo, it smells terrible!  </li>
<li> I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
<li> Very hard to find in the retail market at store level,</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re desperate for some volume, you may want to try this.</li>
<li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo for my fine, fly-away hair. I was skeptical at first, but it really has made a difference. My hair is more manageable and has more volume at the roots. And it smells nice!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It also does give my hair great volume.  When I run out I plan on ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo for fine and/or thin hair.  It really does give lots of volume and body as the name implies.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> I love the Volupt Spray, but I was hesitant to buy the Volupt Shampoo.  I am so glad I did! After reading the reviews, I did buy it and I simply love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking now of buying the conditioner too!  This shampoo is wonderful, it leaves my hair with volume and body!  Usually I can&#x27;t use creamy shampoos because they are too greasy in my hair and weigh it down too much. My hair is fine and I shampoo every day.  I love this one, it is the only one I&#x27;ve found like it that does what it says it will do!  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Sebastion products always meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was given some samples of this shampoo and really liked it. When they were gone I ordered it from a seller on Amazon and it was delivered  in a few days. I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Best I have found for the cost. Thanks to Amazon for making it easy to buy. Very hard to find in the retail market at store level,</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! The glow was instantly! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and i was surprised about the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Volupt Spray occasionally for about 6 months now, so when I ran out of shampoo I decided to try the Volupt line.  I see and feel absolutely no difference after blow-drying with this combo of shampoo/conditioner/Volupt Spray, than I used to see with Redken All Soft/no conditioner/Volupt Spray.  I&#x27;ll keep using it, since I&#x27;m out of All Soft, but...it&#x27;s not a repeat purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times and it works very well for me. I have had difficulty locating a local source recently.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. Made my hair nice and soft and gave it a lot of shine. Great price but delivery took a little longer than expected. I love Sebastian products!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all....dried my hair out completely....</li>
    <li> this product was used in the salon I frequent. It really does make fine hair easier to work with and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I continue to think it is the best I have tried for fine hair</li>
    <li> i have purchased quite a few sebastian products in the past and while i am pleased with the volumizing aspect of this shampoo, it smells terrible!  it makes me want to throw the entire bottle away.  has anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> I typically use Garnier Fall Fight for about a tenth of the cost of this shampoo and I have to say, I do believe the Garnier is better. This volumized my hair just a little more than Garnier, but with a dried out side-effect that I do not get from Garnier. To me, it&#x27;s not worth it. I would rather have nice shiny hair with a minimal amount of volume than to have dried out, damaged-feeling hair with more volume. I could hardly brush out my hair after I used this and my straightener would not glide through my hair smoothly the next morning. If you&#x27;re desperate for some volume, you may want to try this. If you just need a little lift, try the Garnier or something that has some healthy qualities to it that doesn&#x27;t rape your wallet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type shampoo for years, because I am always pleased with the way my hair looks after each shampoo.  Most other shampoos haven&#x27;t pleased me.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo for my fine and thin hair. Actually does what it says and adds volume. Im hooked. I also use Sebastian Thickefy foam and Trilliant heat protection.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair..not thin..but fine.  This shampoo gives my hair the body it needs.  It also gives it a luscious sheen.  A real winner!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! A little goes a long, long way.</li>
