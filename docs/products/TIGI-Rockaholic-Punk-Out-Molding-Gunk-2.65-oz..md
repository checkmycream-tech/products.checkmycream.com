### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>From this company I was very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This has the perfect texture for creating and holding a mussed hair style.  </li>
      <li>Awesome texture.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>Smells awesome!</li>
      <li>There is no visible residue, and ZERO shine, which I think is perfect.</li>
      <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve found, and the best price, too.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>This is a very good hair product and it works.  </li>
      <li>Smells good too!</li>
      <li>It does work great for that bed-head-tousled-chunked look, but it never sets or dries; it stays a sticky &amp; pasty.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product because it is pliable.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>It is a great value for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind sticky, this is great for that dirty-look, chunky, do.  </li>
      <li>Great hold but still pliable.  </li>
      <li>guys who like the semi-scruffy look that most women adore -- this is the product you need to perfect that (deliberately) disheveled charm.</li>
      <li>This Is Good For:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Nice balance of holding power without the oil/wax feel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance because it was good.</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Another tip: scoop out a bit on a finger and rub it between your palms until it gets warm and tacky.</li>
      <li>The best product I have used so far and have been using for 3-4 years now.</li>
      <li>I can use the product but with it being old it doesn&#x27;t work the best.</li>
      <li>* Can handle light rain/mist without washing out, perfect if you live somewhere that gets a lot of rain.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this product online as I believe it is being phased out and</li>
      <li>Glad I found it online</li>
      <li>This will make it spread a bit more evenly</li>
      <li>but it is not terribly offensive.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34;, for lack of a better descriptor.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many many years.</li>
      <li>I can tease it a bit for a more informal look with any flakes or loosing control.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>Although it was nice to be able to find this product that is no longer readily available in stores, I would not recommend this seller.  </li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price ($12 currently) is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find from somewhere reliable.</li>
      <li>my favorite hair product</li>
      <li>still so glad to have it.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Amazon was great in refunding my purchase, and Newvo offered to send me new product if I removed my review.  </li>
      <li>When I saw it available on Amazon for a lower price I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>I can re-model easily during the day.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easy and if I go to bed with it in my pillow is not stained or greasy in the morning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great for piecing hair or keeping a style in place...would definitely recommend to others!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect hair product my whole life, but I feel like I have finally found it.</li>
      <li>Originally, I got it to keep a pixie plus fauxhawk in line.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m exploring new options now, as this stuff can make your hair kind of noticeably sticky when you run your fingers through it.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal and exact same product</li>
      <li>The better way to deal with this is use the smallest amount possible then apply more as needed.</li>
      <li>The salon charged almost $10 more per container, so buying it on Amazon is likely to be the better deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One good thing about it is that the next day all you have to do is dampen your fingers &amp; re-fluff your hair &amp; your ready to go; great on the weekend camping trip when the shower house was closed.  </li>
      <li>A jar lasts about a year, so it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>This has a kind of pasty texture, not waxy, or gel-like, with enough body stay where I put it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this TIGI product for years, purchased directly from my salon, and love it.  </li>
      <li>I have very thin and fine hair and this product works best for me.</li>
      <li>It is more of a dry paste and a light hold if that.</li>
      <li>* Works great on both male and female hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is much cheaper!</li>
      <li>I continue to use daily &amp; glad for opportunity to obtain on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a little of this make my hair thicker and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>* Makes dry hair feel slightly more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is definitely easy to retouch, but also constantly needs retouched if you lean against the head rest in your car or your husband wants to touch your hair.  </li>
      <li>It works fir him very well</li>
      <li>However, this item is no longer being made by the company so please be reasonable with your expectations.</li>
      <li>REALLY.</li>
      <li>It can also clump or \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; up hair if too much is applied at once.</li>
      <li>Looking for something that perhaps offered a little better value, I decided to try this after reading the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily with minimal soap and water.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly like is the smell - the closest thing I can use for comparison is cologne, but it goes away quickly as it dries out.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this company.</li>
      <li>It holds all day even with the high humidity that Knoxville is cursed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since it lasts a long time, it probably won&#x27;t matter if you pay a bit more to buy locally.</li>
      <li>I normally buy it in the salon....</li>
      <li>However, if you use a small amount and do not glop it on your head than you&#x27;ll see why the rest of us love this.   </li>
      <li>Love other TIGI products, especially Rockaholic Groupie spray pomade.</li>
      <li>My understanding from speaking with a friend at a salon is companies like Newvobeauty buy old stock from salons that are going out of business, and other less reputable sources and sell as new fresh product.  </li>
      <li>short, coarse, straight hair, and most other styling products just don&#x27;t have the oomph to control it.  </li>
      <li>With a little of the product and some styling, even stubborn baby fine hair has volume that lasts for hours.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>but you could tell by the color and consistency that it was old.  </li>
      <li>Anyone with fine/thin hair who wants bigger volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the TIGI Rockaholic molding gunk was old and compact.</li>
      <li>I was worried about buying this after reading some of the reviews about the product being old.</li>
      <li>The product was old.  </li>
      <li>It did not seem like old product as some are saying.</li>
      <li>Gives a professional look every time.  </li>
      <li>this product is too thick and oily  more than a Vaseline</li>
      <li>The product was old dried out and had shrunk in the container to about 2/3 the original size.</li>
      <li>This product is slightly less expensive and contains more than their manipulator product, and the hold is actually better for my hair.</li>
      <li>* Only need a small amount for most hair styles.</li>
      <li>I found that there was a clear plastic protective shield which further guaranteed the quality and preservation of the Rockaholic Punk Out Gel.  </li>
      <li>If you are new to this product, you may want to practice with it a few times before you add it to your normal styling routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My item came with the inner seal and was not dry.</li>
      <li>I could tell it had gotten extremely warm/ not like new but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was expecting a thicker cream that would be a firm hold. This product is a disappointment for sure. It isn&#x27;t a cream, and it does not hold my hair in place. It is more of a dry paste and a light hold if that.</li>
    <li> Prior to the Rockaholic Punk Out gunk, I was using TIGI&#x27;s Bed Head Manipulator. Looking for something that perhaps offered a little better value, I decided to try this after reading the positive reviews. This product is slightly less expensive and contains more than their manipulator product, and the hold is actually better for my hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly like is the smell - the closest thing I can use for comparison is cologne, but it goes away quickly as it dries out.</li>
    <li> My husband told me to buy this product and he loves it. Is not a greasy or even a sticky product.  It works fir him very well</li>
    <li> This has the perfect texture for creating and holding a mussed hair style.  I have short, coarse, straight hair, and most other styling products just don&#x27;t have the oomph to control it.  This has a kind of pasty texture, not waxy, or gel-like, with enough body stay where I put it.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (because it isn&#x27;t wet?) or get hard, so I can re-model easily during the day.  There is no visible residue, and ZERO shine, which I think is perfect. Best stuff I&#x27;ve found, and the best price, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I use a little and it gives me the look I want. It lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommend this product but at the salon it&#x27;s twice the price. This is a great deal and exact same product</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this company. They not only have the lowest price I could find, I received my products within 5 days. I will try other products from them now.</li>
    <li> Great product. was received on time.  I&#x27;ve used this product before, looks and feels like I am not wearing any hair product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair product and it works.  Will spike your hair all day long.  Real stiff stuff.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this a couple years ago.  I have short, layered hair.  With the back of a finger, scrape slightly less than a pinky fingernail sized glob of gunk onto your fingernail.  Put in the palm of the other hand and rub hands together briefly.  Take both hands and \\&quot;rub-a-dub-dub\\&quot; briskly all over your head.  With your fingers or a separating comb, arrange and separate pieces to your liking.  Gives a professional look every time.  The secret is to use right amount.  A jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> From this company I was very happy with it.  I had previously ordered it from another company but you could tell by the color and consistency that it was old.  This was not.</li>
    <li> the TIGI Rockaholic molding gunk was old and compact. It loof like it had been stored in a cold place, compact and hard to spread in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  There, I submitted a review - now please stop sending me emails.</li>
    <li> Boy does this spik up my SHORT hair. The best product I have used so far and have been using for 3-4 years now. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I normally buy it in the salon.... this is much cheaper! I will definitely buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for piecing hair or keeping a style in place...would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Although it was nice to be able to find this product that is no longer readily available in stores, I would not recommend this seller.  The product was old dried out and had shrunk in the container to about 2/3 the original size.</li>
    <li> The product was old.  The paste was yellow not white like it should be.  I can use the product but with it being old it doesn&#x27;t work the best.</li>
    <li> The containers did not include the plastic seal over the product (as sold in retail stores), therefore the product was a bit dry and difficult to mold with.</li>
    <li> Nice balance of holding power without the oil/wax feel. Washes out easily with minimal soap and water.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My item came with the inner seal and was not dry. It did not seem like old product as some are saying. However, this item is no longer being made by the company so please be reasonable with your expectations.</li>
    <li> oWorks for me.  I continue to use daily &amp; glad for opportunity to obtain on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I never received this product. They sent me BED HEAD Manipulator(totally different product). Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect hair product my whole life, but I feel like I have finally found it. All you need is a small amount rubbed into your palms and work it on after towel drying yet still a bit damp. You can play with your hair to shape it the way you want and after drying it doesn&#x27;t look oily or wet. You can continue to play and shape it throughout the day. I like that after getting off work I can tease it a bit for a more informal look with any flakes or loosing control. It washes out easy and if I go to bed with it in my pillow is not stained or greasy in the morning.</li>
    <li> this is not the product that I purchased at the salon</li>
    <li> I recently got a pixie cut and needed to create some definition.  My hair stylist used this product at the salon and I really liked it.  Works well without getting greasy.</li>
    <li> It does work great for that bed-head-tousled-chunked look, but it never sets or dries; it stays a sticky &amp; pasty.  It is definitely easy to retouch, but also constantly needs retouched if you lean against the head rest in your car or your husband wants to touch your hair.  When you do touch your hair you want to go wash your hands immediately because it is sticky &amp; leaves your hands sticky.  One good thing about it is that the next day all you have to do is dampen your fingers &amp; re-fluff your hair &amp; your ready to go; great on the weekend camping trip when the shower house was closed.  I just didn&#x27;t like the feel of having an insect trap on my head.  If you don&#x27;t mind sticky, this is great for that dirty-look, chunky, do.  Lots of lift &amp; body possible.</li>
    <li> I had to review this after seeing other reviewers complain about how it felt gross and \\&quot;never dried\\&quot;. This product is a very heavy mud and a tiny bit goes a long way. If you use too much then yes, it will feel dirty and gross. However, if you use a small amount and do not glop it on your head than you&#x27;ll see why the rest of us love this.   Another tip: scoop out a bit on a finger and rub it between your palms until it gets warm and tacky. This will make it spread a bit more evenly and you will use less product.</li>
    <li> My mother swears by this product.  It is a great value for the price.  My mother has tried more expensive versions of this product from other brands, but once her hairdresser turned her on to this she&#x27;s been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for about 3 years but I&#x27;m exploring new options now, as this stuff can make your hair kind of noticeably sticky when you run your fingers through it. Like, there&#x27;s residue when you touch your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many many years. I have very thin and fine hair and this product works best for me. Does not make my hair greasy. I was worried about buying this after reading some of the reviews about the product being old. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance because it was good.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> TiGi&#x27;s Rockaholic Punk Out Molding Gunk lives way up to the name. It&#x27;s different from any hair product I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s a pomade that texturizes and sculpts hair to do whatever you want it to. REALLY. It seems to add moisture as well. Originally, I got it to keep a pixie plus fauxhawk in line. Now that I&#x27;m growing it out, I&#x27;ll continue to use it for twenties&#x27; and forties&#x27; hairstyles. A woman will find a million ways to do her hair with product like this at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For guys who like the semi-scruffy look that most women adore -- this is the product you need to perfect that (deliberately) disheveled charm.</li>
    <li> Best.stuff.EVER!!  Don&#x27;t know why on earth they would stop making it.....it&#x27;s the bomb!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I have been using it for three years.  It lasts a long time because only a little is needed to do wonders with my naturally curly hair.  BUT!! Last year I bought it for $11, and now it&#x27;s $35.  I will be looking for another product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/20/2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other products but not find one that works as well as this one, so I&#x27;ve gone back to it. Still not happy about the price, but at least I&#x27;ve gotten fresh product from this vendor. A jar lasts about a year, so it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> love this stuff! Glad I found it online my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t get it any longer and I was bummed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this TIGI product for years, purchased directly from my salon, and love it.  When I saw it available on Amazon for a lower price I was very excited.  Unfortunately the supplier that Amazon uses Newvobeauty, only seems to send dried up expired merchandise.  Amazon was great in refunding my purchase, and Newvo offered to send me new product if I removed my review.  They did, and the product was worse than my original purchase.  My understanding from speaking with a friend at a salon is companies like Newvobeauty buy old stock from salons that are going out of business, and other less reputable sources and sell as new fresh product.  Don&#x27;t wast your time!!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff. my favorite hair product</li>
    <li> Not the product&#x27;s fault, I was just expecting it to be a different consistency.  I thought it would be more &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34;, for lack of a better descriptor.  Love other TIGI products, especially Rockaholic Groupie spray pomade.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I have short hair and do a flip thing with it... Holds with out being hard.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this product online as I believe it is being phased out and the price was just what I pay at the store.</li>
    <li> this is my second time using this product an it ROCKS. Unfortunately I cant find anywhere local where I can purchase it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I could tell it had gotten extremely warm/ not like new but still so glad to have it. It&#x27;s my favorite. Can&#x27;t find a replacement</li>
    <li> Great hold but still pliable.  Not too matte.  Not too greasy.  Awesome texture.  I like the way it smells too!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this.  I&#x27;ve order it from Amazon in the past, but the product I received was old and dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cane from TIGI.  It was shrink wrapped and upon opening it I found that there was a clear plastic protective shield which further guaranteed the quality and preservation of the Rockaholic Punk Out Gel.  I have fine hair, but a little of this make my hair thicker and easy to style.  It holds all day even with the high humidity that Knoxville is cursed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to by from TIGI from now on!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Only need a small amount for most hair styles. On average, a pea sized amount is enough to handle short to medium-short hair. This means a jar will last quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;* Holds even the thinnest and finest hair. With a little of the product and some styling, even stubborn baby fine hair has volume that lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;* Works great on both male and female hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Product does have a fragrance but it is not terribly offensive. It does take a little getting used to but there are far worse smelling products out there.&lt;br /&gt;* Can handle light rain/mist without washing out, perfect if you live somewhere that gets a lot of rain.&lt;br /&gt;* Makes dry hair feel slightly more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Hard to find. Other than at one salon, I had no luck finding it locally. The salon charged almost $10 more per container, so buying it on Amazon is likely to be the better deal.&lt;br /&gt;* Can be a little hard to work with. The product is very sticky/thick, so a little goes a long way. It can also clump or \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; up hair if too much is applied at once. The better way to deal with this is use the smallest amount possible then apply more as needed. If you are new to this product, you may want to practice with it a few times before you add it to your normal styling routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who This Is Good For:&lt;br /&gt;* Anyone looking for a choppy or messy style that stays put.&lt;br /&gt;* Anyone with fine/thin hair who wants bigger volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Notes:&lt;br /&gt;* As mentioned above, price varies widely depending on where you go. Amazon&#x27;s price ($12 currently) is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find from somewhere reliable. Since it lasts a long time, it probably won&#x27;t matter if you pay a bit more to buy locally.</li>
    <li> This is a great product because it is pliable.  Once you apply it you have time to work with it to get the look you want.  It does not dry hard and you can adjust it throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Only if u have a very thick dry coarse hair it might be good not sure but&lt;br /&gt;Ip this product is too thick and oily  more than a Vaseline</li>
