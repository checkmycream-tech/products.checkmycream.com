      <li>This warmer works great.</li>
      <li>Love it, works great, awesome brand!</li>
      <li>This was warmer worked fairly well for about four months.</li>
      <li>and I cannot see a good reason why the shape was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first glance the improvements are excellent.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but this is so nice</li>
      <li>I am an aesthetician and have always liked Satin</li>
      <li>Works great heats up quick.</li>
      <li>Great adjustable heat controls that keep consistent temperature.</li>
      <li>The new one is nice looking and works just as great.  </li>
      <li>This product got to my salon fast and the warmer works great.</li>
      <li>I love that the on/off switches are covered.</li>
      <li>The heat settings are perfect for specific client needs.</li>
      <li>It pays to spend more.  </li>
      <li>and I love that the cover just lifts off.</li>
      <li>You, I love it&amp;#34; when she received the gift.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>find it very easy to keep clean as well using an orange oil cleaner.</li>
      <li>Great price and product at professional grade!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be fine.</li>
      <li>It keeps my wax at the right temperature all the time and has a nice compact size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used satin smooth wax warmers for years and never had any issues.</li>
      <li>One temp wheel clicks and one is smooth.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t go cheap.</li>
      <li>But hey, wouldn&#x27;t it just be great if Cirepil could use the same size</li>
      <li>Works well, easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>So easy to keep clean</li>
      <li>It does fit Satin Smooth waxes (which I do think are decent especially for the price) and Berodins waxes, which are awesome...  </li>
      <li>Works great &amp; I love that it has a standby setting (less electricity).</li>
      <li>My original finally stopped heating up on one side and it was time to say good bye after 8 years.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that would have made it more perfect is if it had remained the same rectangle shape as the older style.</li>
      <li>It also heats up rather quickly.</li>
      <li>all in all if you use Satin Smooth wax or only use wax beads, never need to remove your tins, and can wedge your wax tins in go for it; this is a nice warmer.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t get very hot...</li>
      <li>This new one takes up more space</li>
      <li>Love the fact I can easily change out the different wax pots.</li>
      <li>I tried several different wax pots and they all fit great.</li>
      <li>This machine looks nice and is simple to use.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t as white and nice looking anymore.</li>
      <li>This is very much worth it</li>
      <li>I really like the oval shape as compared to the rectangle shape of the older model, and I think the warmer control works better, the wax is not too hot to use on clients skin.  </li>
      <li>Invest a little more money for a better product.</li>
      <li>ONLY FITS SATIN SMOOTH!</li>
      <li>Came in the mail on time and fast!</li>
      <li>i love my double warmer.</li>
      <li>thanks for listening!</li>
      <li>because the Satin Smooth double warmer is a popular one among estheticians (as long as they don&#x27;t have to have Cirepil, which not all of them do....)  </li>
      <li>Nice addition to my salon space!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone professional or personal!</li>
      <li>I love my new double wax warmer.  </li>
      <li>It never kept the temperature real well but did warm none the less.</li>
      <li>It heats really fast</li>
      <li>This wax warmer has heat settings that work very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth double wax warmers.  </li>
      <li>I recently replaced my old warmer with this newer more modern style.  </li>
      <li>: Nowhere on any of the packaging, sales literature, website, or owners manual does it say that you can only use Satin Smooth wax in the warmer.</li>
      <li>can as most other waxes use?????</li>
      <li>this warmer you can pick a setting and feel safe that it will be at that temperature an hour or two down the road when you are still waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I hope Satin Smooth makes their next model a little larger to accomodate all the waxes (like Gigi and Clean &amp; Easy warmers do....)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many wax pots, most were more expensive than this one and did not last as long.</li>
      <li>This warmer is made very cheap and won&#x27;t last long..</li>
      <li>just spent 20 minutes on the phone with Conair, the owner of Satin Smooth, customer service.</li>
      <li>So, when I started at a new salon and needed to pick up a couple new wax warmers I leaped at the updated version.</li>
      <li>Looked around for new wax pot.</li>
      <li>If you are a professional, spend a little more money for higher quality that will last.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike some other brands out there that get way too hot way too quickly and possibly burn your wax if you aren&#x27;t truly diligent.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s girlfriend is a professional</li>
      <li>and once she could finally be bothered to look into it she had no solution other than using Satin Smooth wax and that ain&#x27;t gonna happen.</li>
      <li>I have the previous model of satin smooth double wax warmer</li>
      <li>The dual is preferred for my fiance&#x27;s spa so she can have both hard and soft wax available.</li>
      <li>I do not like satin smooth wax and these things were a total waste of money.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for professional use and is also very hard to clean!</li>
      <li>I bought some Satin Smooth hard wax in a pinch once</li>
      <li>No more locking clips on the lid, covers over the power buttons to keep liquids from entering the body and potentially damaging electrical components, and rigid incremental temperature adjustment (the dials click as opposed to just gliding smoothly).</li>
      <li>She did offer to exchange my warmers for new ones of the same model or warmers of equal value which makes no sense whatsoever.</li>

    <li> This warmer works great. It keeps my wax at the right temperature all the time and has a nice compact size. It also heats up rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I have the previous model of satin smooth double wax warmer and I love it. So, when I started at a new salon and needed to pick up a couple new wax warmers I leaped at the updated version. At first glance the improvements are excellent. No more locking clips on the lid, covers over the power buttons to keep liquids from entering the body and potentially damaging electrical components, and rigid incremental temperature adjustment (the dials click as opposed to just gliding smoothly). It was a little larger for no apparent reason other than looks but I figured I could spare a little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my problem: Nowhere on any of the packaging, sales literature, website, or owners manual does it say that you can only use Satin Smooth wax in the warmer. The only restrictions are \\&quot;14 or 16 oz tins\\&quot;. Too bad my 14 oz Cirepil wax tins are difficult to get in cold and impossible to get out warm (I destroyed a tin, literally ripping it apart, with two wax lifters to remove it so I could heat wax for my next appointment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spent 20 minutes on the phone with Conair, the owner of Satin Smooth, customer service. The CSR had no idea what I was talking about and once she could finally be bothered to look into it she had no solution other than using Satin Smooth wax and that ain&#x27;t gonna happen. (Sidenote: I bought some Satin Smooth hard wax in a pinch once and it was the most horrible waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had.) She did offer to exchange my warmers for new ones of the same model or warmers of equal value which makes no sense whatsoever. So, I will be returning my warmers and purchasing a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean really, buying wax because it fits the warmer is like buying a car because it fits the tires you have. Sorry, the suggestion just blew my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all if you use Satin Smooth wax or only use wax beads, never need to remove your tins, and can wedge your wax tins in go for it; this is a nice warmer. If you use any other wax or ever plan to do so then don&#x27;t buy this warmer. Your wax tins may not fit. Also, if service after the sale is something you care about then buy a brand not owned by Conair.</li>
    <li> I love it! Heats up perfect. Came in the mail on time and fast! I&#x27;ve had it for about weeks now and no complications</li>
    <li> I recently replaced my old warmer with this newer more modern style.  I really like the oval shape as compared to the rectangle shape of the older model, and I think the warmer control works better, the wax is not too hot to use on clients skin.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It pays to spend more.  This pot maintains the correct temperature for the wax and would recommend it for a start up or experienced spa.  Don&#x27;t go cheap. This is very much worth it</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend is a professional and I got this for her birthday and have not received any feed back from her except &amp;#34;Thank You, I love it&amp;#34; when she received the gift.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from the single to the dual wax warmer, same brand, and have never had a problem with either. The dual is preferred for my fiance&#x27;s spa so she can have both hard and soft wax available. She has since turned the single wax warmer into one she can travel with if needed. Seperate controls for both sides and never an issue or complaint has come from using this product. Shipped and received on time.</li>
    <li> This item takes forever to heat up!!! Invest a little more money for a better product. Two hours and wax is still hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> This was warmer worked fairly well for about four months. It never kept the temperature real well but did warm none the less. After four months of use one if the earners went out on it! So disappointed because I though this was a highly recommend professional pot. If purchasing for home use I&#x27;m sure it would be fine. Would not recommend for professional use and is also very hard to clean!</li>
    <li> Works great heats up quick. One temp wheel clicks and one is smooth. Not a big deal. I use it in my spa everyday!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many wax pots, most were more expensive than this one and did not last as long. So happy I took a chance on a great pot. I love that the on/off switches are covered.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed.  I am an aesthetician and have always liked Satin Smooth double wax warmers.  My original finally stopped heating up on one side and it was time to say good bye after 8 years.  The new one is nice looking and works just as great.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This warmer works great; however, it does not fit Cirepil waxes.  I read the earlier review where she said she could get them in but could hardly get them out; I was afraid I would damage the unit if I pushed hard enough to get the Cirepil wax in....  It does fit Satin Smooth waxes (which I do think are decent especially for the price) and Berodins waxes, which are awesome...  I hope Satin Smooth makes their next model a little larger to accomodate all the waxes (like Gigi and Clean &amp; Easy warmers do....) because the Satin Smooth double warmer is a popular one among estheticians (as long as they don&#x27;t have to have Cirepil, which not all of them do....)  But hey, wouldn&#x27;t it just be great if Cirepil could use the same size can as most other waxes use????? (:  thanks for listening!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dual waxing system. Great adjustable heat controls that keep consistent temperature.</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; I love that it has a standby setting (less electricity). Efficient and relatively compact given it&#x27;s. Somewhat odd shape.</li>
    <li> so you don&#x27;t know this until you get it....ONLY FITS SATIN SMOOTH! The dimensions they provide are correct for cirepil, but I had to throw two of these away because the wax pot goes in fine, but getting it out is impossible. I do not like satin smooth wax and these things were a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome wax pot! I am an esthetician and been wanting a double for a while now! Love it, works great, awesome brand! Reccommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> If you purchase this from this seller they won&#x27;t return or refund after 30 days. Mine worked great from June-Sept then the left side stopped heating the wax. I&#x27;ve used satin smooth wax warmers for years and never had any issues. My last warmer I had for 4 years and only decided to get another one bc it wasn&#x27;t as white and nice looking anymore.</li>
    <li> Works great. I tried several different wax pots and they all fit great. Love the fact I can easily change out the different wax pots.</li>
    <li> Did not include inserts metal wax holders which cost $10 each !!!</li>
    <li> The heating element has stopped working on three different warmers and the last warmer I purchased, a spring on the on/off button broke.  This warmer is made very cheap and won&#x27;t last long.. I have purchased 4 over the last 10 years and I have finally given up.  If you are a professional, spend a little more money for higher quality that will last.</li>
    <li> This wax warmer has heat settings that work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some other brands out there that get way too hot way too quickly and possibly burn your wax if you aren&#x27;t truly diligent.&lt;br /&gt;With this warmer you can pick a setting and feel safe that it will be at that temperature an hour or two down the road when you are still waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I find it very easy to keep clean as well using an orange oil cleaner.</li>
    <li> i love my double warmer. the temperature controls let me keep my wax at the perfect temperature. it is the only wax warmer i use.</li>
    <li> This machine looks nice and is simple to use. Works well, easy to keep clean. Nice addition to my salon space!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone professional or personal!</li>
    <li> This product got to my salon fast and the warmer works great. The heat settings are perfect for specific client needs.</li>
    <li> Product works great and I love that the cover just lifts off. The only thing that would have made it more perfect is if it had remained the same rectangle shape as the older style. This new one takes up more space and I cannot see a good reason why the shape was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love it! So easy to keep clean</li>
    <li> I love my new double wax warmer.  I purchased it about a month ago and I have no complaints. It heats really fast and it&#x27;s efficient. I am a licensed Esthetician and I use it for body waxing on my clients. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great price and product at professional grade!</li>
    <li> Great value. Looked around for new wax pot. I only needed 1 but this is so nice I bought it and threw my one that still worked away. Space saving and now I can put men&#x27;s wax on one side and women&#x27;s on the other. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Product was completely different. Lid is attached &amp; pots don&#x27;t get very hot...</li>
