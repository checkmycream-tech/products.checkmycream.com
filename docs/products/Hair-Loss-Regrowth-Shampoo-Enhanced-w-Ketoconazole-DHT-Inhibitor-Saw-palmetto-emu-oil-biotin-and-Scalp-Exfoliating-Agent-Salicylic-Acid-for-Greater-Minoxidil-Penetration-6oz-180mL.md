      <li>It feels great and shiny and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with Perfect Image 15% minoxidil, so I can&#x27;t judge it solely on it&#x27;s own merits.</li>
      <li>this hair growth shampoo is great.</li>
      <li>My daughter is using and also taste great, as already noted improvement.</li>
      <li>I want to mention the perfect image 3% for women is so much better than rogaine or off the shelf stuff.  </li>

      <li>I think the use of the products together is a good idea.</li>

      <li>Amazing Shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product has been recalled by the FDA effective 1/20/2012.</li>
      <li>Thanks Perfect Image and Amazon.</li>
      <li>It goes on really nice without ruining my style....</li>
      <li>It seems that the Ketoconazole is an effective DHT inhibitor.</li>
      <li>But my hair is just fine!  </li>
      <li>Very mild shampoo, nice for hair.</li>
      <li>After using it, about a quarter size, I realized that this shampoo will last a good while, with great results.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about six months, and I must admit I see more hair</li>
      <li>It does say on the bottle to use Minoxidile for better and faster results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>realized that my hair falls more when I stopped using this product.</li>
      <li>I am going to order one more bottle.</li>
      <li>When I get home in the evening, applying the minodixil is at the top of the list.</li>
      <li>I attribute most of this to the shampoo since I do not apply any minoxidil to these areas.  </li>
      <li>w/ Ketoconazole DHT Inhibitor, Saw palmetto, emu oil, biotin &amp; Scalp Exfoliating Agent Salicylic Acid for Greater Minoxidil Penetration 6oz</li>
      <li>Mostly it is just a replacement for Nizoral</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll scratch off the idea of buying Nizoral from my head and stick to this one for sure.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this.  </li>
      <li>but of the two, PI smells better and leaves my hair/head refreshed.</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased the product in combination with the Minoxidil 3%</li>
      <li>The smell is refreshing and feels like it cleans the scalp</li>
      <li>It seems to cleanse the scalp thoroughly and gives a refreshing feel.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews on this product and thought it sounded perfect, so I bought three bottles (big mistake!).  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d still like it have some more oil/moisturizing agents.</li>
      <li>Like so many others, I could not find Nizoril and started searching for another shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I dont see that many hairs on my hands.  </li>
      <li>It cleans my scalp, and my hair looks shinny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stop hair loss but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker or more healthy either.</li>
      <li>Latest haircut</li>
      <li>Leaves hair way more maneagable than nioxin.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product, as it was supposed to reduce hair shedding.  </li>
      <li>My wife just tried, she was much more happy because her many year old dandruff problem just gone in 2 use.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is thicker better looking and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only  been using this a day I haven&#x27;t seen results but the way this stuff makes your scalp feel is incredible.  </li>
      <li>I will continue however in this strong battle.  </li>
      <li>As a shampoo it is excellent in that it has all of the characteristics typically would want from a shampoo...  </li>
      <li>but you can feel your hair and scalp refreshed and free of oil wich in exess</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll probably use it until that is readily available again.    </li>
      <li>Surely I will try to update this review, however I will give it some time and for the results its worth the price.</li>
      <li>However, I wish it was SLS free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell how it will keep up, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product</li>
      <li>and the scalp feels so clean after use.</li>
      <li>, I really like the way it makes my scalp feel very clean.  </li>
      <li>I can say that I am honestly impressed with this even if I do not grow back any hair back</li>
      <li>I have researched the best possible hair loss products and this one has obviously kept in touch with scientific advances on hair loss.</li>
      <li>If you continue this progress must quickly solve my problem of hair loss.</li>
      <li>This shampoo gave me instant thickness, conditioning and good looking from the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to sound too critical on such a great product.</li>
      <li>keto shampoo user and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>WOW (more like therapy).</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much i love this shampoo...</li>
      <li>More importantly it also appears to enhance the effect of the 15% Minoxidil hair growth treatment I&#x27;m using from the same manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks I&#x27;m noticing slightly smaller pores on my face and as a bonus I&#x27;m also protecting my hair from falling out which is nice too.  </li>
      <li>This seller&#x27;s other products are wonderful, but definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way-it lathers up tremendously!It smells good and feels good on the scalp.</li>
      <li>This company&#x27;s other products are good too.</li>
      <li>and i just went right ahead and order it.</li>
      <li>I do have an oily scalp, and noticed when using the shampoo it really makes the scalp feel clean and removes the oil right after using it.</li>
      <li>PerfectImage provides a great dropper that you should use to apply small drops over the area.  </li>
      <li>I am thinning only on the vertex, my hairline is still full and strong.</li>
      <li>For the first month or two, it seemed like I had danruff since I was getting skin flakes appearing in the scalp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only on day 5 of using this stuff ,but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be On it forever.....</li>
      <li>FIRST thing I like</li>
      <li>At first, i wanted to buy Nizoral</li>
      <li>Then when I first used the anti dandruff shampoos and rogaine together</li>
      <li>But I have noticed regrowth and perhaps a bit more fullness in hair only using about 3x per week.   </li>
      <li>First month I saw a lot of shedding.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product, as it was supposed to reduce hair shedding.  I was shocked when I experienced 3 times the amount of shedding after using this product, so I threw it in the garbage.  A very expensive lesson learned.  I will stick with regenepure products, as they seem to cause my hair to shed a lot less than this product does, plus, regenepure does not contain sls.  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I was very disappointed with this product, especially for the price I paid.  This seller&#x27;s other products are wonderful, but definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a temporary replacement until Nizoral comes back to the stores. Spent around $25 w/ shipping, and it was a waste of money.  Used it 3 different times to give a fair chance, but it dried out my hair while making my scalp greasy, so my hair looked flat,thin,dull and stringy. Just awful.</li>
    <li> Amazing Shampoo. It also has a good smell.   It helped to make my hair thicker and stronger. I recommend you to use it with the Minoxidil oil in order to regrow your hair!   Good luck :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few months, and I see new hair growth, and it seems like less of my hair is falling out. I like that the product is safe enough for use on children. I would highly reccommend the product to any woman with hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo--I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and there is a slight difference in the thickness of my hair but I think it will take longer to see real results.  In the meantime, though, the shampoo makes my hair soft, shiny, and extremely manageable to the point where I am using it every day instead of every other day.  I wanted to try the shampoo first before I ventured on to the other products but I am definitely going to switch to the conditioner as well!</li>
    <li> Tried out this product and it was ineffective, nothing to show from it. If all I was paying for is an anti-dandruff shampoo there are plenty of other brands for a much cheaper price.  Would not recommend this product especially for the price and the tiny amount that you receive.</li>
    <li> Thanks god, since i use this product everyday, my dandruff was gone. It means that my scalp become healthier. The hair become stronger. I combine with other product to regrow my hair. I am grateful my hair stop falling. I never give up! I want to keep my hair growing. If I can, so can you!</li>
    <li> this hair growth shampoo is great. It stimulating and you can feel it working on your scalp. I like the way it makes your hair soft and manageable. Ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair grows at an increased rate. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very mild shampoo, nice for hair. Keep a healthy and an excellent complement to Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor.   Jose</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t stop hair loss but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker or more healthy either. I am really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that my hair falls more when I stopped using this product. I am going to order one more bottle. I am not completely satisfied with this product because it makes my hair weird. I dont know if I should use some conditioner or some other products with it?</li>
    <li> Ive been using this shampoo along with their 15% minoxidil solution. First month I saw a lot of shedding. The next 2 months, I was able to see a some tiny hair starting to grow. Very recently (4th month going on) I can see the tiny hair start getting darker and longer. The results can be seen not only in the thinning areas, I can see new hair growth outside of the hairline too.   I can say I&#x27;m confident I can fight hair-loss now! Latest haircut I even went for a longer hair style instead of the usual short one!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 4 weeks now, I am 27 years old and my hair has been slowly thinning for the past 2 years. It is at the point where it has become noticeable and it was time to do something about it, or continue down this journey and be bald by 40.  I am thinning only on the vertex, my hairline is still full and strong. I do have an oily scalp, and noticed when using the shampoo it really makes the scalp feel clean and removes the oil right after using it. I use this every night I shower, and leave it in for approximately 3 minutes before rinsing it out. Immediately after 1 week I noticed less hair shed in the shower. Now I only have a few hairs that shed each time which is normal. I can say that I am honestly impressed with this even if I do not grow back any hair back at least the shedding has stopped. I am debating using a minoxidil along with it but that&#x27;s another long commitment. I have short hair so I only use a small amount and its enough to cover my entire head. I will update if I begin noticing some growth.</li>
    <li> Like others, I started using this when Nizoral became unavailable. I thought this would be a decent bridge gap until Nizoral came back in stock. But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back. I have been using this along with the Minoxidil 15% / Azelaic acid 5% solution and have noticed, not just maintenance like I did before, but regrowth on the front of my scalp near the widow&#x27;s peak in under 30 days. And it seems to be staying. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;ve got an afro now. But I have noticed regrowth and perhaps a bit more fullness in hair only using about 3x per week.   Only slight downside for me is that I&#x27;d like it to be a bit more moisturizing. I have very dry scalp and have usually used a lot more moisturizing shampoos. This definitely does some moisturizing and is by no means drying. But I&#x27;d still like it have some more oil/moisturizing agents. I know it&#x27;s designed to be exfoliating and I don&#x27;t want to sound too critical on such a great product.</li>
    <li> I am not a sales rep!....  I don&#x27;t usually leave feed back ,but I just had too this time.  I wash my hair with this shampoo everyday before I go to work , I really like the way it makes my scalp feel very clean.  Also I can pull on my hair ,and nothing comes out in my fingers.. I feel like my hair loss has come to a complete HALT!!!!  I&#x27;m only on day 5 of using this stuff ,but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be On it forever.....I will post an update later</li>
    <li> Leaves hir soft and tangle free.  Haven&#x27;t noticed too much in hair regrowth yet.  Only been using it for a few weeks.  Leaves hair way more maneagable than nioxin.</li>
    <li> in few words: ABSOLUTE AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My hair is soften!&lt;br /&gt;- Less hair loss in the bath!&lt;br /&gt;- Deep clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Hair Loss / Regrowth Shampoo so far!</li>
    <li> This product has been recalled by the FDA effective 1/20/2012. You can check the FDA&#x27;s website for confirmation.  Not Good. I loved this product!</li>
    <li> It cleans my scalp, and my hair looks shinny and healthy.  Plus, I dont see that many hairs on my hands.  ED</li>
    <li> Like so many others, I could not find Nizoril and started searching for another shampoo.  I read the reviews on this product and thought it sounded perfect, so I bought three bottles (big mistake!).  The first time I used it, I followed the directions, washing my hair for a full minute, and then leaving the shampoo on my hair for several minutes.  My hair was like straw!  I used a deep conditioner for three minutes and washed it out and then used a regular conditioner on top of that, and my hair was incredibly dry, had NO shine whatsoever, and felt brittle. So now I&#x27;m trying to use this stuff up by shampooing and rinsing it out immediately, using a regular conditioner, and then a leave-in conditioner after that.  I use Nizoril for hair loss, but, if my hair looks like it does after using this product, I think I would rather buy a wig.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo. It seems to cleanse the scalp thoroughly and gives a refreshing feel. It seems to have beneficial effect on the growth, at the very least preventing the hair loss. It seems that the Ketoconazole is an effective DHT inhibitor. I will continue to use this product should the quality persists.</li>
    <li> Started using this about 4 months ago in combination with rogaine foam and noticed my hair is now a lot thicker and healthier. My hairline is also not receding as rapdily anymore and I even see some fuzz growing back. It&#x27;s too early to tell how it will keep up, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review a few months ago and now I&#x27;m updating. My hair has stopped shedding the 200+ hairs per day and is slowly growing back. I don&#x27;t know if its this product or the others that I&#x27;m using but I feel this is a good addition to my regimen. I use every other day, massage in well and leave on for 10-20 minutes. Again, I won&#x27;t claim that this product is growing my hair back but used in conjunction with other products, it certainly is making a difference.</li>
    <li> although only used for a short period of time results have been noticeable and will continue use of the product to determine its ultimate success</li>
    <li> I had too much sculp etching, this works well for me. It is good anti-fungal product  My wife just tried, she was much more happy because her many year old dandruff problem just gone in 2 use.</li>
    <li> I just started weeks ago so I cant really tell you it works yet but you can feel your hair and scalp refreshed and free of oil wich in exess is one of the causes for hair fall. Will let you know how it goes in combination with Rogaine as the months progress. So far I&#x27;m using it as the label directs, 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to replace Ketoconazole product that I can no longer get online and Nizoral is out of stock everywhere.  Glad I found this.  Very happy with how the shampoo feels, smells and cleans my scalp. Will be a permanent addition to my regiment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a little over a month now since Nizoral isn&#x27;t available locally right now, and I do enjoy the product so far.  I like the smell and the lather of it.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefits from using it yet.  Others have said that they noticed their hair feels thicker but I have yet to experience this.  Mostly it is just a replacement for Nizoral and I&#x27;ll probably use it until that is readily available again.    A couple gripes, the bottle leaks easily if not extremely tight.  Second, the amount you get for the price is a little ridiculous.  I&#x27;ll continue using it for now and hold out hope that I&#x27;ll show some signs of regrowth or thickening.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this more as a facial cleanser to try and shrink my large t-zone pores.  After about 2 weeks I&#x27;m noticing slightly smaller pores on my face and as a bonus I&#x27;m also protecting my hair from falling out which is nice too.  The anti-androgens in this shampoo that shrink sebaceous glands on the scalp also seem to help shrink sebaceous glands on the face, which in turn helps shrink pore size.  My sebaceous hyperplasia on my face look like pimples from a normal distance but in reality are just enlarged sebaceous glands on my face.  I&#x27;m not expecting miracles but a slight reduction in size is what I&#x27;m expecting and so far, so good.  It seems to be working.  Also, the amount of oil my skin produces seems to have been cut in half.  So, for those of you with really oily skin, this won&#x27;t produce miracles but it really does help and it takes 2-3 weeks before you start to see the reduction in face oil when used with a moisturizer.  So, I would recommend this as a facial cleanser for acne caused by hormonal effects on your skin&#x27;s sebaceous oil glands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Dear Sir or Mam I just wanted to let you know that i have had amazing results from using the Perfect Image Solutions Hair regrowth Shampoo,i work it in really well and let it sit for 3 minutes before i towel dry my scalp and hair and apply the formula.I also use the 15% monoxidil with Azeleic acid and I supplement this regimen with 2 daily servings of saw palmetto with pygeum and 1 daily dose of beta sytosterol.The image attached shows me on the left before begining treatment and on the left side after 3 and a half weeks of use.      [...]</li>
    <li> At first, i wanted to buy Nizoral but it became a pain to find one of those so i decided to look for other options with the KETOCONAZOLE active ingredient and while searching amazon i stumbled upon this shampoo. I think luck was on my side because i was also looking for another DHT inhibitor shampoo (I&#x27;m also using Revita from DS Labs) and i just went right ahead and order it. I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s been close to a month and I&#x27;m amazed at how thick my hair is getting with the combination of 3 shampoos, the third one being \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; by Healthy Hair Plus. This combination of 3 shampoos daily, reinforced with DHT blocker pills from HLCC SCRIPTS and Biotin 5000 MCG from Walmart  cheapest place to buy it) are making wonders for my hair. BTW, I also suffer of MPB. I&#x27;ll scratch off the idea of buying Nizoral from my head and stick to this one for sure.</li>
    <li> I have patiently used it as directed, however, it doesn&#x27;t even reduce the hair loss yet alone providing hair regrowth. I would really wanted it to be work and give positive feedback, but unfortunately it did nothing more for my hair compared to ~5 dollar common brand shampoos I was already using. I feel like they just exploit peoples hopes. So, you can obviously try it yourselves but don&#x27;t expect any miracle to happen ...</li>
    <li> Once a day shampoo is not going to bring your hair back by itself.  I have noticed that my sides have gotten thicker since I started using the shampoo four months ago.  I attribute most of this to the shampoo since I do not apply any minoxidil to these areas.  For the first month or two, it seemed like I had danruff since I was getting skin flakes appearing in the scalp.  I attribute this to the product&#x27;s design of removing dead skin and making it easier for minoxidil to penetrate the scalp.  This scalp flaking stopped after month two so you may need to put up with this for a little awhile.    This company&#x27;s other products are good too. I use the 15% minoxidil solution on my thin area (front hairline) and Amazon&#x27;s Kirkland 5% on the rest of the scalp.  This has helped thicken the hair but the area with the noticeable hair loss is stubborn.  I do have some very small hairs showing up in the front so there is reason for optimism.  From reading, it seems like you need to give new treatments 6 to 12 months to see results.    Two comments on effectiveness.  You must get religious on applying twice daily and trying to evenly spread the applications 12 hours apart.  I get up early and apply the minoxidil and let it dry for 45 minutes before hitting the shower.  When I get home in the evening, applying the minodixil is at the top of the list. Second, even coverage is importand with a little massage to work it in with the fingers.  I still use a little Rogaine for the front since the liquid minodixil will drip down the forehead when you try to get the front.  PerfectImage provides a great dropper that you should use to apply small drops over the area.  I even use it with the Kirkland minoxidil since droppers provided with that product does not effectively control the release of the liquid.     PerfectImage does not make a conditioner and I highly recommend the Avalon Biotin thicking conditioner for the off days when you are not scheduled to use the shampoo.  In both cases, spend a little extra time in the shower with the water on or off to massage the product into the scalp and wait 3 to 5 minutes per the instructions.  The conditioner makes the hair silkly and offers some ingredients not in the PerfectImage shampoo that may have some hair loss prevention benefits.    The key to all of this to manage your expectations.  If you hair has been gone for a long time, the hair follicles may be very difficult to bring back to life.  The trick is early intervention to hang onto what you have as long as possible.  If you are not happy with the results, you can always see your doctor for a prescription of Finasteride.  Decide if you want to take the risks with the potential side effects.  This does seem to help when used in combination of the treatments mentioned above for SOME.</li>
    <li> Check main Ingredients then check Nizoral 2% dandruff shampoo.  It comes in a 10 oz bottle for 11.22.  Same actives same Salicylic acid.  I was very disappointed since the bottle I purchased didn&#x27;t describe this and once I posted this review the product was pulled from  Amazon and now re-listed differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for same results hit up Nizoral either at any pharmacy or large grocery store. Its been 2 months almost out of this bottle i been using rogaine for past 4 years and i have same results not losing not gaining.  I just think you can save money bye using the other product I used for a year then saw this fancy shampoo paid the extra and not seeing any miracles the others are claiming. Then when I first used the anti dandruff shampoos and rogaine together I saw a decrease of hair loss and I think I have stabilized now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my thinning hair and because I can&#x27;t find Nizoral for a decent price anywhere. I was happy to see that this product has 1% ketoconazole, same as Nizoral, plus alot of other beneficial ingredients.  However, I wish it was SLS free. I just started using so I will post an update in 3 months.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to know if it is growing hair.  But I do like the shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft and with body and I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am using this product recently and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is slowing the fall. If you continue this progress must quickly solve my problem of hair loss. My daughter is using and also taste great, as already noted improvement. Had taken several vitamins and had not solved anything, because I use too many chemicals in my hair and only a shampoo like this could solve my problem.</li>
    <li> I am having hair loss.  I purchased this item along with Minoxil for women.  I don&#x27;t feel that this shampoo did anything for my hair loss.  I also found that I can buy the same thing locally for much less.  This shampoo seem to do a fair job of cleaning my hair.  The scent is acceptable.  This item is not really a good value for the quantity of shampoo in the bottle.  I purchased this shampoo months ago.  I have used only this item when washing my hair because i wanted to see if it would cause any changed in my hair loss and regrowth.  It didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s OK.  But i wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Im 32 aged male. My hair started to fall from the front side since age 25 and then I considered hair products since 5 months ago. My hair is thin in the front side and baldness is taking place. Take also into consideration that I used to swim in the swimming pool every day for 2 years.  I used Vitamines, hair products and Monoxidile 15%. The Minoxidile is in the 3rd week of my usage so I wont consider that will affect me now. However I used vitamines and DHT blockers for 5 months but no effect and my hair looks a bit better but still falls down a little slower. I will continue however in this strong battle.  Now the shampoo. This shampoo gave me instant thickness, conditioning and good looking from the first time I used it. Its like my hair since 4 years back. WOW (more like therapy). I used Biotin shampoo but didnt have the same effect as this one at all. Now my hair is thicker better looking and easy to comb. It does say on the bottle to use Minoxidile for better and faster results. Maybe because its the same company that is selling the shampoo and the Minoxidile 15%.   Surely I will try to update this review, however I will give it some time and for the results its worth the price. For now its early to say anything about new hair regrowing.</li>
    <li> Dealing with MPB since a teenager; its been a long struggle; the market seems saturated with products that promise hair regrowth; I have tried them all; none seem to work very well; I was washing my hair with Ketoconazole 2% for a skin condition (RX ONLY at 2%); come to find out (Ketoconazole) may help in cases of male pattern baldness(MPB). I have been using this product for about six months, and I must admit I see more hair; I do combine it with 2%, prescription only; checked with health care provider before attempting; but so far I am excited about seen more hair growth; I suspect one day soon I must accept my DNA, but for now I am fighting. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a few short weeks,  but it is wonderful stuff. I&#x27;m a long time keto shampoo user and this one is my favorite so far. I&#x27;ve used Revita, Nizoral, and Regenepure and this one takes the cake. I got sick of DS Labs always messing around with the Revita formula, so I&#x27;m done with them. Regenepure was just so so. The Perfect Image shampoo leaves my hair looking and feeling the best. The only downfall is that it does contain sulfates, which some might take issue with.</li>
    <li> For starters I&#x27;m a real dude.. who wants real results and products like everyone else.  FIRST thing I like is I  got this 6 days early so I&#x27;m stoked about that...  SECOND I&#x27;ve only  been using this a day I haven&#x27;t seen results but the way this stuff makes your scalp feel is incredible.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people say their scalp gets dry ad blah blah get some type of lotion then or something  But my hair is just fine!  The smell is AMAZING, it smells like Peppermint with a small hint of chocolate or something haha  I was expecting some nasty medicine scent  Whether it works or not is really up to my body not the product but thus far I like what I&#x27;ve received  In another month or so I&#x27;ll write another one of these!</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was worried 6oz. wouldn&#x27;t be enough.A little bit goes a long way-it lathers up tremendously!It smells good and feels good on the scalp.I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since early September 2011 and I am very happy with it.  As a shampoo it is excellent in that it has all of the characteristics typically would want from a shampoo...  cleans hair, seems to soften the hair, no dandruff, and has a very pleasant mint fragrance.  More importantly it also appears to enhance the effect of the 15% Minoxidil hair growth treatment I&#x27;m using from the same manufacturer.  I can&#x27;t assess exactly how much effect it has been responsible for, versus just using 15% Minoxidil by itself, but inclined to think that it has increased the absorption due to the correlation in timing of adding use of shampoo with the 15%, and the corresponding increasing hair growth.  I think the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation for hair growth is to use the shampoo periodically during the week, but I just use it everyday since I like the shampoo aspects and fragrance.  Highly recommended.  If using for hair growth, I presume it requires use with Minoxidil as well.  If you do that, in my experience I would recommend going with the 15%, not 5% strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair regrowth shampoo by Perfect Image for a month now and I can tell a difference in the way it leaves my hair.  I use it in combination Perfect Image 15% monoxidil. For me there is no iching or flaking as I was experincing before using Perfect Image products. The shampoo words great but when I first received it I noticed that it was only 6 onches for $20, I thought \\&quot;this is not a good thing\\&quot;. After using it, about a quarter size, I realized that this shampoo will last a good while, with great results.  Thanks Perfect Image and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased the product in combination with the Minoxidil 3% I think the use of the products together is a good idea. But the shampoo feels so great on the scalp, tingling like it is working and the scalp feels so clean after use.</li>
    <li> Me siento muy satisfecho con la compra del producto llamado Hair Loss/ Regrowth Shampoo -Enhanced w/ Ketoconazole DHT Inhibitor, Saw palmetto, emu oil, biotin &amp; Scalp Exfoliating Agent Salicylic Acid for Greater Minoxidil Penetration 6oz / 180mL. Gracias por el excelente servicio brindado.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much i love this shampoo...I only used it for 3 weeks now in combination with a food supplement. i also bought \\&quot;nioxin intensive therapy\\&quot; and perfect image minoxidil.  It seems like i am seeing more new hair growths; I have tried other products before without much success so i am happy about these items.  regardless of the hair growth or keeping what I have, i just love the shampoo for my thin fine hair.  It is so light and doesnt weigh down the hair.  It feels great and shiny and bouncy. The smell is refreshing and feels like it cleans the scalp well.....i am going to continue to use this shampoo.  I am also going to continue to use the perfect image minoxidil 3% for women and take the nioxin tablets and see how i progress.  I want to mention the perfect image 3% for women is so much better than rogaine or off the shelf stuff.  My hair doesnt dry out and it doesnt get overly wet.  It goes on really nice without ruining my style....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am hopeful</li>
    <li> I have researched the best possible hair loss products and this one has obviously kept in touch with scientific advances on hair loss. The ingredients that are the best producers of hair re-growth are all here. Even my wife, who has hair loss problems due to a rare immune condition is seeing results. The packaging is professional and the smell of the product is just right. Highly recommended![..]</li>
    <li> I was told that Nizoral was the shampoo that I needed to find for relief from seborrhea, but it was not on the shelf in any store I looked for it. I found this product by googling \\&quot;ketoconazole\\&quot; &amp; with encouragement from a reviewer I bought it. I was EXTREMELY pleased with the results!!! In the first few days of use I noticed that my scalp was clear!!!. I have since discovered Nizoral &amp; tried it but of the two, PI smells better and leaves my hair/head refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with Perfect Image 15% minoxidil, so I can&#x27;t judge it solely on it&#x27;s own merits. I can say this is high quality shampoo with all the right ingredients and it gives my scalp a tingle.  It also smells minty like my usual go-to shampoo, Pureology, which is a very high quality shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it 3 days/week for two weeks and my hair feels and looks thick, dense and young.</li>
