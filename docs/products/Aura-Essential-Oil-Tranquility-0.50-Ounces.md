      <li>Smells amazing and calming.  </li>
      <li>It really calms me and &amp;#34;Tranquility&amp;#34; is a perfect name for it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like to combine my own oils</li>
      <li>Tranquility smells good in the bottle but even better in the diffuser.</li>
      <li>I have to be honest here - it came to me and the bottle was not sealed.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It smells VERY strongly of patchouli and nothing else.</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST, most relaxing blend of oils I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite blends.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Sublime... love the scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many brands of essential oils over the years, and prefer Aura Cacia the best.  </li>
      <li>Love this oil.  </li>
      <li>My favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this blend before and really love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this blend.  </li>
      <li>I have NEVER found anything more soothing than the blend of  lavender, balsam fir needle, patchouli, palmarosa, geranium and Roman chamomile.</li>
      <li>The smell of patchouli is way too overwhelming in this blend</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent for perfume, my massage room and oil warmers.  </li>
      <li>so lovely , great and fast shipping with a quality product that I always use&#x3D;&#x3D;Aura</li>
      <li>I love the brand.</li>
      <li>Love it in my bath with epsom salts.</li>
      <li>I consistently use and am very pleased with Aura Cacia brand oils.</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t know I had put it on my hand but for two drops to allow others to smell it, it must be strong.  </li>
      <li>Too strong a fragrance and made me sneeze...</li>
      <li>This scent soothes me very much, and it&#x27;s amazing in my humidifier.</li>
      <li>I guess the title is accurate.</li>
      <li>great seller and will be back</li>
      <li>what I received was cheap patchouli oil that was placed into the bottle by someone.</li>
      <li>I had individual oils and they were great.</li>
      <li>This was a new one for me, but I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>It smells soooo refreshing and peaceful.</li>
      <li>This smells so good that I use it daily.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite combination.</li>
      <li>This blend is sweet and relaxing.</li>
      <li>It is a strong geranium oil scent which is fine with me as I love geranium essential oil.  </li>
      <li>It only takes three drops of this oil for a large load and the clothes have a nice, light scent.  </li>
      <li>Buy individual oils and make your own mix.</li>
      <li>like many of the Aura blends, [[ASIN:B001E6RM3M Aura Cacia Essential Solutions Oil Blend, Chill Pill, 0.5 fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]] is another good one--more orange and mint and patchouli.</li>
      <li>but this is by far my favorite oil blend that you can buy.  </li>
      <li>In particular, I enjoy the geranium scent.</li>
      <li>A very strong essential oil that packs punch.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this oil for at least 10 years, and it by far the best blend for calming.  </li>
      <li>The Tranquility is more prominently lavender, but not overwhelmingly</li>
      <li>When trying to open the bottle, the top gets stuck to the dropper, almost as if the dropper was removed and something else put in it&#x27;s place.</li>
      <li>I like to put  10-12 drops in a hot bath.</li>
      <li>To do a 21 Day Spa Plan using the recommended essential oils, the cost was getting more than desirable.  </li>
      <li>loooooove this scent so much!</li>
      <li>My house smells like a spa and even my teenage boys like it. :)</li>
      <li>Everyone comments on how lovely this relaxing essential oil blend is when I pop it in the diffuser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively mild and the high notes are lavender and peppermint.</li>
      <li>I also waft it as a calamative; two deep inhales by a fussy toddler at bedtime helps him reach sound slumber quickly and reliably.</li>
      <li>I use these to make lotions and perfumes and absolutely adore this scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>However I couldn&#x27;t smell much else.  </li>
      <li>It is a very calming scent and works well in my diffuser.</li>
      <li>It is a bit of a camphor scent, or citronella, and is very pungent.  </li>
      <li>Today I happened to be in a Whole Foods and saw this on their shelf</li>
      <li>very calming and &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; scent</li>
      <li>Like the name says, the scent is very relaxing.  </li>
      <li>It has a soothing, but slightly spicy scent that is excellent in oil burners, foot soaks, and numerous other applications.</li>
      <li>I just started using essential oils for various &#x27;afflictions&#x27;:-)</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia knows just the right amount of drops of each essential oil in order to obtain a quality fragrance at the fraction of the cost of separate oils for one particular use in the spa plan.  </li>
      <li>Sprinkle a few drops on the floor of a steamy shower and your whole barhroom will be filled with a comforting spa-like aroma.</li>
      <li>Although the aroma is pleasant enough, but use only few drops to avoid over saturating your room.  </li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it in our diffuser, in a room/body spray, and in my homemade handsoap.</li>
      <li>It had the nuances of the essential oils listed in it and it was subtle and nice.</li>
      <li>sounded great but made my daughter and I both sick as we smelled it from the diffuser</li>
      <li>a little intense scent</li>

    <li> This is by far the BEST, most relaxing blend of oils I&#x27;ve ever found. All my clients comment on how relaxed they feel when they smell this amazing oil.</li>
    <li> I just started using essential oils for various &#x27;afflictions&#x27;:-) I use this for insomnia and have been using for a few weeks. May be a placebo but by George it appears to be working!!!!</li>
    <li> Was what I wanted great</li>
    <li> This is my go to as a perfume, stress reliever, diffused scent and additive to lotion… I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> This smells so good that I use it daily.  I will continue to buy this scent-it is so calming and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love the scent! My doctor used this one day when I was in his office and began to cry. It is a pleasant caliming scent, now I use it at home.</li>
    <li> A very strong essential oil that packs punch.  Although the aroma is pleasant enough, but use only few drops to avoid over saturating your room.  When this product first arrived I filled a aroma diffuser with about 10 drops and got a terrible headache from the lingering aroma.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the fragrance lingers. I mix according to the directions or just whiff the bottle. Arrived on time,a aged well.</li>
    <li> a little intense scent but it did help me go to sleep</li>
    <li> This blend has been around for years (I think over 20) and for a while, I thought it might be discontinued but it&#x27;s back. I have NEVER found anything more soothing than the blend of  lavender, balsam fir needle, patchouli, palmarosa, geranium and Roman chamomile. In particular, I enjoy the geranium scent. It&#x27;s supposed to create a mood of tranquility and I find this calms me down amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like many of the Aura blends, [[ASIN:B001E6RM3M Aura Cacia Essential Solutions Oil Blend, Chill Pill, 0.5 fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]] is another good one--more orange and mint and patchouli. The Tranquility is more prominently lavender, but not overwhelmingly ONLY lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this for years and I&#x27;m never without a bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this stuff!! Have for years!</li>
    <li> Everyone comments on how lovely this relaxing essential oil blend is when I pop it in the diffuser. It&#x27;s relatively mild and the high notes are lavender and peppermint. I also waft it as a calamative; two deep inhales by a fussy toddler at bedtime helps him reach sound slumber quickly and reliably. Sprinkle a few drops on the floor of a steamy shower and your whole barhroom will be filled with a comforting spa-like aroma. Great product!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Sublime... love the scent.</li>
    <li> I consistently use and am very pleased with Aura Cacia brand oils. This was a new one for me, but I&#x27;m very pleased. It has a soothing, but slightly spicy scent that is excellent in oil burners, foot soaks, and numerous other applications. I am very happy with it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many brands of essential oils over the years, and prefer Aura Cacia the best.  I&#x27;ve had this blend before and really love it.  Like the name says, the scent is very relaxing.  A little bit goes a long way.  I like to put  10-12 drops in a hot bath.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent for perfume, my massage room and oil warmers.  It is always a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; scent and never smells artificial.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased Energize, Inspiration, Tranquility and Heart Song by Aura Cacia. Now. I love the brand. I had individual oils and they were great. I had room mist with cinnamon and ylang ylang and it was great. I used all 4 of these mixes and they all smell the same: citrus/eucalyptus/rosemary. I mean it can wake you up allright, but definitely not gentle enough to inspire, create a romantic mood or promote peace. Not a fan. Buy individual oils and make your own mix. Avoid these.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell good at all. Smells like sour dish rags</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  My favorite.  Totally mellows me out.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent and good company! I use these to make lotions and perfumes and absolutely adore this scent. I love Aura Cacia products and feel they are one of the best for the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in my massage therapy practice for over 20 years!  Loved it then, love it now!!  (mixes well in lotions, oils, laundry rinse cycles and bath salts!)</li>
    <li> sounded great but made my daughter and I both sick as we smelled it from the diffuser</li>
    <li> To do a 21 Day Spa Plan using the recommended essential oils, the cost was getting more than desirable.  So instead, I looked to Aura Cacia, whose products I have used for at least 45 years.  Found this blend TRANQUILITY which equals several separate bottles of essential oil.  Aura Cacia knows just the right amount of drops of each essential oil in order to obtain a quality fragrance at the fraction of the cost of separate oils for one particular use in the spa plan.  Thank You Amazon.com.  You were there to help making shopping and saving a good time.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have always been very satisfied with this brand and the Tranquility scent was no exception. It is a very calming scent and works well in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> This blend is sweet and relaxing. One of my clients came into the massage room and said &amp;#34;It smells so tranquil in here&amp;#34; and she didn&#x27;t even know the name of the blend, so I guess the title is accurate. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells like lavender like the other two I bought of different calming scents.</li>
    <li> I like to combine my own oils but this is by far my favorite oil blend that you can buy.  I use it before bed and at work.  So relaxing!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blend, the smell is everything I was looking for, it truly smells like a day at the spa! I love it!</li>
    <li> so lovely , great and fast shipping with a quality product that I always use&#x3D;&#x3D;Aura Cacia...great seller and will be back</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t smell as good as I had hoped it would.  It is a strong geranium oil scent which is fine with me as I love geranium essential oil.  However I couldn&#x27;t smell much else.  There is a slight sour note in this mixed with the geranium.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again although I do like this company&#x27;s oils.  I will be using this, as it is mostly pleasant, just not as great as I had hoped it would be.  It is a bit of a camphor scent, or citronella, and is very pungent.  I can&#x27;t pick out any lavander or fir notes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put two drops on my hand when I opened this in a dentist&#x27;s waiting room and the assistant said to me I smelled like I had been at the spa.  She didn&#x27;t know I had put it on my hand but for two drops to allow others to smell it, it must be strong.  And it does indeed smell like some spas, so that is a good thing.  I am hoping it will grow on me as I get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took three weeks to arrive from the company.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday when I make my bed.&lt;br /&gt;Take a wash cloth and a few drops of tranquility and stroke your sheets with the cloth so the tranquility infuses the cotton and transfers into your sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Dreams</li>
    <li> very calming and &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; scent</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and calming.  My home is scented like a fancy spa now!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and helps us get to sleep. I purchase this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for at least 10 years, and it by far the best blend for calming.  Some of the calming blends, when added to the bath, burn the skin, but this doesn&#x27;t.  I put it in the bath, diffuser, in lotions, and on lamp shades.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> I love this blend.  Will buy it over and over. The &amp;#34;5 oz&amp;#34; advert must be a typo!  I expected .5 oz, and that&#x27;s what I got.  :)</li>
    <li> I use this to give my laundry a light and pleasant scent as opposed to fabric softener which is horrible with all its irritating chemicals.  It only takes three drops of this oil for a large load and the clothes have a nice, light scent.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> I have to be honest here - it came to me and the bottle was not sealed. I thought that to be odd, but said, whatever let&#x27;s try it. It smells VERY strongly of patchouli and nothing else. I also thought this was odd. When trying to open the bottle, the top gets stuck to the dropper, almost as if the dropper was removed and something else put in it&#x27;s place. I found all of this suspicious, but thought I was possibly wrong. Today I happened to be in a Whole Foods and saw this on their shelf and I tested out the scent. It smells NOTHING like what I was sent. It had the nuances of the essential oils listed in it and it was subtle and nice. What I have is only Patchouli, which I HATE and I have to think that I was charged for a bottle of Aura Cacia Tranquility and what I received was cheap patchouli oil that was placed into the bottle by someone. Not happy and I am throwing out the bottle today. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! My house smells like a spa and even my teenage boys like it. :)</li>
    <li> Incredible smelling. This scent soothes me very much, and it&#x27;s amazing in my humidifier.</li>
    <li> Too strong a fragrance and made me sneeze...I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting 6 drops of Aura Cacai&#x27;s Tranquility with 80 ml of water in my Riverock Deneve essential oil diffuser. This is my absolute favorite combination. Tranquility smells good in the bottle but even better in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite blends.</li>
    <li> The smell of patchouli is way too overwhelming in this blend</li>
    <li> We have used  this product for many years, does not disappoint  - just the supplier was disappointing</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Love it in my bath with epsom salts.</li>
    <li> My sister uses Aura Cacia Tranquility in her stained glass shop.  Walking in to the aroma pulls me in to beautiful environment that she has created.  I use it in my cottage house to create an ambiance of comfort and relaxation.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing! So far, I&#x27;ve used it in our diffuser, in a room/body spray, and in my homemade handsoap. It smells soooo refreshing and peaceful. It really calms me and &amp;#34;Tranquility&amp;#34; is a perfect name for it!&lt;br /&gt;I loooooove this scent so much!</li>
