      <li>Love the smell of this stuff!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see it online.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, works so</li>
      <li>It was and is the most popular.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this.</li>
      <li>Been using it for many many years.</li>
      <li>MANY others</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many deodorants.</li>
      <li>many.....</li>
      <li>This scent has been my favorite</li>
      <li>I Love This Deodorant</li>
      <li>I love this scent of degree and cannot find it at any store anymore.</li>
      <li>Order it here, online since they have stopped carrying this scent in stores for the most part.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent of deodorant, after trying so many over the years, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like 19 out of 20 do.  </li>
      <li>I loveeeee the smell which makes you feel nice and clean after a shower.</li>
      <li>but the smell was overpoweringly strong.</li>
      <li>I frequent, so I am glad to be able to buy it on here from Amazon  </li>
      <li>I had also once tried pure satin which seemed to work better</li>
      <li>Thanks for having this available!</li>
      <li>I love the Degree Pure Rain product, but two out of the four items that were delivered in my package were the Linen Fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, especially when I&#x27;m having a hot sweaty day!!!</li>
      <li>Pure Rain is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>PURE CLEAN should have been discontinued.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>This is the only one I have been able to use with no problems.</li>
      <li>The scent kind of reminds me of Juicy Fruit gum, but other people have told me that they smell vanilla cake when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I normally get it in the store, but wanted to buy bulk</li>
      <li>Get this if you love the moisturizing ability of Dove anti-antiperspirant, you don&#x27;t care for the heavy zebra stripes</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product boasts on the label about being amazing for not leaving white marks on clothing because I gave it a try for a few weeks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, which I&#x27;ve only ever also found in Dove brand (which leaves much heavier marks on clothing).  </li>
      <li>Smells really good and keeps me from smelling bad all day long :)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it for the ultra clear properties, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any marks on shirts after all this time.</li>
      <li>While it leaves less marks than other non-gel deodorants, it still can leave a mark if you&#x27;re not careful (though, with a little water they easily rub off).  </li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product boasts on the label about being amazing for not leaving white marks on clothing because I gave it a try for a few weeks and now I&#x27;m scrubbing white crap out of my shirts. It smells nice, works so-so but does not last through the evening. I had also once tried pure satin which seemed to work better but the smell was overpoweringly strong. Once again, I decide to stick with Secret invisible gel I&#x27;ve been using forever. I gave it 2 stars since it works for an average work day to keep you from stinking.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I can use, due to sensitive skin. Glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Been using it for many many years. Works great. I loveeeee the smell which makes you feel nice and clean after a shower. Order it here, online since they have stopped carrying this scent in stores for the most part.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Not over powering</li>
    <li> Dear Degree,&lt;br /&gt;please re~start making this scent AND formula again. It was and is the most popular. No did,and barely does purchase the other &amp;#34;li&#x27;l black dress scent&amp;#34; ,it&#x27;s horrible..PLEASE RE~START THE &amp;#34;LIKE RAIN SCENT&amp;#34;, again.&lt;br /&gt;thanks and I pray u take mine n many.....MANY others advice,&lt;br /&gt;Julie J&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Have any lying around the Degree facility,you may send them to me!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;jjoyner82@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Wish this was still sold on the East coast</li>
    <li> I Love This Deodorant</li>
    <li> Just what I was after, I love this product, had to order it into NZ after discovering in USA! Arrived quickly, packed well and perfect condition</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent of deodorant, after trying so many over the years, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like 19 out of 20 do.  They no longer  carry this scent in any of the stores I frequent, so I am glad to be able to buy it on here from Amazon  The scent kind of reminds me of Juicy Fruit gum, but other people have told me that they smell vanilla cake when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and keeps me from smelling bad all day long :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why this product would be discontinued. PURE CLEAN should have been discontinued. Not this one.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many deodorants. This is the only one I have been able to use with no problems. Thanks for having this available!</li>
    <li> Degree Ultra clear is getting harder and harder to find -- thank you for offering this in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; so I can stock up on it.</li>
    <li> This scent has been my favorite and I haven&#x27;t found it in stores in years, and I was thrilled to see it online.  Came quick and the smell is just as great as I remember it!!</li>
    <li> This product is discontinued, so stock up online while you can.  Smells soooo good.  I was so sad when they took it off the market.</li>
    <li> One of the best-smelling (non-offensive) deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used.  While it leaves less marks than other non-gel deodorants, it still can leave a mark if you&#x27;re not careful (though, with a little water they easily rub off).  It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, which I&#x27;ve only ever also found in Dove brand (which leaves much heavier marks on clothing).  Get this if you love the moisturizing ability of Dove anti-antiperspirant, you don&#x27;t care for the heavy zebra stripes Dove leaves behind, and you prefer deodorant that DOESN&#x27;T smell like soap, perfume, or baby powder.</li>
    <li> I love this scent of degree and cannot find it at any store anymore.</li>
    <li> It does not work.  I am having the worst time finding a deodorant which works, does not take a year to dry and does not create a film all over clothes.</li>
    <li> I love the Degree Pure Rain product, but two out of the four items that were delivered in my package were the Linen Fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Try the motionsense ones.</li>
    <li> it does though leave some white streaks.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff!</li>
    <li> This fails to live up to its promise. It works as a deodorant but leaves white marks. I&#x27;m looking for something else. Do not buy this if you want an invisible  deodorant</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve swapped brands for many years trying to find what works best for me. Once I decided on these Degree lines, I tried the different scents. Pure Rain is my absolute favorite. I love the smell, especially when I&#x27;m having a hot sweaty day!!! I don&#x27;t use it for the ultra clear properties, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any marks on shirts after all this time. I normally get it in the store, but wanted to buy bulk so I bought it on Amazon.</li>
