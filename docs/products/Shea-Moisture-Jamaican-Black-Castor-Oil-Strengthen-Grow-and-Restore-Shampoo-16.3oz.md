<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Target&#x27;s website has this product for $ 10.99 + free shipping for the holiday season, but since it&#x27;s been out of stock for two weeks I finally gave in and just bought it from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells just like play-doh with a hint of vanilla and shea butter. I washed my hair two days ago with it and my hair still smells sweet, but now it&#x27;s more of a cake-batter kind of smell with that underlying castor oil. It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, so nothing I can complain about. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super dry, crusty, tangle-y 4c hair, and with all these lovely traits, it&#x27;s prone to breaking if I&#x27;m too rough on it. This shampoo gave me slip - I repeat, a SHAMPOO gave me SLIP on my TUMBLEWEED of a mane - and I didn&#x27;t want to stop running my fingers through the suds! It lathers and rinses out really well, too. AND, as if all that wasn&#x27;t great enough, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to: clarifies your hair til it&#x27;s squeaky clean but still leaves it extremely moisturized. I kept rinsing even after the shampoo was gone because it felt so smooth I thought there must have still been product in there. And, let me tell you, the buildup was G-O-N-E. I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in three weeks  because I was counting on Target to restock (lmao) but after using this, my hair felt brand new! It felt - and still feels - like I was conditioning my hair rather than washing! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product! This is the first Shea Moisture item I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ll definitely be coming back for conditioner.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and cleanses without stripping, this bottle will last awhile.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair look like it had not been  cleaned for several days.... Discontinued the use and  will find some one that  would like to have it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok , it smells like a crayon.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not good shampoo, it just doesn&#x27;t leave my particular hair the way i like it.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of takes the body out of my hair and leaves it feeling, not greasy, but not super clean either.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but that&#x27;s about it. I used it for two weeks before finally giving up. I have very fine hair. This shampoo made it feel thicker, but goopy all at the same time. No way could I run my fingers through it. It was easy to tangle and extremely hard to style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I already see and feel a difference in my hair. I don&#x27;t even need conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this company.  No animal testing. This makes my hair feel clean and soft.  I buy their lotion too.  And face cream.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Hair smells good feels soft and clean and I feel better with this product!</li>
    <li> leaves hair feeling super clean</li>
    <li> I originally got the shampoo at Ulta on sale two bottles for $10 so I tried it since it was sulfate free and I have a keratin treatment in my hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure but I thought why not, it&#x27;s super cheap and it&#x27;s sulfate free. Anyway I was absolutely surprised at how clean it got my hair without stripping anything or making it dry. I have been unable to find it since then, my Ulta is not caring it anymore so I was very happy to find it on Amazon! I would recommend this to anyone-you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to get a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great and non striping on hair. I paid about $16 on Amazon but it&#x27;s priced about  $9.99 in target or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves hair feeling healthy and silky</li>
    <li> Love to find products with Castor Oil in it.. This shampoo is very well done, leaves my hair and scalp moisturized, feeling light and full.  People were saying not to use it as it will turn your hair dark because of the castor oil..  My light strawberry blond hair has not darken&#x27;d.  don&#x27;t need to use a lot, and I am on my second bottle.. Love the results washing my hair once a week or longer..  If your body does well on castor oil products then you will appreciate how well formulated this shampoo is.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, it does magic to my hair. It helps stop the shedding and it is truly moisturizing.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo and the masque too. Bought this line when Walgreens was having a BOGO sale figuring I didn&#x27;t have much to lose if it didn&#x27;t work out. Was attracted to the combo of castor oil, apple cider vinegar and peppermint oil to address my problematic scalp (pretty sure it&#x27;s eczema). So I&#x27;m always on the hunt for natural products and had been doing a castor oil treatment the night before washing for a year plus. Took the shampoo and masque to the hair salon and both my stylist and I immediately liked the fact that there was no ACV scent. The fragrance is pleasant and it definitely clears the build-up while also moisturizing the scalp and hair. The masque is heavenly. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and my hair is looking great but time will tell if it results in significant growth.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONE TIME,SO FAR ,SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo yet.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I started using this shampoo after I cut my locs and wow! My hair has really taken off. Shea moisture my going natural easy</li>
    <li> Go to your local target Walgreens or Cvs and buy this 17.99 is too much. Or order it @ sheamoisture.com</li>
    <li> I really do not like the smell at all. It smells like play doh and kinda like syrup but the outcome of the first time I&#x27;ve used the shampoo is highly amazing. I love it so far and only used it once. Does anyone know what essential oils I could put in it to change the smell?</li>
    <li> Although I have not seen significant results, I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4C hair. I have been natural for three years now and every shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, even the shea moisture (regular) line, my hair felt stripped and dry. But after using this shampoo,my hair did not feel stripped and squeaky clean; rather, it felt soft and moisturized. My scalp was clean as well. I have been using this product weekly for 2 weeks and my hair feels soft and moisturized. I recommend this product for any one who has dry hair especially after washing.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo lots of suds just received.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo along with SheaMoisture Black Castor Oil Conditioner for not quite a month and it seems as my hair is getting more volume. I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week. Before I was able to go without a wash for a week. The shampoo/conditioner seems to make my hair greasy quicker. At this point this is not a big deal for me as long as I see regrowth.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and makes my hair softer but I had a lot of shrinkage.</li>
    <li> I LOVE what the product does. I&#x27;ve been natural going on 5 years now and have been struggling trying to fine what works for me. I finally found it in this shampoo. Its perfect! It cleans and does not strip the hair. Leave my scalp feeling squeaky clean (literally). I don&#x27;t know my type of natural hair but it works great for me. I wash my hair roughly every 2-4 weeks. This product lifts all of the build up on my scalp. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used to date it leaves my hair super soft and its sulfate free what else can you ask for, I will keep buying this and the Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Shampoo both really good.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to enjoy this shampoo but I just did not. Prior to using this shampoo I was doing ACV rinses to remove buildup and cleanse my hair. I am a Shea Moisture junkie and saw this shampoo and the ingredient list immediately pulled me in. I love JBCO and it makes my hair incredibly soft. I was already clarifying my hair with ACV, so I thought, why not? And it has Shea Butter to moisturize the hair, which is amazing because my hair is extremely dry. What could possibly go wrong? Here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used it, my hair felt really dry, which was no surprise to me because even when shampoos say &#x27;moisturizing&#x27;, they still tend to dry my hair out. My biggest turn off was how dirty my hair still felt after washing my hair. I do not stretch my washes out very long because I can&#x27;t (I have dermatitis and psoriasis) so there is not much product build up when I do wash my hair, which is 1-2 times a week. The shampoo made my hair feel very gritty which has never happened before when using a shampoo. After conditioning, deep conditioning (using the masque from the same line), and applying my usual products (leave-in and oil) my hair felt dirty as if I hadn&#x27;t washed the previous products out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product two stars because I still think the ingredient list is great and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dry and straw-like!  I will never use it again.  I multiracial with long, curly hair and my natural curls and ringlets are GONE.  I&#x27;ve been brushing it way too much just to get the knotty tangles out.  I tried rewashing, but no haps.  Pic is BEFORE I started using SM.  Now it&#x27;s a stringy mess.</li>
    <li> You must try this as a day-by-day shampoo! I like-it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for Shea Moisture products much but this is a great product!! Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair or leave it dry. Lathers great &amp; smells great too (kinda like vanilla)! I wouldn&#x27;t buy from amazon though. It&#x27;s carried in Sally&#x27;s Beauty, CVS &amp; Ulta for half the price, even better when you can catch a sale. I really love the leave in conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, doesn&#x27;t stripe my hair</li>
    <li> This is a sulfate free clarifying shampoo, a rarity for those of us with color treated hair or oily or sensitive scalps.  It smells wonderful, clean and very fresh.  It also contains apple cider vinegar which creates shine and removes buildup.  I used to use Ion sulfate free clarifying shampoo but it took too much shampoo to create a decent lather.  This shampoo is different.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to create lather and if you leave it on for 5 minutes, it definitely gives you bouncy, shiny, very clean hair.  I bought my bottle at Ulta for $11 so the price on Amazon is a bit high.  This is a bigger bottle than usual, with 25% more, supposedly, free.  It will last quite a while.  I don&#x27;t know about the potential of this shampoo to encourage hair growth but it does leave my hair really  clean  and removing excess oil and product buildup certainly can&#x27;t hurt the growth factor. I use this shampoo once every two weeks and my color has never looked better.  I have demi permanent color as well as a regular permanent color on my hair and this shampoo keeps the color fresh and bright. I use a considerable amount of hairspray on my hair when I wear it down or in an updo so buildup is usually a problem. It weighs my hair down and eventually makes it sticky. This shampoo removes it completely.  I&#x27;d been told that apple cider vinegar would leave my hair buildup free but I was adverse to smelling like a salad, lol!  The fragrance of this shampoo is light and fresh with a hint of the ACV but it&#x27;s not overpowering and the lather is luxurious.  I don&#x27;t think it smells like play-doh though, like one other reviewer has said.  I was new to Shea Moisture products when I spotted this shampoo in the store, but I happened to notice that it was a sulfate free clarifying formula and decided to to try it.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive at all and I figured what is the worst that can happen?  At Ulta you can always return items that don&#x27;t work, so it wasn&#x27;t a risky venture at all.  But I love this!  The next day my hair was bouncy, light and very shiny and the color looked amazing.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this.  Since that time, I have become a regular SM user.  I love the Manuka Honey formula shampoo and conditioner (only at Target and Ulta) which hydrates my hair without weighing it down and smells like wildflower honey.  I love it.  I also love the Tahitian Noni formula as well as the SM masks, which work great when used with heat.  The Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo is one of my holy grail products.  I highly recommend it.ext day my hair was bouncy, light and very shiny and the color looked amazing.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this.  Since that time, I have become a regular SM user.  I love the Manuka Honey formula shampoo and conditioner (only at Target and Ulta) which hydrates my hair without weighing it down and smells like wildflower honey.  I love it.

    <li> Great shampoo! It sofens and strengthens my hair, plus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> i bought the whole line from SheaMoisture.com! I love it! Makes my hair soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
    <li> Amazing for my scalp! I love the entire shea moisture line!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo ever since I started using it my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out. It&#x27;s incredible but I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often.</li>
    <li> This hair care line is my current obsession. I have type 2b hair and this product does a great job at removing build up, promoting hair growth, and keeping my hair healthy. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but the results are simply amazing. For this price and for the time it lasts it is very well worth it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with an all natural product that makes your hair feel great!</li>
    <li> Hair has improved a lot, not drying, started using this since May 2015 and have really liked it, even bought backups</li>
    <li> Found this at Ulta 10.99 regular price.</li>
    <li> I am currently in the desert, and this shampoo is by far the best I have used in the past year, and NEEDED at this point and time.  I narrowed down all my options before buying a shampoo.  Glad I went with this.  I was excited for the shea butter and apple cider vinegar, since I cannot buy any where I am..It left my hair soft, and very clean.  I needed something that would help add some juice to these strands and I am going to keep using it.  I have only used it once so far, so after a month we will see if it keeps up the good work.  But definitely a plus for people with natural hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and cleans hair. My hair has never been so shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> great product. Love  it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if i got a bad batch but i just used this stuff and my hair stiffened up, got tangled and lots of my hair came out. Im returning it today! I never had this experience with ANY  shea moisture shampoos</li>
    <li> Smells really good, has a light lather to it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! It left my hair so soft and moisturized. (Smells good too.) It also removed all the buildup/residue from my locs. So glad I finally found a shampoo that gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING!!! My hair has never been so soft after washing. This has officially become a staple in my hair care routine.  For reference, I am 4b/c.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Worked wonders on my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great line of products. This formula is till new to me but I love the fact that it has all of my favorite items included (vinegar, jamaican black castor oil,etc)</li>
    <li> So far so good. Light pleasant scent and moisturises my hair.</li>
    <li> making my hair seem thicker</li>
    <li> I use it only on my scalp about once a month .. I&#x27;m not a shampoo person, I use cleansing conditioners &amp; cowashes only on my hair. But I like this shampoo on my scalp only cause it gets it clean 😀</li>
    <li> Just love. Smell good and excellent for my locs!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural/organic shampoos and conditioners for about 5 years. Some shampoos were fairly decent, but most left my long, thick, caucasian hair feeling brittle and like straw. For those of you trying to find alternatives to chemical laden products I&#x27;m sure you know the matted, brittle mess I&#x27;m talking about. This shampoo was such an unexpected delight and completely surprised me with the way it performs. Loads of lather, but most importantly, my hair has never felt so clean, silky smooth and tangle free while washing.  I was in the habit of washing my hair once a week and just rinsing well with a light conditioner daily so I didn&#x27;t have to put my hair through breakage trying to comb out massive tangles other shampoos would create. Unfortunately, the organic conditioners that actually worked for a daily rinse left my scalp and hair feeling a little waxy no matter how little I used or how well I rinsed it out. This shampoo took care of that feeling on the first wash without making my hair feel stripped of any natural oils.  As to the scent - everyone is going to have their own take on it. I find it to be a little earthy, subtle and quite pleasant. It keeps my scalp and hair in balance and feeling incredibly healthy with no color fade. The shampoo itself is a light brown in color and thinner in consistency than most shampoos. Not thin to the point it runs off my palm before applying, but don&#x27;t expect a thick shampoo. It takes a little less than the size of a quarter to give me a luxurious lather that covers the entire length of my hair (mid back and very thick hair). A little goes a very long way.  For my specific hair type this shampoo isn&#x27;t just Ok, it&#x27;s something I now stock up on and wouldn&#x27;t be without. I had quite a few hit and miss shampoos/conditioners and they went to friends and family who have different hair types and wanted to try them. This shampoo along with the matching conditioner and the Manuka Honey shampoo &amp; conditioner are the only haircare products in my cupboard now. But this is my go to and absolute favorite. I purchase from Ulta which is a little less expensive and often offers BOGO.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used, by a long shot! I&#x27;ve got thick hair with 3b curls and brillo-style frizz. Shampooing with this, my hair has slip, ZERO tangles and it gets my scalp clean--which is hard with such thick hair.  At the same time, it is gentle.  It could work on its own without conditioner, but I use a little of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey conditioner on the length and ends for good measure. It&#x27;s been a wonderful combo for me.</li>
    <li> I read about this shampoo online and saw the great reviews it was getting.  I agree.  It is a marvelous shampoo - leaves my hair shiny and very manageable.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on the strengthening, but I am confident it will. I like this shampoo very much and would recommend anyone to try it too. I really like all the Shea Moisture products. They are great quality.</li>
    <li> I have a crazy mix curl pattern hair type ( 2b, 3b, 3c) that was dry and lifeless , scalp issues as well and ever since I&#x27;m using this shampoo the overall health of hair and scalp is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried every product u can think of and none did for my hair what this have. My hair is healthier and scalp is too. Smells good and cleans ur hair without stripping it. Scent is mild ( like caramel? )</li>
    <li> This shampoo hands down is these best shampoo I have used. I have been on this crazy and sometimes depressing hair journey for 10 yes and counting. Still can&#x27;t get a steady regimen but one for certain this will be my shampoo as long as the recipe don&#x27;t change. I still intend to co wash mid week but once a week I intend to shampoo with this. I have short 4b hair, and usually I a shampoo, my hair will feel so stripped, like it was going to snap but not with this shampoo.my has moisture and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it. Now I am trying some of the other products on this line and so far I am not a huge fan. But this shampoo. Wow, I plan to stock up the next time its on sale.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the second time I used it the oil came out in clumps.  The oil separated from the shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know if this is what was suppose to happen but I did not like it.  The oil ran down my arm the sink the tub  I was not pleased.  Lots of lather but very messy.</li>
    <li> I got this product when I had a bald head, using this shampoo along with other Shea Moisturizing product such as &amp;#34;curl and style gel shufelt (to seal in the moisture).&amp;#34; In three short months, I have an afro that I could style, if I choose, but I dont because I like the nappy, curly, spirally look. SMJBCO is used best once, twice, or maybe three times a month; for me: once a month, with a co-wash conditioner (Shea Moisture Product) once a week. Resulting in rapid growth and moisturized hair. By the by, use cool water with products.&lt;br /&gt;Before: nappy, dry, fizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;After: Nappy/curly moisturize hair.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice, I really like this shampoo</li>
    <li> A little smaller than what I expected but I like the way it cleans my hair...</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is so soft when I use this. I have natural african american hair (I have no idea what texture because I don&#x27;t get into all of that but it&#x27;s soft/course). This is great! Try it! You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> SHEA MOISTURE JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL,MADE MY HAIR SOFTER.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! It leaves my relaxed hair so soft and manageable!!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.I&#x27;ve tried them all. But nothing compares to this one. My hair is super curly, thick, dry, frizzy, all at same time. This shampoo DEtANGLES my hair and leaves it Sooo smooth, clean and even makes my curls look better.When I straighten my hair after using this shampoo , my hair is so silky.I love this shampoo and can&#x27;t believe I wasted time&amp;money on other shampoos that were harsh; &amp;added chemicals that were not benefiting my hair in any way. Knowing that it has so many natural ingredients that help my hair grow is a PLUS.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast.  I don&#x27;t really notice a difference with the product.  However, this is my first time trying this shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to give it some time.</li>
    <li> This is the biggest bottle ever, and the shipper was quick, always ordering this product from them. Plus it works for me, it cleans my hair nicely with no residue and its soft.</li>
