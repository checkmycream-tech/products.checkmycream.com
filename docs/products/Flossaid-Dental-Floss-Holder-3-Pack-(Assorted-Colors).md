      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with everything.</li>
      <li>My order was processed and shipped very quickly, and it arrived much more quickly than I would have anticipated.</li>
      <li>Because these make flossing convenient, I do it twice daily and as a result my good dental health saves thousands of dollars in dental work that is avoided by brushing and flossing.</li>
      <li>It is just so much easier and faster to floss the good old fashioned way.</li>
      <li>outstanding quality--far better than earlier verisons</li>
      <li>Yes, they break once in awhile, but they are worth it.</li>
      <li>My experience is that flossing without these is a waste of time; these holders make flossing quick, easy and effective.  </li>

      <li>This makes it much easier</li>
      <li>I had to use more floss than normal and it kept coming loose.</li>
      <li>I thought it might be too wide to use comfortably but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem either.</li>
      <li>I got this in hopes that I could save some plastic from going to the landfill by switching from the disposable flossers, but I&#x27;ve gone right back to using them.</li>
      <li>The Flossaid works as well, is easy to find on Amazon, and costs less.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the GUM brand floss holder, it works OK but is too small for me ...</li>
      <li>I mean, the thing is huge.</li>

    <li> Good product, both design and performance</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I have very tightly spaced teeth and flossing by hand is difficult. This makes it much easier so I do it much more regularly. As long as you properly tension the floss when you put it on, there are no problems with it popping off or anything like that. I thought it might be too wide to use comfortably but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem either.</li>
    <li> Garbage, threw them in the trash.  Absolutely useless!!</li>
    <li> I have used this FlossAid holder since 1976. Yes, they break once in awhile, but they are worth it. I&#x27;ve tried the GUM brand floss holder, it works OK but is too small for me ... oh, and given time they will break too. I use waxed tape. You can use the floss you please. Great product.</li>
    <li> Tank you for you order.</li>
    <li> It is just so much easier and faster to floss the good old fashioned way. I had to use more floss than normal and it kept coming loose.</li>
    <li> Floss keeps coming off the groove. Flimsy plastic.</li>
    <li> outstanding quality--far better than earlier verisons</li>
    <li> Work exactly as advertised. Well made. Large, fits adult hands easily.</li>
    <li> works pretty much as advertised... had to use it a couple of times to get the hang of it; now it&#x27;s my go to floss aid ... seems to be made from a durable plastic that should last if not abused... would recommend it to someone with floss finger issues and a little patience...</li>
    <li> I hjad been using the GUM/Bulter flossers and liked them  But they break after a few months.  They have also become more expensive and harder to find.

    <li> They were delivered ahead of schedule. I&#x27;m pleased with everything.</li>

    <li> Just as promised and timely.</li>
    <li> The tongs at the end are ridiculously wide spaced. I mean, the thing is huge.

    <li> I have bought these before.  They are exactly what I need.  I like the product, and it comes just as advertised.</li>
    <li> great price, great product.</li>
