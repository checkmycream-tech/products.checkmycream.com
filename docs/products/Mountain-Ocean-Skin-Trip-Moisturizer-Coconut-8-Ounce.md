<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than thirty years and I LOVE it. The aroma is subtle and the lotion is not oily at all. Try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love &amp;#34;Skin Trip&amp;#34; lotion.  My sister introduced me to it many years ago, and it has been my favorite, ever since.  The scent reminds me of my childhood!  It works really well, moisturizes, without feeling greasy.  I try to keep a bottle in my refrigerator, for accidental sunburns.  I love this product, and have had difficulty finding it from time to time...ordering through amazon makes it super convenient. Try it!!</li>
    <li> I use it daily and I love it</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Its super light weight, absorbs quickly, and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is a great skin moisturizer. I love that it blends in quickly and is made with coconut oil and aloe vera. Perfect for summer tanned skin!</li>
    <li> CONGRATULATIONS. you are a winner!! What a wonderful gift to of found this!!! Say goodbye to dry skin from face to feet. Wow, pretty amazing stuff. SENT FROM ANGELS!&lt;br /&gt;welcome to pure silk!!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using skin trip ever since my mom introduced it to me after she had been using it for over 20 years!! It is very light and refreshing and the smell is my favorite smell!! I put it on in the morning, and even after my afternoon run i can still smell it on my arms!! It keeps my moisturized ALL DAY!! Definatly try it, the smell is not overpowering at all and if you love coconut this is perfect for you! even if you don&#x27;t love coconut you will still love it because the smell is not very strong.</li>
    <li> This is a non-greasy light moisterizer. It sinks right into skin and smells great. If you have really dry skin you will need another heavier one for night use. This one is good for day daily use!</li>
    <li> My favorite skin lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this at the Zoo Gallery in Florida because it smelled so good but ended up ordering more because it really is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It&#x27;s light but really works well (I have very dry skin and it worked all day.)  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely real coconut lotion and I have been using it for decades. I don&#x27;t think it has changed in all that time, except they have recently removed parabens! I thank this company for recently removing parabens from their products and they are also removing sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates. (These chemicals absorb into the body they are known toxins that can contribute to various cancers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredients are coconut oil and aloe juice. It feels so light, smooth, and fresh, but not sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great in the bottle.  However after applying it, within only a few minutes it loses the great coconut smell and takes on a very funky odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife for X-mas. We both love the smell of a good coconut lotion.  However she seemingly hasn&#x27;t used it and when I finally asked why, she told me about the smell.  Sure enough, we tried it on a few other volunteers and everyone said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is light, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after applying it - so it has that going for it.  For all I know it may be the best lotion in the whole world, it may have the power to end wars and cure cancer.  But I&#x27;ll never really know for sure, because there is no way we&#x27;re using this odd smelling product.</li>
    <li> In 1975, I had a job that kept me out on the road surface for 8 hours in the sun. A woman I was seeing bought this for me to put on after my showers at home. The woman is long gone but I still am using Skin Trip for sun exposure.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used.  I am allergic to so many fragrances...they produce an instant headache.  But this nice coconut fragrance is great.  The lotion is not greasy and it lasts a while after application.</li>
    <li> I found this when I was trying to remember the moisturizer that I used to use back in the mid-1970s.  They haven&#x27;t even changed the label in all these years.  I live in one of the driest deserts on earth, and this does the job.  Unlike jojoba oil, which I was previously using, this doesn&#x27;t seem to evaporate off my skin.  And it doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy -- just leaves my skin feeling soft.  I use it only on my face, and one 8-ounce bottle has lasted five months.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as everyone says....works like any other lotion.  Nothing outstanding....</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Smells a little more like vanilla than coconut to me, but keeps my skin well hydrated and still smells good.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap and loved the fragrance so much I had to have the lotion as well. It&#x27;s great, fast absorbing, not greasy at all. I just wish the scent was a little stronger</li>
    <li> This is the most soothing, gentlest lotion I have ever encountered. I started using it years ago when I was having terrible eczema and every other lotion made it worse. This was the only one I found that didn&#x27;t. Years later, I no longer have eczema, but it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
    <li> i have been using this stuff since they invented it.  itsa the ONLY lotion i like in the whole world!!!!  not greasy-and it works. and it smells AMAZING</li>
    <li> Skin Trip is an amazing product.  It is one of the best lotions available for your skin.  If you like coconut this is the lotion for you.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like Mountain Ocean Skin Trip so badly. I use organic coconut oil all the time as a shave oil, for smoothing my hair, and on chapped lips. It&#x27;s great, so I thought that Skin Trip would basically be that experience in lotion form.   The lotion is nice as far as moisturizing properties, the texture is good, and it absorbs in to my skin quite well but the added fragrance is overpowering, sickeningly sweet, and just unnecessary. I can&#x27;t smell like a Baskin  Robbins all day, it&#x27;s just too migraine-inducing. Someone call me when they make a perfume-free version. It would be different if this literally smelled like coconut -it is after all one of the main ingredients, but it has been heavily scented. I somehow doubt that this is an &#x27;original&#x27; formula, especially given the silicones etc on the ingredient list. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cute hippie-style labeling, there&#x27;s not very much that is &#x27;natural&#x27; about this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the rave was about. It only has a faint smell of coconut. It&#x27;s pretty watery. And overpriced. I&#x27;m glad I bought it here and not at the store, because it was even more expensive there. But I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Check out Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender coconut lotion.</li>
    <li> Needed something to moisturize my skin as I have very dry skin to the point of itchiness. Messed around with a few cheaper lotions from here and there and tho they mostly worked &#x27;ok&#x27;, they had many problems. This lotion: long lasting, smells absolutely amazing, doesn&#x27;t stink the eyes and, probably the most important fact, doesn&#x27;t make you oily.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and has a very nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Little on the watery side for me and at first it doesn&#x27;t smell that great but after it absorbs it does smell nice. Probably would not buy again but didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion daily for 30 years. I cannot live without it. It is the lightest but rich lotion. And I am known for the pleasant scent!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 20 years, and it&#x27;s great stuff. You&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s too thin as you apply it, but it feels fine once it&#x27;s on your face or hands. There&#x27;s no greasiness at all, and the coconut scent is light, not overpowering. It keeps well, too. Just shake it up. It&#x27;s a buy!</li>
    <li> Although I love love love this lotion cause it works so well...its a more emotional connection for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child growing up in the Denver area I remember my big sister tanning and how she always had this amazing smell. I also remember how mad she got at me for sneaking into her room and using it. Of Course I always tried to lie and tell her I didn&#x27;t do it. Figures she never believed me...I smelled just like her!!!! (I was only about 7 or 8!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a grown-up for my birthday and Christmas every year my sister would send me my own bottle of skin trip. I lost her to cancer last fall and and have to say that as much as I miss her...skin trip helps bring her back every day.</li>
    <li> My favorite for years now for the summer. Absorbs well with no greasiness, very effective, and smells awesome, like coconuts but sexier-- like summer in a bottle.</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling amazing soft and moisturized. it is the perfect consistency and doesn&#x27;t leave your legs feeling heavy and sticky after applying - getting skinny jeans on after lotioning with this is not even as difficult as most lotions! great product and i love the smell.</li>
    <li> Only lotion I have used for 20+ years, and this is great price and shipping. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a natural body lotion that smells like coconut the smell lingers on your skin all day. In the past only able to find this product in a natural heath food store, thanks Amazon for making it easy.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion in the world... it is lightweight, soaks in quickly without leaving any greasy residue, and my boyfriend thinks it makes me smell like a \\&quot;cupcake.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect coconut lotion for a while and decided to give this one a try after reading some of of the reviews.  Sadly, the smell was just too offensive for me and I had to immediately wash it off.  It does not smell \\&quot;coconutty\\&quot; - or fruity, it just has a very strong and overpowering unnatural and offensive scent. Sorry ...</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a thick and heavy lotion this is not for you. This lotion is very fragrant with the smell of coconut, but it light and not sticky at all, great for every day use. Plus, all of the ingredients are all natural if that is what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, is that if you are looking for that overly moisturized feeling, you have to keep reapplying all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin Trip for 15 years!  It super light, smells delicious (but not over powering),and makes my skin nice and soft.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever been able to use on my face without breaking out or seeming greasy.  Probably because it&#x27;s all  natural and so light.  I used to order it direct off their site in a big giant container, but unfortunately their prices went way up, so I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile.  The amazon price is cheaper, and free shipping. Yay!</li>
    <li> Really bad smell.....Didn&#x27;t seem to work any more miricles than any other product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin Trip for over 20 years, on and off -- \\&quot;on\\&quot; when I could find (and afford) it, \\&quot;off\\&quot; when I couldn&#x27;t.  It is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, especially in summer.  Not greasy and skin absorbs it quickly.  Makes skin SOOOOO soft.  Love the scent -- it used to come in \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, too.</li>
    <li> I used this product for more than 10 years when it first came out in 1971 because it was cool, not greasy, and had a nice smell.  Then, I left the mountain states and could not find it on the East Coast or southern Texas, so I did not use it again until I bought a bottle a few weeks ago. It still smells good, is light, but I experience a slight burning sensation after applying that did not exist when the product first came out in the early 1970s.  I notice chemicals in the ingredients now that I did not see before. My face does not like one or more of the chemicals and I will not be buying another bottle.  The product I remember using in the 1970s felt cool and did not tingle when I put it on my face after shaving.  Something has changed in the formula and I don&#x27;t know what it is but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and now have an Amazon subscription. A staple of health food stores, this still hippie looking product soaks right in with zero grease for a good light moisturizer. I use it every morning and love the light coconut scent, although, to be fair, others aren&#x27;t as big a fan of the smell. Great for hands and body, even good for the face (I&#x27;m a guy so don&#x27;t have a cabinet full of products). A long time favorite.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new skin lotion that was good, not tacky &amp; dried quickly.  While on vacation &amp; shopping with a friend in Maui, my friend who is also a resident, saw this on a check out counter and proceeded to tell me how wonderful it was.  I bought a bottle and absolutely love it.  I wanna give some to everyone I know.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews but I am not sure if I like this product coz the coconut smell is way too strong.</li>
    <li> Good but ingredients are not all natural - dimethicone included so will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome!  It is so light, not greasy AT ALL, yet still leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.  It smells like coconut and whenever I wear it, I always get compliments.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to this when I was 13...I am now 27 and STILL think that it is the BEST lotion available.  I have tried so many commercial lotions, some VERY expensive too, and THIS STUFF is wonderful!  I love the simpleness of the product, packaging and NO ANIMAL TESTING.  It has a wonderful, fresh coconut scent and melts into skin with a smooth, non-greasy ease.</li>
    <li> Ilove this lotion!! I fell in love with Coconut Skin Trip while living in the ultra-dry Colorado climate and was so happy to find it available on Amazon. The tropical aroma really soothes the senses and whenever I use it I hear tons of positive comments on the fragrance. Great for dry skin &amp; dry hair!</li>
    <li> Have been using \\&quot;Skin Trip\\&quot; for about 35 years. The best moisturizer ever. Constantly getting comments on how good I smell. Soaks in and moisturizes and is not ever greasy. I have been in contact with the people who make it and found them to be awesome human beings as well. Good price on Amazon. About a dollar cheaper than at Mrs. Greene&#x27;s Market. BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Meh... I love the smell of coconut and was excited to try. The lotion smells a bit like coconut and is thin. I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This cream is beautiful. It is light never greasy and smells like summer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for more then 20 years but recently moved to a very secluded area so most things will have to be shipped.  Lotion is a light lotion and does not leave your skin feeling sticky.  In the winter when my skin is really dry I apply this lotion night and mornings.  Smells wonderful of coconut and vanilla.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of coconut, and I was really looking forward to trying this lotion after reading all the great reviews, but I was disappointed to discover the coconut scent is overpowered by some sort of medicinal smell.  I thought maybe the smell would dissipate after application, but it got worse.  I asked my husband, &amp;#34;Old Bloodhound Nose,&amp;#34; to give me his opinion, but he turned away quickly and said, &amp;#34;You smell like spoiled milk!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately rinsed off my legs and arms outside with the hose and threw the bottle of lotion in the recycle bin.</li>
    <li> Great product that goes a long way per bottle.</li>
    <li> I love skintrip lotions and reccemend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to see people who, like me, have been using Skin Trip for over 20 years. I found it 28 years ago on a trip to Colorado and have used it every day since. My sons are now hooked, too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just a moisturizer-- it protects your skin from city grunge, sun and wind, and all the daily attacks on your face. If you get sunburned, Skin Trip will wick away the burn and itch. The coconut smells so good in the morning you&#x27;ll want to taste it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased to see it available online. Our \\&quot;health food\\&quot; stores in Oklahoma think it&#x27;s okay to run out of Skin Trip! Not an option as far as I&#x27;m concerned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At 55, I have great-looking skin and I&#x27;m convinced that Skin Trip is the cause. Buy some!!</li>
    <li> We love this! It&#x27;s fabulous and it not only feels good on the skin it can also help keep mosquitoes away.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was under the impression that his was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion, devoid of extra chemicals, etc. etc. However, while the smell is lovely (1 star) and it moisturizes just fine (the other star), I cannot justify paying that amount of money (-star) for an all natural lotion that is chock full of chemicals (-star) and for the company which bought the original not bothering to inform new AND long time customers that the ingredients have changed (-star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product has a &amp;#34;sour smell&amp;#34; to it. When I thought of the smell of coconut I had to try it. Since we live in FL it could be possible that lotion has been in the hot truck for too long, hence the smell. From now on I would rather buy my beauty products in a Brick &amp; Mortar store.</li>
    <li> I received my Mountain Ocean Skin Trip Moisturizer yesterday and i have used it twice a day. This is the only moisturizer  I&#x27;ve  bought  that doesn&#x27;t  sit on top of the skin. The product is immediately  absorbed  into the skin and leaves the skin baby soft. I&#x27;ve  used it on my face, neck, arms, legs, and chest. I&#x27;m  happy i can use it everywhere  on my body and i don&#x27;t  have to buy a separate  product for face and body. The scent is not overwhelming  it is a light coconut scent. This is also my nighttime  moisturizer  for my face. When i wake my face is still soft and supple. No dry spots at all. I&#x27;ll  be purchasing  Mountain  Ocean on a regular basis  and it is replacing my regular lotion and moisturizer. I almost  forgot  to  mention  how great this stuff is on my feet too. It keeps them soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this lotion from Amazon after stumbling upon it while looking for another lotion. I have used it a few times now and the stuff is pretty addicting. First, it is a light weight lotion - not heavy or greasy, so it is great for summer. Second, the lotion smells amazing. I have a collection of probably 20 lotions that I use and I can definitely see this one becoming part of my rotation, especially since it smells like summer. The bottle is smaller than I expected but I probably should have looked at the size before ordering.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Bought for a Christmas gift. Recipient loved it.  Will buy it again this Christmas if still available here.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Very moisturizing and has a lovely light scent. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Living in the windy, sunny NV desert my skin drinks up Skin Trip.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for 20 years.  It is truly an essential if you like the outdoor elements.</li>
    <li> Instantly takes us to the beach and is very nourishing. Wish I could buy in bulk! Bottles seem to last a fairly good amount of time</li>
    <li> This is an essential product for me.  I use it every day.  It makes a nice after shave, after-sun, and just plain ol moisturizor.   I mainly just use it on my face.  No greasiness plus smells great!</li>
    <li> While this moisturizer delivers on being light and quickly absorbent, it does not smell like authentic coconut in any way. It smells like a chemical company perceives the coconut fragrance to be, and then mixed those chemicals within the lotion. I put it on my arms and the smell was so fake and unpleasant that I had to wash it off. As I said, it does absorb quickly, but my arms didn&#x27;t become incredibly soft by using it. Coconut is my favorite fragrance its easy to identify real vs engineered coconut. All in all, a disappointing product. I gave it two stars because it delivered on its promise of absorption.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product since the 1980s. Nuff said</li>
    <li> Same as it ever was...which is pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred items with natural and organic ingredients and this was billed as a very good product.  But it is loaded with chemicals and the worst chemical of all is the horrible fake Vanilla perfume in it.  I put this crap on my face and it stunk so badly I couldn&#x27;t get to sleep.  I got up in the night and and tried to wash it off, but it just CLUNG to my face and hands.  I ended up having to take a shower in the wee hours!  I am going to try and get a refund!  Don&#x27;t use this crap!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Smells so good. I get caught smelling myself on a regular basis. My skin feels amazing. I love it. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Just adding my compliments, because this product deserves it. First introduced to it in 1976, I have enjoyed it ever since. It is non-greasy, makes my skin feel right, and it smells SO good. I&#x27;m not sure if this is true, but I was told in the beginning that it used to be called &amp;#34;Skin Drink,&amp;#34; but they had to change the name because it smelled so good that people were eating it by mistake. True or not, it made a good story, and I&#x27;ve been a skin trip fan ever since.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve depended on it for decades. West Africans use coconut on their skin, and I don&#x27;t know how the memo got to Colorado, but I&#x27;ve always been grateful that it did. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is (or was) with Wholefoods. Wholefoods employees in the HABA department made some vague assertions about issues, but I researched it and have fallen in love all over again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It soaks in quickly without a greasy feel and it smells great.</li>
    <li> An all around excellent product. I have been using Skin Trip for two years, and stockpile several bottles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product is non-irritating and non-burning, has a relaxing coconut scent, washes off easily, and makes body-to-body contact glide....</li>
    <li> I received my order quickly.  Customer service was fine.  However, within two days, all three bottles of lotion I bought were spoiled.  Smelled sour, thick and lumpy.  I am in contact with both Web Vitamins and Mountain Ocean to try and figure out whether it was a bad batch or possibly stored in too-hot an area.  Needless to say, I do not have my lotion.  It will be solved soon, but I want my lotion!!</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven in a bottle.</li>
    <li> do not buy this-save your money -chemical smell-not a good lotion at all -put in my kitchen garbage-on the same day I received-total waste</li>
    <li> This product has been awesome for decades.  For something so milky it really delivers the moisture.</li>
    <li> My husband kept bringing this moisturizer home from the store. I finally tried it. I have very dry skin and only use thick moisturizers that will stay on my skin for awhile. This moisturizer is very light but it soaks in immediately and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> this is great, soaks in quickly, light scent, only thing that stinks its its kind of liquid like.  i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever tried! Believe me, I have wasted so much money trying lotions/moisturizers. They were either too thick or runny or simply did not work. This gives your dry skin a much needed drink. Your skin will be left with a beautiful shine/glow. It is not heavy either like so many others. It has a wonderful, light coconut scent that is not overpowering. I hope they never stop making this product. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I tried this facial lotion at the recommendation of a friend.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything, from moderately priced Neutrogena, to expensive stuff like Dermalogica and Jack Black.  This Skin Trip lotion is amazing, and leaves my skin feeling incredible, which I think has a lot to do with the coconut oil in the lotion.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t love the bottle design, and would have preferred a squeeze tube or something, but the contents are great and that&#x27;s what matters.  At 8oz for this price, that is truly a great deal, especially when most high end luxury lotions are charging $20-30 for a 1.7oz bottle.  I recommend trying Skin Trip, and think you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mountain ocean skin trip since I was 17. I&#x27;m 57. That in itself says enough.&lt;br /&gt;Best stuff ever. My 20 year old daughter has been using it now for about 5 years. I keep several bottles on hand always!  All natural. Can even use it on your face. Smells like a tropical island  and makes me think of being there every time I use it! It definitely is a &amp;#34;skin trip&amp;#34; Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the only lotion I use. It&#x27;s super lightweight so it sinks right into my super dry skin so leaves no oily residue at all and actually moisturizes my skin rather than coating it like most lotions. it&#x27;s pricey but really worth it.</li>
    <li> I just received my order and was very excited to try it.  It&#x27;s hard to find a lotion with a nice coconut smell and I was hoping this was it.  It&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is but I don&#x27;t like it, in fact I put it on and then had to take a shower because I couldn&#x27;t take the smell anymore.  Some people really seem to like it, which is why I purchased it, but it&#x27;s not for me.  Also, it&#x27;s very runny, but it does absorb quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Rediscovered it after many years. But first found it in the 70&#x27;s. Great smell is coconut, thin and quickly absorbable. Some things don&#x27;t change. And don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation in a magazine. I&#x27;m guessing the magazine got paid to recommend it, because I can&#x27;t imagine anyone recommending this without financial compensation. The smell, which is great when you apply the lotion, wears off within 30 minutes. The lotion itself isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all. It&#x27;s so thin it looks like it&#x27;s been watered down. So, don&#x27;t use it for the smell, don&#x27;t use it for the moisturizing, I can&#x27;t think of a reason to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, very soothing with a great tropical smell.  I&#x27;ve been using it since college and won&#x27;t put anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it always transports me, moisture without being greasy and messy, I have a million allergies but this is not one of them! it goes on smooth does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave anything but silky skin and a light scent of the best summer ever :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. It&#x27;s the only lotion I have found that never makes my skin break out. True Believer.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. I really love the smell just as other reviewers have mentioned. It&#x27;s a nice soft scent, and it lingers for quite a while but it&#x27;s never overwhelming. You only smell it if you put your hand to your face or someone is really close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how soft my skin feels application. I guess the only reason I have to take one star off is, I don&#x27;t super feel like it&#x27;s an all-natural product as it claims, but I have no doubt that this is still a way better lotion than all the lotions in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> Very strongly scented in the good way. People tell me how good it smells after hugging or if they are close.&lt;br /&gt;Not too girly scented so my husband will use it also.&lt;br /&gt;Worked good on sunburn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never struggled with dry skin - quite the opposite, I tend to run oilier than most. However, after being out in the sun, using a shower scrub, or shaving, it&#x27;s nice to be able to re-moisturize the skin. I&#x27;ve found that most lotions are made for people with extremely dry skin, and they tend to settle on top of my skin like a greasy film. This stuff is does not fall into that category. The consistency of this lotion is very runny, which I consider a benefit. It absorbs into the skin in record fast time, and leaves the most wonderful coconut scent behind. I&#x27;ll never use another lotion!</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful smell.  I have a hard time getting this away from my wife.  It moisturizes well and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;The subtle fragrance of coconut in a skin quenching delightful non-greasy lotion.</li>
    <li> My skin is way too dry for this.  Love the texture, its light.  The smell is great, a little light on the coconut.  However my skin sucks it up and cannot get enough</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Feels nice and silky on your skin</li>
    <li> ST conditions better than any lotion I have ever tried, and absorbs fully into the skin in seconds, providing a soft, pliable, full feel. It does not leave a thick gooey layer on top of the skin like some lotions. I enjoy the light coconut scent, and have had many compliments. But it&#x27;s not natural; check the label!</li>
    <li> I have used Oil of Olay for most of my adult life and I still love it for the summer because it has UV protection. This product has a very similar consistency but no  UV protection. I like that it has all natural ingredients. It is light and absorbs into my skin quite quickly. I love the coconut scent.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great smelling lotion!</li>
    <li> i adore the light texture..toothpaste thick creams are not my style. absorbs quickly. routinely get comments &amp;#34;you smell good, what is that?&amp;#34; so its not just me going crazy for coconuts. reminds me of summer. has aloe so its great for after a day in the sun.</li>
    <li> We had been on the hunt for the perfect lotion for our 3 month old&#x27;s skin and this is it! Smells great and actually moisturizes unlike other lotions we have tried! you can tell it is a nice quality lotion! We love it so much it is now delivered to the house monthly!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Light not greasy. Absorbs quickly. Light coconut smell. Everyone in the family really likes this lotion.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion...nice and light with a wonderful coconut scent that lasts a long time.  Not a sickening sweet scent either...it&#x27;s nice and fresh!  Moisturizes well and is an overall a very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion when I was 13 and have used it on and off for nearly half my life!  Whenever I try something else I end up missing it.  I get compliments on the smell non-stop and it makes my skin feel incredible.  I have rough, bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and this is the only lotion (other than straight jojoba oil) that has cleared it right up.  The ingredients are natural, it&#x27;s a wonderful all-over moisturizer, and my boyfriend can&#x27;t stop sniffing me whenever I use it.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> This is really good lotion for hairstylists ! It really soaks into the skin and keeps your hands soft. I mixed it with a little of this Victoria secret lotion , just a tad because that one is too perfumey so when I mix it with the skin trip it calms it down and makes it softer ,I will be ordering more when I run out I love it . The scent alone is good too tho. I love coconut I was just bored one day and decided to mix it :)</li>
    <li> Great non greasy lotion with an incredible coconut scent that stays with you all day! It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchase it every summer.  The coconut scent reminds me of the beach.  Skin Trip is a wonderful light great smelling natural moisturizer.  If you have never tried it....go ahead.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> Light coconut scent. Nothing really special about it. I thought it was a natural product but its not. Not very moisturizing either.</li>
    <li> I did not research this product well enough. It has toxic products in it and it does not moisturize well at all.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this lotion. I love and use the bar soap version, and give that product 5 stars. This lotion just feels to thin and watery for my liking. It&#x27;s nice to just slather on if you&#x27;re looking for a nice scent. It&#x27;s also a decent moisturizer for the arms... but my hands, feet and legs require something a bit more substantial. I really wanted to love this, but alas, will probably not be buying again. The scent is amazing though. If I buy again, it will be for that alone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very thin lotion. the smell is incredibly strong and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Had memories of it from childhood, now questioning the hype. It&#x27;s very thin, the scent disappears quickly, would never buy again at this price. Great packaging though, go figure.</li>
    <li> Trying to go natural with body products and this lotion is perfect. Smells like you are on an island, is the perfect consistency for all over, and is all natural and cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I USED to LOVE this lotion! It was my go to every day for years... and I mean years, I think 15+!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome part- My skin looks amazing, as I haven&#x27;t aged at all! I was just told a few months ago I look like I&#x27;m young and 35, and in reality I&#x27;m 49! People are out right shocked when I tell them this and are in disbelief... best part is its true and I can only think its due to this lotion as its the only one for my face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD- I recently read a review that I had to do my homework on, as its time for me to buy more, and I was mortified to find out the company has been SOLD, and if that not enough they have a new crapy, cheap cheap formula that they have changed over to and its crap now for the same price!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will no longer use this product, as its not even the same feel, the smell is even different from what the old formula was... I really makes me mad when companies take something so wonderful and turn it into TRASH!! Shame on the company that bought and changed this product! You have distorted a perfect product and it will be the sad death of it once people realize its not the same as it was....&lt;br /&gt;Rest in peace... Mountain Ocean Skin Trip Moisturizer, Coconut lotion you will be missed!! &#x3D; - (</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion. Great scent. Not fake smelling or overly coconutty. Absorbs really quickly. Great product!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells fantastic and works well for body. I never used it on my face because coconut oil always clogs my pores, but I can see why some people like it for face!  It is very thin and absorbs quickly. The texture is a little weird if you aren&#x27;t used to thin, fast-absorbing natural creams. You have to work quickly to apply it evenly. I like it better in the summer months because I need a bit of a thicker cream for winter. Plus the scent is so summery-awesome. The smell doesn&#x27;t really linger for me though, I kind of wish it did! Although I do feel this works well and appreciate all the good-for-you ingredients, I prefer the feel and application of Kiehl&#x27;s Lightweight Cream de Corps for summertime lotion. I will probably buy it again, but mainly for the scent :)</li>
    <li> I just love this lotion. It smells great, sinks in fast, hydrates well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate or break out my skin. Perfection. I always get compliments on how soft my skin is, so i know it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been curious about this moisturizer, having seen it in stores for years and loving the bottle, but never trying it, so I finally ordered it. I love coconut so figured I can&#x27;t go wrong. It does smell coconut-y, but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; of coconut. For instance, it doesn&#x27;t smell like real coconut oil. Not that I expected that, but just be aware that it&#x27;s a fragrance. But it&#x27;s a good fragrance, in my opinion. The performance is good, it&#x27;s a light cream, not heavy. Sinks in well and leaves a nice summery, tropical scent.</li>
    <li> This smells really amazing. I liked it a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my face cream for 30+ years.  It&#x27;s the only thing my skin can tolerate for a long period as I develop problems with everything else.  Nice mild scent, sinks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, and by the way the price has only gone up by 10 Cents a year.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with how strong/sugary/fake the fragrance was and how unnatural the ingredients are. Yuck. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> This product is now full of chemicals. It has the same scent as the original skin trip and works ok as a moisturizer. If you&#x27;re not concerned about the chemicals absorbing into your body through the skin, then it&#x27;s an acceptable moisturizer. When I bought it, there was no indication on the listing of the added ingredients that are too complex to pronounce like Behentrimonium Methosulfate or Dicetyldimonium Chloride or Phenoxyethanol to name just a few.  I will not buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since I first discovered it about 15 years ago.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it actually keeps my skin feeling moist - not like most lotions that once they are absorbed need to be immediately re-applied.  The smell is wonderful!  I feel happy as soon as I open the bottle and get a whiff. It also makes me think of a day at the beach.  I noticed that some people mentioned a bad smell to it and unless it just didn&#x27;t mix well with their body chemistry, I would suggest that the lotion was stale.  It must be kept fresh as instructed by keeping from heat or freezing.  I once bought the last bottle in a health food store and I noticed that the color looked a little off.  In the past, the lotion in every bottle I had purchased was a pure bright white - but in this bottle, the lotion looked a kind of light beige color.  I knew it could go bad if not stored properly or kept too long and so inquired if this might be the case.  The store assured me it was fresh - told me it was \\&quot;supposed to be that color\\&quot;. HAHAHA!  So I bought it and sure enough the smell was different - had an undertow that was definitely unpleasant and I could not use it.  Fortunately, that was the only time I had such an experience and I was grateful for the years of prior experience that I have had with this wonderful product - if I had been a first-time user I would have thought it was just a bad product.  But if the bottle is fresh, there is nothing on the planet that smells better.  And while I&#x27;ve tried many other lotions over the years, nothing compares to the great way Skin Trip makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Not to strong good lotion</li>
    <li> this is my favorite lotion! I tried my friends and now I am a lifelong skin trip user. It smells absolutely delicious.I have it on auto ship and give it as a gift and everybody loves it. Its not sticky and it absorbs right into your skin. Not greasy at all. I put it in refrigerator to keep it fresh if I order multiple bottles. I love the packaging also. Definitely try it.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion would be amazing but I found it to be very watery and the scent is too mild for my taste.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a great light smell and absorbs quickly.  I live at high altitude, so I needed something to keep my skin hydrated.  This did just the trick.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Watery though</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Not too greasy, love the scent, works on all types of skin.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite lotion EVER! It smells amazing... a light coconut smell that reminds you of summer year round. It&#x27;s light and super absorbent, a great everyday lotion for sure.</li>
    <li> The texture is what we in the industry call &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; -- as you rub, it turns white as if you were lathering up. After you emulsify it some more, then it disappears into the skin. A &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; lotion is displeasing for application, because you have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; harder for it to absorb. Who wants to do extra labor?. Most modern cosmetic chemists try to avoid &amp;#34;soapiness&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s a sign of a improperly mixed emulsion, or old-fashioned formulation (shh--- it IS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, nothing is wrong with old-fashioned as this product has been around for ages, and i admire its hippie ethos. But the formula is just too watery and thin to provide long-lasting hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried contenders in this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; category (Beauty Without Cruelty, Alba Botanicals), but i&#x27;ve since moved on to a much better Body Lotion: [[ASIN:B004W7BF6K NUXE Body 24HR Moisturizing Body Lotion, 6.7 fl. oz.]], a French pharmacy favorite. Being exposed to so many emulsions in this field in all these years, I&#x27;ve found Nuxe to a double whammy winner in terms of cushiony texture and efficacious moisturization.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, and it has been around for a long time.  I first used it when I lived in Hawaii 40 years ago...Now I spend lots of time in the mountains in high altitude, which is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;Mountain Ocean absorbs quickly and really helps!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. First off it smells wonderful! I feel like I benefit from just that alone :) However, in all reality, I have been using this lotion for a long time, it is thin enough to really get spread around evenly and easily and soaks in leaving my skin nice and soft. If I get a little too much sun, rubbing this on a couple times afterwards takes the red away. Good stuff. Get it!</li>
    <li> One of the best light lotions I have ever used. With my dry skin I need to use lotion everyday. I use a prescription one after my shower, however I cannot shower everyday so I use the Skin Trip Coconut lotion every morning and night before I go to bed. It keeps the dry skin at bay and keeps my skin soft and I always get compliments on how I smell too.</li>
    <li> The single best smelling lotion that I&#x27;ve used in my life.  If you hate all of those bath and body type scents because they smell too perfume-y and give you a headache (like me!), then you&#x27;ll love the gently but delicious smell of this coconut skin trip lotion.  It feels so nice on the skin, too.  I only wish it came it bigger bottles for those of us who use a lot!</li>
    <li> I wanted something that had the scent of coconut, tropical, yummy.  After receiving it and trying it, I fell in love with it.  It smells yummy and tropical and like coconut.  My husband loves it as much as I do.  I am hoping I can use it on my face as a moisturizer as well as arms, etc.  I put it initially on my arms and found it just melted (perhaps a better word would be it absorbed into my skin, etc.)  No greasy feel.  I am a teeny bit concerned because there is a note on the bottle that says \\&quot;best when used fresh\\&quot;.  I know not to freeze it or allow it to get ultra hot but not sure what \\&quot;fresh means\\&quot;.  Will it last a few months?  weeks?  I do not see a date on it showing a Use by Date or anything.  Other than that I really do like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition:  Have been using it a few days now.  Still love this stuff! I have been trying to see if I can be a bit more specific about the scent.  Yes it is coconut but I think I will add it gives me a feeling coconut/sun tan lotion scent.  That is what I was looking for.  Very tropical, very light sent too. Not overwhelming.  Have gotten several compliments and people asking me what I have on.  I am still amazed as to how quickly it resolves into my skin.  One other thing.  I do like the ingredients.  I am not an expert on this type of stuff but the first ingredient is Purified Water, second is Coconut Oil and third is Aloe Juice.  From there we get some things that I don&#x27;t know what they are, but to be honest I don&#x27;t care.  I like these \\&quot;main ingredients\\&quot;, love the scent and love the feel.  It&#x27;s a done deal for me.</li>
    <li> The BEST lotion on the planet. My husband steals it from me lol. Truly remarkable product</li>
    <li> I really love the stuff. I bought it to help with a sunburn and it was perfect. It&#x27;s a really light lotion, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin and it absorbs quickly but the coconut oil stays on your skin for a long long time after application to help keep moisture in. Also, the coconut scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion since the 70&#x27;s. Always am asked what am I wearing, the fragrance is amazing! Very light, not greazy.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this lotion, my mate likes it too.  I try a lot of different lotions and am happy with skin trip and cetaphil. I get a better price on Amazon than I do locally...</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite of mine for almost 20 years.  One of the best products ever!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic but I don&#x27;t find it to absorb quickly like it says it does. Overall it is a good light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Using this lotion is like taking a trip to a tropical island. It smells nice and like coconuts but unlike some other lotions does not smell artificial or too strong. I use it daily or sometime twice per day. It moisturizes my dry skin well in the winter and is also nice to use in the summer because its not too heavy and absorbs quickly. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have the nasty chemicals that are found in many other lotions, and I think its great to support a small company!</li>
    <li> Oh, I had such high hopes for this lotion. My hands get so dry in the winter and I was thinking the coconut oil and aloe would be super moisturizing, not so much for me. The smell is pretty good, again, not as good as I expected. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very light, and leaves my skin feeling very soft. However, it seems a little watery so it seems like you have to use more to apply over a larger area.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! Very fast absorbing!</li>
    <li> I have been using Skin Trip for decades.  It smells delicious, makes my skin smooth, and absorbs easily.  I have tried other brands and always come back to Skin Trip.  Always.</li>
    <li> I am currently in a very hot dry climate. This stuff rocks. It is not oily and absorbs faster than anything I have used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years. It smells like a summer day at the beach and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s not greasy. The best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  kinda runny, but smells good and feels good.  i use it every night when its really dry!</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer this product is fantastic, but as a consumer product it falls short in the area of scent. I live with a girlfriend who is sensitive to smells and she is disgusted by the smell initially, but it fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. My favorite colognes still work well and there is no afterscent. In summation functionally this is great but the smell is polarizing.</li>
    <li> My wife digs this stuff - and I dig her when she wears it.  You have to love Coconuts....or it&#x27;s just silly to even buy it</li>
    <li> Heavenly smell, but a little watery for my taste.</li>
    <li> I love the lip trip lip balm and so I thought I would try this. It soaks right into my dry chapped skin and lasts a long time. I only need to use a few drops. It smells great too, coconut.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve written a review on this already, but I am compelled, as the world seems to be going you know where in a handbasket, to make another company pay for  turning something fine into crap.  So, Mountain Ocean, you&#x27;re the winner.  I have used this stuff for 30 years, first in dry Alaska where it was better than gold.  But a couple of years ago, the company changed hands and ingredients.  Not sure why, profit is usually the answer, because common sense tells me that &#x27;if it works, don&#x27;t fix it.&#x27;  It still has a decent smell compared to many coconut products, but it is now greasy going on and dries up within minutes, meaning you are inclined to use more(aha, maybe that was their intention).  I miss people in Congress working for the good of their citizens.  I miss typewriters.  I miss the time before cell phones.  And I miss my Skin Trip.  If you&#x27;ll notice, most of the rave reviews on here are from years past, or from people who never knew the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy or greasy - love the summer coconut fragrance in the middle of winter.  Use liberally because it soaks right in!</li>
    <li> I put this lotion on for the first time 5 minutes ago. It is AMAZING! It absorbed immediately, with no greasy residue. It smells incredible, feels incredible, and I love that the first three ingredients are water, coconut, and aloe. Consider me a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I used to use this lotion all the time then it became hard to find. It smells great and works even better. Absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky. This is just what my extra dry skin had been needing to feel good again.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great to me and everyone else around me. It helps a lot with the dry tahoe weather too!</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love this product and their Soap is wonderful too. This company is owned by the same family for over 40 years and they have not changed the formula of Skin Trip because it works so well providing soft smooth skin to so many fans who Love the  Unique famous *coconut Fragrance * They now offer a free tote bag that comes in handy if you write to them and share your story.</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there, light and quick absorbing.  Smells great too!  It&#x27;s the one health and beauty product that my husband and I share.  Our favorite.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good, came on time and as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes moderately well. They could improve a bit on the moisturization level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint, and it&#x27;s just a preferential one, is the overwhelming coconut smell. Yes, I know, it&#x27;s coconut lotion, and a milder one at that...but it lingers too long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only using it about once a week. If I start using it more than that I can&#x27;t tolerate the tropical smell I carry with me all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it is a great product, no complaints about that...just remember to be in a coconut mood! :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and super slick. And it smells too. And and and it&#x27;s like wow man.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face and noticed immediately the very thin consistency... this feeling was replaced with a burning sensation and I thought \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; and sure enough, that&#x27;s on the list of ingredients.  Alcohol is extremely drying and is not what I want to be putting on my face or body to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your face to feel like you&#x27;re taking a trip to the Caribbean, complete with sunburn and the fragrance of a Pina Colada, this is for you.  If you want a real moisturizer, I suggest Aveeno Everyday Oatmeal.  [[ASIN:B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  It&#x27;s true coconut -- no fake scent.  Anyone who loves coconut will LOVE it.  It&#x27;s a lighter lotion, great for every day and not heavy; but, because iIt&#x27;s on the lighter side, it&#x27;s probably not good for excessively dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion nice and Coconut-y! This is the perfect moisturizer for the summer it moisturizes, but isn&#x27;t heavy at all and the scent it great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true - if you are wondering if you&#x27;ll like it and if all these reviews are for real - take the plunge - you won&#x27;t regret it!  I use this moisturizer under makup and it is fabulous!  My face looks dewy and fresh - and I have extremely dry skin.  Try it - you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Was looking for something more natural in my lotion and wanted to give this a try. The coconut smell is mild and nice but the lotion is very watery and doesn&#x27;t feel as if it conditions at all</li>
    <li> Very nice and lite with a wonderful coconut scent</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well but it is a little too thin for my taste and the smell is not a natural coconut smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a coconut lover.  And this scent is my most favorite scent in the world!  It&#x27;s light, yet intoxicating, in a good way.  I always get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it.  It&#x27;s a light lotion, so it never feels greasy.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion I have 3 of them around the house. It&#x27;s very thin soaks in fast. Great coconut fragrance.</li>
    <li> This really works well if you have dry skin!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! Prevents ingrown hairs and softens skin!</li>
    <li> i loved the smell but the lotion was too liquid/watery. Went on wet and wasn&#x27;t very hydrating. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all types of moisturizers, from very expensive to very inexpensive.  Jack Black, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Kiehl&#x27;s, Clinique, etc.  I do really like Mountain Ocean Skin Trip, it feels great, it&#x27;s fast absorbing, it&#x27;s light, and it smells good (not perfumy, but a nice coconut scent the first 10 minutes you put it on).  Best of all, it&#x27;s an extremely amazing value for the price and the size of the 8 ounce bottle.  Many high end moisturizers are double the price and come in 1.7 oz bottles!  As great as a moisturizer Skin Trip is, the bottle sucks.  It comes in this big, cheap bottle with a label that&#x27;s attached by a plastic wrap and not even a sticker.  When I was opening the bottle I accidentally took the entire label off the bottle!  When I want to squeeze a specific amount of lotion out onto your hand, 9 times out of 10 I wind up squeezing way to much out, or it somehow manages to splash all over my bathroom when I close the cap.  Mountain Ocean has a great product going here, but they need to invest in a better quality bottle or better yet, squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells like vanilla, cinnamon &amp; coconut, &amp; isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It&#x27;s light yet nourishing and when I use it people often say, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that nice smell?&amp;#34; It isn&#x27;t cloying or too heavy in terms of fragrance &amp; your skill feels moisturised without feeling medicated or heavily oiled. I recommend it highly &amp; Amazon sells it more inexpensively even with postage than health food stores do as an out of store retail item in San Francisco. Try it it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I hate lotions because they&#x27;re either sticky, smelly, greasy, full of chemicals or simply doesn&#x27;t moisturize. This one is GREAT. The smell is fresh and not overpowering. The smell makes me want to run to the beach and sip margaritas. :) The texture is perfect and it melts into the skin very fast. Love that it&#x27;s a mom and pop brand too. These little known brands like this always seem to have a superior product vs big name brands.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this everyday after showering and washing hands.  It has a light natural scent and feels silky not greasy.  Absorbs quickly as well.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a light coconut fragrance that I love.  The lotion soaks right in and makes my skin feel wonderful.  This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item for me!</li>
    <li> Still my favorite after 30 years.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and this company!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice natural fragrance. Light moisturization. Not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick lotion, just lighter and thinner.</li>
    <li> first time using this product, it came in the mail so fast, and it smells and feels amazing. will buy in the future</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on great and has a wonderful fresh, slightly coconut odor.  It is thin enough to easily apply, but not so thin that it runs down your arm while applying.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face, but probably could.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve used 3 moisturizers, lifetime. I like the smell of this one, but it is very light and absorbs quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used so usually I reapply 3-4 times after a shave (which I enjoy actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No UV protection means you need to add sunblock yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in the fridge just in case any of the bacteria which manage to survive in there get any ideas about going methicillin resistant!</li>
    <li> I love skintrip, always have, always will...while others undergo the knife...injections...and worse...i apply this and feel like a goddess...i apologise for this seemingly egocentric review...but, try skintrip, you&#x27;ll head trip.</li>
    <li> Only  facial moisturizer I would use because it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, this lotion smells so good. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever tried, period. Absorbs immediately and no need to reapply. Typically, I have very dry skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t have thought something this &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; would work. But it does! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for over 30 years and will not change to another type or brand.</li>
    <li> Tried it twice and had to wash if off both times because chemical smell was way too strong.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut.</li>
    <li> I use this as an aftershave or as a soother of my manly face after a day in the sun.  Its smell reminds me of the beach and chickies in suntan lotion.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this quick absorbing,  lovely smelling, cruelty free product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I remember it. Yes.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so light it soaks in immediately. It smells like Heaven, or at least reminds you of that beach where you felt like you were in Heaven!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and this is the best moisturizer I have found. I live in a harsh climate with very cold moisture sucking winters and hot dry summers. In the summer I leave a bottle in the refrigerator and always have one in my cooler for long days on the boat. Nothing feels better than cold Skin Trip on a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments daily on how good I smell!</li>
    <li> I first heard of this product when I was a store manager at a GNC, and a customer insisted that no substitute for this product would do. I later tried it for myself and agreed. It soaks into the skin very quickly, moisturizing, but not leaving a greasy feeling. I also like the coconut smell. I recommend keeping extra bottles in the fridge, as it needs to stay fresh, esp. in hot weather.</li>
    <li> This was an in-store impulse buy for me. I was shopping with my friend when she saw this on the shelf and started gushing over saying it was her absolute FAVORITE moisturizer. She told me I HAD to try it, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was right! This moisturizer works well and is LIGHT. I personally hate putting on thick lotion after getting out of my shower. I put this on and my skin absorbs it super quick. It is refreshing and won&#x27;t weigh you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the summery coconut fragrance. The bottle says, \\&quot;its best when fresh. Keep from freezing and high heat.\\&quot; I assume the reviewers who said negative things about the odor received a bottle with expired content. I&#x27;m not sure if I would want to order this online for that reason. (At least not in the winter, as I live in VT --it is bound to freeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part? No animal testing. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconuts and this lotion does the trick. I have super dry skin in the changing of seasons, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product during winter months unless you wanna keep reapplying, but I will be definitely using it most of the year.</li>
    <li> Very milky and fluid but it is super moisturizing with a phenomenal fragrance</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, works great.</li>
    <li> I have problems with skin sensitivity and cannot use a lot of moisturizers. This one I have had no issues with. It goes on smoothly and smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Seller rating is five stars for sure. Item arrived super quick and without any damage or leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give Skin Trip ten stars if I could, because it is one of the best lotions you can ever use. It&#x27;s the only thing I use to moisturize my entire body, including my face. I have replaced all of my specialty beauty lotions and creams with this one lotion. It really is a miracle in a bottle. It has limited ingredients which is important for my extremely sensitive skin. I have super cranky, ultra sensitive, breaks-out-if-I-sneeze sort of skin. I get compliments regularly how great it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin feels velvety soft because it the consistency is thinner than a traditional lotion. Is spreads out evenly and absorbs ultra quick. You can add more if you feel like you aren&#x27;t moisturized enough, but you probably will be, and because it&#x27;s so light you&#x27;ll never be left with greasy, clogged pores. I use it after sun exposure and literally for everything that needs healing. Coconut oil is naturally antiseptic, ultra moisturizing, skin protecting, and has a natural SPF of about 4. So it&#x27;s great on nearly everything you throw it at. Can&#x27;t tell you how many hundreds of dollars I save with the top four items alone. My regimen consists of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Clarisonic face brush (I swear by this--it will change your life for the cost of two good facials and all of the extra products to clarify, exfoliate, deep clean your face you will no longer have to buy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Dove bar soap (that&#x27;s right, bar soap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Skin Trip Coconut Moisturizer on my face and full body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Baking soda for exfoliation (as needed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it. No toners, no night creams, no peels, special exfoliants, wrinkle or eye creams. The only thing I can foresee is those in colder climates may need an additional heavier lotion or cream if exposed to heaters and the elements quite a bit. It gets pretty cold here in the winter, and I have found I end to reapply and more liberally than in warmer times. It still works perfectly just more is needed to retain the moisture for longer periods. Or I use pure coconut oil to give that extra layer or protection without congesting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for using Baking Soda in your beauty regime: Make a paste with some water and dip a cleansing brush in it or slather it all over with your hands and do a face and body scrub. It&#x27;s super softening and a gentle enough texture to be used by anyone. I usually keep a plastic tub of it in the shower and just scoop handfuls of it and scrub away. Great for softening rough feet even if you feel like you aren&#x27;t scrubbing very much. Soft feet secret: after your baking soda once over in the shower, slather on the Skin Trip Coconut Moisturizer generously while your feet are still warm, and throw on some socks over top. Do this before bed and wake up with super soft, rested tootsies in the am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review helps you and that you have the same amazing experience with this lotion as I have. Try it and I bet you will love it!ore liberally than in warmer times. It still works perfectly just more is needed to retain the moisture for longer periods.

    <li> When I first started working at Whole Foods Market, my girlfriend at the time used this lotion. She gave it to me and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. It hasn&#x27;t changed in 20+ years. It smells better than coconut; its a unique smell that obviously smells great! Like the beach or ocean. It&#x27;s also NOT greasy. I mean that. It&#x27;s dries to your skin quickly and it won&#x27;t feel like you have any lotion on. This is not for sun protection...but for after the day in the sun. This product is expensive for a small bottle of lotion but it simply is the best and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s worth it. It will last you a month. Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> I have used this fantastic lotion since the 1980&#x27;s. Absorbs into your skin beautifully and leaves a light, fragrant smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and years.  I just love it.  The smell is a bit particular (coconutty/vanilla-u), but I personally really like it.  What I like best about this lotion is the liquidy texture. It really feels like my skin absorbs it completely, whereas a lot of other lotions leave a waxy/oily feeling behind on my hands.  It is a little pricey, though, and I wish they had a bigger size for a better deal.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like being at the beach, is good for you, and makes my skin feel great. Super light weight - love it for summer time!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Smells great and absorbs better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion! so light and fresh, it goes on and blends instantly! the scent is so light and so perfect. like a warm sunny day at the beach. It really hydrates my skin and leaves it so soft and smooth and did I say IT SMELLS LIKE COCONUT HEAVEN? This is the perfect lotion for every day, twice a day use, it&#x27;s a great hand cream too. I put it on my hands and arms at night before bed and the soft pure coconut smell lulls me off to sleep. For any coconut lovers this is the stuff for you, it&#x27;s not heavy perfume, it&#x27;s not overwhelming it&#x27;s just the perfect amount of light luscious coconut fragrance. My fianc&amp;eacute; needed lotion after a hotel shower and used my Mountain Ocean Skin Trip and LOVED IT! he raved about how his skin didn&#x27;t itch or flake the entire day. now he wants his own bottle (I&#x27;m not sharing!) this is a great product, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Newer reviews are right, they must&#x27;ve changed there formula because this stuff is not good. I love cult following products, usually theres a reason behind it,but this stuff feels cheap. Its really runny and liquidy, feels like it leaves a film on my skin, and the scent isn&#x27;t anything special. I used 3 times and the threw away</li>
    <li> I have been using this body lotion for over 11 years, and I highly recommend it.  Smoothes and hydrates my skin and leaves a lovely natural coconut scent as opposed to the many fake smelling coconut lotions and creams out there.  I don&#x27;t intend to ever switch, but I will say that I am upset that I can no longer find it at Whole Foods or Earth Fare.</li>
    <li> The best every day moisturizer. Wonderfully subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Have used this product since the early 70&#x27;s .  My shin thanks you!</li>
    <li> Perfect coconut smell, and a great lotion to boot</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells great and leaves skin so soft! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because I was looking for a good coconut scented lotion for summer. I didn&#x27;t want that fake, perfumy scent. This lotion smells incredible! It smells truly like coconut with a tiny hint of vanilla. It does not feel greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. I will definitely be looking at purchasing other Mount Hagen products- quality stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff loves my face and my face has never been happier! I have used it for over 20 years and still lovin it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion!! We have had 3 generations in my family and my Grandma is the first one to wear it! She has been using this lotion for over 20 years and her skin looks amazing!! I will never use any other lotion and the smell is amazing too, but that might be more of the smell I connect with my grandma either way, there is really no way you can go wrong with this lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion spreads on smooth and it is light in fragrance, as well as, has a light scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I can use and not break out with acne on my face. It&#x27;s light but heavily moisturizes and is great under make-up. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10yrs now. Glad I can purchase it on Amazon with free-supersaver shipping. It&#x27;s cheaper than at my local Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> My hubby has dry skin issues on his legs, especially in the winter. The only thing that gives him relief is Skin Trip Moisturizer. I just noticed that they have a soap now and am adding that to our wish list for him. We&#x27;ve been using Skin Trip for many, many years, and it still has the same great quality and consistency.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading stellar reviews on another website reviewing skin products (makeupalley). I have really sensitive skin and it dries out embarrassingly bad in the dry spells of winter, but this is gentle enough to use on damaged patches of skin or even my chest, which usually reacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears pretty thin, but I&#x27;m not convinced that thickness is the only or primary indicator of how well a lotion will leave you moisturized long-term. Its second ingredient is coconut oil, so it keeps you moisturized and soft really long. It&#x27;ll hit me a few days after body-moisturizing with this stuff, if I brush my side or something, I think, \\&quot;Why am I so soft?\\&quot; and finally realized it&#x27;s because of this lotion! Ha. I&#x27;d recommend this as a hard-to-find, versatile lotion you can use for body, hands or face.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for nearly 3 decades.  Soft healthy skin, no burn or redness, smells terrific.  Much preferable to the stinging, over-chemicalized/perfumed products most men use.  Have told many others about this gem, and the feedback continues to be along the lines of very happy and appreciative.  A little goes a long way... I typically use bout 1/2 teaspoon per shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin cream I have tried (at any price).  It has a smooth feel, without the fake &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; feeling of synthetic oils and chemicals.  This is a really good natural based product.  Like any natural lotion, lit may leave a mark on some fabrics (suede).  It cannot be beat for soothing summer skin and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the fantastic smell?  The coconut aroma is an instant trip to the tropics.  My daughter especially loves it.  She says it smells like Hawaii.  I agree.</li>
