<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Mailed faster than what I would think! Thank you! Very excited when get the box. But the material looks not very high quality . Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real one, but with this price, not bad. I tried a little bit. Pretty good!</li>
    <li> Favorite straightner...I had the one with the yellow plates and loved It...this one is even better!</li>
    <li> The titanium plates pull at my normal type short style hair.  Ceramic plates are 100x better on hair.  I DO love the 500 degree temp so if it&#x27;s heat you want then this is your product.  But, since the titanium will eventually burn and ruin my hair, I am going to order the Izunami ceramic that heats up to 450.</li>
    <li> I burned up my CHI in London and needed a quick replacement. Went on Amazon to buy a new one but was enticed by this one that several people said was just as good....wish I had stuck with my original plan and bought the CHI and spent a little more money which I ultimately have to do anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron gets 3 stars because it does straighten my hair.  I have lots and lots of long, baby fine hair that breaks pretty easy. My CHI would glide through my hair very smoothly with no tugging and no breaking. This resulted in straight, shiny, and healthy looking hair. The Herstyler does not slide through smoothly and it pulls, tugs and breaks my hair. In the end my hair is straight but it looks dry, broken, and even burned. And before you say there is a heat adjustment, I have played with that too and find that it has to be close to the hottest setting to achieve straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long story short it works but you pay for what you get. This is a cheap, $20 Walmart quality flat iron. You&#x27;re not getting the value it&#x27;s promising with a BS suggested retail price of almost $200. Spend an extra $50 and get something that will take better care of your hair.</li>
    <li> Good flatiron, even on ethnic hair! I turn it all the way up to 500 degrees because I have very coarse hair and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair at all</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FLAT IRON VERY EASY TO WORK WITH AND THE SIZE FITS IN MY HAND JUST RIGHT NEED TO GET A MINI FOR TRAVEL.  HAIRSTYLER IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IVE HAD A HAIRSTYLER FLAT IRON  BEFORE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GOOD FLAT IRON</li>
    <li> Looks very professional like the $100 plus one I bought at the mall. Still have to try it! ;)&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is excited to have her own prof. grade flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased as a gift cause mine works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it and uses it very often! She says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great to straighten ! Love the results! Comfortable to use!</li>
    <li> Works great! Only took 5 min to straighten my think and wavy hair instead of 20min!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Appears to be quality and for the price and as often as I&#x27;ll use, (twice, three times a year) it&#x27;s very much acceptable. Only compliant is that it pulled and broke a few strands every other pass or so. My hair is thick, course, wavy Caucasian hair that has been treated with keratin straightener. Overall, decent and I&#x27;m ok with it as it was deeply discounted. Had I paid full retail, I&#x27;d be furious.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the use of my Herstyler Superstyler flat/curling iron.  It is the perfect size which allows me to create different styles to my long and/or short hair.  The adjusted heat is perfect.  I like it so very much, I actually purchased several more of these superstylers and gave them as presents to my close friends and family for the Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron I love it!</li>
    <li> Works really good!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife is happy with it</li>
    <li> This is the straighter of my dreams works very good I would recommend this straighter to everyone it leaves your. Hair very straight and silk looking...</li>
    <li> Not the real one but super great</li>
    <li> AMAZING GETS SOOO HOT</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM I ORDERED A SECOND PAIR JUST INCASE THE FIRST PAIR GO BAD LOOKS JUST LIKE I HAVE A PERM MY DAUGTHER TOLD ME</li>
    <li> Every time I have ordered the hersyler from Amazon it pulls my hair out. It is not a true her styler. It is crap.</li>
    <li> Great for my thick course hair.  For quickest style Ever use with Herstyler Hair Syrum applied to towel dried hair.  My husband ran his fingers through my hair the other day... . And friends,  there is nothing that makes a girl feel more, well wanted and sexy but he asked me... when did I all of a sudden turn Japanese? That&#x27;s all he had to say.</li>
    <li> This sucks. You have to go over the hair 10 times and it still had bumps in the hair when we were done. This straightener is horrible quality!</li>
    <li> It gets my kinky hair super straight and it heats up fast. I have no complaints. This is one of my best flat irons.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron with the onyx plates. My hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Got it on time, my wife loves it...</li>
    <li> Items purchased were exactly as described! Great Seller!!</li>
    <li> This is my second &#x27;Herstyler&#x27; flat iron.  They are a great price and work really well.  I have thick, wavy/curly hair ~ I have been happy with this iron.  The last one I had, lasted 3 years of almost daily use.</li>
    <li> Herstylers are fragile but very good flat irons.  Do not drop it.  You will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Love them.  Arrived before time.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and My friend said she loved it! She said it works well and she liked that she could put it on a lower temperature setting.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my hair stylist and she loves them, To her, they are the best flat irons you can get because of the higher temperatures she can use on the different textures of hair. She likes these even better then the other Herstyler that she had.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast! I have thick medium hair and done flat ironing my hair  in 10 min. Great product . Thanks</li>
    <li> This is an excellent styler.  It is strong and appears to be durable.  It has a number of temperature settings to provide consistent straightening for various types of hair.  I really have enjoyed using this styler.</li>
    <li> I found this 1&amp;#34; after purchasing a 2&amp;#34; flat iron. This one is such a high class, high powered, appliance. I love it!!! So worth the price...you just can&#x27;t do any better. It heats up immediately, and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it ......I have curly hair and it is the right temp for my hair. I recommend this product to all women of color</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s great..love it...works jes like my old one</li>
    <li> I must say these are the best hands down. I took these to my hair stylist so she could test them out and she had me make a purchase for her. They really work on all types of hair. I am african american with thick naturally curly hair but I don&#x27;t even need to press my hair before using them. I have recommended them to 4 other people who all see a major difference in their hair.  I also purchased the hair serum and conditioner which I really like as well. Also my daughter who also has thick hair used to dread getting hair done is now looking forward to it as it has trained her hair only after using them twice.</li>
    <li> Even on a low setting doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair as well as the classic herstyler. Seems to not be the best for damaged hair as mine is. Works good though. Heats up quick</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve used. I owned my first Herstyler for almost 10 years and this one is even better!</li>
    <li> It was late getting to me the outside package was damaged don&#x27;t know if that had something to do with the chipped plates on the flat iron but the hard plastic is damaged too and it looked like hair product was left on it not what I expected not happy</li>
    <li> These are the best flat irons I have ever purchased.  They heat in less than one minute and keeps hair straight all day even throughout the humid southern day.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my flat iron!!!!!  Its better than the $150 Chi I purchased (which I returned once I got this one)!.  Quick delivery awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I have curly/wavy hair, and I don&#x27;t need to blowdry it straight first for this iron to work. Like others have said, there is no temperature gauge, so I just keep it in the middle. It heats up fast, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Super fast delivery. A+++</li>
    <li> Works perfect looks great. I love it! I had bought a chi and returned it for this and saved almost $100.</li>
    <li> I love these flatirons... just be careful though, you can seriously burn yourself so use the glove..  other than that they are perfect.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price, quality,  and heat for this item. This is a must have and best of the lower end straighteners in my opinion.  Highly recommend and I have thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> My best friend has one of these it was purchased at a mall kiosk and cost WAY more than what I paid on here but I love mine just as much</li>
    <li> Thus Her styler didn&#x27;t do good for my hair at all! I didn&#x27;t realize the plates were onyx ceramic. I ordered a Her styler before that work greatly! The plates were ceramic,  and when I ordered this one I thought the plates would work the same.  This flat iron worked like a cheap, generic one I bought that did ok. I have thick, medium coarse hair, this iron did OK on my ends but my roots stayed puffy. This one didn&#x27;t meet my expectation, so I ordered the one I got before this one, and this is going back for a refund. I guess it the onyx that isn&#x27;t working with my hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Great price. Can&#x27;t beat it! You should get it...Go on!</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a flat iron for cosmotology school, we purchased this one as others are MUCH higher in price, but this one works just like the expensive professional ones, ....smooth, shiny, silky straight hair in very little time and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.&lt;br /&gt;great buy!!!</li>
    <li> These irons are freaking awsome!!!! They make my hair feel like silk! They are miracle irons!!!! I love these irons!!!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when you order this board, because they said many things too good to be true for the price we have is very cheap, but safe and I&#x27;m happy now.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it leaves my hair the temperature rises to 500 (I do not need so high) but I put it to a level suitable for my hair, and let me warp of either one or two passes for maximum tuft.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the material is not heated because of where you grab, as there are some plates that are heated to the handle, this does not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: its temperature rises to 500, no pulling hair and smooth in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I would like to bring temperature indicator because only brings a button that has a hairline thin to thicker when the temperature rises but does not indicate the temperature we are using, I never use it up to 500, but only guess where to put it button, but the temperature never that I am using.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I throught it would</li>
    <li> I received the product dirty! Had someone&#x27;s  hair on it.  I thought I was getting great deal on this, and was very excited when I saw the box outside my house... Only to be disappointed</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife...she loves it! Great product, great value.</li>
    <li> I love my herstyler.... !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would buy it again. This is the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
    <li> So far so good , great price . Good product .</li>
    <li> i love these flat irons, Ive used them on didferent types of hair from corse, to silky straight and they get it straight....my hair is curly and they smooth my hair with no issues everytime. that golve comes in handy because yes hunty they do get hooooooooooot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she seems to really like this product. When I told her how inexpensive it was she was suprised. Good Budget Styler.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I opened my package and it had obviously been opened and used before. The seal was not tight and the iron was not put in well.&lt;br /&gt;They should at least tell you they are used!&lt;br /&gt;Beware!</li>
    <li> Very nice, works excellent and the price was amazing.</li>
    <li> I was really anticipating this iron because of all the good reviews on Amazon and other sites. I use my flat iron every other day and I need a high setting because I have frizzy, curly hair. I got in the mail and used the next day. It did an excellent job! Better than the Remington which I was using. I only had to do 1 swipe of the iron per section. And the style stayed throughout the day. It gets really hot so you need to put it on a heating pad or acceptable counter. It also contains a heat-resistant glove. I saved the glove but didn&#x27;t need it. I have to say I was so happy I got this and am very pleased with the product-no complaints only raves. It really got rid of the frizzies.And there is NOTHING out there with this quality at this price. I would definatley say go for it! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this product. Bought with  overnight shipping and ended up throwing it out. Does not heat. They contacted me for an exchange but never sent a new product. Horrible experience</li>
    <li> I have owned a Remington straighter that I LOVE for 10 years, but it&#x27;s a 2 inch straightener and I wanted a 1 inch for styling/curling, so I purchased this Herstyler. This is a good straightener. It gets screaming hot, and I like that the controls are inside the handle as opposed to on the outside, where I would hit them while I&#x27;m using the straightener.  However, I still prefer the Remington for quick straightening (habit perhaps?) and I am not very good at curling with the Herstyler. I think it&#x27;s possible to do it, but I am too styling inept to get it right.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in 2012 from a kiosk in the mall. I was extremely skeptical but was talked into buying it by the rep. I paid way more than what it is currently listed for on Amazon. They told me that it had a lifetime guarantee and if there were any issues, I could just bring it back to them and they&#x27;d replace it. My sister and I both bought one and we joked about how we were probably scammed and the straightener probably sucks. Well, here I am, 3 years later and I am STILL using this straightener. I&#x27;d say it was money well spent! I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. Some of the reviewers say that it destroyed their hair, that may be true. The iron gets REALLY hot. I have thick and coarse hair, though, so I need some extra heat to get my hair to get to where it needs to be. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it has destroyed my hair, but it does make my hair look healthy once I&#x27;m done straightening it! I&#x27;m completely happy with this product. I&#x27;m shocked at how cheap Amazon has them listed for sale. I&#x27;d consider buying again.</li>
    <li> Recieved the straightener in a timely fashion. I read many reviews before deciding on this straightener and I wish I would have spent a little more for a better one. It does heat up quickly so that&#x27;s nice however my hair looks exactly the same as it did with my 5 year old Walmart straightener. I guess my expectations may have been a little too high. Overall it gets the job done but definitely not without going over my hair a few times. I have fine hair not thick so I thought it would be quicker than my old one.</li>
    <li> I have had a Her styler for a few years and love it. My Mom kept borrowing mine so I bought her, her own. Its great!!! Then her friend said your hair looks great what did you do and so I bought her Friend one as well. Needless to say we Alll LOVE herstyler and for kinky hair the BLACK Ceramic makes all the difference. By the way I paid full price for mine the very first one in a local mall yeah wish I had searched online first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for two months now and it is the best flat iron I have ever owned or used.  It slides easily over my AA hair, without pulling or burning my hair.  I have since colored my natural hair, and have not noticed any burning or damage.  I love this flat iron!  It came with a glove, which I have no need for, as I do not use on the highest heat setting.  I have not found the handle to get hot.  I adjusted the heat from the midway setting in small increments until I found the setting suitable for my hair.  I also purchased the holder to use when I use the flat iron, and store it there when not in use (iron unplugged, of course).  Excellent price-point, excellent product.  Product arrived in new, unused condition.  I don&#x27;t care that the lettering is smudged as it doesn&#x27;t affect use of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this flat iron. I was kind of nervous that it wouldnt be as good because of the price, but when it arrived it looked just like my previous flat iron that was over $100. I have ethnic hair so the temperature has to be really high . You won&#x27;t be desapointed</li>
    <li> It works, and gets the job done quickly, but I&#x27;m not sure I understand all the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; about it. Don&#x27;t use it with post-drying wet straightening treatments, it singes your hair, not like actual high end flat irons. My hair is long and very curly, it worked a LOT better blowing my hair out straight first. Probably because it&#x27;s a narrow tool and I have always used 2 inch ones.</li>
    <li> Love it - works great</li>
    <li> It is definitely a used one which I expected anyway but the plate is not gliding smoothly as it should be in most irons.</li>
    <li> I am not pleased my hair straightener was not new and it did not heat up fast even after putting on the highest setting it still did not straighten hair that good. I am not pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only flat iron that I&#x27;ve tried that straightens my fine curly hair while leaving it soft and not damaged.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter, she always had mine so I thought I&#x27;d get her one for her. We love it!</li>
    <li> My best friend, who I purchased this for, LOVES this flat iron. She has nappy ethnic hair and always complains on how unmanageable it is. I bought this one because it has a higher heat setting than mine and am AMAZED at the results on her hair. She now has really flat manageable hair she loves.</li>
    <li> This thing get so hot and has my hair looking amazing every time I use it... And the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago and I love it! It heats up pretty quick and I love love love that I can use it to straighten and curl my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener was awesome, it heated up so hit, that is what I needed with my thick hair I have d, I would recommend if you are looking for a great hair straightener this is the one</li>
    <li> No working it only work for little bit</li>
    <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
    <li> I choose to purchases the coconut oil, because one of my friend uses it for almost everything. This products is good for your hair and your body, but you can use it to cook as well. I just love it!!!!.</li>
    <li> This item was as I expected with great deal of price</li>
    <li> It was a gift my daughter love it</li>
    <li> love it! and better than paying 220.00 at the mall, lol</li>
    <li> The superstyler works great. It doesn&#x27;t get as not as I thought,  but nonetheless it does its job.</li>
    <li> Good except it doesn&#x27;t give you the actual  temperature of flat irons (according to my wife, I don&#x27;t use these).</li>
    <li> Out if all the flat irons I&#x27;ve ever bought , this one is amazing! Keeps its curls for days and keeps my unruly curls straight. Best tool ever!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product while it was on sale because I wanted to see if it was really worth the amount that was the original price. This product has the highest temperature I have seen a flat iron go to. I have very thick hair that doesn&#x27;t like to be flat ironed. I used this product and it only took me 15-20 minutes to flat iron my hair. It usually takes me at least an hour to flat iron my hair. It does get very hot so someone would have to stay around it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall or anything.</li>
    <li> Super impressed! Amazing deal for this flat iron. Love all the features it has, floating plates, adjustable temp and the cord swivels to prevent tangling.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate in return for my unbiased review. I let my teen granddaughters test and review this. Well the 4 are now fighting over it and 2 of them have a expensive competitors brand.  Lol, my youngest child of 16 won, but I have to order more for Christmas. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> It was good and did what it was supposed to do, but did get too hot if you use it too long.  You don&#x27;t have to apply too much pressure while using it.  I like the look and style a lot.  For the price, I would buy it again or as a present.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s working very well and I am happy about it. I totally recommend</li>
    <li> I love it, has great quality and works better than other straightners I have used.</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I have ever bought.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your money!!</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve Ever used!! I plan on buying more Herstyler products here on Amazon. I have very Thick , course, curly hair and this smoothed my hair onThickI&#x27;ve always had to go over the same times. This was one time done!! I read reviews about people getting there hair burnt. And also leaving a description Of their hair type. Seems to me they shouldn&#x27;t of bought this model in first place. The box is very Cleary marked even and states it&#x27;s meant for those with Thick Hair -Very Curly Hair . So I advise you if you have thinner hair maybe not use this model . Or use it on its lowest setting possible to start.</li>
    <li> My straightening iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  It also seems to pull my hair alot.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and works well. Although it was used and the seller did not state that.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, I can not believe I got it for this very low price. Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I love this iron I would harder it again its great so far. .😀</li>
    <li> i like it very much thank you</li>
    <li> Price is amazing! Don&#x27;t fall for the mall!  This is the real product.</li>
    <li> I love these flat iron new inbox , super hot with out drying out my hair . Better iron than my chi iron .</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great so far.I love that it has the different temperature setting.I like that its good on thick hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my Herstyler straightener, it is amazing and heats up so quickly! I want to buy two more for my sister and mother! :)</li>
    <li> This product works okay, however my hair seems to get stuck in it which leads to some painful pulling.  This may be due in part to my hair being very fine.</li>
    <li> Great price and the wife loves it-thats the most important factor! Several reviewers stated they felt it appeared repackaged or previously used like they were returns? Not the case here! I can usually tell when an item such as this has been used-look at how the cord is bundled up. If it were previously used the  person before me didn&#x27;t extend the cord fully? Do you know how difficult it is to repack the cord like originally packaged? It heats up quickly and glides through hair effortlessly. Not sure why retail price for these things is so high but for the price I paid, it was worth it.</li>
    <li> The boxes were taped shut like they were used and the straighteners were all scratched up</li>
    <li> NO SUCH COMPANY KNOWN AS HERSTYLE.  GOOGLE IT FOR YOURSELF.</li>
    <li> Nice package looks good, not for me but i order it as a Christmas gift for my mother in law. Read good reviews on youtube must work good save at least 30% buying it here; hope she likes it wish me luck!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this Herstyler flat iron. I have purchase one flat iron after another and have never found the right one. Until now. I first saw this flat iron at a kiosk in the mall and they were selling for $150.00. I decided to check online before purchasing, and good thing I did, I got a fabulous flat iron for a fraction of the price. If like me you have been searching for a flat iron that really works, this is it!</li>
    <li> Straightener works good but is not the same as the herstyler that I tried at a kiosk selling the same product. This straightener was half the price of the straightener at the kiosk so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I love my herstyler, I was a little bit skeptical about the performance initially because of how low the price was (around $60 for a straightener + curling wand set) but it impressed me. I have curly frizzy hair (mixed with African American) and this straightener was able to make my hair silky and frizz free! It gets super hot 500 degrees to be exact, which is nice bc I only have to go over a section once. The packaging was nice, and the flat iron design is sleek and does not catch on my hair. It heats up quick and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it&#x27;s held up so far (even after I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times on my bathroom floor). If your looking for a good reliable flat iron for a good price I would recommend this one! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is bc I feel like the temp gage is hard to read, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure how really not it&#x27;s getting. Other than that love it! And also love the curling wands I got in the set too! (Not sure if they sell that anymore as I did not see it)</li>
    <li> First tried this at my sisters house.  Loved it so much I had to get one for myself.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product for a steal of a price!!!!!  Works wonders to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. Although it turns on and heats up, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s at the correct temperature. I used it on my hair and went over the same sections of hair repeatedly and it barely did anything. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. It makes my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair super straight.</li>
    <li> tyhis is a gorgeous heavy duty styler that leaves my hair really shiny. The price is incredible.</li>
    <li> Totally not original it doesn&#x27;t work like the last one I had I thought I had a bargain and NO I just got a disappointment</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the iron but the seller is good</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair to my waist and I needed a straightener that heats fast and over 450°f . Usually it can take up to 1 hour to get the job done. With this straightener it took around 30 mins. Only Bad thing is that they delivered it to my neighbors house Good thing they brought it to my house.</li>
    <li> this straightener is terrible. it completely destroyed my hair. it honestly doesnt work nearly as well as people make it sound. and your hair doesnt go through very smooth. ive only had it a few months and I bought a new one....a solia. and i have previously used baByliss. would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!  It gets very hot and it is also nice and sturdy.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good flat iron, HerStyler is a great brand.  I&#x27;ve owned two of their flat irons and this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> The plates heats up fast as described. I accidentally dropped mine (vinyl floor) the first day I got it and chipped one of the plates  :( Still works, but just be careful  with it. It chips easily in comparison to my ceramic CHI, which I have had it for years and dropped it many times.</li>
    <li> Always had a burnt spell to it and didn&#x27;t like the way it did my daughter&#x27;s hair. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> loved it this is a great products gets really extremely hot.., i bought this as a back up with my other ones i use this from time to time.., i also use my old one as well</li>
    <li> I just got my flat iron yesterday. Although it did come sooner than the expected ship date,it was missing the mat that was supposed to come with it. I actually purchased a Herstyler in 2008 from a kiosk in the mall and that one is still going strong and I paid a great deal more for that one! The price is great, almost too good to be true now. This flat iron gets too hot for my coarse hair texture, but the good thing is that the heat settings are adjustable.I am going to keep it because the price is too low to go through the process of returning it and you problably could not have came across a better deal for the price unless you stole it!!!.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for terrific cost!</li>
    <li> It is perf! I just have to get a heat protector cause it can damage my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely fake. The iron is not even.</li>
    <li> my bf got this for me and used my account to ship it to me, love it, best straightner ive ever had</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve used several of these.  At some point we end up breaking them (usually a hard fall to a hard floor) and need a replacement.  LOVE this flat iron.  Daughter is a competitive swimmer with bi-racial hair.  She likes her hair straight and we flat iron it almost EVERY morning before school.  Her hair is past her shoulders and thick.  I can do the job in under 20 minutes with this flat iron.  Even at the high temp, with the glove and moving quickly...hair remains in good condition.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, gets points for presentation, but plates pulled my hair, not a smooth flow through plates.</li>
    <li> Works really well just like the $100 one I got from the mall!</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price</li>
    <li> It works excellent! Heats up really fast and straightens in no time. I have really thick hair that is to middle of my back and I can straighten it in 7 mind flat! So glad I invested in this. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. ... I love this flat iron it is by far the best one that I have ever purchased...</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have ever bought. I don&#x27;t have to turn it on high to get it to be very hot. Its small enough to fit into my pocketbook. The flat iron also came with a glove so I can get really close to my scalp and not burn myself. I would buy this product for birthday and Christmas gifts. I received this product at a discount (or free) in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used her styler flat irons before and they worked great.. But this in particular one pulls the hair really bad as if the plates are cracked or something..  Definitely not a good buy.  Not sure if I received a defected one, but it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    <li> No complaints! Does the job and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. Great value!</li>
    <li> Great just like the one in the mall</li>
    <li> This is the one to get! Super nice and in a beautiful box.</li>
    <li> The HERSTYLER FLAT IRON did meet my expectations and more it was just what I needed to get a straight silky finish for my hair as well as for my daughters hair. I am truely happy with the results and plan to purchase a second one.</li>
    <li> Since I have hard to manage hair, I was so impressed with how well this styler has done with my hair!&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and I find that my new hairstyle now lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Before I applied this Styler to my hair, I prepared my hair with some glossy hairstyling spray.&lt;br /&gt;Results were very shiny hair and it did not frizz up even in the heavy rain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided by Herstyler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Best straighter EVER!!!! I promise you, you WILL NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Too hot to operate and it took too many times to straighren6</li>
    <li> I had a BaBylissPRO Nano before for 4 years.  This flat iron isn&#x27;t bad, it works well, but it isn&#x27;t as good as my other flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a very good styler. It is the best I have had. I find I do need to wear the glove that comes with it to avoid burned fingers/hands.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and it smooths out my hair without any frizz.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these that I have purchased and I am so happy with it. The price is unbeatable and the quality is wonderful! I love that you can adjust the heat. I have never had a single problem with either of them at all. The only reason I purchased another one is mine got kind of icky from the product build-up so I retired that to my &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; straightener and ordered a new one. I also love to curl my hair with my flatiron and I feel like this one is shaped perfectly for that so thats a lovely bonus.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat Iron a couple of years ago, I didn&#x27;t use it everyday as I have another small one from a different brand. Sadly a couple of weeks ago I decided to use it, (since my hair is long enough now), and it didn&#x27;t heat at all.I was really amazed when I started using it, because my cousin had bought the same exact one from a kiosk at the mall for almost three times the amount of money I paid here. Now I guess those $30 bucks worked as a rate of $10 per each year I had it. Not sure about the quality of this product outside the kiosk. My recommendation (I will take my own advice this time) go with Conair, all of my hair dryers, flat irons, curlers, are from this brand and have worked well over the years. I thought I was getting a better product, but with this flat iron you should not expect a long-run return on your money. Get sometime else.</li>
    <li> There are temperature controls on this HerStyler ceramic straightener and curling iron. You can adjust your temperature from 180° F to 500° F. When I was testing it, I could tell the rapid rise in temperature by simply holding my hand close to the side of the plates. These plates aren&#x27;t static, but rather flex and move when you are working with your hair. It&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;Floating&amp;#34; technology, something rather different than some of the old-style irons I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HerStyler is a professional iron and the heat generated can be steep so there&#x27;s a nice heat-resistant glove included. It&#x27;s soft, comfortable black glove double stitched with pink on the top of the elasticized cuff. If you haven&#x27;t already, it would probably be wise to invest some sort of holder to house it in when you use it. There is a curved lip around the iron and the plates shouldn&#x27;t touch a counter if laid down flat, but anything can happen (and does). I wouldn&#x27;t want to take any chances and burn my counter. There are a lot of affordable ones out there, including HerStyler, but picking one out is a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to create a frizzy mess, you certainly can do so with any kind of straightener or curling iron. You should definitely be using moisturizing conditioners and some sort of heat protectant if you&#x27;re going to use the HerStyler on a regular basis. A little protection will keep your hair from becoming damaged and worn out looking. One thing nice about this iron is that you won&#x27;t get any snags with the Floating technology. They move side-to-side and glide over the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Innovative MCH ceramic heater-Heats up in seconds&lt;br /&gt;► Onyx ceramic plate to maintain high levels of heat&lt;br /&gt;► Same great results twice faster&lt;br /&gt;► Powerful 500° F heat designated for thick and curly hair&lt;br /&gt;► Negative ion technology eliminates static and frizz by neutralizing positive ions&lt;br /&gt;► Straight-Curl-Flip-Style, all in one straightener&lt;br /&gt;► Heat resistant glove included for your convenience&lt;br /&gt;► Once year manufacturers warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This black HerStyler is very easy to hold and control. Good thing because I&#x27;m not particular good at using one, but am trying out several HerStyler irons and am getting better at it. There is an On / Off switch and a control dial behind the top plate. You can curl, flip, or straighten with these narrow 1&amp;#34; ceramic plates. I don&#x27;t have long hair, but it can be unmanageable. Depending on the weather, I can have curls, waves, and it can stand straight up at times, giving me an unsightly pixie look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the ceramic plate HerStyler out on dry and then on damp hair. I tried a few different things and was satisfied with the performance. It&#x27;s not recommended that you use these on wet hair in an attempt to style and dry it. I don&#x27;t know anything about &amp;#34;negative ions,&amp;#34; but only know how well this HerStyler worked. If you are interested in them and you don&#x27;t know about them, perhaps a little research is in order. Even on my short hair I was able to straighten where it needed it, experimented with a bit of curl, and flip. The iron works well, but simply don&#x27;t expect it to do more than it claims to do and you&#x27;ll be fine. I do like the addition of the control, something that many people prefer in an iron. The control can be turned 180° and you can see a small indented dot that will indicate where you&#x27;re at temp-wise. Probably wise to set your temp before using the iron while under a bit of light because the black can be difficult to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.one straightener&lt;br /&gt;► Heat resistant glove included for your convenience&lt;br /&gt;► Once year manufacturers warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This black HerStyler is very easy to hold and control.

    <li> Love it!! A friend of mine was telling me about one she had gotten at the mall but, I hate going to the mall so, I looked it up online and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for me and one for my daughter l.Needless to say my friend is ticked that she paid so much for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!!</li>
    <li> Getting used to using flatiron instead of curling iron- I like it</li>
    <li> I love my Herstyler Superstyler. I can straighten my hair in 40 min. I have very thick curly hair, it took me 2hours and 15minutes with other brands. Nothing works like my herstyler.</li>
    <li> I had one b4..so after it was broken. .I bought 2 more from this site. .however am not amazexactly sure if am happy. .it does not glidesmoothly on the hair. .and it leaves a burn smell even on low temp</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and affordable.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my first herstyler flat iron...</li>
    <li> Love this brand HerStyler. Great price compared to the mall prices</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even had it 3 months and the plate just broke in half. I&#x27;ve had other HerStyler products which were amazing, but no. Just no.</li>
    <li> Works way better than my old straightener and I have very tricky hair. Shipped fast and came in a cool case.</li>
    <li> I have had Herstyler for about 7 years now and every few years I update mine so when I saw this on Amazon for $30 instead of $200 I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Ive already used it twice on myself and once on my moms hair; we both are hispanic but my hair is really thick and frizzy. I&#x27;d have to say I have no complaints. I love that I can pick what temp I want, I love how it gets close to the roots, my hair is soft, shiny, less frizzy, and I was happily surprised that it came with a glove for when I want to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my last Herstyler (Forever), this one gets my hair done a few mins faster, my hair is much softer and it is less frizzy. So its just an extra plus especially since the last time I bought mine in the mall for $150.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that since it is small it does take long to do my hair and your hand can get tired (especially your thumb) but in the long run I&#x27;d rather it be small for my roots. So you pick and choose which is more important. Oh and this product did Not come with a bag for travel/storage. But the box is nice and you can buy a bag at walmart.</li>
    <li> awesome product. love the way my hair feels</li>
    <li> Nice product, very nice. Starting with the box that it comes in, beautiful box. Looks like I went to a fancy salon and purchased it. Flip top open with velvet inside and magnetic clip close.  Impressive. Nice large long swivel cord doesn&#x27;t tangle up, comes with a glove so the heat of the iron doesn&#x27;t hurt your hands.  Temperature goes from 180 Fahrenheit to 500 Fahrenheit which my one I purchased before which was a very expensive ($450) one only goes to 450 f so the extra temperature is nice.  Heats up fast Straightens hair nicely the best I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommended. No the cord help so you can walk around move back and forth with ease. No skittle on ground in front of the morrow anymore for me. I&#x27;ve enclosed pictures. Pictures are before and after. Look at the shine it added to my hair! I received this product free/heavily discounted price to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is absolutely amazing. I have frizzy curly hair and it does an outstanding job on making it look fab. The only downfall is how it makes my hair smell after I straighten it. It has sort of a skunk smell to it. I can live with it though since my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Great product - sensational price.  My girls prefer this over their Chi. This straightener reduces time spent straightening by half from the Chi.  I bought four as gifts along with the serum and each one lived them.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I ever used!</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t as great as the herstyler straightener I purchased from a kiosk at the mall, but the delivery time was earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Still can&#x27;t believe the price! Gets my real hair and extensions straight in seconds!</li>
    <li> Best ever!!!!! I have been using for over 8 years!&lt;br /&gt;Every 3 years I buy a new one!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal for about 10 percent of what they cost at the Mall. Buy one before they are all gone.</li>
