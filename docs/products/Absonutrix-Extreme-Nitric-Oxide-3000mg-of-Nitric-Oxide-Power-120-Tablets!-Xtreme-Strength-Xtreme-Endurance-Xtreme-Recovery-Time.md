      <li>If up lack boost of energy when at gym.&lt;br /&gt;#2 Increases blood flow which helps with more reps and recovery</li>
      <li>content.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if your trying to get a better NO</li>
      <li>Used better.</li>
      <li>I was using another well known brand and it was greater then</li>
      <li>Seems to give me a better and faster pump.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Why spend more?</li>
      <li>This was ok stuff.</li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>then 3 more after the workout.</li>
      <li>It may work better for some people than others.</li>
      <li>if u have any more questions, comments, etc.. leave a comment</li>
      <li>it works pretty good but wasn&#x27;t the kick I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t strongly recommend, but for price not horrible.</li>
      <li>This product is really good when you start to compare to the top name brand such as Force Factor and many others that are 3-5times the price!</li>
      <li>This is important if you wish to continue w/ the product you like best long term.</li>
      <li>so u can continue it full time!</li>
      <li>the price.&lt;br /&gt;Absonutrix Extreme No2 works perfect.</li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Anyways product does deliver results such as more pump in and out the gym, added strength and vascularity, aids in helping nutrient delivery since No2 products make your veins become twice or more in size with continued use, along w/ many more benefits IMO!  </li>
      <li>But now I am a little jittery, and the pump is awesome and is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The tablets are HUGE.</li>
      <li>But afterward,  I feel a huge</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d try this because it was so cheap.  </li>
      <li>If it does, I will stick to my Free-form L-Arginine which is great as well, to use before and after workouts and also on ur off days to keep that Vascular look and get the nutrient effects all arginine and similar amino acids provide.  </li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>Overall GREAT for Nature &amp;#34;gymrat&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I did get up off my chair today and felt more powerful.</li>
      <li>Still when I did the math 15bucks and free shipping is what I paid for my 1st bott.</li>
      <li>and so far so good, I have 4diff.</li>
      <li>The positive note was that I did gain more weight while taking than I did while I was not.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m certain a better product can be found without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>For the price not bad</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me a super pump or anything, but 5 minutes into a workout</li>
      <li>More than What I Normally do.</li>
      <li>At 53 yrs old I can say Absonutrix Extreme No2 is the best product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Product is awesome I can tell a different as long as I take the suggested dose.... 3 pills on days</li>
      <li>Nothing special really but its not bad.</li>
      <li>but wow, my wife is enjoying the increased blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>This supplement was definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Add comment for any questions, comments, etc.. or a list if you wish to find out a great combo that seems to have worked out great for me the past few yrs.  </li>
      <li>-- right...</li>
      <li>Unlike most NO2, I did not get the pump right away, or in the middle of the workout.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about any extra endurance or strength, but I am not a pro-gym person, so I don&#x27;t know any better.</li>
      <li>no2 is supposed to make veins bigger, in order to feed the muscle with more oxygen.</li>
      <li>much quicker!)</li>
      <li>... I still mostly give 4 stars so they don&#x27;t get a big EGO and start raising prices.</li>
      <li>Personally, I like Six Star No2 better.</li>
      <li>so it can be somewhat overwhelming but most all do the same thing at the same dose.  </li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>when most others are 2tabs making the average a full 2mo.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping,this stuff really does work.i have went from 206lbs to 245lbs .so</li>
      <li>Most are great, some not so good, but all products in that line are not cheap and only offer a few extra benefits that are deff.</li>
      <li>not so sure of the exact impact since i use other stuff with it</li>
      <li>From now on, I&#x27;ll just stick to using the real stuff.</li>
      <li>but this one really helps with blood pressure.</li>
      <li>Expected better</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as much as it says so..</li>
      <li>it help me to get pump up for a workout i like using it very goood  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s why work so fast</li>
      <li>i am ready.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not a potent as I want it to be ... went with another brand with same dosage and my ding dong very hard again</li>
    <li> Product is awesome I can tell a different as long as I take the suggested dose.... 3 pills on days I don&#x27;t work out and 6 pills on the days I do work out....3 an hour before lifting...then 3 more after the workout. Of course needs to be added to your normal vitamins and proteins supplements and you have to work out Hard....not a pansy tone up work out this is for builders.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying this product, like all pre workouts out there, will no doubt affect everyone differently.  But for me, I have not had a pump like this for 2-3 years.  I just got done lifting.  Took three tablets about 20 minutes prior to starting.  Unlike most NO2, I did not get the pump right away, or in the middle of the workout.  But afterward,  I feel a huge surge.&lt;br /&gt;I did the same exact workout I usually do, with the same amount of water during, same bubble gum, only thing that was different was I forgot my usual headphones.  :)  But now I am a little jittery, and the pump is awesome and is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Took this product for two weeks. It had no effect what so ever. For some it might be placebo effect but I payed close attention to it, and nothing.</li>
    <li> This supplement was definitely worth the money.  Much cheaper than other products like it on the market.  My husband has taken the name brand No2 and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
    <li> not what i expected at all..no energy..no recovery ...no strength..</li>
    <li> Seen little to no results and most of the pills we&#x27;re broken.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give me anything, it only made me feel tired. From now on, I&#x27;ll just stick to using the real stuff.</li>
    <li> This crap does not work!! Dont waste your money..  If you feel the slightest bit of anything its probably just your guilty conscious trying to trick you into thinking it works so you wont feel so used for spending the money on it!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as much as it says so..</li>
    <li> this product is great.  this product increases your strength and endurance. I recommend this product to anyone. I give it 4 stars</li>
    <li> The effects of this product are notice immediately&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;I have try other products before to sea what happen&lt;br /&gt;is not coated I think that&#x27;s why work so fast</li>
    <li> Its really not that bad for what its price. Its basically six star stuff in a smaller pill size form. All in all it works pretty good but wasn&#x27;t the kick I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is really good when you start to compare to the top name brand such as Force Factor and many others that are 3-5times the price! It contains the same amount of tablets as the new force factor 2 which in my opinion is a 5 star product, but is also very expensive and the only way I can afford it is through doing a few trial offers of some of their new No2 products.  Most are great, some not so good, but all products in that line are not cheap and only offer a few extra benefits that are deff. not worth 3-5times the prices since IMO are deff. not 3-5times better!  Maybe 30-50% at best!  This product offers almost just as much active ingredients(Nitric Oxide Booster)and in some cases more than the expensive brand names out there but the dose is 3tabs per serving(40day supply but only 20 if u do what the bottle states which IMHO is way to much and is there so u go through the bott. much quicker!) when most others are 2tabs making the average a full 2mo. supply.  Still when I did the math 15bucks and free shipping is what I paid for my 1st bott. and so far so good, I have 4diff. products that I use containing No2 so I only take 1tab per day of Absonutrix Extreme No2 along w/one other product for a total combo of a little over 2000mg&#x27;s of Nitric Oxide for my pre-workout along w/other supplements and I use another 1000-2000mg&#x27;s post-workout along w/ 35+Grams of Protein Isolate 3-5times a day, Cycle Assist when on cycle and if not, other supplements such as testosterone Boosting products or Test  Cyp. or Enanthate Injections while on cycle.  Add comment for any questions, comments, etc.. or a list if you wish to find out a great combo that seems to have worked out great for me the past few yrs.  Anyways product does deliver results such as more pump in and out the gym, added strength and vascularity, aids in helping nutrient delivery since No2 products make your veins become twice or more in size with continued use, along w/ many more benefits IMO!  Deff. a product to check out or consider if u lack Energy in the gym and will continue to use as long as the price doesn&#x27;t raise.  If it does, I will stick to my Free-form L-Arginine which is great as well, to use before and after workouts and also on ur off days to keep that Vascular look and get the nutrient effects all arginine and similar amino acids provide.  There are a wide variety of different MFG&#x27;s and deff. Arginine types so it can be somewhat overwhelming but most all do the same thing at the same dose.  There are some newer Generation No2 products in the Factor 2 by Force Factor that seem to provide a stronger effect even at lover does again this has been my experience w/ the new product.  Trials are still going on as far as I know for both Factor 2 and TestX180, etc...?  That&#x27;s why is great to try diff. products on amazon or trials until you find the one that works best and also one that you can afford on a reg. basis.  U don&#x27;t have to cycle on and off this stuff so you want to find a product in ur pr. range so u can continue it full time! This is important if you wish to continue w/ the product you like best long term. Good luck, Stay Strong! Hope this helps and if u have any more questions, comments, etc.. leave a comment &amp; I&#x27;ll get back to U ASAP!  I will also explain the 2 ingredients that r not commonly found, if ever in a bottle of NO2 but are in this bottle!(OKG &amp; GKG)very Important facts that took me a few hrs. 2 gather  but this is deff. a 5 star product, it just seems like when a MFG. gets all 5star rating&#x27;s then prices start to go way up! so I very rarly if ever give a 5star due to this issue!  Even If Im very satisfied w/everything, product, service, price, etc... I still mostly give 4 stars so they don&#x27;t get a big EGO and start raising prices.</li>
    <li> Product did not work fully as expected, but I did see and increase of about 7lbs on my max outs. Wouldn&#x27;t strongly recommend, but for price not horrible.</li>
    <li> i noticed it helped a little with recovery but not much else considering the price i will probably buy again</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. The results are amazing. The makers of this item knew what they were doing when they formulated this product. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> 60 Day Money Back Guarantee -- right... the seller says 14 day return unopened; the manufacturer&#x27;s web site say 30 days (and fails to clarify the terms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works no better than lower dose products costing a fraction of the price... or a number of products that combine NO2 with other active ingredients (like Creatine Ethyl-Ester L- Arginine L-Carnitine  L-Taurine) and it seems the \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot; is just as suspect as the merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation -- save money and buy another brand (and buy direct from Amazon so at least you know that any \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot; promises are going to be kept).</li>
    <li> this works great. just wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> This product is great for pre and post work outs.</li>
    <li> No good false advertisement .</li>
    <li> Very fast recovery time after solid work. i am ready. to get up and going the day after workouts without any muscle soreness</li>
    <li> Bought this item a couple months back after running out of some spendy GNC No2. While this product does help it does not give me the \\&quot;blast off\\&quot; that the other No2 supplements do. For the price not bad but I&#x27;m certain a better product can be found without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I Have Not Yet try It. I Did it Once today &amp; Wow it Made Me Sweat Way More than What I Normally do. &amp; I Lasted Longer.  Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> These pump me up,  so I believe they work great,  I will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> This was ok stuff. Cheap but I did not really notice a big difference in my weight lifting. The positive note was that I did gain more weight while taking than I did while I was not.</li>
    <li> Very good. get a jump of energy.</li>
    <li> Great product will for sure continue use</li>
    <li> It took longer than I expected to take effect, but I&#x27;m now seeing the results.  Which was just as they advertised!</li>
    <li> SCAM alert!  This individual never shipped the item. I spoke with UPS rep and was told a label was created but the package was never actually mailed. My bank statement shows the total amount of the product was debited the day the purchase was made. There&#x27;s no way to contact the seller either. I gave it a star because I&#x27;m required to do so in order to submit a comment, I&#x27;ve actually never tried this product.</li>
    <li> The tablets are HUGE. They taste terrible, they smell weird, but I think they work fine. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I started taking these, but I have found that I do recover faster. I don&#x27;t know about any extra endurance or strength, but I am not a pro-gym person, so I don&#x27;t know any better. I think that taking 6 pills (3 before working out and 3 after) as recommended is a lot to take all at once, but I&#x27;m little.</li>
    <li> seems to help my pump..</li>
    <li> Five stars awesome does what it say</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on me , maybe I should of double daily dose. Who knows</li>
    <li> Garbage just Garbage does absolutely nothing, this is truly asian crap quality product.</li>
    <li> i was struggling with 225lbs. starting taking this pill I was at pushing 315lbs three times within three weeks of taking the pills. Im very impress.</li>
    <li> It was ok. No real progress just a bit of a boost. Nothing special really but its not bad. Expected better</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this because it was so cheap.  Very slight energy increase but no pump.  I would only recommend this is you&#x27;ve never taken a NitricOxide booster and are trying to save money.</li>
    <li> At 53 yrs old I can say Absonutrix Extreme No2 is the best product I have ever used. I have more energy with my work outs. Am stronger and adding lean muscle mass.</li>
    <li> I just threw the bottle out in the garbage. I used it despite the fact that many of the pills were broken and crumbling into powder. I finally decided to throw it out because I was sick of having powder all over me everytime I opened the bottle. The pills had no effect what-so-ever. I would never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Personally, I like Six Star No2 better.</li>
    <li> good product quick ship</li>
    <li> I have used this product before my purchased.</li>
    <li> Seems to give me a better and faster pump.</li>
    <li> Got nothing from it. Don&#x27;t remember using it.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and same as descripted.</li>
    <li> I was using another well known brand and it was greater then 3 Xs the price.&lt;br /&gt;Absonutrix Extreme No2 works perfect. It does what it said it would do on the label and does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;Extreme Strength, Extreme Endurance, Extreme Recovery Time with NO light headedness or dizziness.&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly continue purchasing Absonutrix Extreme No2 as long as they keep the price of it fair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it to a friend.</li>
    <li> It works&lt;br /&gt;will buy again.....</li>
    <li> not so sure of the exact impact since i use other stuff with it</li>
    <li> I use this before doing any workout or when splitting firewood or anything that requires me to stay motivated and steady without loosing energy. This really works! I chew one or 2 and down that with water although they are in pill form so its up to you I guess.</li>
    <li> The product did a good job for me I seen a difference within two weeks of use. Getting ready to place second order.</li>
    <li> i like it it help me to get pump up for a workout i like using it very goood  yes</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly.  I was concerned about it actually working.  But, I felt a difference and continue to feel a difference.  It doesn&#x27;t give me a super pump or anything, but 5 minutes into a workout I feel a rush of blood and energy in my body.  Works great for me.  I have recommended this product to other people.</li>
    <li> good product...feels like it supports my VO2 capablities...also mental/physical faculities...positive effects for recovery enhancement...could feel the difference in 10 days solid...</li>
    <li> Ive searched for a perfect stack for 8 months now, and this is my preworkout MUST. Mixed with Jack3d. Definitely feel the pump after 5 minutes. After I&#x27;m done, I cant buckle my seatbelt by reaching, have to turn my whole body. It may work better for some people than others. Its just my two cents :D</li>
    <li> Perfect Just what i was looking for and great service.</li>
    <li> Hello I&#x27;m a Fitness Trainer and my thoughts on this product is. ...#1 helpful for If up lack boost of energy when at gym.&lt;br /&gt;#2 Increases blood flow which helps with more reps and recovery time.&lt;br /&gt;#3 Overall GREAT for Nature &amp;#34;gymrat&amp;#34; who&#x27;s like too work hard and being patient and results&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Only see results FAST base on Your Performance and Dedication does NOT give u new muscles over NIGHT. ..you Must Train and sweat to the EXTREME Daily. .</li>
    <li> at first i thought drinking NO is bad for my heart but after drinking this it makes me feel better for some reason. Im not saying for other people with heart problems to drink this but its personal preference. i also exercise and sometimes eat a good diet but this one really helps with blood pressure. i dont get dizzy as much from standing after taking this. might be from the magnesium content.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if your trying to get a better NO this is not it. I also take NO XPLODE and that one works well. im scared to take C4 cause my brother and friends says they get the tingles all over the body and something unnatural is what i dont like.</li>
    <li> All this product did was give me migraines.</li>
    <li> Rarrrrrrr. Take this stuff and you will be ripped like a dinosaur. Like a T-rex just rippin it up. Rarrrrrrrrrrr, Rarrrrrrrrrr</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eating this product for a couple weeks. I still am a fat slob. I did get up off my chair today and felt more powerful.</li>
    <li> These no2 pills are good, but have some flaws. no2 is supposed to make veins bigger, in order to feed the muscle with more oxygen. not much of that happen with these. they are great for energy though.</li>
    <li> The product works. I have a broken back and work out my upper body while sitting. After a few days, I noticed some gain in my muscle mass. Another pleasant side affect is an increased libido . I have no problem but wow, my wife is enjoying the increased blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is cheap and not really sure if its works, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and have yet to notice and muscle gain at all. I think the ingredients are generic that&#x27;s why the product is so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I give it five stars cuz it works excellent for me  I like the way it works the pump but you have to dring a lot of wather I will recommend this product to beginers at the gym</li>
    <li> Thsi must not be that good becasue I don&#x27;t even rememebr buying it. If I bought it, I used it, if I don&#x27;t rememebr it, it must not work.</li>
    <li> Eh... not what I was expecting.  Used better.</li>
    <li> it was a good deal you should try it i think its the best one i ever had before .</li>
    <li> The best very good product can&#x27;t complain 5 stars</li>
