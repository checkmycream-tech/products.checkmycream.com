      <li>Wonderful Palmerosa.....</li>
      <li>I give this product a rating of excellent for quality.</li>
      <li>The aroma is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Great quality, beautiful fragrance</li>
      <li>Smells great, too.</li>
      <li>in a good way.  </li>
      <li>good oil for the price.</li>
      <li>The product was of good quality and met my needs.</li>
      <li>Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I read it&#x27;s good for irritated skin and split ends.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, it seems like Palmarosa Oil, which is a good oil for skin and against fungii.</li>
      <li>This one smell good from the bottle like citrus ones do.</li>
      <li>This is a good one to have on hand.  </li>
      <li>It smelled really good too.</li>
      <li>Yep, wonderful Palmerosa, that is all ;)</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice sheen on my hair.</li>
      <li>I will say mix with carrier oil very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for my soap making, thanks for being good at what you do!</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this oil.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s better than citronella in scent.</li>
      <li>love their size and price....use it for many homemade products</li>
      <li>The oil really smells great.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the Seller gets a top rating from me.</li>
      <li>A favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I seem to have fallen in love with Palmarosa, this year.  </li>
      <li>In fact,  every one of the essential oils from this company have been very good.</li>
      <li>Excellent product quality and received it faster than expected.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it because it&#x27;s SO strong smelling.</li>
      <li>but it works fine.</li>
      <li>This oil is very strong, but when diluted with a few drops into a large batch of water it makes a very pleasant palmarosa scent, I used this one for months and since it is so durable the 30 ml bottle lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>Now I know why it&#x27;s such a good insect repellant.</li>
      <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful!  Very bold and long lasting!</li>
      <li>I received the palmarosa eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
      <li>It was shipped in a timely manner and arrived safely in adequate packaging.</li>
      <li>Most essential oils have strong smells because they are so concentrated and need to be diluted.</li>
      <li>I think it would be nice to see GC/MS analysis/data on essential oils that are sold, so that people can know for sure what is in the stuff, since it is a product that usually ends up in the body one way or another, and also because important components vary from oil to oil, and also because they tend to come from developing countries without much regulation on agricultural practises, and it&#x27;s good to know that you are getting the components that you really want.</li>
      <li>It is good to put a drop of either Thyme/Lemongrass/Palmarosa on your toothbrush, or to rub on athlete&#x27;s foot, or other skin problem.</li>
      <li>makes great deodorant in combination with other natural ingredients</li>
      <li>It smells pure and powerful.</li>
      <li>I use palmarosa essential oil for one of my ingredients for an healthy scalp.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure initially about the dropper as I had not had that type before</li>
      <li>This is so pungent that I can only use a couple drops in my mixes, and it overpowers the other oils until it burns off (and good thing it evaporates quickly).</li>
      <li>I got it for many of its qualities - digestive support, stress &amp; fatigue relief, scar tissue and dry skin / wrinkle treatment, antibacterial qualities (e.g. for scrapes and acne treatment) -</li>
      <li>It says 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade,</li>
      <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Jan</li>
      <li>So, I will assume average :)</li>
      <li>Perhaps that means it&#x27;s just more concentrated than previous versions I&#x27;ve purchased?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised with this product.</li>
      <li>I was quite surprised how it made my skin feel and smell.  </li>
      <li>Adding 90-100 drops each of Thyme, Lemongrass, and Palmarosa Oil to a 50g container of Vick&#x27;s Vaporub gives you a good Essential Oil Balm that will kill just about any skin infection (bacterial/fungal, even viral) or other problem, including minor skin cancers (it&#x27;s a powerful and secret combination of oils, don&#x27;t tell anyone).</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t really know if it is good or bad or just</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember which Palmarosa this is, since I got 2 bottles from 2 different places, and they both said 100% something or other, but one was 2x more than the other, but they both seemed the same to me.</li>

    <li> Not sure yet. Will update in a couple months. I will say mix with carrier oil very strong fragrance. I bought this because I read it&#x27;s good for irritated skin and split ends. It leaves a nice sheen on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this oil. Most essential oils have strong smells because they are so concentrated and need to be diluted. This one smell good from the bottle like citrus ones do. This oil works well for the uses I use it for. Very happy and will buy again. Recommend it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to create scents for homemade soaps. The product was of good quality and met my needs. It was shipped in a timely manner and arrived safely in adequate packaging. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is so pungent that I can only use a couple drops in my mixes, and it overpowers the other oils until it burns off (and good thing it evaporates quickly). Now I know why it&#x27;s such a good insect repellant. I guess it&#x27;s better than citronella in scent. I got it for many of its qualities - digestive support, stress &amp; fatigue relief, scar tissue and dry skin / wrinkle treatment, antibacterial qualities (e.g. for scrapes and acne treatment) - but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it because it&#x27;s SO strong smelling. Perhaps that means it&#x27;s just more concentrated than previous versions I&#x27;ve purchased? It works - so still giving it 4 stars. But PHEW.</li>
    <li> I received the palmarosa eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
    <li> I rub it on my back along with a few other oils before bed at night. I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> Mixed this up with some lemon oil and vanilla extract to keep the mosquitoes and ticks away from my children. Works great! Will definitely buy this again!!</li>
    <li> I seem to have fallen in love with Palmarosa, this year.  This is a good one to have on hand.  In fact,  every one of the essential oils from this company have been very good.</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong, but when diluted with a few drops into a large batch of water it makes a very pleasant palmarosa scent, I used this one for months and since it is so durable the 30 ml bottle lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> I mixed the rose-geranium oil and almond oil and it helps keep ticks off. Smells great, too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> makes great deodorant in combination with other natural ingredients</li>
    <li> It says 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade, whatever that means, and I guess it is, because I don&#x27;t have any scientific data either for or against that statement. Does it mean it is edible? Does it mean they wash the insects/fertilizers off the grass before the steam extraction? Does it mean the grass is grown without pesticides? I don&#x27;t know. Anyhow, it seems like Palmarosa Oil, which is a good oil for skin and against fungii. It is good to put a drop of either Thyme/Lemongrass/Palmarosa on your toothbrush, or to rub on athlete&#x27;s foot, or other skin problem.
