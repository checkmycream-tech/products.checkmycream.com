### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it works perfect</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff</li>
      <li>Great smelling and works well.</li>
      <li>noxzema is great and the price is great</li>
      <li>I was so happy to see an \\&quot;adult\\&quot; Noxzema.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleanser that won&#x27;t break the bank like some others.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try after reading a lot of good reviews about it, however it&#x27;s not for my skin.</li>
      <li>Noxzema make good cleaning products.</li>
      <li>This one however smells good.  </li>
      <li>I think SA can do a really good job on upholding the already \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; face</li>
      <li>But the problem stopped after a good 1 or 2 months of usage and everything takes off nicely ever since.    </li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>When I was done, my skin looked amazing</li>
      <li>But it is nice.</li>
      <li>This is definable the absolute best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>excellent product  highly recommend it</li>
      <li>It has a very fine grit which is like a mini exfoliate type wash.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and afford!  </li>
      <li>This is better than the store bought cleansers.  </li>
      <li>and I seemed to get breakouts more often.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin more greasy and oily in the T zone and</li>
      <li>My favorite face wash</li>
      <li>And the result was prominent.</li>
      <li>This is better to me.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth and it does a great job getting into those pores.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it available!!</li>
      <li>And in my own personal opinion, the stronger and more aggressive acne fighting ingredient is BP, while SA is more on the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; side of the battlefield.</li>
      <li>I tried another kit called Acne Free</li>
      <li>I ordered this on amazon because I liked the original product, but what was sent to me was the new product.</li>
      <li>Between Terminator 10 and this, they fight bacteria with a purifying clean while also utilizing the word Oil-Free.</li>
      <li>That being said since they&#x27;re all priced the same, a good scent can be the tie</li>
      <li>I am thinking about hitting that \\&quot;State of Emergency\\&quot; button to halt the usage of SA product immediately and switch back to my good ol&#x27; BP Oxy Wash.    </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, and because of this I&#x27;m more prone to getting acne.</li>
      <li>; whatever they&#x27;re made of they are not the natural crushed nut shells or fruit pits) and they are the perfect density.</li>
      <li>I picked a bottle of this up at my local CVS pharmacy and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Let me be clear: I actually LOVE this.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially for the adult complexion.  </li>
      <li>No idea if what they sent me works as they sent the wrong item, unwilling to exchange for correct item (pictured/listed, is awesome oil free) and didn&#x27;t get my refund, insisting they did</li>
      <li>Two stars for the fresh and minty feeling.</li>
      <li>The others I&#x27;ve used smell very medicinal, which is fine because I need them to work first and formost</li>
      <li>Active ingredient, preforms well, good scent</li>
      <li>I am currently in my late teens and early twenties (the perfect age range for acne invasion)    </li>
      <li>My sleeping pattern is still normal with 8 hrs a day, and my sexual activities have been in neutral gear for weeks since I start experiencing the new SA ingredient.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need very much each time you use it.</li>
      <li>When I first used the scrub it worked well</li>
      <li>For the fact that I have been using Acne Face Wash products for the last 5 years in a row now, I think it is safe call myself an \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; consumer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Aveeno and St. Ives, they work much better</li>
      <li>I saw results after the first wash</li>
      <li>My first choice is always BP.</li>
      <li>Love this daily scrub!</li>
      <li>I increased the frequency from washing twice a day to 3 times a day and for the last 4 days, things hadn&#x27;t got better any bit.</li>
      <li>I think the lower concentration of Salicylic Acid is great as I have sensitive skin and all other products which use 2% was rough on my skin and caused more problems.</li>
      <li>First of all, there are 2 main types of acne fighting ingredients: Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) and Salicylic Acid (SA).</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t take that scent anymore, which is a real shame.</li>
      <li>Scrubbing beads exfoliate very well.  </li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t need to use it very often.</li>
      <li>After using this scrub my face feels very refresh...</li>
      <li>This is my every day deep clean face cleanser.</li>
      <li>For the first week of using Noxzema, I admit my face was literally 100% clear.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for men or women.</li>
      <li>its gentle on a sensitive Skin and Cleared the Acne</li>
      <li>and I ended up with Noxzema with a totally new SA ingredient.    </li>
      <li>As I got older, I thought those days were over, however as an adult I find the occassional breakouts.</li>
      <li>out of all the face wash that I have use in the past, I feel like this one makes the most difference on my face.</li>
      <li>However, now I first use the regular Noxzema cleanser and then use the scrub over it.</li>
      <li>This Noxzema face wash really got me hooked on the clean and menthol feeling left on my skin after washing though, but feeling only is just not enough</li>
      <li>I used 2 times a weak and used it in my face and chest, having amazing results.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need much if you only use it on your T-Zone and that stretches out your usage of the product.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to have few breakouts.</li>
      <li>I got this product for my daughter but when I use it my face is soft with noticeable cleanness.</li>
      <li>my acne is really clearing up and noxzema is the only stuff that works</li>
      <li>My face looks youthful and feels so soft.</li>
      <li>Not too harsh but strong enough to get the job done.</li>
      <li>Overall I urge anyone who wants to try a different acne cleanser to give this one a try.</li>
      <li>This product received was not as pictured and was not the same ingredients or way to use as the old product was.</li>
      <li>When I used it the other day for the first time in several weeks, I had to rinse it almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this product worked very well for me, however I do use it in combination with some other products.</li>
      <li>So I searched the nearby CVS store for something that offer some kind of a menthol tingling feeling with small particles to scratch off the dead skin cells (none of the above came with my 5 years running Oxy Wash)</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to people with minor to moderate breakouts, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s strong enough for severe acne sufferers.</li>
      <li>I developed acne in my late 20s, and most scrubs are too harsh for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I would rather go with Benzoyl Peroxide which can give me 80~85% clear face, but at least that percentage stay CONSTANT for the last 5 years, rather than depending on Salicylic Acid to give me 100% clear face, but last only a little more than a week like a candle in the wind.    </li>
      <li>No black heads or dry skin.</li>

<li> Although during the first few times of usage, my face did dried out and redness appeared.</li>
<li> 2nd and 3rd week came by and my face took a nose diving down the hill day after day.</li>

<li> , I also found that despite the regime above, when I put on foundation, my nose and chin would again get oily within a few hours.</li>
<li> everyday and it has became my daily habit.</li>
<li> this Salicylic Acid agent backed down and ran away like a little pussycat standing next to a firecracker.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
<li> My face turned from a flat plain into a world map with mountainous terrains here and there.</li>
<li> Although its Noxema, it&#x27;s not really their typical cream in the jar cleanser.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I realized that my local Targets and Walgreens were switching to a new product, &amp;#34;Ultimate Clear Anti-Blemish Daily Scrub.&amp;#34;  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> But it is nice. The tight skin and smell are both missing. Says self foaming but I wouldn&#x27;t say that....</li>
    <li> Almost all acne face scrubs are the same.  Same active ingredient, same results, the same.  This one however smells good.  The others I&#x27;ve used smell very medicinal, which is fine because I need them to work first and formost so the smell is almost irrelivant.  That being said since they&#x27;re all priced the same, a good scent can be the tie breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Active ingredient, preforms well, good scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
    <li> This is better than the store bought cleansers.  Although its Noxema, it&#x27;s not really their typical cream in the jar cleanser.  This is better to me.  It cleans well and works to get rid of some skin problems.  Great smelling and works well.</li>
    <li> This product received was not as pictured and was not the same ingredients or way to use as the old product was.</li>
    <li> I tried proactive for about 4 months  and it did a so so job. I tried another kit called Acne Free and I seemed to get breakouts more often. I then tried neutrogena and it still was not clearing up my acne to well. I picked a bottle of this up at my local CVS pharmacy and it is amazing. I saw results after the first wash and I have only been improving from there. This is a great cleanser that won&#x27;t break the bank like some others. Overall I urge anyone who wants to try a different acne cleanser to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the adult complexion.  It is easy to use and afford!  Thanks for making it available!!</li>
    <li> For the fact that I have been using Acne Face Wash products for the last 5 years in a row now, I think it is safe call myself an \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; consumer. I am currently in my late teens and early twenties (the perfect age range for acne invasion)    First of all, there are 2 main types of acne fighting ingredients: Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) and Salicylic Acid (SA). This Noxzema product is SA based with 2% concentration. And in my own personal opinion, the stronger and more aggressive acne fighting ingredient is BP, while SA is more on the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; side of the battlefield. Now I can be wrong, but you can read about the comparison here: [...]    My first choice is always BP. I have been using Oxy Face Wash with 10% concentration of BP for the last 5 years everyday since I was still a high school freshman. And the result was prominent. I survived my High School career with noticeably clearer face with the exceptions of a few times when I got my sleeping pattern out of control because of summer breaks. I wash my face with Oxy Wash twice a day (before and after bed) everyday and it has became my daily habit. Although during the first few times of usage, my face did dried out and redness appeared. But the problem stopped after a good 1 or 2 months of usage and everything takes off nicely ever since.    5 years running until the last 3 weeks when I decided to \\&quot;try out\\&quot; something new since I kinda got bored of the \\&quot;smell-less\\&quot; and no minty tingling feeling that Oxy had to offer. So I searched the nearby CVS store for something that offer some kind of a menthol tingling feeling with small particles to scratch off the dead skin cells (none of the above came with my 5 years running Oxy Wash) and I ended up with Noxzema with a totally new SA ingredient.    For the first week of using Noxzema, I admit my face was literally 100% clear. Almost even clearer than before when I was with Oxy BP. I felt like I could be on a TV screen or something like that you know ^_^ But that&#x27;s it. 2nd and 3rd week came by and my face took a nose diving down the hill day after day. Now I am backed down from 100% clear to 100% not. My face turned from a flat plain into a world map with mountainous terrains here and there. I increased the frequency from washing twice a day to 3 times a day and for the last 4 days, things hadn&#x27;t got better any bit. My sleeping pattern is still normal with 8 hrs a day, and my sexual activities have been in neutral gear for weeks since I start experiencing the new SA ingredient. I am thinking about hitting that \\&quot;State of Emergency\\&quot; button to halt the usage of SA product immediately and switch back to my good ol&#x27; BP Oxy Wash.    Final note, it is not Noxzema to blame here. It&#x27;s the Salicylic Acid ingredient that is too week to hold back any waves of acne invasion. I think SA can do a really good job on upholding the already \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; face but all it takes is a few small waves of acne invasion and this Salicylic Acid agent backed down and ran away like a little pussycat standing next to a firecracker. This Noxzema face wash really got me hooked on the clean and menthol feeling left on my skin after washing though, but feeling only is just not enough, I NEED RESULT! I would rather go with Benzoyl Peroxide which can give me 80~85% clear face, but at least that percentage stay CONSTANT for the last 5 years, rather than depending on Salicylic Acid to give me 100% clear face, but last only a little more than a week like a candle in the wind.    Two stars for the fresh and minty feeling. I would love to receive some comments from someone to correct me if I am wrong! Hope my review helped.</li>
    <li> This is one of the product that I need to have every single day. out of all the face wash that I have use in the past, I feel like this one makes the most difference on my face. I have very oily skin, and because of this I&#x27;m more prone to getting acne. After using this scrub my face feels very refresh... it&#x27;s like drinking a mint mojito... but for your face. Differently recommended!!!</li>
    <li> its gentle on a sensitive Skin and Cleared the Acne i would recommend it to Acne Prone Skin,it works wonders</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product worked very well for me, however I do use it in combination with some other products. I have an oily T-zone, with daily white-heads/blackheads appearing on my nose. When I first used the scrub it worked well and so would have given it a 4 out of 5. However, now I first use the regular Noxzema cleanser and then use the scrub over it. I sort of happened onto this by accident when I used the remainder of the regular Noxzema cleanser and used the scrub with it. When I was done, my skin looked amazing and I woke up the next morning with no whiteheads. I also began using Biore astringent which helped to shrink a couple of enlarged pores. I then use Olay regenerist Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting SERUM (not cream) as a moisturizer. My skin has made a complete 180 in terms of reducing the number of black and white heads that would show up on my nose and chin as well as the enlarged pores. Another note, I also found that despite the regime above, when I put on foundation, my nose and chin would again get oily within a few hours. So whenever I need to put on foundation, I add Dermalogica MediBac Clearing Mattifier cream (APPROX $30) as the final component to the regime before I put on foundation and that takes care of the oil. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for a tiny tube but you don&#x27;t need much if you only use it on your T-Zone and that stretches out your usage of the product.</li>
    <li> Love this daily scrub! I use it once a day at night to scrub away all the oil and dirt. Not too harsh but strong enough to get the job done. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, although I don&#x27;t have acne but one to four breakouts at a time it seems to be helping them heal faster. I would recommend this product to people with minor to moderate breakouts, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s strong enough for severe acne sufferers.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Clean Blemish Control Daily Scrub&amp;#34; By Noxzema is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that works on my skin.  I developed acne in my late 20s, and most scrubs are too harsh for my skin.  I was very disappointed when I realized that my local Targets and Walgreens were switching to a new product, &amp;#34;Ultimate Clear Anti-Blemish Daily Scrub.&amp;#34;  I ordered this on amazon because I liked the original product, but what was sent to me was the new product.</li>
    <li> No idea if what they sent me works as they sent the wrong item, unwilling to exchange for correct item (pictured/listed, is awesome oil free) and didn&#x27;t get my refund, insisting they did but still no money and really just wanted the stupid item I ACTUALLY ordered. .. waste of time and money</li>
    <li> This product is the only one I like to wash my face with. It has a very fine grit which is like a mini exfoliate type wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff I highly recommend it for men or women. This is definable the absolute best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash but they don&#x27;t seem to sell it in the stores.</li>
    <li> How hard is it to post the correct picture with the correct product!?!? What they sent me is not what I wanted and does not match the information/description provided. This company sucks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 13 and even though it&#x27;s says it&#x27;s for adults it works perfect my acne is really clearing up and noxzema is the only stuff that works</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out with whiteheads all over my chin. Makes your skin more greasy and oily in the T zone and over dries your cheeks, and the smell is terrible. I decided to give this a try after reading a lot of good reviews about it, however it&#x27;s not for my skin. I&#x27;m going back to Aveeno and St. Ives, they work much better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Scrubbing beads exfoliate very well.  Controls oil and acne.  Smell is unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> excellent product  highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is my every day deep clean face cleanser. Between Terminator 10 and this, they fight bacteria with a purifying clean while also utilizing the word Oil-Free. My skin feels so soft and smooth and it does a great job getting into those pores. Once a month I will let this sit on my pores for 10 minutes and when I get out my face looks like I got a facial. No black heads or dry skin. My face looks youthful and feels so soft. A+ on product and price.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear: I actually LOVE this. It&#x27;s in a SLIGHTLY creamy base; really, it&#x27;s in a non-foaming base not unlike regular Cetaphil, but it has more body to it than Cetaphil; it&#x27;s not runny. It does rinse thoroughly with water and does not leave behind any oily residue. The scrubbing particles are very small and they&#x27;re rounded plastic (or silicone; whatever they&#x27;re made of they are not the natural crushed nut shells or fruit pits) and they are the perfect density. A little goes a long way, too. You don&#x27;t need very much each time you use it. And you don&#x27;t need to use it very often. Maybe 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fragrance is almost impossible to overlook. It&#x27;s a sweet, over-ripe-to-the-point-of-rotted fruit smell that has unconsciously made me use it less often over the past couple of months. When I used it the other day for the first time in several weeks, I had to rinse it almost immediately. I can&#x27;t take that scent anymore, which is a real shame. Fragrance doesn&#x27;t USUALLY put me off skincare products, unless the fragrance is especially pungent and/or unpleasant. This is one of those.</li>
    <li> I used 2 times a weak and used it in my face and chest, having amazing results. Love It! Noxzema make good cleaning products.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my daughter but when I use it my face is soft with noticeable cleanness. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I used Noxzema all through my teenage years and was always complimented on my skin. I was fortunate to have few breakouts. As I got older, I thought those days were over, however as an adult I find the occassional breakouts. I was so happy to see an \\&quot;adult\\&quot; Noxzema. I think the lower concentration of Salicylic Acid is great as I have sensitive skin and all other products which use 2% was rough on my skin and caused more problems. Definitely keeping this product as part of my routine.</li>
    <li> noxzema is great and the price is great</li>
