      <li>Isn&#x27;t every woman on a search for the perfect mascara?</li>
      <li>it was the perfect mascara for me.  </li>
      <li>Best mascara</li>
      <li>and she says this is the best quality for a mascara she has ever tried</li>
      <li>This stuff is the BEST!</li>
      <li>Awesome brush.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!!</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>This is honestly one of the best cheap mascaras out there!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this mascara anywhere ever since.</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara is still lancome though.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Wish I would have bought more.</li>
      <li>I loved this mascara when I first bought it in stores, but the product I received from here was goopy and sticky...</li>
      <li>Love this product and shipping was quick!</li>
      <li>Enjoy :)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear, and it comes off easily with makeup remover</li>
      <li>Plus, it did not perform as well as any cheap mascara I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping around to see if there&#x27;s another locally available brand that works as well, but this remains my all-time-fave.</li>
      <li>..trust me if u want long beautiful eye lashes</li>
      <li>My friend recommended this mascara to me so I was excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>:) I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (I have long lashes and prefer volumizing but not the thick kind that seem to be the norm).</li>
      <li>The Eyes to Kill curls without your needing to curl and holds it, adds astounding length...and once in a while a tiny flake.</li>
      <li>This time, this tube, however I found it a bit too gloppy and I needed several curler uses - and then some more.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it again, but if it&#x27;s 2 year old mascara, it defeats the purpose.</li>
      <li>It is definitely not the best, but for the price, it is hard to beat.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>** bumps really do prevent clumping.</li>
      <li>I am really bummed I can&#x27;t get it just anywhere.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s waterproof and does not clump too much.</li>
      <li>but I always used the curler anyway as getting a bit older seems to have taken some of the oomph from my lashes.</li>
      <li>and I will like it more again but not the way I love my far too expensive HGs.</li>
      <li>and so far I actually really like it.  </li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t ever had a single problem with this mascara wearing off quickly or flaking onto my skin, which some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
      <li>However I am now comparing it to Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Eyes to Kill Waterproof mascara and lately to the ever so slightly better yet ever so slightly harder to put on Lancome Hypnose Drama Waterproof.</li>
      <li>I have fairly long and naturally curled lashes to begin with, but this mascara makes my lashes go on for miles.</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave clumps, and it makes your lashes long and curvy!</li>
<li> Makes my eyelashes very long no clumping.</li>
<li> will dry out a bit</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t subtle and may be a bit much for your everyday casual makeup if you prefer a more natural look, but when you want serious impact this stuff is tops.</li>
<li> They look very dark, dramatic and voluminous--as long and full as wearing falsies, IMO.</li>
<li> I am not ready to move on to another product.</li>
<li> now am down to trying to find it on &amp;#34;the web&amp;#34</li>
<li> The brush separates the lashes, the product itself doesn&#x27;t get all clumpy or dry so hard it breaks your lashes.</li>
<li> It can appear a teensy bit thick in consistency, occasionally slightly clumpy, so some care is needed when applying it.</li>
<li> **small</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t  know if discontinued but hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> There are hardly ever clumps</li>
<li> It is however hard to get off, so I just use make-up remover.</li>
<li> At least I am saving the brush!</li>
<li> but it is very hard to find.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s SO sad</li>

    <li> Did not like the all plastic applicator &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;. Plus, it did not perform as well as any cheap mascara I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Best mascara ever!i never buy from stores..trust me if u want long beautiful eye lashes this is what ur looking for</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but it is very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara i don&#x27;t  know if discontinued but hard to find in stores. Makes my eyelashes very long no clumping.</li>
    <li> I loved this mascara when I first bought it in stores, but the product I received from here was goopy and sticky... I&#x27;m wondering if [since the product seems to be discontinued] the item I received was expired.  I was so excited to find it again, but if it&#x27;s 2 year old mascara, it defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is honestly one of the best cheap mascaras out there! I would recommend it to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t leave clumps, and it makes your lashes long and curvy! Awesome brush. It&#x27;s a MUST buy.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this mascara to me so I was excited to try it.  It is definitely not the best, but for the price, it is hard to beat.  It does lengthen your lashes, but I have had no adverse reactions to it and so far I actually really like it.  My favorite mascara is still lancome though.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much! Love this product and shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> i have been buying this mascara for years.  now am down to trying to find it on &amp;#34;the web&amp;#34;. it was the perfect mascara for me.  i dont know what happened here but the last couple of orders i have had definitely are not the same.  basically you have to apply several coats just to look like you have mascara on.  either the color or consistency changed.  and i suppose as Rimmel discontinued it the last 2 orders i have received may not be legit Rimmel.</li>
    <li> She tried this mascara that her friend bought her and she says this is the best quality for a mascara she has ever tried</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST! The brush separates the lashes, the product itself doesn&#x27;t get all clumpy or dry so hard it breaks your lashes. I am really bummed I can&#x27;t get it just anywhere. Wish I would have bought more. At least I am saving the brush!</li>
    <li> I buy this mascara all the time. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used for about 2 years. When my local CVS stopped carrying it I turned to purchasing it online bc I am not ready to move on to another product. It&#x27;s just as advertised stays on all day bc it&#x27;s waterproof and does not clump too much. It is however hard to get off, so I just use make-up remover. Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t every woman on a search for the perfect mascara? I know I was, still am but I think I found my HG (Holy Grail). Saw a pixiwoo yt video of this as part of the look and was amazed that it curled her lashes without a curler. Mine too but I always used the curler anyway as getting a bit older seems to have taken some of the oomph from my lashes. This time, this tube, however I found it a bit too gloppy and I needed several curler uses - and then some more. However I am now comparing it to Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Eyes to Kill Waterproof mascara and lately to the ever so slightly better yet ever so slightly harder to put on Lancome Hypnose Drama Waterproof. The Eyes to Kill curls without your needing to curl and holds it, adds astounding length...and once in a while a tiny flake. The Lancome does all that with one coat and no flakes at all. Ever. Could be this current Rimmel tube will dry out a bit and I will like it more again but not the way I love my far too expensive HGs. Think I will always keep a curler in my makeup bag tho...you never know.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (I have long lashes and prefer volumizing but not the thick kind that seem to be the norm). The brush is unlike any brush I&#x27;ve seen at Sephora or drugstores. The three **small** bumps really do prevent clumping. There are hardly ever clumps and I use this every day. It&#x27;s SO sad Coty/Rimmel have discontinued it and moved on to chubby mascara tubes and totally different wands.</li>
    <li> I like the triple plump brush because it does separate my lashes and extends them! :) I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. .can&#x27;t find it anywhere. .</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara on a whim over a year ago because it was on sale at my local department store. I have to say, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fairly long and naturally curled lashes to begin with, but this mascara makes my lashes go on for miles. They look very dark, dramatic and voluminous--as long and full as wearing falsies, IMO. It can appear a teensy bit thick in consistency, occasionally slightly clumpy, so some care is needed when applying it. It isn&#x27;t subtle and may be a bit much for your everyday casual makeup if you prefer a more natural look, but when you want serious impact this stuff is tops. One coat is enough for me, and no curler is necessary. It doesn&#x27;t give me that scraggly &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ever had a single problem with this mascara wearing off quickly or flaking onto my skin, which some other reviewers mentioned. It also didn&#x27;t cause my eyelashes to pull or fall out. It doesn&#x27;t smear, and it comes off easily with makeup remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this mascara anywhere ever since. I&#x27;ve been shopping around to see if there&#x27;s another locally available brand that works as well, but this remains my all-time-fave. If it was still sold locally, I would buy again and again.</li>
