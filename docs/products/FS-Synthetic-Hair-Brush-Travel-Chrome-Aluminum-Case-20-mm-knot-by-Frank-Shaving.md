### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>It is on par or softer than my best badger brush.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for a toiletry bag.</li>
      <li>A great travel shave brush!</li>
      <li>Great for traveling</li>
      <li>Dries very quickly, but doesn&#x27;t whip up the best foam.  </li>
      <li>The product is well made and dries very quickly, which is great for travel, but I am not a fan of the synthetic bristle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has nice ventilation, so I can use it, and then put it away even when it is damp.</li>
      <li>Still builds lather nicely, but does take a bit of work.</li>
      <li>Even a 22mm knot would be a nice improvement.</li>
      <li>Handy travel brush...not equivalent to my Edwin Jagger boar</li>
      <li>Very pleased, the new brush is perfect, Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Well it lasted about 4 more uses before falling apart again.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product and the delivery time.</li>
      <li>Love the way you put it together.  </li>
      <li>FS was MORE than helpful, and sent me a replacement even though the official return time had lapsed.</li>
      <li>The case ingeniously protects the brush.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>The concept is pretty good</li>
      <li>/&gt;The feel of this brush is fantastic - synthetics</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d expect a 24mm knot to overcome the primary limitations rather well.  </li>
      <li>I use a brush and good quality shaving cream because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>would order it again since it dries so fast (and this is good when you travel on-the-go), but I would also order the badger for trips that have a 2-3 days worth of overnights.</li>
      <li>I wanted synthetic because, let&#x27;s be honest, the last day that you spend in any location</li>
      <li>The problem is: right out the box, unused, the inside of the tube is already corroding or had quality problems during chrome plating.</li>
      <li>Painting flecks of metal onto my face wouldn&#x27;t bring me any joy. :-/</li>
      <li>The knot is adhered with an inferior adhesive and it fell out after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Fell apart on first use.&lt;br /&gt;Garbage</li>
      <li>Bristles are too stiff and do not make good lather compared to my Muhle Silvertip.  </li>
      <li>Synthetics dry more quickly and really don&#x27;t suffer from moisture</li>
      <li>Could have just been my single order because overall the reviews for this product seem pretty good</li>
      <li>As advertised -- super soft.</li>
      <li>One more positive, this one doesn&#x27;t smell funny like the other one.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this isn&#x27;t really an issue for travel use - small squeeze bottles of cream are more convenient</li>
      <li>Nice little travel brush.</li>
      <li>It takes a little bit longer to get a lather because it is smaller for travel, but it works great.  </li>
      <li>it does produce decent lather and no worries of mildew with the synthetic bristles.</li>
      <li>I will purchase a high end travel brush.</li>
      <li>The concept is great, but unfortunately the product did not function as advertised.</li>
      <li>Soft brush, compact, does the job for traveling with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>Steady structure and breaks down easily.  </li>
      <li>I love this little guy for travel!</li>
      <li>Very soft brush.</li>
      <li>The brush is reasonably well done as is the outside of the protective tube.</li>
      <li>After the first use the glued end came loose from the one side and was unusable.</li>
      <li>really have come a long way.  </li>
      <li>It takes a long time to develop decent lather.  </li>
      <li>I cant say enough just how soft this synthetic brush feels.  </li>
      <li>My natural hair brush does the same.</li>
      <li>It was not glued down very well.</li>
      <li>synthetic bristle is very soft but curiously springy; it is not scratchy like boar, but it does not have the flexible feel of badger.</li>
      <li>A lot of their other synthetic brushes get high reviews and this one is no different.</li>

<li> When it&#x27;s broken down, the container helps keep the hair from getting damaged.</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to lather as well and tends to drop worse than my expensive non-travel brush, neither problem is hard to deal with.</li>

    <li> I love this little guy for travel! It has nice ventilation, so I can use it, and then put it away even when it is damp. When it&#x27;s broken down, the container helps keep the hair from getting damaged. It does shed a little, but I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s new. My natural hair brush does the same. One more positive, this one doesn&#x27;t smell funny like the other one.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush. But the loft is limited due to the compact nature of the travel brush and case. Still builds lather nicely, but does take a bit of work. The brush is hidden inside the hollow handle/container and comes out via a twist off cap. The brush is then twisted onto the top of the handle the handle for use. Soft brush, compact, does the job for traveling with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> A great travel shave brush! Perfect size for a toiletry bag. The container also acts as the handle, and the sucker never mildews.</li>
    <li> The brush appears to have been glued to one metal end of the case. After the first use the glued end came loose from the one side and was unusable. Could have just been my single order because overall the reviews for this product seem pretty good</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel! As advertised -- super soft. Synthetic, so no yucky badger smell. Give your face the same treatment when traveling. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Nice little travel brush. The case ingeniously protects the brush.</li>
    <li> The product is well made and dries very quickly, which is great for travel, but I am not a fan of the synthetic bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic bristle is very soft but curiously springy; it is not scratchy like boar, but it does not have the flexible feel of badger. As a result of the bristle&#x27;s properties, I have also noticed that the lather prefers to work its way to the knot and stay there, a quick squeeze from the base to the tip will get it out onto your hand where it can be scooped off and applied to the face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order it again since it dries so fast (and this is good when you travel on-the-go), but I would also order the badger for trips that have a 2-3 days worth of overnights.</li>
    <li> Love the way you put it together.  I travel a lot this is just what I needed.  But lately I have to mail blades ahead to hotel.</li>
    <li> The concept is pretty good and I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the brush even though it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as my regular brush. I suspect the synthetic does not hold water as well as the beaver brush. Also, upon second use, the brush simply fell out of the holder. It was not glued down very well. Hopefully an application of Gorilla Glue will allow it to stay put for a while.  Well it lasted about 4 more uses before falling apart again. Deduct 2 stars.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Dries very quickly, but doesn&#x27;t whip up the best foam.  Great for traveling</li>
    <li> The brush is reasonably well done as is the outside of the protective tube. The problem is: right out the box, unused, the inside of the tube is already corroding or had quality problems during chrome plating. It&#x27;s rough, bubbling, and looks on the verge of peeling. I&#x27;m going to give using it a try, but if flakes start showing up on the bristles I&#x27;m going to have to toss it. I use a brush and good quality shaving cream because I have sensitive skin. Painting flecks of metal onto my face wouldn&#x27;t bring me any joy. :-/</li>
    <li> The density of this brush leaves something to be desired, but it&#x27;s a solid travel brush.  I wanted synthetic because, let&#x27;s be honest, the last day that you spend in any location will more-than-likely entail tossing a still-moist brush in your bag.  Synthetics dry more quickly and really don&#x27;t suffer from moisture anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of this brush is fantastic - synthetics really have come a long way.  It just feels small, and the properties of synthetics mean that it&#x27;ll take longer to whip up a lather.  Expect your travel shaves to take a little longer; not only will you need an extra minute for your lather, but the brush is slower to apply the lather as well (relative to a 20mm badger brush.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest sticking with creams.  It doesn&#x27;t load soaps efficiently at all.  Fortunately, this isn&#x27;t really an issue for travel use - small squeeze bottles of cream are more convenient anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering its intended purpose, the only thing I&#x27;d want to change would be a larger knot size.  I&#x27;d expect a 24mm knot to overcome the primary limitations rather well.  Even a 22mm knot would be a nice improvement.</li>
    <li> Handy travel brush...not equivalent to my Edwin Jagger boar but i didn&#x27;t expect it to be....it does produce decent lather and no worries of mildew with the synthetic bristles.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too stiff and do not make good lather compared to my Muhle Silvertip.  It takes a long time to develop decent lather.  Since the hair is stiff, the lather does not apply well.  The travel tube is executed well but ultimately this product is let down by the Synthetic hair.  I will purchase a high end travel brush.</li>

    <li> Fell apart on first use.&lt;br /&gt;Garbage</li>
    <li> This thing is a tough little beauty on the outside and a softy on the inside.  I cant say enough just how soft this synthetic brush feels.  It is on par or softer than my best badger brush.  It takes a little bit longer to get a lather because it is smaller for travel, but it works great.  FS stands for Frank Shaving.  A lot of their other synthetic brushes get high reviews and this one is no different.</li>
    <li> I had a small problem with this brush, there was a defect after a couple uses. However! FS was MORE than helpful, and sent me a replacement even though the official return time had lapsed. Very pleased, the new brush is perfect, Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The knot is adhered with an inferior adhesive and it fell out after the first use.  The concept is great, but unfortunately the product did not function as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, I am saving it for travel.  Steady structure and breaks down easily.  I am pleased with the product and the delivery time.</li>
