      <li>I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Consumer Reports ranked as best</li>
      <li>Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ultra brite, made by Colgate is very good at removing coffee and presumably tea stains.</li>
      <li>I know it has gotten great reviews from consumer reports and</li>
      <li>But Ultra Brite is great for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
      <li>My teeth look great</li>
      <li>it does a great job of keeping stains off my teeth and does have fluoride to help protect my teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
      <li>-in-all a great product</li>
      <li>This is a great brand of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s how I found this page with all these great reviews.  </li>
      <li>an amazing value for toothpaste!</li>
      <li>But the best part is that it&#x27;s dirt cheap.  </li>
      <li>Apparently it&#x27;s good at whitening.  </li>
      <li>Good whitening toothepaste...</li>
      <li>I picked it up from wal-mart at the lovely price of .98!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing at whitening, and I know it has to be cheap because my Dad is always looking to save a buck.</li>
      <li>It appears that Consumer Reports no longer rates toothpaste, but Ultrabright was at the top of their list when they did.  </li>
      <li>If you want a whitening paste, try a better quality brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand on and off for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change.</li>
      <li>I like Ultrabrite better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years--it tastes great and for some reason really whitens.</li>
      <li>The best possible combination!</li>
      <li>The difference is quite astonishing</li>
      <li>I am going to stop using this product immediately and switch to something that is better for enamel strengthening.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I found this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The mint taste is ok.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, given the amazing results and cheap price, this toothpaste is a miracle.</li>
      <li>I was quickly reminded of how great my smile can be.</li>
      <li>This product is a great followup to whitening your teeth with \\&quot;Natural White\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth.</li>
      <li>my favorite toothepaste---feels clean</li>
      <li>The paste is a nice consistency and doesn&#x27;t produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Also I have used this one since 1980 and now my daughters and my grandchildren like it a lot, is cheap.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush because it keeps my breath smelling good and my teeth are white and clean.  </li>
      <li>it is quite abrasive and contains other materials which make it , I think, ideally suited for this.</li>
      <li>With all the magical ingredients (including high abrasion baking soda) of all the other toothpastes tested, this product had the best stain removal, lowest abrasion, and the lowest price!</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B0000530SD Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening Anticavity Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 6 oz (170 g)]]</li>
      <li>At the same time however... this toothpaste is rather cheap, so I guess that makes it a good buy.</li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of expensive whitening toothpastes out there all of which were a great dissapoimtment.</li>
      <li>I cannot be more pleased with these results especially when considering the bargain price.  </li>
      <li>pleased with this product and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive</li>
      <li>The downside however is that is makes your teeth sensitive, so it would be best to alternate between this and another normal toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the paste is great, nice minty flavor, and after just a few uses my teeth were starting to look brighter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning</li>
      <li>and it keeps my teeth nice and white!</li>
      <li>This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rarely any dental issues here in years.</li>
      <li>Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth--all, aside from my wisdom teeth--are white and healthy.  </li>
      <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who is an avid coffee drinker like me.</li>
      <li>A $1.00 price strikes me as suspicious especially since most toothpastes are $3 to $5.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t exactly buy this product from amaazon.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
      <li>toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which, in my opinion, simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I&#x27;ll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly light, tastes like some sort of generic mint, and cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never paid much attention to toothpaste...</li>
      <li>The change in my teeth was so fast and noticeable that I had to Google this toothpaste...</li>
      <li>They are much whiter.</li>
      <li>this is unusual for me because any whitening/brightening toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried before have not done a thing for my teeth.   </li>
      <li>and I frequently get compliments on my smile.</li>
      <li>Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say I noticed it whitening any better than any other whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other</li>
      <li>It works better then any other toothpaste on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Ultrabrite and Pluswhite whitening toothpaste are the only toothpastes that leave the mouth feeling clean rather than the candy tasting ones like Crest.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it 3.75 to 4 stars but considering its low price it gets a full 5 easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In spite of this, I highly recommend the Ultrabrite.</li>
      <li>I went back to the store and picked up two more tubes, just so I wouldn&#x27;t run out in the near future.  </li>
      <li>As far as freshening breath, I do believe it could do a little better in that area...</li>
      <li>This is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that has actually whitened my teeth noticeably.</li>
      <li>Vivid coffee/soda/tea drinker,</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but all the gels and things make them sensitive.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000JJZY4E New Natural White Pro Tooth Whitening Kit]]</li>
      <li>We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using this toothpaste with a cheap electric toothbrush, and the stains are coming off after only a few brushings.</li>
      <li>I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now because I can&#x27;t wait to see how much whiter they&#x27;ll be the next day.  </li>
      <li>Dollar General and Walmart sell it for $1.</li>
      <li>I am now making the connection that since using this product, I have been to dentists (general, endontists and periodontists) more times than I can remember for broken teeth, root canals, root extracts and crown restorations.</li>
      <li>Not only did they not whiten my teeth nearly as well as this product</li>
      <li>I do use an Oral B Professional electric toothbrush, and I believe that helps a lot, as do daily flossing and mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>One of corporate America&#x27;s favorite ways to bitch-slap the consumer is the constantly shrinking product trick while keeping the price the same (or increase it), down to 5.8, 5.5oz or even less by some, if memory serves correctly a normal sized tube used to be 8oz several years back.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s abrasiveness has a downside; too much rubbing over an extended period of time MAY wear down the tooth enamel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very simple stuff down to the flavor, no crystals, no magic strips, no flavors from an alternate universe, no voodoo magic, just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it keeps my breath smelling good and my teeth are white and clean.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it.</li>
    <li> Ultra brite, made by Colgate is very good at removing coffee and presumably tea stains. it is quite abrasive and contains other materials which make it , I think, ideally suited for this. However, it&#x27;s abrasiveness has a downside; too much rubbing over an extended period of time MAY wear down the tooth enamel. As such, I use it only after drinking coffee and don&#x27;t rub too vigorously. it does a great job of keeping stains off my teeth and does have fluoride to help protect my teeth. Other than after drinking coffee, I use Cavity Prevention Crest. But Ultra Brite is great for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I found this toothpaste. I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but all the gels and things make them sensitive. My husband and I use it and I can tell a difference in the color of our teeth. They are much whiter. I can purchase this at my local Wal-Mart for 97 cents a tube. As far as freshening breath, I do believe it could do a little better in that area...that is why I only gave 4 stars. But, as long as I use mouthwash after I brush it&#x27;s really not a problem!</li>
    <li> I also read the consumer reports rating and decided to try it, especially since it only cost $1.09 at Target. With all the magical ingredients (including high abrasion baking soda) of all the other toothpastes tested, this product had the best stain removal, lowest abrasion, and the lowest price! The best possible combination! The only slightly negative aspect is sensitivity, which is not experienced by everyone. If this occurs, using less or brushing with a basic toothpaste every other time should resolve this issue. This is advice from my dental hygenist who has used Ultrabrite for many years, and like me, remembers the annoying commercial when this product was first introduced.    This product is a great followup to whitening your teeth with \\&quot;Natural White\\&quot;. Read the reviews.......[[ASIN:B000JJZY4E New Natural White Pro Tooth Whitening Kit]]</li>
    <li> I used the paste day and night and it did nothing. I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth. This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above. I just didn&#x27;t see a different after about 2 weeks of use. If you want a whitening paste, try a better quality brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips in the past and had only limited success.  On a whim, I bought a tube of this at Dollar Tree, not knowing how well it worked.  After just a few days I immediately noticed a difference!  My teeth, which have been deeply stained by tea/coffee drinking noticeably started getting whiter.  I went back to the store and picked up two more tubes, just so I wouldn&#x27;t run out in the near future.  It&#x27;s been close to a month now and I&#x27;m not even halfway through the first tube, yet there&#x27;s a dramatic improvement.  I cannot be more pleased with these results especially when considering the bargain price.  The taste is decent and it doesn&#x27;t linger after a few swirls of water.  My only negative comment about the product is that it&#x27;s very runny.  It&#x27;s not as thick while brushing like some toothpastes are, and therefore this stuff really splatters while using an electric toothbrush if you&#x27;re not careful.  In spite of this, I highly recommend the Ultrabrite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste as long as I can remember. Ultrabrite and Pluswhite whitening toothpaste are the only toothpastes that leave the mouth feeling clean rather than the candy tasting ones like Crest.  I cannot find it in any store these days, and I am almost out. Does anyone know who carries it in the Milwaukee, WI area? Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to settle for buying online from now on.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports ranked as best so I started using it. I am very happy with the results. Dollar General and Walmart sell it for $1. I would not have tried it without Consumers Reports recommendation. A $1.00 price strikes me as suspicious especially since most toothpastes are $3 to $5.  One of the few cases where a low price is not  a tip off to a bad product.    [[ASIN:B0000530SD Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening Anticavity Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 6 oz (170 g)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months, and my teeth just sparkle! Vivid coffee/soda/tea drinker, and it keeps my teeth nice and white!</li>
    <li> Good whitening toothepaste... but I can&#x27;t say I noticed it whitening any better than any other whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve had. At the same time however... this toothpaste is rather cheap, so I guess that makes it a good buy.</li>
    <li> We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it&#x27;s inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which, in my opinion, simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I&#x27;ll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change.</li>
    <li> Now how often do THOSE two words go together? Not that often in a toothpaste! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and personally I&#x27;ve never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth. Rarely any dental issues here in years. My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile. These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour. The paste is a nice consistency and doesn&#x27;t produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush. The price can&#x27;t be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this toothpaste with a cheap electric toothbrush, and the stains are coming off after only a few brushings. This is a great brand of toothpaste. It works way better than expensive teeth whitening strips or homemade baking soda paste. I definitely recommend to people who struggle with stubborn stains on their teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never paid much attention to toothpaste...I just use whatever my Dad buys.  However, I noticed that when he switched to this brand, my teeth were looking whiter and brighter by the day...this is unusual for me because any whitening/brightening toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried before have not done a thing for my teeth.   The change in my teeth was so fast and noticeable that I had to Google this toothpaste...and that&#x27;s how I found this page with all these great reviews.  So I decided to add mine. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now because I can&#x27;t wait to see how much whiter they&#x27;ll be the next day.  If you have struggled with getting your teeth unstained despite brushing regularly, I would recommend this to you. It&#x27;s amazing at whitening, and I know it has to be cheap because my Dad is always looking to save a buck.</li>
    <li> I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever&#x27;s cheap...cough) and this is what I&#x27;d call a \\&quot;throwback\\&quot; toothpaste.  It&#x27;s very simple stuff down to the flavor, no crystals, no magic strips, no flavors from an alternate universe, no voodoo magic, just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It&#x27;s fairly light, tastes like some sort of generic mint, and cleans very well.  Apparently it&#x27;s good at whitening.  But the best part is that it&#x27;s dirt cheap.  It&#x27;s a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste, basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that it&#x27;s made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years--it tastes great and for some reason really whitens. I&#x27;ve also used the 10$ toothpaste. I like Ultrabrite better. Funny-right?</li>
    <li> my favorite toothepaste---feels clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand on and off for many years. I know it has gotten great reviews from consumer reports and thats why a lot of ppl try it. As far as the whitening is concerned I personally wouldn&#x27;t rank it high in that regard, its not very effective at removing surface stains in my experience. The mint taste is ok. The fluoride, cost, and tube size are why I buy and use it. One of corporate America&#x27;s favorite ways to bitch-slap the consumer is the constantly shrinking product trick while keeping the price the same (or increase it), down to 5.8, 5.5oz or even less by some, if memory serves correctly a normal sized tube used to be 8oz several years back. It&#x27;s owned by colgate palmolive. I&#x27;d give it 3.75 to 4 stars but considering its low price it gets a full 5 easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pick it up from my local dollar store, 6 oz. tube &#x3D; .17/oz. an amazing value for toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that has actually whitened my teeth noticeably. The difference is quite astonishing and I would recommend this to anyone who is an avid coffee drinker like me. The downside however is that is makes your teeth sensitive, so it would be best to alternate between this and another normal toothpaste. Otherwise, given the amazing results and cheap price, this toothpaste is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Works well, have definitely noticed it whiting my teeth</li>
    <li> Also I have used this one since 1980 and now my daughters and my grandchildren like it a lot, is cheap.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t exactly buy this product from amaazon. I picked it up from wal-mart at the lovely price of .98! The consistency of the paste is great, nice minty flavor, and after just a few uses my teeth were starting to look brighter. Although I did notice that my teeth got a little more sensitive to cold afterwards. But that&#x27;s just might be on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush. Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For me, since I have somewhat sensitive teeth, so I use this every other day (for whitening abilities) and I use Sesodyne toothpaste on the alternate days. This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Back when my children were little I bought this toothpaste because it was cheep. I remember being stopped on the street by a couple of ladies inquiring on how I got my teeth so white and I didn&#x27;t know what to say. I was actully embarrased to tell them that I used a dollar tree toothpaste. It&#x27;s been several years since that day and I think I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of expensive whitening toothpastes out there all of which were a great dissapoimtment. Not only did they not whiten my teeth nearly as well as this product but they left my mouth feeling unclean and did nothing for buildup. I was so sick of spending all that money that I decided to grab a tube of ultrabrite at the dollar tree  on a whim. At the time I just figured that if they&#x27;re all crap anyway why waste all that money. I was quickly reminded of how great my smile can be. It works better then any other toothpaste on the market in my opinion. I&#x27;ll never switch again.</li>
    <li> lives up to its hype as it cleans teeth and makes them whiter. can find at your local dollar tree as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 5 years now. I began to use it because Consumer Reports said that it was actually the one whitening toothpaste that worked. In that case, I guess I should give it a higher rating, although I&#x27;m not sure my teeth are any whiter. With whitening pastes there is a price to pay in that they tend to be abrasive and wear down the enamal, and I believe that is my problem. I am now making the connection that since using this product, I have been to dentists (general, endontists and periodontists) more times than I can remember for broken teeth, root canals, root extracts and crown restorations. I have spent a fortune! I am going to stop using this product immediately and switch to something that is better for enamel strengthening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ultrabright exclusively since I was 18, and I&#x27;ll be 61 next month.  My teeth--all, aside from my wisdom teeth--are white and healthy.  My wisdom teeth were removed when I was 21 at the advice of my dentist.  I still question that call.  I do use an Oral B Professional electric toothbrush, and I believe that helps a lot, as do daily flossing and mouthwash.  It appears that Consumer Reports no longer rates toothpaste, but Ultrabright was at the top of their list when they did.  Walmart recently stopped carrying Ultrabright, so I buy it elsewhere now.  You can still find it for less that $3 per 6 oz. tube, shipping included, if you look around</li>
