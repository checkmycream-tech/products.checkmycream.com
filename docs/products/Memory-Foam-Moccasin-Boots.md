      <li>so im giving them a four star for the fit and will up date</li>
      <li>Liked mine so much that I ordered another pair to give as a gift.</li>
      <li>I like them as far as looks thought they were warm...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very warm and easy to put on, walk outside to get the morning paper in or pick up the mail outside.</li>
      <li>they are more likely slippers!</li>
      <li>They are a little warm for current weather, but still comfortable.  </li>

      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t any inside memory foam support at all</li>
      <li>They are comfortable other than the snugness, really.</li>
      <li>Items marked Large for ladies foot size 9-10.  </li>
      <li>But....order larger sizes because they run very, very small.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These really keep my feet warm when it&#x27;s cold around the house, the only thing that I would want from this is better sole comfort.</li>
      <li>Would be better to have dracker lining , as this bright white cheap lining will get dirty soon and not sure they will last long after washing.</li>

    <li> Boots were just what I wanted for my wife and she likes them very well. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that they ran a little small so I ordered a size larger, and they fit. I just got them today so I don&#x27;t know yet how im going to like them so im giving them a four star for the fit and will up date my rating after I wearing them awhile.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re a gift for my wife and she loved them says they are very comfortable she wears them in the house all the time</li>
    <li> they are more likely slippers!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable but not long-wearing.</li>
    <li> Size runs about 1/2 a size too small. Velcro on sides doesn&#x27;t match up.  Rather cheap feeling.</li>
    <li> I like them as far as looks thought they were warm...no cold goes through soles bad from my floor (tile) they stretched out badly I am disabled walk like a drunk duck as is.. now have trpped because to to big, if you buy order 1-2 sizes smaller thats how big the stretch, I sorry about this posting.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made and the size is not even close. Very disappointing; this was supposed to be a gift. Now I have to pay for shipping just to get a refund. Not much of a refund when half of it will go to sending the item back.</li>
    <li> Very nice, were gift.</li>
    <li> Great for the winter. Very warm and comfortable. I really enjoy wearing them around the house in the evening. Great!!!</li>
    <li> Items marked Large for ladies foot size 9-10.  Wife is size 9 and couldn&#x27;t get shoes on.  returned for larger size</li>
    <li> These are wonderful! Liked mine so much that I ordered another pair to give as a gift. But....order larger sizes because they run very, very small.&lt;br /&gt;Very warm and easy to put on, walk outside to get the morning paper in or pick up the mail outside. Love them!</li>
    <li> I like these shoes, but they tend to run a little snug/tight. They are comfortable other than the snugness, really.</li>
    <li> These really keep my feet warm when it&#x27;s cold around the house, the only thing that I would want from this is better sole comfort. There really isn&#x27;t any inside memory foam support at all so you might want to add some insoles for support. I do love the color and the look of these.</li>
    <li> I ordered the larger size as indicated by others.  Worked out fine.  They are a little warm for current weather, but still comfortable.  The moccasin style gives more room for your toes.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality, and the colors do not match as in the picture.  They May last for a while.</li>
    <li> Long story short, these boots run much smaller than the sizing indicates. You may want to size up 1 or 2 sizes when ordering. The quality of the product was a bit dubious as well (they weren&#x27;t as well constructed as the image in the ad would indicate). But they are house slippers and they are $20, so I guess what do you expect?</li>
    <li> Just okay to wear in house, but they look better on photo. Would be better to have dracker lining , as this bright white cheap lining will get dirty soon and not sure they will last long after washing. Price is cheap too, will keep</li>
