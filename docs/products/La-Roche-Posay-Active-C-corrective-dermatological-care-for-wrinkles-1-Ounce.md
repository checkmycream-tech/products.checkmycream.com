<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Helps to keep the skin on my face healthy.</li>
    <li> I use Retin-A at night to keep my skin clear and cut down on fine lines, but I needed something for the morning.  I use this along with the version intended for the eye area before my morning moisturizer, and I LOVE them.  This one absorbs quickly and makes the skin wonderfully soft and supple.  I&#x27;ve noticed a definite decrease in fine lines with this regime.  I love La Roche-Posay products, and my dermatologist highly recommends them.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying, I NEVER write reviews. I&#x27;m the kind of person to think about how i should but then never do...until i met this product. I was having a skin crisis where i simply couldn&#x27;t get my skin alleviated of dry flakes on my cheeks. I&#x27;m Asian/European with generally sensitive skin but able to cope with a lot products  truly \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; people aren&#x27;t and so i started using Affirm (retinol) to relieve some minor acne on my face thinking i was above having problem skin...BAD idea. For months after even after ceasing all use of it my face continued to be flaky, erythemic and irritated. I&#x27;ve generally always had very soft, clear skin so this was new for me. This would all completely, and when i say completely i mean, COMPLETELY come to end once i started using Active C. Within one week of use with the smallest pea sized amount morning and night my skin was glowing with NO flakes and had smoothed out so nicely i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face and reveling in how amazing the transformation was. If i had to give you a phrase to help you visualize a girl whom you&#x27;ve no idea what she looks like i&#x27;d say, \\&quot;RECHARGED AND GLOWING.\\&quot; I probably won&#x27;t ever stop using it. I recommend it to everyone in any skin care conversation, and i love it so much, i&#x27;m actually writing my first review on a product. Do yourself a favor and try it. You have nothing to lose (except for the $37 or so bucks, but even then its a small price to pay for truly radiant skin). I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skin care products as many have, But THIS one people, is the one you want to invest in. I promise.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, very fast. Very prompted!! It was a pleasure to deal with. Wonderful product and store. Thanks</li>
    <li> As a man, I have not thought of using a product like this on my face.  I tried it on the recommendation of my dermatologist and am extremely well pleased with it.  While the price may seem high, a single tube lasts almost three months.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but never noticed any difference in my skin. In fact I used it for a year and still no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but the ones I have were not affected at all.</li>
    <li> It works for light lines, not deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It is very excellent I really like it because it clean my skin skin, keep it moisture n looking good, the only thing it&#x27;s the price out of my pocket.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, it was oxidized and yellow. I normally use this eyecream so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like.</li>
    <li> Use it ones, use it for ever.  Excelent product, your skin looks radiant and so smooth.</li>
    <li> Fighting with pigmentation, early wrinkles and dull skin, I decided to give this a try after reading that vitamin C is one of the best active ingredients for skin care. This product has a good concentration (I think around 5%), so it&#x27;s effective, but not too irritating,&lt;br /&gt;After 2 tubes, I feel I&#x27;ll use this for years.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t help much with the pigmentation, and the effect on wrinkles is very subtle, given the low concentration vitamin C. But my complexion has improved greatly, the dullness is gone, and my skin looks dewey and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommended for those who have the patience to wait for real, long-time results.</li>
    <li> Received product in expected amount of time.  Product seems to be \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; which is critical for topicals containing vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Excellent under eye cream from one who has tried many</li>
    <li> Received product opened &amp; re-packaged, the tube had been squeezed several times which made it very clear that I was sold a used product</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I have been using it for 5 months already and like the smoothness and softness it gives to my skin.  In my youth I did a lot of sun tanning, not knowing what it could do to my skin.  This product is supposed to help \\&quot;undo\\&quot; the damage I did way back then.  I do like it, and this market was the best prices I have found for the product.</li>
    <li> I love this Active C!  It smells great and really leaves my skin looking and feeling nice.  I&#x27;ve never noticed a greasy, heavy feeling from it.  I have combination skin leaning on the oily side and this is an awesome moisturizer.  La Roche-Posay just discontinued the Active C XL which was a little thicker and had more of a smoothing effect on my forehead so THAT would be my favorite skin cream, but no longer, Active C it is!</li>
    <li> I love this brand. My skin is very sensative and could never use just anything.  I have been using this for over 14 years.  People always assume that I am 6 to 8 years younger than what I really am.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over 10 years; it was originally recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office and I continue to use it.  It is very light, moisturizing and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived from the vendor far more quickly than I anticipated.  Very good and personal service, the vendor follows up.</li>
    <li> My top derm doc recommends this, as do many other skin experts. (I&#x27;ve used this for years, but I also use Retin-A. I&#x27;m a 49-yr-old Asian MD who still gets carded.) This Vit C product may sting your eyeballs (probably reflecting that it&#x27;s unsafe for your cornea), so consider the separate eye formulation made especially for the eye area. Also, the NORMAL-TO-COMBINATION formulation is quite emollient; the formulation for DRY skin seems suited for VERY dry skin!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C! that&#x27;s what you need for clear, bright skin. this is a great moisturizer for the price. It leaves my skin a bit sticky at first, but it&#x27;s a dry sticky, if you could imagine. But then i put on primer after and its fine. It does wonders for dull skin though.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It is highly recommended by the MD I see for skincare.  PROBLEM...I have now ordered this 4 times from Amazon.  Two of the 4 ordered were not sealed with foil.  Without foil seal - the cream was a dark brown for about 1/4 of the tube - exposed to oxygen and ineffective.  The first 2 tubes were just as I have purchased at Ultra.  Having just received the 2nd unsealed product, I think Amazon has a real problem with supply.  Wasting a fourth of the product - not to mention the sanitary question - this is not a deal.</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have had nothing but compliments on my skin!  I am over 50 and my skin looks healthy and glows after using this product at night and under my make-up during the day.  The only suggestion is that you try and use small amounts on each cheek and spread it around because it can go quickly and it&#x27;s pricey....but well worth it!  I also use the Active C for eyes and my fine lines around the eyes have diminished tremendously!  Love La Roche-Posay products.  Their cleanser is also a MUST!!</li>
    <li> Active C for eyes is not the same as Active C anti wrinkle dermatological treatment.Not happy at all. Really long wait to end up with wrong product.</li>
    <li> I stopped drinking coffee and started washing in an oil wash called Nude and applying this product at least twice a day. I don&#x27;t use anything else. My skin went from  a combination mess with a lot of dryness to radiant, dewy and totally clear. I had dark spots on my cheek from a past breakout that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. They are nearly gone after one month of use. I have used everything and have never found anything I like more.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other la Roche products. Also had problems with the tube breaking and leaking product.</li>
    <li> I actually have oily skin over most of my face with the exception of the eye area and around the mouth. I use this everywhere. Gives me a wonderful glowy, even skintone and light-but-penetrating moisture without being thick, heavy or greasy, Makeup goes on beautifully over this. While I&#x27;m not really worried about wrinkles on the oily portions of my face, I also smooth this under my eyes to stave off fine lines - works great in both areas. I must say the glowy skintone is unmatched by any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old woman who has taken good care of her face and hands and never paid too much attention to my neck. All of a sudden I developed unsightly wrinkles and loose skin in this area (after losing a bit of weight). I tried everything to redress this problem and invested quite a bit of money into skin repair, hydrating and enhancing creams. Nothing worked until I purchased La Roche-Posay Active C. My neck is now smoother and the skin is tighter. The results were almost immediate (within a week I noticed a difference). I will be using this cream for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> It was an absolute waste of money. First, it irritated my skin and made it even drier. I thought it was an initial reaction and kept using it for for a full month. The same thing. My skin gets dry and no difference whatsoever...</li>
    <li> I still have not see many difference but it was a dermatologist recommendation to use daily in the morning before the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It is a preventive treatment, I guess, so I believe there is not much change to be seen. The goal is for the wrinkles to take longer to show up.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I already felt is the smoothness during application.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it has made a significant difference in my skin. It&#x27;s expensive but I keep using it nonetheless. That says a lot.</li>
    <li> As you will see from the description is clearly states Day/Night Treatment vs. the other which is what I normally purchase.  I thought I will try the day/night to see if it made a difference, however; when I received the item it was no different to the other and had NOTHING noted on the tube that it was a day/night cream.  So why the vendor posted it as such baffles me</li>
    <li> I love all the La Roche Posay products.  this one is excellent like the rest of them.  Very mosturizing, but absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin sooth! I will shop again.</li>
    <li> I can feel the different after 2 weeks, brightening my skin. Great.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this cream.  Smells wonderful and makes my skin so soft.  I put it on under my moisturizer!  Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> La Roche is hands down the best skincare company. I love this product. This product makes you look well rested when you&#x27;re sleep deprived, eating too much crap, and stressed. Too bad La Roche doesn&#x27;t make a retinol product anymore. This and their retinol [roduct is all a girl needs to look great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for many years. I have always purchased in the pharmacy. After purchasing here, I notice that there is a difference in the consistency and color of the product? Could it be a weaker formula? Could the seller be diluting this? I just don&#x27;t think it seems the same and although it&#x27;s a nice product, this specific tube hasn&#x27;t produced the same results. It doesn&#x27;t even have the same smell.</li>
    <li> Contains harmful parabens :(</li>
    <li> I was recommended this item on a beauty forum. It did absolutely nothing for my wrinkles or even dark circles. I learned from the first use that a little goes a long way. Use a little or it gets goop-y and crusty on your eyelids - yuck! It truly didn&#x27;t rub in well, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this item clogged my pores in my under-eye area. Now there are tiny bumps in that area... Yikes! I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to get rid of them. But I truly cannot recommend this. I used it over 4 months.</li>
    <li> Usually get this cream from my doctor, but found it cheaper on Amazon and ordered enough to have no shipping charges. Now I don&#x27;t even have to go to my doctor&#x27;s office to buy this. I use this great cream religiously, not only at bedtime but under makeup.  Love the consistency and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin is hard to adapt, but this product is amazing. The touch is inctedible after 3 days!</li>
    <li> Very good product, but it is for dry skin. I&#x27;m testing and found it a bit oily for my skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT...I HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS AND EVERYONE COMMENTS ON HOW GOOD MY SKIN LOOKS....VITAMIN C AND  POTENT...USE THIS EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT....VERY VERY GOOD PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> The other eye cream is better (my skin got plumper and definitely helps with lines but this is good too. It&#x27;s more for younger skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really works!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for many years and will continue to do so.  It has helped me keep my skin fresh.</li>
    <li> First found La Roche products in France 8 years ago.  Delighted they are available in US. NPerforms as advertised, have used this particular product for over a year.</li>
    <li> me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 6 years... my skin never looked better! it really works for the wrinkles... however you have to be constant!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I have been using it for a long time (always repurchase).  Can&#x27;t say how effective it really is, but I am always told I have no wrinkles and that I look so much younger than I am (which is 54).</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about a month ago (recommended by my dermatologist).  So far, I am very pleased with it and will continue using it.  I have had no side effects and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. Glad it is now available conveniently on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this does not clog my pores.  I love this brand!  The amount you receive lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have I ever come across.  It was first recommended to me by a dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years.  It clears up skin, evens skin tone, gives skin resiliency and hydration without the oily feel.  It absorbs quickly.  For first time users, you will find you will break out for the first 2-3 days, that&#x27;s because it clears from the deep layers out and will surface any clogged pores that are beneath your skin that you haven&#x27;t even noticed you have.  After that, your skin is radiant.  I use it day and night.  During the day after I apply it, I put on a sunscreen, and then my foundation make-up.  I also have my 15 yr old daughter using it now and it has really cleared up her acne.  She wears no make-up she&#x27;s all natural and this product has made a huge difference in her clarity.    Also, I had never used the company that I ordered it from, but I was pleasantly surprised to know that even though it shipped from Greece, the product was here in just a few days and actually before the delivery date promised.  And it shipped for free.  Very pleased about it.</li>
    <li> One of the best skin products I have found and I am an admitted product- jumper!</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, have used this for a long time....and travels well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now.  My first summer using it was last year.  I was told by my dermatologist to use this along with my sunscreen.  It almost doubles your protection.  I&#x27;ve battled melasma for years.  While my melasma still got darker, it wasn&#x27;t half as bad as previous years.  I&#x27;ve continued to use it throughout the year and I just can&#x27;t believe how clear my face has gotten!  Curious to see what happens this summer.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Works really well and I noticed a difference after just a week or two.  Shipping was great.  Arrived from Greece in no time!</li>
    <li> super cool product! good!</li>
    <li> been using this product for 10 years so glad I started, I look 10 years younger now! My dermatologist is amazed at the texture and look of my skin. I will be 50 soon thanks to Active c I don&#x27;t look it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it works beautifully. Don&#x27;t skip this step! It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and I my skins still looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this, and she gives it five stars. I can see the difference in her skin.</li>
    <li> Great item at a cheap price.  Perfect transaction!</li>
    <li> There is noticeable difference in my skin when I use Vitamin C especially&lt;br /&gt;in cold weather.It appears to be more clear. The wrinkles are still there&lt;br /&gt;but not as noticeable.I like the consistancey of the Vit.C cream.</li>
