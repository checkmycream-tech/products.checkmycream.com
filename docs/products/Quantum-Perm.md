    <li> I just had my new perm yesterday so am happy with it so far.  I gave it four stars since I&#x27;m not sure how it will last but was easy to give and arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> I really like this perm and I&#x27;ve used it before and will again!  Soft and distinct curls.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law says these perms last longer than those sold in retail. I will have to take her word for that!!</li>
    <li> Love these acid perms.They don&#x27;t damage my hair.A great price to.</li>
    <li> This is a great perm kit. I have been getting perms for years from my regular hair dresser who uses this kit, I have since moved away and decided to try it myself. I tried other kits and had horrible results--with this the results are perfect! My hair is very long and the curl took root to end. This perm gives a very natural look and stylish, modern results.</li>
    <li> quatum extra body acid perm has the best curly perm i have yet to use</li>
    <li> I watch a couple of you tube videos before I did my perm. Never done a perm before on myself. I ask my husband to help me with the back. Bought my second box so I can do again in 6months or so. Great product, the perm solution smell was not that strong for me. good luck!!!</li>
    <li> This perm is easy to use...doesn&#x27;t burn hair.  Hair is permed very professional looking.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the acid perm.  It worked well, but really smelled up the house.  However, it did not sting my scalp, like many perms do.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> my hair looks pretty when I used this perm solution, but the perm didn&#x27;t last long!!!</li>
    <li> Have always loved the Quantum perms&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> lotion not strong enough and does not hold too well on my hair. It is Ok for that price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good buy.</li>
    <li> prompt good product  thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used perms for years, and was looking for one that had minimal odor.  This one had been reviewed as having no noticable odor, however, it has plenty of odor and is no different from others. It does the job, stays in and doesn&#x27;t loosen with the use of heated appliances or stretching of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it again.</li>
    <li> Quantum is a wonderful perm says the 93 year old lady who is thrilled to have curls again! It arrived quickly and the product provides a  quality perm.  So glad it is accessible on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been giving my mother home perm for almost 30 years on and off.   I used to use Ogilvie, and I was somewhat content as that was the only brand I could buy from drug stores.   I decided to use Amazon to change the perm lotion because my mother hair was too dry.     I was hesitant about getting this product as reviewers indicated that this is for professional use.  After carefully following instructions, my mother was very pleased with the result.    In the past, after perm, her hair dye color ran, but with this, very little bit of dye color ran.   She was also happier because the hair was not as dry as before.      Only thing I was not aware was that I had to buy paper to roll hair. Luckly, my mother had some papers I could cut and use.      I will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> These have  worked  dependably for me for years.  I like to use a wrapping solution that protects your hair along with it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a perm that did not have the odor of the usual ones. Not so.</li>
    <li> Great perm but really stinky. I have used this product for over 10 years. Athough, I wish that it was unscented, it does the job. The smell lasts for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this perm, been using it for years, the wave lasts for over 3 months at least. I used to be able to buy it in a local beauty store, but the state passed a law. Thank goodness I can still get it online. I&#x27;m old now and figured maybe it was time, so weakened and got a shop/salon perm last November at my daughter&#x27;s hairdresser, cost me $50, the curl lasted about 6 weeks. So back to doing my own.</li>
    <li> We purchased two of these because we couldn&#x27;t get it locally.&lt;br /&gt;We plan to definitely purchase this again as it is holding so well.&lt;br /&gt;There was very little odor as we have seen with other brands.</li>
    <li> this was all bent up and I was expecting it sooner</li>
    <li> always great as usual.</li>
    <li> Great  perm!!!! Leaves hair so soft &amp; the last one I used lasted for over 9 months through many trims :-)</li>
    <li> This is the longest lasting, most gentle perm that we&#x27;ve tried. It appears to be pretty easy on the scalp as well. Best around!</li>
    <li> Great attention was used in the packaging of this product.  I was a bit concerned with uknown weather conditions but everything was sent and recieved as described. It was appreciated. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the smell dissipates as soon as your hair dries and you wash your towels.  I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.  I used to get it at my local beauty supply, but now that I&#x27;ve moved to a rural area, I don&#x27;t have that option.  I am glad to be able to buy it on Amazon.  I have very fine blond hair and this gives me enough body that my do lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Best perm I have ever had - did exactly as instructions said and it worked great.  If you have stubborn hair and want a good curl that, so far, lasts a long time, try it - great price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give a review because my perm solution was busted in the box. All I could do was toss it .</li>
    <li> With partial grey hair it is hard to find a perm that works on both types of hair.  This one does.</li>
    <li> usually this is a good perm in my case I received a perm that was old and it did not activate I am disappointed</li>
    <li> The perfect perm for Mom</li>
    <li> great product never over process your hair again</li>
    <li> These are great extra-body perms.</li>
    <li> A friend and I give each other the perm and both are very happy with this Quanatum Extra Body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perm.  Will continue using this perm.</li>
