      <li>It does wash out very easy.</li>
      <li>and it is very easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love leopard print?</li>
      <li>Let me start with the pros of this item: The packaging is hella cute.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Like a cobweb and you have to make sure it doesnt drip on you.</li>
      <li>a couple decades have passed :)</li>
      <li>Very impressed  Will definitely be reordering</li>
      <li>The packaging for this mascara is adorable.....</li>
      <li>and I love this because it&#x27;s glossy and</li>
      <li>In addition, it also gave me &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes, top and bottom.</li>
      <li>The leopard print container is super cute too!</li>
      <li>it was great as pwe usual thanks for the great service!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>When you remove it, it comes off right away with water, but the wand could be better.</li>
      <li>undamaged, and was so excited to use it almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I loved it made my eyelashes look bigger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time trying to find the right one, and this one by far is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
      <li>This has gotta be one of my favorite mascaras by far.</li>
      <li>This mascara wasn&#x27;t all that, but it&#x27;s worth for a waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>and it will slide right off</li>
      <li>good for when you want to remove it, but not good if you go swimming or out in the rain :)</li>
      <li>Super cute on the outside.</li>
      <li>Secondly, I&#x27;m a sucker for beautiful packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order more in the future!</li>
      <li>So, first of all, I&#x27;m a mascara hoarder and still searching for the Holy Grail of mascaras.</li>
      <li>, this mascara will stay on all pretty much all day till you go to bed with no touch up needed</li>
      <li>so I have to waft at my lashes to make sure its dry before i curl them.</li>
      <li>The mascara is very stringy.</li>
      <li>That was one reason i really didn&#x27;t like it because they make my lashes fall out.</li>
      <li>Other than this it was okay</li>
      <li>It is very wet and at first you most likely will apply and it will get on your eyelids or around your eyes, however the trick is to just let it dry and it will then come off easily with no</li>
      <li>If you want a very subtle cheap mascara with an adorable tube, this is for you.</li>
      <li>Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t smudge and adds length and volume!</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concern</li>
      <li>I actually am able to remove with my fingers in the shower due to once your eyes are wet</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for dramatic length and/or volume, I&#x27;d suggest spending a bit more.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, I had also purchased the same brand liquid black eyeliner with the leopard print, and it was a fantastic liquid liner.</li>
      <li>The only &amp;#34;up-side&amp;#34; was that there was no strange odor.</li>

<li> I know that sounds weird, but it seems like it has a small string of mascara floating around every time you pull the wand out.</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t know what this product is made of and it smells weird.</li>
<li> It flaked terrible, and I curled my lashes before applying it and this mascara actually straighten my lashes!  </li>

<li> I was completely disappointed.</li>
<li> This mascara was terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved it made my eyelashes look bigger. This is the only mascara i buy and will only buy.</li>
    <li> The mascara is very stringy.The máscara stretches. Like a cobweb and you have to make sure it doesnt drip on you. It does cover your eyelashes good but I wouldnt order it again.</li>
    <li> This mascara was terrible.  As far as I&#x27;m concern the lady with the huge lashes that is shown to advertise for the product is definitely false advertising .  It flaked terrible, and I curled my lashes before applying it and this mascara actually straighten my lashes!  It did not wear well at all.  Will never purchase again and would definitely NOT recommend.  Would also like to know why there is never a purchase receipt or address given with the product sent, so the product could be sent back for refund?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Not at all happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have thick lashes and I love this because it&#x27;s glossy and while I wouldn&#x27;t say it gives volume, it makes the length stand out as the tips of my lashes are lighter.  No flaking either!  will definately purchase again.  The leopard print container is super cute too!</li>
    <li> I am not resive my product. .??????</li>
    <li> Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t smudge and adds length and volume! Will definitely purchase another soon when my current Tube runs out!</li>
    <li> This mascara wasn&#x27;t all that, but it&#x27;s worth for a waterproof mascara. When you remove it, it comes off right away with water, but the wand could be better. The tube design is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Super cute on the outside. Mine says MAC on it but it dosent say so in the pictures. The actual product gives length but no volume. Its kind of watery so I have to waft at my lashes to make sure its dry before i curl them.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascara&#x27;s I have every purchased since a teenager ..........a couple decades have passed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly lengthens your lashes and makes them pop as if you had eyelash extensions done, however you do need to get adjusted to applying it.  It is very wet and at first you most likely will apply and it will get on your eyelids or around your eyes, however the trick is to just let it dry and it will then come off easily with no smudging!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this mascara will stay on all pretty much all day till you go to bed with no touch up needed and it is very easy to remove.  I actually am able to remove with my fingers in the shower due to once your eyes are wet it loosens up the fibers and it will slide right off your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So FYI  good for when you want to remove it, but not good if you go swimming or out in the rain :)</li>
    <li> it was great as pwe usual thanks for the great service!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something to add length to my lashes but not finding that.  It does wash out very easy.</li>
    <li> This mascra weeks perfectly! I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time trying to find the right one, and this one by far is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, and it&#x27;s amazing. The only thing about it is that it&#x27;s a little watery on the tip. Besides that one little problem, I&#x27;ve had no problems with this mascra. I&#x27;m going to order more in the future! (:</li>
    <li> For one it does not say that this is a waterproof mascara and it is. That was one reason i really didn&#x27;t like it because they make my lashes fall out. Other than this it was okay but I WOULDN&#x27;T buy it again.</li>
    <li> So, first of all, I&#x27;m a mascara hoarder and still searching for the Holy Grail of mascaras. Secondly, I&#x27;m a sucker for beautiful packaging. The packaging for this mascara is adorable.....leopard print! Who doesn&#x27;t love leopard print? Anyways, I received the product within 2-3 weeks. undamaged, and was so excited to use it almost immediately. So, I washed my face and proceeded to apply this mascara. I was completely disappointed. It was the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue and &amp;#34;refused&amp;#34; to apply evenly. It was clumpy with a wet formula. It did not give length, volume, or curl. When I pulled the wand from the container, it literally was &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. The only &amp;#34;up-side&amp;#34; was that there was no strange odor. In addition, it also gave me &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes, top and bottom. The product itself was less than $3, so I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back to the vendor. On the other hand, I had also purchased the same brand liquid black eyeliner with the leopard print, and it was a fantastic liquid liner. Would I purchase from this vendor again? Yes, I would. But I won&#x27;t be purchasing the mascara. Thank you for allowing me to input constructive criticism!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth it and no, it didn&#x27;t curl plus you neglected to tell me this was waterproof formula which is hard on lashes!</li>
    <li> This mascara does take getting use to it is a bit watery. I let mine dry between coats and it adds incredible length. Second of all I usually have problems with raccoon eyes. I had severe allergies one day. My eyes watered all day with out even a smudge. Very impressed  Will definitely be reordering</li>
    <li> This has gotta be one of my favorite mascaras by far. Beats Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber mascara</li>
    <li> Let me start with the pros of this item: The packaging is hella cute. It&#x27;s cheap. It does make your lashes a bit longer and blacker (you can tell you&#x27;re wearing some kind of mascara). Now for the cons: It&#x27;s stringy. I know that sounds weird, but it seems like it has a small string of mascara floating around every time you pull the wand out. I&#x27;m assuming that the reason behind this is the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34;, but its super weird and annoying. Also this comes off in weird little gooey worms when you take it off - it almost looks like wet eraser shavings. I also don&#x27;t know what this product is made of and it smells weird. If you want a very subtle cheap mascara with an adorable tube, this is for you. If you&#x27;re looking for dramatic length and/or volume, I&#x27;d suggest spending a bit more.</li>
    <li> I love this. It has a very strong smell, kind of like a permanent marker. But the product works well</li>
    <li> It is very thin and stringy</li>
