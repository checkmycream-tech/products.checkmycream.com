      <li>ladies absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>projects very well and great longevity.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>A unique smell, a unique personality, simply the best cologne I ever have, I recommend with no eyes this seller and products</li>

      <li>Smells fantastic on a man or woman, in my opinion.</li>

      <li>for the fast shipping and cheap price on this cologne; my husband love it.</li>
      <li>it is light and fresh with citrus overtones...</li>
      <li>It is a bit strong at first.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>it is very clean smelling an not as strong as a lot of the other men&#x27;s colognes I&#x27;ve smelled.  </li>
      <li>fully recommend buying through this company, very responsible ..</li>
      <li>However, it has such a compelling fresh and clean scent that I do find myself wearing it - in the right situations.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>i always loved this cologne for men, and i finally decided to buy it for my boyfriend finally, i recommend it to all men!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what the scent I was sent smells like, it smells incredibly watered down and does not last an hour which is a good thing because it mells like the bottom of a large old tree after it rains and has a poor note of spice and citrus.</li>
      <li>very nice soapy scent, day wear, spring and summer , Japanese yuzu lemon is sharp,  </li>
      <li>Every time i wear it I get at least one compliment or comment on how good I smell.</li>
      <li>Lets just say my swag is back in full action because of this.</li>
      <li>I recently bought this L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey for men and like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Apparently this is &#x27;the&#x27; cologne to have.  </li>
      <li>It sucks tremendously</li>

<li> /&gt;Only wish UPS hadn&#x27;t left the package on my doorstep, in the ninety degree weather (farehnheit; about 33C), for half the day.  </li>

<li> A similar aquatic is Nautica Voyage which lasts and lasts, but not as complex.</li>

<li> I admit I was anxious to smell it</li>
<li> and I am disappointed in Amazon for selling me a knockoff being that it&#x27;s the same reason I avoid private sellers</li>
<li> I think it is a subtle cologne, but gets the job done.  </li>
<li> I bought this Cologne after hearing some recommendations from a friend that works at sephora but being that it was a but expensive for a small bottle, I decided to check Amazon prices..bad idea.</li>
<li> but this is one smell I can&#x27;t seem to get tired of.  </li>
<li> you&#x27;re skeptical</li>

    <li> My husband loves it - he hasn&#x27;t had it for quite some time - He was very happy to get it again.  Pleasant smell - would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love this, I will definitely purchase this one again for my man. He smells wonderful and I think this may be the best scent he owns.</li>
    <li> Recieved my order quickly,and the Cologne Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> A lot of men&#x27;s colognes like this get close to smelling feminine.  This one actually steps on the line.  However, it has such a compelling fresh and clean scent that I do find myself wearing it - in the right situations.  Wonderful sillage and longevity.  I am drawn to this EDT -- I just wish it were slightly less feminie.  Best for summertime outdoor use.</li>
    <li> I know my cologne and let me tell you this is not it. I am stuck with something I can&#x27;t even use and money gone to waste.</li>
    <li> Great product, ladies love the smell of it. I am attracting girls with it like there is no tomorrow :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have always used this since I stumbled on it in 1990. Will not try another because this is the best above the rest</li>
    <li> great stuff came on time real product fast and reliable great company they will take care great price and service</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! It&#x27;s very sweet smelling, but not overpowering. Smells fantastic on a man or woman, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Men in my family love it!!!</li>
    <li> Nice. it was what I wanted</li>
    <li> excellent service, would recommend</li>
    <li> My wife actually suggested that I buy this cologne some time ago.  I was initially hesitant to give this cologne a try, but after I had a chance to smell it, I was sold.  I think it is a subtle cologne, but gets the job done.  Oh by the way the wife loves it!  Happy wife...happy life.</li>
    <li> i always loved this cologne for men, and i finally decided to buy it for my boyfriend finally, i recommend it to all men!!</li>
    <li> Apparently this is &#x27;the&#x27; cologne to have.  I admit I was anxious to smell it thinking maybe I&#x27;d try the women&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it arrives and my son (32) is really delighted with it.  Personally I thought it smelled rather like soap, but maybe that&#x27;s the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is very clean smelling an not as strong as a lot of the other men&#x27;s colognes I&#x27;ve smelled.  And it would seem this scent would be good for men of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re skeptical try a sample of it before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
    <li> es la fragancia que me encanta sentir en mi esposo, aqui en venezuela adquirir un perfume es muy caro por esta razon la traigo del extranjero</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie ive always heard about issey miyake and never gave it a try. Recently broke up with the lady and needed something to boost my confidence. Ordered this and bleue..omg... ladies absolutely love this. Compliments after compliments.. Lets just say my swag is back in full action because of this. Must get if your lookin for a cologne that gets you noticed.</li>
    <li> I have tried many fragrances because I keep getting bored if I use the same for a couple of months.  but this is one smell I can&#x27;t seem to get tired of.  it is spicy and fresh and incredible</li>
    <li> I love the smell... It&#x27;s cool and fresh and kind of sweet. I&#x27;m feeling very comfortable with this scent and intend to use it for a long time</li>

    <li> This cologne is great and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> bought a while ago, batch number checked and its authentic. very nice soapy scent, day wear, spring and summer , Japanese yuzu lemon is sharp,  stays all the way from the beginning. projects very well and great longevity. price is average considering others sites.</li>
    <li> i first bought this perfume in the women&#x27;s version for my girlfriend at the time.  She smelled amazing whenever she used it.  I recently bought this L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey for men and like it very much.  Strong floral/citrus opening.  Lasts about 6 hours on my skin.  A similar aquatic is Nautica Voyage which lasts and lasts, but not as complex.</li>
    <li> I would use this company anytime. Good customer service and my product arrived on time. My product quality was great, I was pleased.</li>
    <li> A unique smell, a unique personality, simply the best cologne I ever have, I recommend with no eyes this seller and products they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Venezuela</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite scent I own. Every time i wear it I get at least one compliment or comment on how good I smell. Amazons price is great as well. The scent lasts until you shower also. Great cologne!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance..it is light and fresh with citrus overtones...I live in Florida and it is the perfect scent for warm climates</li>
    <li> Favorite scent!  It&#x27;s incredibly unique, so I&#x27;ll leave my bias out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish UPS hadn&#x27;t left the package on my doorstep, in the ninety degree weather (farehnheit; about 33C), for half the day.  I was terrified this would pickle in the heat.  Fortunately, that was not the case!</li>
    <li> This is a good smell. It smells kind of like soap and flowers. It is a clean, fresh scent. It is a bit strong at first. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in it as I have known some of my buddies to do with cologne etc.. All in all it is a good scent that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> very good product, and the estimated transfer passed off without inconvenience. fully recommend buying through this company, very responsible ..</li>
    <li> Thanks! for the fast shipping and cheap price on this cologne; my husband love it.</li>
