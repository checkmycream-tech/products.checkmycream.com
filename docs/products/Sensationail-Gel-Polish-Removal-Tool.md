    <li> This works great! Very easy to remove polish, once you use a little nail polish remover with it.</li>

    <li> Product was described. Works and a great addition to my manicure kit.</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT MAKES REMOVING YOUR GEL POLISH THIS IS IT! I ALSO LIKE TO USE THIS TOOL TO PUSH BACK MY CUTICLES BEFORE MY GEL MANICURES. MAKE SURE YOU SOAK YOUR NAILS BEFORE USE SO IT COMES OF EASIER!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says, making the polish scrape off just a bit easier.</li>
    <li> Great for cuticles and taking off polish</li>
    <li> This tool is very sturdy and sharp.  It does scrape off the gel polish, but note that it will also strip off some of your fingernail so be very careful about using it.  The quality is much higher than I was expecting for the price.</li>
    <li> I will too admit I bought it at Rite Aid because I actually saw it there first and took a pic To look into, then after looking online I went out of my way to go get it. But... I like it a lot and would pay $10 to deliver it to my house. I have used several tools to remove gel polish and nothing worked as well and I would finish by using my trusty fingernail. I think it did a good job. Right now I am trying the gel shields. I get soooo tired of removing the polish. Will leave a review for that when I take it off.</li>
    <li> works great just do not scrap to hard and get your nail.  this tool is wonderful for getting the polish off when you have soaked your nails</li>
    <li> I am really surprised at how well this works.  I was a complete skeptic and was just using my cuticle pusher, that has a similar shape, to remove the polish but it left occasional &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; in my nail.  There is something about the overall shape (and angle of the head) of this tool that makes it very easy to remove the polish and I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> A good tool....got all the polish off.</li>
    <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
    <li> Before finding this product I would sit for hours trying to get my gel based polish off. With this tool I now can soak my nails then gently removed the polish. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a real help in removing the gel polish, you have to soak in the polish remover and then use this tool.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool. I do soak my nails in acetone before using, but for only about 5 minutes. I cant sit still that long. This products removes every bit of polish on nail without peeling off the top layer of the nail. My nails are healthy and never damaged after removal. Some buffing is required to smooth out the nail again/remove primer(not polish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must have tool if  you use gel polishes</li>
    <li> Very easy to hold and use the double ended tool! Such a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This tool is invaluable...it makes it soooo much easier to do my nails..and I can put my feet in the machine too!</li>
    <li> If you wear gel nail polish, here is a tool you must have.  It simplifies removing old gel nail polish, turns it into a breeze.</li>
    <li> Work great, I love it.</li>
    <li> works well after soaking nails, to remove the gel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it that much, but my daughter uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> not working for me.. hardly get any off</li>
    <li> I love this tool, it makes it really easy to gently scrape off gel poish while soaking in acetone. The tool is sharp, i would not recommend using this to attempt to remove gel polish without soaking it, because it can really damage your nail bed.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool for removal of the my Shellac gel polish.  Perfectly angled to easily remove the polish after soaking in remover.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; is of professional grade quality.  I would certainly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, removes gel easily and without damaging the natural nail. It&#x27;s a must for the gel fans out there. Bought at CVS for $5.99.</li>
    <li> This tool works great to remove off the flaking polish.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be a troll, but I bought this for $11 when Walmart has it for $5. Other than that, great tool :)</li>
    <li> Good product, good transaction.</li>
    <li> It works as described, however, giving it 4 stars as after ordering I saw it at Walmart for almost $5.</li>
    <li> very simple tool to help scrape off the polish. It works fine. I see no distinction between this and other removal tools, so I suggest buy according to price alone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO happy that I bought this.  It decreases my time removing my gel nail polish.  I&#x27;ve never seen it at Wal-mart, target or sally beauty supply.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nail when I&#x27;m taking off the gel polish and it makes the process very easy.  This is a great buy. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I saw this exact tool at CVS for $5...there were other products in this line as well. Save yourself $7 by going to your local CVS, if you have one close by. I also ordered some foil wraps (not seen at CVS) and soaked with Cutex for 5 mins and it was easy to scrape off the gel polish using this tool. I probably should have soaked longer because I think I scraped off nail enamel in the process, so next time I will be more patient.</li>
    <li> I like having a tool that works for the task it was designed. A lot of the time Tools designed for special tasks do not meet the needs of the user and are a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Just magic.  Not sure why this thing works so well, it just does.  Remember how easy it is to have top layers of your nail to peel when gel finish is beginning to separate?  Prevent that with this tool.  Soak nails in regular remover, then using this tool, the gel peels off like it is a thin layer of cellophane.  Some reviews said this is available at local stores that sell nail supplies, but I never found it.  Well worth paying a bit extra to protect your nails.  I haven&#x27;t found that it causes any nail damage, just the opposite, it prevents damage.  If you do your own nails, buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  Through the years, I have relied on reviews to make smart purchases and now I&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;pay it forward\\&quot; by helping others with my reviews. [...]  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool it takes my gel manicures off with ease, cuts removal time in half. By the way IT ONLY COSTS $5 at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Walgreens after seeing this review. Great buy. I buffed the shine off the nails, put pure acitone on cotton, put the cotton on my fingers, wrapped my fingers in foil, put my hands under a heating pad, waited about 10 minutes, scraped off the gel with this tool, buffed my nails with a file, pushed back my cuticles, put on some lotion and put some cuticle oil on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers are ready to go for the next set. I&#x27;m going to give them a day&#x27;s rest. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s necessary but I&#x27;ll do it anyway. Total time it took to remove: 25 ish minutes.</li>
    <li> This tool is too dull as a gel remover.  It gets duller the longer you use it but it is dull fresh out of the box and there is no way I know of to sharpen it.</li>
    <li> I love this tool and I love Sensational gel polish system. After some trial and error, I&#x27;ve mastered getting the polish off without ruining/thinning/scratching up my nails. Here&#x27;s how to do it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  With a coarse file, file the shiny topcoat off your nails until they look cloudy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover  and OPI Expert Touch Removal Wraps (or cotton balls and foil). Saturate the cotton with the lacquer remover, place on nail, and wrap with foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. **Now this is the trick!**. Place your wrapped fingers under a heating pad set to medium or low.  Leave under heating pad for 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Remove foil wraps and use your handy Sensationail remover tool to LIGHTLY push off the nail polish. It should be basically fall off your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. If any remains, do NOT forcefully scrape it off. Just put the same foil wraps on whichever fingers have some leftovers (you could re-wet the cotton with remover if you like), place your hands back under the heating pad for another 5 or 10 minutes. The rest of the polish should come right off. I&#x27;ve never had to follow up with a third cycle.</li>
    <li> love this for helping to remove shellac polish without as much damage and is also good for pushing back cuticles!</li>
    <li> Helps the polish slide right off. The nice thing about removing at home is that you can soak as long as you want. This tool helps!</li>
    <li> Works great for removing the polish.</li>
    <li> The one thing I hate is trying to get gel nailpolish off. This little tool did a great job without damaging the natural nail. Really glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I might not be using this correctly becasue when I try using it the top few layers of my nail come off.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using an orange stick when soaking off gel polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I found this. I have trouble removing my gel nails sometimes, even with the soak off. This works very well with the soak off and it doesn&#x27;t damage your nails. I&#x27;ve accidently damaged my nails trying to use other tools to get them off. This is a great find, and it also works extremely well for pushing cuticles up. Love it!</li>
    <li> This tool is good, heavy duty and will last forever. If you need a tool to remove Shellac, this is one to consider for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSA: with all gel polishes, it is important to file off the top layer of color and soak your nails in acetone for at least 5 minutes (or wrap them with foil and an acetone soaked cotton ball) before using this tool. DO NOT have a go at your cured gel without pre-treating them for removal - you will damage your nails.</li>
    <li> Tool works great, but way overpriced here. I purchased at Rite Aid for $4.99, well worth that price! Why overpay?</li>
    <li> this remover is SO awesome!! I have used gel polishes for two years now and always used the orangewood sticks.  Once I discovered this tool and began using it, I will never use an orangewood stick again!!</li>
