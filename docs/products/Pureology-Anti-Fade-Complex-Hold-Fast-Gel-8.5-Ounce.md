### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It is the best to keep hair in place for any length of time.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky at all - the product is just perfect for the job.</li>
      <li>The best gel I have ever used in 30 years.  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair gel I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This was a great product buy buyer beware</li>
      <li>good, would  purchase again</li>
      <li>I love this gel!</li>
      <li>Have always liked this product&lt;</li>
      <li>Waiting for your courteous reply...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t count how many products I&#x27;ve tried to hold my spiky style, but none of them work anywhere close to this one.  </li>
      <li>so I am glad to have found it at amazon.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it would have sold better if they hadn&#x27;t marketed it as &amp;#34;Anti-Fade&amp;#34; because it was a great gel and most people who use it don&#x27;t seem to care about the color as much as the hold.</li>
      <li>and I never found anything better in a gel product.</li>
      <li>It allows me to do many differant styles always leaving my hair in place.</li>
      <li>I love this product............have baby-fine hair...gives me body.  </li>
      <li>Also leaves my hair in healthy shape.</li>
      <li>This holds my fine hair in place without looking clumpy or sticky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is fine.  </li>
      <li>, get this GREAT product back on the market!</li>
      <li>Having fine hair, I can honestly say that it holds my hair and gives it more volume than any other product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>My second and third day hair is the best.  </li>
      <li>They are pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that I have tried that was able to do that.</li>
      <li>The seller was &amp;#34;Speed-Box&amp;#34; and I think they watered the gel down because it did not have the consistency and hold as the original product that I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
      <li>A quick brush or rub with your hands will soften it completely, still leaving the style.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
      <li>I have wavy, frizzy hair and this product really smooths it out.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found it at amazon and ordered multiple jars!</li>
      <li>I know someday I&#x27;m going to have to find another product, but I will put it off until I buy the last bottle available.</li>
      <li>Buy as much as you can before they disappear.  </li>
      <li>have tried many other products after this was discontinued and haven&#x27;t found anything that works.  </li>
      <li>Bought because product is no longer available and wanted on hand as long as I could.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
      <li>a long way - well worth the price</li>
      <li>Only gel I have ever found that holds my curls and gives me the look I want throughout the whole day.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking so far.</li>
      <li>Check Ulta to do your research before you buy a 5 year old product...</li>
      <li>OR, tell us what new product does the same wondrous job.</li>

<li> And don&#x27;t leave me (and hundreds of others) high and dry!!!!</li>
<li> If you have fine, thin hair and want body that won&#x27;t go flat, this is what you have been looking for all these years.  </li>
<li> I do wash just my bangs on day three and add a tiny bit of this to my wet bangs and blow dry them.</li>
<li> Working with the public with dark hair that is important.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> It dries stiff and will stay that way if left alone.  </li>
<li> Just a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> When I get out of the shower, I use Redkin&#x27;s Grip Tight, comb it through my hair, then add a pea size of this, comb through and then blow dry.  </li>
<li> I have tried others due to fact nobody carries this in my area.</li>
<li> I use other anti-fade products by pureology.  </li>

    <li> This was a great product buy buyer beware this is ancient packaging. Check Ulta to do your research before you buy a 5 year old product... Scary to see those are still out there for sale</li>
    <li> I have short hair and have used this product for over 10 years.  It firmly holds your hair in place and does not flake.  I was very disappointed that it is no longer available in beauty supply stores.  Fortunately, I found it at amazon and ordered multiple jars!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Having fine hair, I can honestly say that it holds my hair and gives it more volume than any other product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel I have ever used.  it is so hard to find. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this product............have baby-fine hair...gives me body.  Bought because product is no longer available and wanted on hand as long as I could.  Don&#x27;t know why they stopped making it...............</li>
    <li> This is the only gel I used in the last 6 years. I have tried others due to fact nobody carries this in my area. This will hold ALL DAY and has NEVER FLAKED for me. This is the only product that I have tried that was able to do that. Working with the public with dark hair that is important.&lt;br /&gt;I am male</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 14 yrs. Started out discovering it in a salon who used it and I never found anything better in a gel product. It allows me to do many differant styles always leaving my hair in place. If I use it on dry or damp hair, it still cooperates! Also leaves my hair in healthy shape. Highly recommend it for all types of hair. Mine is colored so I need the finest ingrediants and this product holds up to what it claims.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find in the grocery store, and is expensive at the salon. Amazon price is comparable, and they always have it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  My hair is fine.  I don&#x27;t think I could do without it.</li>
    <li> I knew what I was getting, as I have used it before. Hold your hair were you want it to be. My hubby uses this product and likes it.</li>
    <li> If you have fine, thin hair and want body that won&#x27;t go flat, this is what you have been looking for all these years.  Just a pea size will do.  Don&#x27;t use too much.  When I get out of the shower, I use Redkin&#x27;s Grip Tight, comb it through my hair, then add a pea size of this, comb through and then blow dry.  My second and third day hair is the best.  I do wash just my bangs on day three and add a tiny bit of this to my wet bangs and blow dry them.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! I have been using it for years. Only gel I have ever found that holds my curls and gives me the look I want throughout the whole day. I am so sad it will be unavailable soon. Maybe it would have sold better if they hadn&#x27;t marketed it as &amp;#34;Anti-Fade&amp;#34; because it was a great gel and most people who use it don&#x27;t seem to care about the color as much as the hold. Shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone else found a comparable product, or one that they like as well?</li>
    <li> The best gel I have ever used in 30 years.  I wish it would come back.  The current pureology replacement is not even in the same league.  This holds my fine hair in place without looking clumpy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other products after this was discontinued and haven&#x27;t found anything that works.  Please contact me if you find a replacement for this product.</li>
    <li> Please Pureology (or someone!), get this GREAT product back on the market! OR, tell us what new product does the same wondrous job. Or tell us another product by someone else to go to. DON&#x27;T ABANDON YOUR DEVOTED HOLDFAST CULT!!! And don&#x27;t leave me (and hundreds of others) high and dry!!!! Waiting for your courteous reply...</li>
    <li> Works for but VERY EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> Holds style &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
    <li> I have wavy, frizzy hair and this product really smooths it out.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some gels. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking so far. I use other anti-fade products by pureology.  They are pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 years and will be sorry when I can&#x27;t find it anymore.

It isn&#x27;t sticky at all - the product is just perfect for the job.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer made by pureology so I am glad to have found it at amazon.  It holds your hair and doesn&#x27;t let it down even in humid weather.  I know someday I&#x27;m going to have to find another product, but I will put it off until I buy the last bottle available.</li>
    <li> I wish they still made it, it works so well.  Buy as much as you can before they disappear.  sad</li>
    <li> good, would  purchase again</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed after spending $65 which is double the original retail price! I was desperate to buy pureology holdfaat gel because it has been discontinued and is the only product that works on my hair.

    <li> just a little goes a long way - well worth the price - my hair is stubborn and this tames it</li>
    <li> Have always liked this product&lt;br /&gt;It is the best to keep hair in place for any length of time. Thank you</li>
