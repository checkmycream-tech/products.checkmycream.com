<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It turn I nice pink but it was the same pink on each person who tried it</li>
    <li> Works well, but gives my lips a very pink color that doesn&#x27;t suit me very well. But it makes my lips very soft.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail, and I have to say I love it! It made my lips smooth and a bit glossy which is great! The color turned out to be a warm pink that resembles mac&#x27;s plumful color. I don&#x27;t know if that color would turn out on everyone since it is a &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lipstick. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the lipstick, expecially when you consider how cheap it is!</li>
    <li> Mom loves this brand!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is great.  I have been wearing this for years. Did I say years, yep I did!!!!  If you line your lips put the mood lipstick on (green is what I use) and if you want darker or frosty just ad that on top..  I know that it is using another lipstick but you will always have color on your lips even after you eat. I never go anywhere without it and I am always handing some to someone that likes it.  More and more companies are coming out with a stain but right now this is number one with staying power for a color.  Try it and enjoy.</li>
    <li> I gave these out as a small Christmas gifts to the women in my family, we all thought they were fun. It&#x27;s definitely a novelty item.</li>
    <li> Mom loves and price was great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lipstick so much, but it&#x27;s very soothing for chapped lips, and gives a nice color.</li>
    <li> So cute! ChapStick consistency with a stained look to it. I&#x27;ve been giving them away as gifts and just keeping a couple for myself. Everyone has loved them! Great price.</li>
    <li> Turns into a sort of magenta pink. If you&#x27;re light handed with application, it can be worn as a light sheer stain but can easily be made too bright (at least for winter).</li>
    <li> I love these.  I don&#x27;t like the fake color of lipstick and this just deepens the natural color</li>
    <li> This was what it was for the price. It&#x27;s good on your lips if they&#x27;re chapped but the color it changes to is a pink and works for me but not for all complexions.</li>
    <li> I first found this lipstick while traveling in 2001 at a gas station. I was so happy to find it again on Amazon. I have ordered this mood lipstick 3 times so far. I wear it everyday. It is not as moisturizing as I would like so I wear it over Chapstick but I love the color  my &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; turns it. One of my sisters loves it as well. The other sister says it&#x27;s too pink for her but she wears it anyway. I guess because  she gets it for free.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Very cool, color is very nice matches your ph, makes lips soft</li>
    <li> I know green lipstick looks scary but this stuff is amazing! It shows up as a natural to brightish pink and looks different on everyone. I&#x27;ve given one to all my friends cause it brings out the perfect lip color in anyone. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but not sticky and does not move on your lips.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t trust the color because it adjusts to your ph. But it is super moisturizing and I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this particular set but a few different ones from different companies and they are the best. They stay on forever even after eating and stuff. It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out. In fact,  I forget I&#x27;m wearing it. I get compliments on the color. I really wish they had this in different colors other than pink. I&#x27;d never buy any other type of lipstick!</li>
    <li> I like the aloe vera ingredient; leaves my lips soft. The color is lighter than expected, but still gives a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with your product.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because a BUNCH of them were broken when I recieved this package.. Sad day. The ones that weren&#x27;t broken still worked pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this brand and I am very happy. The texture is very moist and soft and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Really cool to see how it looks different on everyone</li>
    <li> great product, lasts almost like a stain after the first ten minutes. wish it came in different colors I would buy more. cheap and you get so many for the price. moisturizing too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and was please to find it again --after several years of looking.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks arrived very quickly. Maybe within about a week or two. They go on very smoothly, and turn into a nice toy pink when applied. Stays moist and colored for hours before I have to reapply it. I&#x27;m throughly pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lipstick.  I have been using it for years now and have given it to friends to try and now they are hooked.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick because it goes on easily, does not smear and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This lipstick has a great color and lasts 3-4 hours.  Usually two applications and it will last most of the day.  Gave these out as gifts and everyone has loved the lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. I like the way it looks on my lips and i will keep buying this product</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It moisturizes and the color is different on everyone. It adapts to your lips according to your color I guess. It&#x27;s still a mystery how it works. The ONLY downside is it tastes funny. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Been using this for years and it always works great.</li>
    <li> These have a similar effect to balm stain type lip colors. They go on seemingly moisturizing and slightly glossy, and though the glossy effect goes away within an hour or two your lips stay bright pink for a very long time (it does seem to be fairly drying, so I recommend also applying a balm throughout the day.) I might put on some of this at 4 PM to go out with friends, go out, have drinks and food, come home, fall asleep, and wake up the next day at noon and still have substantial color. The color is a flattering and sheer berry pink; I usually like red or purple lipsticks, but this color is very nice and bright without looking tacky or childish. I&#x27;m planning on keeping a couple sticks as my own backups (they do seem to go fast) and otherwise will be giving the rest away as gifts to friends. The ingredient list is also surprisingly not bad; nothing on it sent up any particular red flags in terms of toxicity or allergens. Of course, you can make your own decisions about that.</li>
    <li> I give it s five star</li>
    <li> great for birthday goodie bags for middle school girls</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lipstick. the color is the same on everyone and it&#x27;s a very bright pink, like a fuchsia. so if that color looks good on you, you will like this. :)</li>
    <li> Very fun for gifts. It turns a different color on everyone. I&#x27;ve given them out to all my female relatives and friends. I just wished it was a little more mosturizing. It&#x27;s a great stain that lasts forever. Very flattering color on anyone.</li>
    <li> The product does turn pink, but unfortunately it&#x27;s all the same shade. It a bright shade that almost anyone could pull off though</li>
    <li> When I bought this item I read all the reviews for this product, and it seemed nice so I bought it. But when I tried on the lipstick it turned my lips a bright pink. I thought maybe it was my mood or that my pH balance was too high so I tried it again a few days later and it was still a bright pink. I then thought maybe it was just me so I had both my older and younger sisters try it. The same result. I then had my stepdad try it, and sure enough, his lips were a neon pink too. Plus, it took a lot to take it off. It was cheep but save your money.</li>
    <li> changes to a beautiful shade.</li>
    <li> Nice color but doesn&#x27;t last a long time</li>
    <li> Love the lipstick. Wasn&#x27;t as dark of green as the last brand I bought but this works well. Have worn mood lipstick for years. Stays on for a long time. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Strong plastic/chemical taste. Can&#x27;t find the ingredient list anywhere. It&#x27;s probably very bad for your health. The pink color is very unnatural. Not recommend for the sake of your own health...</li>
    <li> I love these! I can&#x27;t believe you get so many for the price. The color lasts all day &amp; when you put it on, your lips feel silky :) &amp; the coolest thing iz the colors. Sometimes I put it on &amp; it&#x27;s hot pink &amp; other times it&#x27;s a darker pink. On my bf it was magenta &amp; my friend it was red &amp; my other friend dark pink. It iz so cool it&#x27;s likr everyone gets they&#x27;re own specific shade!</li>
    <li> even have my mother hooked on it lol</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for its novelty. It stays on really well, but the color ranges from bright, punch you in the throat fuchsia (unfortunately the color it makes my lips) or soft barely there pink (my sister) If I just barely put any on I can get away with it. The only bad thing is it smells kind of like crushed ragweed (oddly specific I know.) Overall, not bad, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Like the product, but really didn&#x27;t need as many tubes as I got.</li>
    <li> Wet and Wild had these lipsticks for years, then suddenly they were gone. I am so glad to find a source for them now. The color is very good and depends on your body temp as to how light or dark it will be. The color lasts a long, long time and the Aloe keeps moisture in my lips.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much or the color will come on very very pink. Try to just to a swipe or two and you&#x27;ll have the perfect shade of pink.</li>
    <li> I love this I&#x27;ve noticed the more you put one the brighter it is so if you want a light color only put one coat on love it I&#x27;m using these as Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Great price for an all day pink lipstick!</li>
    <li> It turns just the right color for each person!  I gave a bunch to friends and they love it too...</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first, but I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s cute, fun, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have had the green mood lipstick for years and loved it, but it was produced by Sarah.  This one does not produce the pink color as the Sarah and is greasy.  I passed out six of them to my family members and the have the same opinion.  Still have six left and will probably trash them.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this when i wear it. I gave most of the extra out as gifts. Reminds me of high school love it and would buy again!!</li>
    <li> I have used this many times in the past and had a hard time finding it so was happy to find it here.  It works with your own skin tone and that&#x27;s what I was looking for in a lipstick.</li>
    <li> I gave these out as gifts to my co workers who all love it(:</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and turns into either a really bright pink or a rose color depending on ur chemistry and temp.</li>
    <li> The reviews that state that the color does not change are spot on.  I had several other women use a stick as there are so many and all the same and there was no difference in the color/shade.  It comes out very pink and stays pink.  It looks like something my 9 year old daughter would have in her Hello Kitty makeup kits.</li>
    <li> Have been using this lipstick for years.</li>
    <li> Good, but it came melted.</li>
    <li> great price and i really smooth and fun lipstick...it stays on for hours by the way..I thought because it was so cheap that it would be fun for 5 minutes but I put some on this morning it it still looked great 6+ hours later.</li>
    <li> it was nice to see them back ,I used them a long time ago and with a good price you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I had mood lipsticks prior to this which looked like these, however the color was more rich and deep than these.  I mistakenly assumed that because the outside container looked the same, the lipsticks were the same.  Not so.  These are too pale for my liking and I won&#x27;t be ordering any more.....</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast for this product. The packaging could be better but it&#x27;s not that bad. The color turned a bright pink almost red on my lips but it does change according to body heat and pH level so it might be different on other people. The lipstick itself is a bit hard to blend first but works just fine after that. Comes with good amount of product per tube. The reason i did&#x27;t give this review 5 stars is because of the smell. This lipstick has a strange smell kind of like crayons but a bit more strong. That&#x27;s my only con about this product. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> pretty good. got some on the sleeve of a shirt and had a darned time removing it. also, turns hot pink on me, so not my favorite shade, hahaha.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick! It has become my go-to for 3 reasons: It goes on smoothly, is softening to my lips, and I adore the color it turns on me!  The pink is bright but not garish - just a notch up from natural. I&#x27;ve noticed it looks good in photos. Best bang-for-my-beauty-buck I&#x27;ve spent in ages. I recommend buying this 12-pack and sharing it with your friends.</li>
    <li> got this for a present for my mom. She liked it but said it did not turn as red as the last tube she got.</li>
    <li> Love these! And such a great deal! Gave these to my class at church (young women, ages 16-18), they all loved it too and the color was different for all of them! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!! It was a pretty pink color and glided on smoothly.  It was so fun to watch the green stick go on clear and tint my lips pink! I gave several to my friends because theres no way I would use twelve tubes by myself, everyone loved the lipstick! while i don&#x27;t normally wear pink lipstick, I really liked the shade it turned, it really complimented my face.  The product came in quickly and the packaging was solid.  I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Love the color and it is very moist. Stays on for hours.And the price is unbeatable. Got it within three days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product several years ago....and the color was much brighter and deeper on my lips.</li>
    <li> I would rather it be less pink and more red, but I like that it stains your lips. The color lasts all day (despite multiple coats of Chapstick) and it does not dry them at all.</li>
    <li> if you didnt already buy this it really stays on</li>
    <li> This stuff looks pink on everyone.  Kind of like very cheap kids lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love these lipsticks and WHAT a bargain!! I&#x27;ve kept most for myself, but have a few out to friends and family so we can all rock our own colors!</li>
    <li> I thought this would tint my lips... Nope, and it has nothing to do with mood... It looked the same on my aunt and myself.. It just turns this god awful middle school, not sure how to pick colors that work with my skin tone pink/purple... Very juvenile color... Wasn&#x27;t thrilled and now I have 12 tubes of this lipstick that I will never use... Guess they&#x27;re good for kids though.</li>
    <li> Nice, very smooth and the pink color last for hours.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift to put in the makeup bags for my bridesmaids!</li>
    <li> I think the key to this product is what pigment your lips have to start with. I have very little color in my lips on their own, which is why I wanted to try this. For me, it turns a BRIGHT pink. Like 80&#x27;s pink or &amp;#34;hoochie&amp;#34; pink (I think that&#x27;s the color from Urban Decay or something? It&#x27;s the big popular color right now to contrast tan skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it kind of makes me look like I just ate a cherry popsicle so it&#x27;s not going to be an everyday wear for me, sadly. But I gave two sticks to my cousin who does have lip color and it looked AMAZING on her. Same with my boyfriend, who was gracious enough to let me try it on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ladies (and gentlemen), know that the paler your lips are, it seems like the brighter the pink this will be. Just a head&#x27;s up.</li>
    <li> Was a little unsure at first about how these would turn out, but I love them. Gives me my perfect shade of pink with no effort on my part. Feels like a chapstick but looks like a lipstick. I&#x27;m fair skinned so it stains my lips if I leave it on all day, but nothing a shower can&#x27;t fix. This is my go to. I keep one in my purse, with my makeup, in my car and in my backpack. And, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on how the shade suits me! Speedy delivery too!</li>
    <li> Soooo many for such a cheap price. Although the case is cheap and the gold rim quickly goes away, it is still a bargain. Loved it, thanks!</li>
    <li> not quite the same as my original lipstick made by &amp;#34;Sarah&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My LIPS STAY LUCIOUS, SOFT &amp; PINK ALL DAY with one application - put your  favorite color over if you like, but you really won&#x27;t want to. LOVE THIS ALOE STICK.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Love this product, it gives me a bright pink color. U have to apply it a couple of times. It stays on your lips for a long time and it kinda stains them too.</li>
    <li> I dont know what I fully expected buying this, but it was kind of a let down.</li>
    <li> Good for the price love them</li>
    <li> My wife love the lipstick..I don&amp;#34;t use it myself.  Thank You</li>
    <li> The last for a l I ng time I love them been using them for years</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I gave them away to the girls in my family for Christmas, and they all love it! It&#x27;s fun to see the shades of pink/red that it is on each different person. A great gift :)</li>
    <li> These are a great price for a dozen lipsticks. You cannot go wrong ordering these, The lipsticks are a light green color, but go on my lips a soft pink shade. The aloe is very moisturizing as well.  I am doing favors for a \\&quot;Sweet 16\\&quot; birthday. These will be in the favor bags. Great deal. I would order them again.</li>
    <li> I originally saw these on Pinterest and then when I happened upon them on Amazon I knew I had to try it out. The lipstick cases themselves are very cheap, in fact I broke my first one by trying to open it (The twisty part came off and the whole tube stayed in the upper case) But it looks great. I gave one to each of my girlfriends for Christmas and they all love it. It&#x27;s cool because it does look different on each person. So far, not CRAZY different but definitely varies in shades on most people. Since it&#x27;s Aloe, it&#x27;s also super smooth. Just wish the cases were not so cheaply made! Good Buy!</li>
    <li> I saw these Henna based lipstains on Pinterest and was so fascinated I immediately hopped on Amazon and bought some.  I was surprised by how much I love them!  I bought a 12 pack and gave them out as Christmas presents to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick goes on like chap stick, is moisturizing, lasts 2-3 hours and has a great color.  It uses your natural PH levels and coloring and simply enhances your lip color.  My sister and I get a very pink hue from it (which I love) but on my best friend it is a warm lovely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts a long time and it extremely inexpensive to buy in bulk, I keep one in my car and one in my purse and another in my makeup kit so I can always touch up.  Better yet, it is very moisturizing and makes my lips feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are cheaply made, but I expected that.</li>
    <li> Havn&#x27;t been able to find these in a long, long time. If put on correctly it stays on until you go to bed.</li>
    <li> This lipstick came well packaged. The lipstick turns a flattering and long lasting shade of pink. The aloe makes the lipstick easy to apply and moisturizing. I love the novelty of the lipstick and plan to buy more to gift to friends.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the lips but Lipstick not anchored to base of the tube and falls out.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> My wife loved them. Fast shipping. Good quality product.</li>
    <li> I am returning them.  There is a note for the reason inside.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t as vibriant as the Fran Wilson Brand.  It&#x27;s good for a lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Shipping was fast! Old school lipstick! Have given one to every girl I know and it looks great. Doesn&#x27;t stay on too long</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick. Just a hint of color. Very natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lipstick, but I love this!  It&#x27;s very cool that it changes color and it dries right on.  I can easily put chapstick on over it and it doesn&#x27;t come off.  It lasts about 4-5 hours which is the perfect amount of time for me when I go out.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffers!  We had fun putting it on and comparing colors! Seems to last fairly long too.</li>
    <li> always loved mood lipstick Thank you</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this stuff is amazing! First of all, $6 for 12 lipsticks is unheard of and the product is awesome! It&#x27;s super moisturizing, and it really does adjust to your skin tone! Gave it to my roomies who all have VERY different skin tones and undertones and we all rocked our own personalized lipstick looks! A great every day lipstick and totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Product came in 2 days (ordered on Saturday arrived on Monday) Great color but doesn&#x27;t show well on darker lips. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister, she just loves this green one in particular because the shade is red. it is a nice red without being too glaring and works well with dusky skin colors. It is long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. A nice product.</li>
    <li> Very coolAnd great gifts</li>
    <li> Good product. I have been wearing it for years. Don&#x27;t buy the yellow it was tested positive for lead.</li>
    <li> bought it thinking it was actualy green lipstick which is what I needed for my costume so as a green lipstick it sucks and it did not change the color of my lips so as a mood lipstick I don&#x27;t find it much better</li>
