### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>AWESOME savings!</li>
      <li>Everything was perfect!!!</li>
      <li>I have used it three times now works great.</li>
      <li>Hoping for great results on my stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Having said that, applying ANY cream or oil to the skin after rolling is very hazardous.</li>
      <li>The dermaroller just isn&#x27;t worth the risk!!!!</li>
      <li>This has been a good buy for me.</li>
      <li>I have loved the product.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a good product...</li>
      <li>Roller quality appears good and looks better than the picture.</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>Longer needles increase the risk of infection or scarring and hurt more: “Once you get over one millimeter, you need to be pretty brave,” says Michael Gold, a Nashville, Tenn. Dermatologist who is a consultant to EndyMed</li>
      <li>I know we all want better skin</li>
      <li>I love how my skin is changing..</li>
      <li>I used it and my skin is already looking much better.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied with the packaging.</li>
      <li>So far, no damage, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>This tool is cool!</li>
      <li>My fine lines are smoother, and it plumps up the skin and allows for deeper penetration of skin products.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the feel of my skin during and after using this roller.  </li>
      <li>The needles are larger than what I wanted but for the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>As I said the roller fell and after about a month of light use.</li>
      <li>Just not too sure if I&#x27;m using it right</li>
      <li>I have used this on a regular basis according to directions and there&#x27;s some improvement of my stretchmarks which might be just as easily attributed to good lighting or the passage of time.</li>
      <li>try to be more consistent on it and see what happens 6 months from now.</li>
      <li>Would have appreciated more info on how to use the product.</li>
      <li>But other than that I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Also, alot of people say you dont bleed but with this size and the 2.0 , if your doing it right you do bleed alittle.. to me its worth it.</li>
      <li>However, be very gentle when using for the first couple of times.  </li>
      <li>Results were ok but could have gotten that from any similar product.</li>
      <li>After reviewing medical research studies on collagen fiber stimulation decided to try and also in conjuntion with hialuronic acid for it to  better penetrate.</li>
      <li>Okay so I got my dermaroller in the mail &amp; there were several typos on the box, no directions and fuzz balls on the needles!!!!!!</li>
      <li>and it actually does a better job.</li>
      <li>I think the Ida of more needles was good but is actually a fail.</li>
      <li>rolling at home, doctors say, it is important to wash the face first with soap and water and use only quality needle devices.</li>
      <li>There are some really inexpensive ones ($5-$8) that work really well.</li>
      <li>it really didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>but it did more bad then good</li>
      <li>But the needles stay sharp and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for over a year and the product is still like new.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a 1mm dermaroller for the last few months and have been loving the results (not this one).</li>
      <li>I was utterly surprised when I received this way ahead of schedule!</li>
      <li>but my advice would be to exfoliate at home, use a natural oil &amp; some liquid collagen.</li>
      <li>That is pretty amazing for me since I used to always look mad.</li>
      <li>I will stick to my shorter needle for now and look in the future for longer needles that do not have such a high quantity.</li>
      <li>And when I used it on my scars on my back it actually really irritated the skin and made the texture of my skin really rough.</li>
      <li>Even natural oils or creams should never be applied to an open wound unless it is an anti inflammatory &amp; that would only be reversing the damage done by the rolled which would leave you with no results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda like the man that lays on a bed of nails, he can do so without injury due to the high amount of nails he is laying on.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this method of irritating the skin is good for anyone</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not buy this product, though here&#x27;s some information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologists recommend consulting a physician before micro-needling at home and using needles shorter than a quarter-to-a-half millimeter. Longer needles increase the risk of infection or scarring and hurt more: “Once you get over one millimeter, you need to be pretty brave,” says Michael Gold, a Nashville, Tenn. Dermatologist who is a consultant to EndyMed Medical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If rolling at home, doctors say, it is important to wash the face first with soap and water and use only quality needle devices. Dull needles, or somewhat skewed needles, can result in damage to the face, adds Dr. Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal</li>
    <li> The estimated delivery was long but I received my product in about two weeks after ordering. Satisfied with the packaging. The roller comes in a plastic casing with a plastic sealed wrap over the case. Roller quality appears good and looks better than the picture. Have not used it yet but plan on trying it out today. Hoping for great results on my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I have used this on a regular basis according to directions and there&#x27;s some improvement of my stretchmarks which might be just as easily attributed to good lighting or the passage of time.</li>
    <li> This has been a good buy for me. I have been using this for over a year and the product is still like new. I will purchase this one again if I ever need another one.</li>
    <li> I was utterly surprised when I received this way ahead of schedule! Surpassed my expectations. I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this method of irritating the skin is good for anyone but it did more bad then good</li>
    <li> I needed another to plump up my face . I guess I would be purchasing these rollers until I cant get anymore rejuvernation.</li>
    <li> Would have appreciated more info on how to use the product. But other than that I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> After reviewing medical research studies on collagen fiber stimulation decided to try and also in conjuntion with hialuronic acid for it to  better penetrate. Have seen a decrease in face pore size. Price is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;will try to be more consistent on it and see what happens 6 months from now.</li>
    <li> As I said the roller fell and after about a month of light use. Is made to not last very long. Results were ok but could have gotten that from any similar product.</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased a 1.0mm micro needle that didn&#x27;t have the same number of needles and it actually does a better job. I think the Ida of more needles was good but is actually a fail. You can hardly tell that there is any puncture at all with this one. I will stick to my shorter needle for now and look in the future for longer needles that do not have such a high quantity. It&#x27;s kinda like the man that lays on a bed of nails, he can do so without injury due to the high amount of nails he is laying on.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good product... however when I used it on my face it really didn&#x27;t do anything. And when I used it on my scars on my back it actually really irritated the skin and made the texture of my skin really rough. But the needles stay sharp and it&#x27;s easy to use. Just not too sure if I&#x27;m using it right or if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
    <li> Okay so I got my dermaroller in the mail &amp; there were several typos on the box, no directions and fuzz balls on the needles!!!!!! Also after I ordered this product I began doing a lot more research &amp; found that this is an extremely dangerous product. Anytime you are puncturing the skin you are extremely susceptible to bacteria and disease! Having said that, applying ANY cream or oil to the skin after rolling is very hazardous. You are putting chemicals into an open wound. Even natural oils or creams should never be applied to an open wound unless it is an anti inflammatory &amp; that would only be reversing the damage done by the rolled which would leave you with no results. I know we all want better skin but my advice would be to exfoliate at home, use a natural oil &amp; some liquid collagen. The dermaroller just isn&#x27;t worth the risk!!!!</li>
    <li> When I tried to use this roller it kept sticking. As a result it looked like I scratched the hell out of my skin. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what your skin is supposed to look like afterwards but I swim every day and it looks&lt;br /&gt; awful. I&#x27;ll see how it looks in a couple weeks I guess.</li>
    <li> This products does what it states it&#x27;s going to do.  I used it and my skin is already looking much better.  However, be very gentle when using for the first couple of times.  The needles are larger than what I wanted but for the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a Gift ..I use It for CBT and My slave Loves it,use for Only 1 slave if you need extra buy extra</li>
    <li> I  heard about this technique a few years ago but was never brave enough to try it.  After looking into this more closely I realized that my fears were silly.  I enjoy the feel of my skin during and after using this roller.  Plan on using often!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!!! I have loved the product. I hope you keep on doing thos goode work for ever and ever</li>
    <li> Ive had it for a couple of weeks . Quick shipping. It is the roller in the picture . I dont bleed it does leave my skin dry and scratched . Hopefully i see results</li>
    <li> Well packaged and just as described. Quick delivery. I have used it three times now works great. Bleeds a little but wipes off with alcohol. In about three days peels a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 1mm dermaroller for the last few months and have been loving the results (not this one). My fine lines are smoother, and it plumps up the skin and allows for deeper penetration of skin products. I just started to use it on a few red spots (acne) scars on my chin and we&#x27;ll see how that goes. So far, no damage, so I&#x27;m happy. I got this one in the mail a day ago and tried it out last night (I decided to try a bit of a deeper needle). The needles are too close together to do anything at all. There may be a little bit of penetration, but not much. I don&#x27;t like it. I went back to my 1 mm roller immediately after using this one, and can feel the difference. The one I&#x27;ve been using is this one: http://www.amazon.com/Needle-Roller-Therapy-Dermatology-System/dp/B004LUZ956/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355762698&amp;sr&#x3D;1-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;1+mm+dermaroller. I would look elsewhere when it comes to rollers and not get this one. There are some really inexpensive ones ($5-$8) that work really well.</li>
    <li> This tool is cool! The crease in between my eyes is lessening.. somehow my forehead doesnt swinch together now like it did before I started the roller. That is pretty amazing for me since I used to always look mad. Also, alot of people say you dont bleed but with this size and the 2.0 , if your doing it right you do bleed alittle.. to me its worth it. If you read up on it, Dr&#x27;s charge alot of money for the same thing you can do yourself. AWESOME savings! I love how my skin is changing.. If you want change, get it!</li>
