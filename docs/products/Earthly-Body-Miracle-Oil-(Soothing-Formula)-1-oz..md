<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it for almost everything. I originally got this to help with ingrown hairs that I sometimes get from waxing. It not only prevented hair bumps, it also got rid of the scares from prior ones.. So then, I decided to use it on my face as a moisturizer and I hardly ever breakout anymore.. It also keeps my nails from breaking and they are actually growing healthier than when I was going to the nail salon every two weeks. I thought my nails were a hopeless case. Now, I don&#x27;t have to get fake nails for my wedding day.. This is by far, the best product I have ever come across in skin care and no where near as costly. It&#x27;s my all-in-one skin care solution.</li>
    <li> I have been using Miracle Oil to soften a surgical scar.  With regular use, it softens the skin and helps to ease the stretching pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product at my nail salon for 4 years and it works great!  Helps heal nails and make them much stronger.  I finally ordered two bottles for the house.</li>

    <li> All Natural, this product used twice a day on post surgical scars literally made them disappear!  I purchased this for my niece who is now 7 months pregnant and horrified about stretch marks. She has been rubbing all over her bellie and so far not a mark.  We need more. I only wish it came in a larger size!</li>
    <li> Purchased it 3 weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t see any improvements yet but it may be too soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!! I used this on a burn I had on my hand (from hot soup) and it went away.

    <li> I had a problem with fleas in my yard (no pets). They were hitching a ride on my ankles into my house and biting me all over! I took care of the fleas, but my ankles were a complete mess. I put this on one night before going to bed hoping it would ward off fleas due to the rosemary and eucalyptus oil. Major surprise...woke up to almost completely healed ankles! Majority of my bug bites were gone. After using a few days there were completely gone! Miracle indeed.</li>
