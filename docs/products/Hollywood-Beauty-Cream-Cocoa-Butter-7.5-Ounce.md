<ol>
      <li>This is wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>Best creame I have ever used got my wife and sister using it</li>
      <li>She thinks it is GREAT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best for use as a massage butter -</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen an incredible difference in the appearance</li>
      <li>I still have a lot of work to do to heal my skin condition from the inside out, as opposed to just covering up the problem with medicated creams, but in the meantime, this works beautiful for keeping skin moisturized and protected.</li>
      <li>All the great reviews you read are before they ruined this creme.</li>
      <li>Great product for all over use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great as a make-up remover too.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that great after shower, either.  </li>
      <li>Using them together could be a reason for my good results, however, using it Palmers alone didn&#x27;t work for me</li>

      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>i love this butter.  </li>
      <li>When I purchased it at the store seem to be more creamy and wasn&#x27;t as oily on my skin.</li>
      <li>I like the product and plan to keep it, but it appear to have more vitamin E than cocoa butter which makes it more oily.</li>
      <li>Definately will buy again and would surely recommend to people.</li>
      <li>I love my skin</li>
      <li>Hope this review helps someone :)&lt;</li>
      <li>It says it is safe to put it anywhere on your body</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a couple of months and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I had any mark on my calf.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and it smells fantastic</li>
      <li>product is mostly petroleum jelly, which is a skin softener</li>
      <li>Love, this skin cream.  </li>
      <li>Though, I will say, I LOVE putting this stuff on my hands, elbows, and knees.</li>
      <li>I cant stop touching it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mixing the Hollywood beauty with this in hopes of getting the consistency I&#x27;ve previously enjoyed with this product.  </li>
      <li>In the winter, this is a really excellent moisturizer for very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Great for people with allergies or sensitive skin.    </li>
      <li>it was much firmer, as good Cocoa Butter is.  </li>
      <li>This Hollywood Beauty Cocoa Butter with Vitamin E is great for after showers and bath makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and youthful looking.  </li>
      <li>Then I found this cocoa Butter and have smooth lips, no chapping at all.  </li>
      <li>Just smooth some on and take it off with a cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>I put my hands in to smooth it on my body and it was falling from my fingers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also fantastic for elbows, knees, super-dry hands, and feet.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and is so great on my type of skin(which can be slightly dry, even in the summer)</li>
      <li>Keeps them nice and smooth (a tad bit greasy but defiantly making your skin look and feel healthy and hydrated- especially during the winter seasons!).</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this purchase.</li>
      <li>This product is great if you have really dry skin.     </li>
      <li>This Cocoa butter worked right away!</li>
      <li>I love this cream so much, I now use it for everything from eye makeup remover to body lotion.</li>
      <li>I have even noticed that marks I had before getting pregnant</li>
      <li>I used this to prevent stretch marks while pregnant</li>
      <li>Just recently started using this product, its amazing on what it has been doing on stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product on your face if you have oily skin or are using some kind of medication/treatment (such as acne medication).</li>
      <li>by adding far more Vaseline(Petroleum) than Cocoa Butter.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit greasey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>In the morning, my feet are so soft and feel fantastic!</li>
      <li>I have been a very loyal customer of this particular brand of Cocoa Butter since  the year 2000.  </li>
      <li>So, far I&#x27;ve put the new mixture on my lips and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I put it on after a shower or right before bed and wake up in the morning with lucious skin.</li>
      <li>Not pleased, but I kept using it as I could find no other product as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the latest change.  </li>
      <li>Cocoa butter use to be the first ingredient...</li>
      <li>Brought this product from Freds and at first I was using it after showers &amp; nightly, sometimes I applied it twice a day..</li>
      <li>Love this for cracked heels, cuticles, stretch marks as well as regular body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This stuff made my skin more oily and made my skin burn and turned red with irritation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too heavy for summer months and it smells good.</li>
      <li>Goes on skin smoothly, nice smell, hydrates skins very well, last a long time, enjoy using now  and have ordered a 3 pack for the winter months</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nearly pure petroleum</li>
      <li>Not only was it wonderful on dry skin, the fragrance made it pleasant to use on a sore nose during a cold.</li>
      <li>Very hard to find in stores, so happy to find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last three years now and my skin is very smooth and soft</li>
      <li>So I am real hopefully with this product, but will keep you updated in about another month.</li>
      <li>It also works very well on my arms and shoulder blades.  </li>
      <li>This really happened.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A jar of petroleum jelly is much cheaper and a lot easier to find.</li>
      <li>I had a lot of damage done to my face and neck by steroid cream, ELIDEL, and TersiFoam, but this wonder cream has really helped to undo some of that damage.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>it stays smooth and slick for quite a while, allows for very deep muscle massages, and if you use too much, the excess \\&quot;grease\\&quot; can be buffed off with a towel very easily after the massage.</li>
      <li>My first impression was \\&quot;Wow.</li>
      <li>The old formula had Cocoa Butter as the first ingredient.</li>
      <li>Back when I first started using this product Cocoa butter was the first ingredient listed on the label.  </li>
      <li>Both me and my boy friend highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>All of the other moisturizers and creams I&#x27;d been using on my face didn&#x27;t seem to work or lock in any moisture anymore, but this amazing product finally kept my face moist and with a protective coating over it.  </li>
      <li>I was also glad to see that it doesn&#x27;t contain lanolin, as I suspect the lanolin contained in Aquaphor, which had initially been working wonders for my dry skin, may have aggravated my skin all over again.  </li>
      <li>The new formula did not bother me.</li>
      <li>They give no warning, no labels proclaiming the new formula.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Moving right along, so I&#x27;m early twenties, female, and I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on butt/thighs for quite a while now, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the Palmers products...</li>
      <li>So you can see that she thinks this is a special cocoa butter for her, any other just doesn&#x27;t work for her.  </li>
      <li>Using this TWICE A DAY (morning and night, always after a bath) for only LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, my skin is now BETTER than it ever was before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it, but only after making a visit to a store to purchase pure cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend this for deep massage and silky foot benefits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my late 50s and have better lips than in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the record, My skin is sensitive, and oily around my T-zone (unless of course my medication is taking the oil away from my face).</li>
      <li>My skin was peeling because of the dryness, and now it is so soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it is very sticky on your body.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday as I should, it&#x27;s been maybe a month, or a little less than since i started using this, but I have seen really good results!</li>
      <li>(you don&#x27;t really need to put it on every day if you don&#x27;t have _really_ dry legs).   </li>
      <li>but this cocoa butter did the job when no other brand or lotion would.</li>
      <li>most common use for this is on my dry cracked feet.  </li>
      <li>There is a big change since i started  using this product so i could highly recommed it to any one with dry skin problem.</li>
      <li>and WHAMMO you get a different formula.....if you have used this product in the past when it had cocoa butter as main ingredient...you will be sorry you bought the NEW kind....</li>
      <li>HB has a much higher cocoa butter ratio to its other ingredients, which naturally gives it a thick texture and greasy feeling if you use too much.</li>
      <li>so I put some on my face to help get rid of my dry skin that I have been getting from a new acne treatment I have recently started to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> was not what I brought three years ago. Has a smell like something burnt.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is GREASY! I was hoping for something not as greasy, but oh well. It does have the yummy cocoa butter smell and the grease feeling does fade once your skin soaks it up. I only recommend it for DRY skin...like winter time skin! It&#x27;s just too heavy otherwise. I put it on after a shower or right before bed and wake up in the morning with lucious skin. You get a lot for the price though, so if you can handle feeling like a grease monkey for a little while the results are worth it. I&#x27;m trying to reduce the appearance of my silver stretchmarks, we&#x27;ll see if it does anything!</li>
    <li> My wife had me search the internet to find this product as we couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores, WalMart, WalGreen, Safeway,etc.  So you can see that she thinks this is a special cocoa butter for her, any other just doesn&#x27;t work for her.  She thinks it is GREAT!</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have really dry skin.     I usually put it on my legs when they get dry and they moisture up for days (you don&#x27;t really need to put it on every day if you don&#x27;t have _really_ dry legs).   It does reduce stretch marks and scars as advertised.   I also use it on small cuts and sores you get for example on your hands and it makes them heal a lot faster.  Oh, and in the summer, if I get burnt by the sun, slap on some cocoa butter and it reduces the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; pain and flaking!    The only downside is that it is very sticky on your body. But hey, I endure it for all the above perks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hollywood Beauty cocoa butter for years and I&#x27;ll never go back to Palmer&#x27;s or any of the other brands. Plus, it has no beeswax or lanolin! Great for people with allergies or sensitive skin.    HB has a much higher cocoa butter ratio to its other ingredients, which naturally gives it a thick texture and greasy feeling if you use too much. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best for use as a massage butter - it stays smooth and slick for quite a while, allows for very deep muscle massages, and if you use too much, the excess \\&quot;grease\\&quot; can be buffed off with a towel very easily after the massage. It&#x27;s also fantastic for elbows, knees, super-dry hands, and feet. I used it all during my pregnancy, from 2 months on, and have no stretch marks from that time.    For a foot cream, I like to use \\&quot;too much\\&quot; of the product at bedtime, then put on plain cotton socks overnight. In the morning, my feet are so soft and feel fantastic! I really recommend this for deep massage and silky foot benefits.</li>
    <li> Very....very upset about the changes they made to this product. All the great reviews you read are before they ruined this creme. Cocoa butter use to be the first ingredient...it IS NOT NOW. The almighty dollar strikes again. I use to buy off of the shelf...then couldn&#x27;t  find it anymore. Now...I know why. People quit buying because of the changes. Now you buy it off the internet....get it home and WHAMMO you get a different formula.....if you have used this product in the past when it had cocoa butter as main ingredient...you will be sorry you bought the NEW kind....</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this purchase. I have heard many great things about this product and wanted to give it a try. After ordering it off of Amazon it came in the mail a week later. My first impression was \\&quot;Wow. This smells a lot like chocolate!\\&quot;. It says it is safe to put it anywhere on your body so I put some on my face to help get rid of my dry skin that I have been getting from a new acne treatment I have recently started to use. For the record, My skin is sensitive, and oily around my T-zone (unless of course my medication is taking the oil away from my face). This stuff made my skin more oily and made my skin burn and turned red with irritation. I don&#x27;t believe it was actually the product itself that made my skin burn. I think my skin burned because I was using Tretinoin cream for my acne and it wasn&#x27;t working well with this product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product on your face if you have oily skin or are using some kind of medication/treatment (such as acne medication). Though, I will say, I LOVE putting this stuff on my hands, elbows, and knees. Keeps them nice and smooth (a tad bit greasy but defiantly making your skin look and feel healthy and hydrated- especially during the winter seasons!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having horrible on and off problems with eczema and seborrheic dermatitis on my face for over two years now, and my skin was at a very dry and painful point when I found this product.  All of the other moisturizers and creams I&#x27;d been using on my face didn&#x27;t seem to work or lock in any moisture anymore, but this amazing product finally kept my face moist and with a protective coating over it.  In less than 24 hours, the skin on my face, particularly around my eyes, went from being painfully dry and flaking, like a molting snake, to actually looking like human skin again.  I had a lot of damage done to my face and neck by steroid cream, ELIDEL, and TersiFoam, but this wonder cream has really helped to undo some of that damage.  It also works very well on my arms and shoulder blades.  If you have very dry skin or eczema, constant moisturizing is extremely important, and this one works so well because it has a Vaseline-like base and all natural ingredients.  I was also glad to see that it doesn&#x27;t contain lanolin, as I suspect the lanolin contained in Aquaphor, which had initially been working wonders for my dry skin, may have aggravated my skin all over again.  I still have a lot of work to do to heal my skin condition from the inside out, as opposed to just covering up the problem with medicated creams, but in the meantime, this works beautiful for keeping skin moisturized and protected.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Loved it. Not only was it wonderful on dry skin, the fragrance made it pleasant to use on a sore nose during a cold. HOWEVER the containers I just purchased were horrible! The product smells like a damp basement and it is sticky. Every time I purchase this it is slightly different.  The new formula did not bother me. The little rough bits did not bother me. It still did the job. But this last order is unbearable.  It&#x27;s stinky and sticky and seems to have no effect on my dry skin. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Just recently started using this product, its amazing on what it has been doing on stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day with a mixture of Johnson&#x27;s Aloe Vera and Vitamin E baby oil, plus taking a Vitamin E capsule. I&#x27;ve noticed my stretch marks have been fading,not much, but I also believe if i continue to use, hopefully it will fade these annoying depressing marks over time. I have tried everything from Trilastin, to Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter, and all kinds of remedies that swear up and down that they work, then turn out to be a waste of money. So I am real hopefully with this product, but will keep you updated in about another month.</li>
    <li> **For starters, I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t quite had this product a month yet!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving right along, so I&#x27;m early twenties, female, and I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on butt/thighs for quite a while now, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the Palmers products...they didn&#x27;t work. Decided to pick this up bc being young, with no kids and having stretch marks is not cute.. Brought this product from Freds and at first I was using it after showers &amp; nightly, sometimes I applied it twice a day..I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday as I should, it&#x27;s been maybe a month, or a little less than since i started using this, but I have seen really good results! My skin is tighter and the marks are diminishing mark by mark. I&#x27;m also using it bc I have some discoloration on my back, haven&#x27;t seen any results for that but for the stretch marks, it WORKS! Give It a try if you&#x27;ve battled with embarrassing stretch marks. It can be purchased at Fred&#x27;s! Hope this review helps someone :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Oh and one other thing, sometimes I also use this along with Palmers stretch mark massage lotion. Using them together could be a reason for my good results, however, using it Palmers alone didn&#x27;t work for me an I used that for months. This Cocoa butter worked right away!</li>
    <li> Goes on skin smoothly, nice smell, hydrates skins very well, last a long time, enjoy using now  and have ordered a 3 pack for the winter months</li>
    <li> I like the product and plan to keep it, but it appear to have more vitamin E than cocoa butter which makes it more oily. When I purchased it at the store seem to be more creamy and wasn&#x27;t as oily on my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few months but realy like the way it makes my skin feel, I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love, this skin cream.  Both me and my boy friend highly recommend.  This is wonderful product.  Goes on smoothly and is so great on my type of skin(which can be slightly dry, even in the summer)</li>
    <li> Especially for the price. It is a bit greasey, but it&#x27;s worth it. I put it on my feet at night and put on a pair of socks. By morning my feet look like I just had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> In the winter, this is a really excellent moisturizer for very dry skin.  It&#x27;s too heavy for summer months and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This is no joke. This really happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered a severe allergic reaction that left my entire body covered in scars, dark spots and DRY spots from the reaction and my medication. I love my skin so I was devastated that this had happened. Nothing was helping my condition, and then I came across this cocoa butter on Amazon. Using this TWICE A DAY (morning and night, always after a bath) for only LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, my skin is now BETTER than it ever was before. I have no more dry spots, dark spots, or scars from the allergic reaction. My skin was peeling because of the dryness, and now it is so soft and moisturized I cant stop touching it. I use this cocoa butter RELIGIOUSLY because of what it did for my skin. My scars were VERY dark and looked like a terrible skin infection. I don&#x27;t know why but this cocoa butter did the job when no other brand or lotion would. The only other one that I use is Queen Helene Cocoa Butter CREME (not lotion) because it does the same moisturizing for me. But this cocoa butter actually treated my scars and marks, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!! It also did wonders for my stretch marks along my hips and made me feel sexier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: I have VERY sensitive skin (easily breaks out into hives especially with the cold and when I scratch), but this cocoa butter always stops me from scratching and does not cause me any reactions.**</li>
    <li> This Hollywood Beauty Cocoa Butter with Vitamin E is great for after showers and bath makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I use this as a make-up remover and lip balm.  In my twenties I had really bad chapped lips.  Nothing I used helped.  Then I found this cocoa Butter and have smooth lips, no chapping at all.  I&#x27;m in my late 50s and have better lips than in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a make-up remover too.  Just smooth some on and take it off with a cotton ball.  My skin is smooth and youthful looking.  Sometimes I use it after a shower, as well.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  They&#x27;ve changed their formula again.  This is the 2nd time in ten years.  They give no warning, no labels proclaiming the new formula.  The above review was for the formula I purchased back in 2011.  I usually buy about six jars so that I don&#x27;t run out and just in case they change the formula.  At any rate, the new formula is not good.  Back when I first started using this product Cocoa butter was the first ingredient listed on the label.  Then in the last ten years this was switched to petrolium.  Not pleased, but I kept using it as I could find no other product as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the latest change.  It&#x27;s nearly pure petroleum jelly-- It looks like it.  It feels like it.  It&#x27;s doing nothing for my chapped lips or makeup removal.  It&#x27;s not that great after shower, either.  I&#x27;m still using it, but only after making a visit to a store to purchase pure cocoa butter.  I&#x27;m mixing the Hollywood beauty with this in hopes of getting the consistency I&#x27;ve previously enjoyed with this product.  So, far I&#x27;ve put the new mixture on my lips and am very pleased with the results.  Of course I&#x27;m changing my rating of this product from 4 stars to 2 1/2.  Such a shame.  No doubt the company was influenced by money, but it&#x27;s just not going to work.  A jar of petroleum jelly is much cheaper and a lot easier to find.</li>
    <li> I am eight months pregnany and have been apply HB Cocoa Butter throughout the entire pregnancy and do not have any stretch marks yet.  It also helps to relieve iching on the belly.  I have even noticed that marks I had before getting pregnant seem to be fading.  Great product for all over use.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt use anything else.....but the sallys &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; section in my area hasnt a clue about what hollywood beauty products do for a person.....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last three years now and my skin is very smooth and soft yet i used have a dry skin. There is a big change since i started  using this product so i could highly recommed it to any one with dry skin problem. Because even my friends keep on asking me what i use on body. Its really good try it you won&#x27;t fail</li>
    <li> Hollywood Beauty Cream, Cocoa Butter is a quiet gem of my beauty routine!!  I first purchased a small 3 oz jar, but couldn&#x27;t remember WHERE I got it.  After an exhaustive search locally, I turned to Amazon.  I found it in the larger jar, and was pleased to find it the same price as I remember paying for less than half the size on Amazon!! Woo hoo!! I got a jar for my sister too.  Both she and her husband have dry skin and this alleviates the dryness without irritation. She now uses it regularly too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most common use for this is on my dry cracked feet.  It has completely healed them in just a few weeks of daily use!! The smell is heavenly and it absorbs into my skin without leaving the overly greasy feeling.  I also use it on my face after defoliation with a steam regimen.  Once a week with my manicure, this cocoa butter soothes my dry hands too!  Good for nearly every part of my body!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid to blow the horn too loudly on the virtues of this stuff, because I am afraid it will become too popular and harder to find!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It gives my dry skin the hydration it needs. Definately will buy again and would surely recommend to people.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as my doctor said to try using cocoa butter on my surgery scar to help reduce the scarring.  I use this 2x a day with a bit of  lavender oil.  I haven&#x27;t seen an incredible difference in the appearance but it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks now.  I did try using it on my feet with socks, as I&#x27;ve got very rough, dry feet, and wow, a few nights and my feet have definitely improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is mostly petroleum jelly, which is a skin softener itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for dry feet, hands, etc., jury is still out on the scars, stretch marks, blemishes, etc.</li>
    <li> I read that some buyers received a different formula. My jar was the same as always. Definitely NOT the consistency of vaseline, but rather the firm consistency it has always been. Very hard to find in stores, so happy to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that cocoa butter could help fade marks and heal. I had this terrible scrape turned scar on my calf. I tried everything to help heal/fade it. Finally I used this stuff and within a couple days my scar was going away. It&#x27;s been a couple of months and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I had any mark on my calf. This stuff is amazing and my body soaks it all up. I&#x27;m a cocoa butter convert and will never go back to anything else. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this to prevent stretch marks while pregnant and it totally worked! I love this cream so much, I now use it for everything from eye makeup remover to body lotion.</li>
    <li> i love this butter.  use as a lip ointment.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the new formula. The old formula had Cocoa Butter as the first ingredient. This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this for cracked heels, cuticles, stretch marks as well as regular body moisturizer. It&#x27;s an amazing product and it smells fantastic too!&lt;br /&gt;Only bummer is I can&#x27;t find the jumbo 10 ounce version anywhere.</li>
    <li> Best creame I have ever used got my wife and sister using it</li>
    <li> I have been a very loyal customer of this particular brand of Cocoa Butter since  the year 2000.  I would drive 20 minutes out of my way to purchase this Cocoa Butter product when the store closest to me ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this yesterday and opened it.  I noticed right away that it looked softer than usual, sort of the look of Vaseline. I put my hands in to smooth it on my body and it was falling from my fingers.  I knew something was different, because all of 13 years that I used this product it was much firmer, as good Cocoa Butter is.  The smell coming from the jar smelled like pure Vaseline, could hardly smell any Cocoa Butter at all. This company is trying to cut corners!!! by adding far more Vaseline(Petroleum) than Cocoa Butter.  It is NOT the same product, and should NOT be advertised as the same.&lt;br /&gt;HOLLYWOOD BEAUTY COCOA BUTTER...YOU HAVE JUST LOST A LOYAL CUSTOMER!!! IF I WANTED VASELINE I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED VASELINE.!!</li>
