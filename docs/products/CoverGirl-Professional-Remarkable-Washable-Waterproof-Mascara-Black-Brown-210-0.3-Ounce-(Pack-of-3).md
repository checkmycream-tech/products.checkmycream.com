      <li>Great value!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one for over 7 years, its the best.  </li>
      <li>Color is great.</li>
      <li>So I looked for a waterproof washable mascara and found it in \\&quot;Remarkable Cover Girl Waterproof Washable Mascara\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>This mascara works well, stays on if you cry or in elements that make your eyes water, &amp; washes off easily - it is the perfect waterproof mascara!  </li>
      <li>It is truly washable, but also fairly waterproof.</li>
      <li>the best part is that its cheap.</li>
      <li>love this product, it worked really great, it does not clump on my eyes like the rest of the mascaras that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I keep fooling myself into thinking there is a better Mascara out there, but there is not!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>Its like it adds to your eye lashes almost, its just amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>I used to love Great Lash by Maybeline, until I got to an age where the skin over my eyes started touching my lash line when I blinked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand &amp; kind of mascara for years.</li>
      <li>It goes on well, looks good &amp; comes off easily.</li>
      <li>However, it would be a good mascara for women who don&#x27;t need waterproof because it applies smoothly and does not clump.</li>
      <li>I am a man and my lashes hang in my eyes and are turning very light</li>
      <li>All went very smoothly.</li>
      <li>It removes easily with a cotton ball saturated in warm water, or in the shower.</li>
      <li>I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  </li>
      <li>Since they discontinued it I have tried many Cover Girl \\&quot;waterproof\\</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything that I like better.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t find it in stores any more and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
      <li>you too will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect combination of waterproof and easy to remove, something that I have never been able to find in any other mascara.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to see it was available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but I can still remove it so easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>yet I can easily get it off with any soap and water.</li>
      <li>It is waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover cloths.</li>
      <li>Shipping, very quick.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Waterproof, but washes off easily....</li>
      <li>I joined hot yoga - I liked it</li>
      <li>&amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  </li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with this product and it is waterproof for the most part but a good cry will bring dark tears.</li>
      <li>For the price I got 2 mascaras, these will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Smudges clean off easily with water or a damp tissue.</li>
      <li>This is totally worth the price!</li>
      <li>No need for special eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and blonde, so this shade works well for me.</li>
      <li>shipment was received quickly.</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like is how much this particular kind flakes.  </li>
      <li>and I keep coming back to this one, love it!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go swimming in it, but it&#x27;s great for everyday use because it doesn&#x27;t smear and is somewhat water resistant.  </li>
      <li>a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely, no clumps and looks good to me!</li>
      <li>wear contacts and have never had a problem with sore eyes (unlike right now because i don&#x27;t have this mascara</li>
      <li>and it came right off</li>
      <li>far as application I love it, a little on the bottom, more on the top, and do the corners twice and it looks</li>
      <li>Now my mascara stays on during hot yoga</li>
      <li>which is what sent me searching for a washable waterproof mascara in the first place.  </li>
      <li>The first time I wore it I had to use eye make up remover first, washed after, and still had mascara on.</li>
      <li>I do not have tons of money to buy expensive makeup any longer and these are as good as most I have bought.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it a good price I received it a day after I ordered it even though i did second</li>
      <li>honestly looks like it lengthens and thickens my eye lashes at the same time (which again no other mascara has done).</li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s easily removed with my facial cleanser and water.  </li>
      <li>And honestly I don&#x27;t even do that often because I wear lower eye liner and if I put just a little on it looks like it just adds to it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I really wish that Cover Girl would NOT discontinue this product.</li>
      <li>Too much product gets onto it but isn&#x27;t applied to the lashes well.</li>
      <li>And the shipping worked out very well, too.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money and for everyday eyelashes, they are just fine.</li>
      <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t run or smudge - like most waterproof makeup, but it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove like most waterproof.</li>
      <li>It has the staying power of other waterproof mascaras but is so easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts.</li>
      <li>it just looks normal no smudging</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had any major problems with clumps, a few flakes sure, but they are easily cleaned off with a single swipe under the eye lashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different types of mascara lately &amp; none are as good.</li>
      <li>I still miss the old Marathon Mascara!</li>
      <li>You just have to get it good and wet for a few seconds, then it comes right off with your fingers or a wet washcloth.  </li>
      <li>, I have sensitive skin, and eyes</li>
      <li>I really like this and had the ease of ordering this was very simple.  </li>
      <li>It applies easily without clumping and leaves the lashes looking full, and dark without looking fake like some of the products on the market.  </li>

<li> , I have sensitive skin, and eyes</li>
<li> I really like this and had the ease of ordering this was very simple.  </li>
<li> It applies easily without clumping and leaves the lashes looking full, and dark without looking fake like some of the products on the market.  </li>
<li> far as praise go, a little soap and water</li>
<li> It does leave some residue behind, but it comes off easily with a little Oil of Olay on</li>
<li> I have difficulty using other mascara types, especially the ones that have to be removed with eye makeup remover.  </li>
<li> Tried about 5 other brands and came back.</li>
<li> I normally hate waterproof mascara, so this is the only kind I ever use.  </li>
<li> It started running the second I put it on and within 5 minutes had come off and gathered black goo into the corner of my eyes.</li>
<li> Its not smudge proof but that is not really a problem with me, who rubs their eyes after their mascara is on anyway?</li>
<li> I have used this mascara for years but had a hard time finding it the last couple of years.</li>
<li> , no irritation, i didn&#x27;t have to rub hard, no left over excess, no ripping out my eye lashes, it didn&#x27;t stick on there when i tried to get it off.</li>
<li> Lately, it&#x27;s become difficult in locating this particular CoverGirl mascara in the local stores.  </li>
<li> Also, you can get this at Walmart for about half the price as on Amazon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never liked waterproof mascara for anything other than times when I&#x27;m planning on being in the water due to the difficulty of removing it;  </li>
<li> So with a little labor and scrubbing with additional remover it eventually came</li>
<li> This mascara comes off after a few hours despite the claim that it is waterproof.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;ll hold up to a tear or two, but not an all out crying jag, or a drizzly day but not a downpour, a brisk walk in the heat, but perhaps not a marathon.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never tested it with water because I just plain don&#x27;t swim in make up.</li>
<li> Why is it so hard to find anything BUT BLACK in waterproof mascara?</li>
<li> I always used Cover Girl&#x27;s marathon mascara which, if anything, was too hard to wash off.</li>
<li> Waterproof mascaras worked well but were so hard to remove even with eye makeup remover.  </li>
<li> , i seriously didn&#x27;t even know you could get sore</li>
<li> Not a good look.  </li>
<li> and i hate every single one of them.</li>
<li> &quot; mascaras and have been disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like Cover Girl. I like that the mascara is waterproof but comes off with soap and water.  What I don&#x27;t like is how much this particular kind flakes.  I&#x27;ve worn Cover Girl for years, did they change the formula?</li>
    <li> What can I say? I am a man and my lashes hang in my eyes and are turning very light&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t what them longer , or lusher...I just want them out of my vision and to have color&lt;br /&gt;to them..This does the job. I rub my eyes , whatever and it just looks normal no smudging&lt;br /&gt;etc...just keeps them in place and adds color...</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t run or smudge - like most waterproof makeup, but it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove like most waterproof.</li>
    <li> I have got to give props to amazon for this product. Not only is it a good price I received it a day after I ordered it even though i did second I day shipping. This is totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smear or run. At the end of the day it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water. No need for special eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s the perfect combination of waterproof and easy to remove, something that I have never been able to find in any other mascara.</li>
    <li> 1. Personally I don&#x27;t like the density of the brush. Too much product gets onto it but isn&#x27;t applied to the lashes well. Doesn&#x27;t build a lot of volume. Isn&#x27;t going to be my go to mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Waterproof, but washes off easily....kinda. The first time I wore it I had to use eye make up remover first, washed after, and still had mascara on. So with a little labor and scrubbing with additional remover it eventually came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Price, for the product is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shipping, very quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this CoverGirl mascara for years.  I have difficulty using other mascara types, especially the ones that have to be removed with eye makeup remover.  This washable waterproof mascara stays on until I wash it off with soap and water.  Lately, it&#x27;s become difficult in locating this particular CoverGirl mascara in the local stores.  I was so glad to see it was available on Amazon.  I ordered several since I change them out every 6 months.  I will definitely be ordering this product again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was received quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for over 7 years, its the best.  It has the staying power of other waterproof mascaras but is so easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts.</li>
    <li> For the price I got 2 mascaras, these will be fine.  I do not have tons of money to buy expensive makeup any longer and these are as good as most I have bought.  Definitely worth the money and for everyday eyelashes, they are just fine.</li>
    <li> I really wish that Cover Girl would NOT discontinue this product. I have used it for years and it is the only thing I can use.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything that I like better. Tried about 5 other brands and came back. Not all that waterproof...if your eyes water, you will get  some smudging under the eye. Smudges clean off easily with water or a damp tissue. I like it because it&#x27;s easily removed with my facial cleanser and water.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and blonde, so this shade works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but i am pissed! i can&#x27;t find it in stores any more and couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I&#x27;ve had to buy 4 different kinds of mascara and i hate every single one of them. I&#x27;ve heard rumors it was discontinued is this true?&lt;br /&gt;As far as praise go, a little soap and water and it came right off, no irritation, i didn&#x27;t have to rub hard, no left over excess, no ripping out my eye lashes, it didn&#x27;t stick on there when i tried to get it off. Its not smudge proof but that is not really a problem with me, who rubs their eyes after their mascara is on anyway? I&#x27;ve never tested it with water because I just plain don&#x27;t swim in make up. I have however showered with it on and worked out with it on and it lasted just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and have never had a problem with sore eyes (unlike right now because i don&#x27;t have this mascara, i seriously didn&#x27;t even know you could get sore eyes form mascara until now), I have sensitive skin, and eyes and I have no idea what I&#x27;ll be wearing with out this.&lt;br /&gt;As far as application I love it, a little on the bottom, more on the top, and do the corners twice and it looks PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;It honestly looks like it lengthens and thickens my eye lashes at the same time (which again no other mascara has done). Its like it adds to your eye lashes almost, its just amazing stuff. I&#x27;ve never had any major problems with clumps, a few flakes sure, but they are easily cleaned off with a single swipe under the eye lashes. And honestly I don&#x27;t even do that often because I wear lower eye liner and if I put just a little on it looks like it just adds to it.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is that its cheap. Well....it was anyway</li>
    <li> I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  Of ALL of the mascaras that I have tried in my life, (which is about 20 years now, &amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  I normally hate waterproof mascara, so this is the only kind I ever use.  This mascara works well, stays on if you cry or in elements that make your eyes water, &amp; washes off easily - it is the perfect waterproof mascara!  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I really like this and had the ease of ordering this was very simple.  And the shipping worked out very well, too. All went very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I keep fooling myself into thinking there is a better Mascara out there, but there is not! I even have purchased more expensive brands and I keep coming back to this one, love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara comes off after a few hours despite the claim that it is waterproof.  I always used Cover Girl&#x27;s marathon mascara which, if anything, was too hard to wash off. Since they discontinued it I have tried many Cover Girl \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; mascaras and have been disappointed. Also, you can get this at Walmart for about half the price as on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use prescription eye drops several times a day so I need waterproof mascara.  This mascara bled into my eyes after one application of my drops, causing severe irritation.  However, it would be a good mascara for women who don&#x27;t need waterproof because it applies smoothly and does not clump.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product and it is waterproof for the most part but a good cry will bring dark tears.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara daily for several years now.  I used to love Great Lash by Maybeline, until I got to an age where the skin over my eyes started touching my lash line when I blinked.  A few hours into my day, I&#x27;d have what looked like an extra set of eyebrows, thanks to my oily skin. Not a good look.  I&#x27;ve never liked waterproof mascara for anything other than times when I&#x27;m planning on being in the water due to the difficulty of removing it;  which is what sent me searching for a washable waterproof mascara in the first place.  It turns out that this mascara is not what I&#x27;d call truly waterproof, but I still like it alot.  I wouldn&#x27;t go swimming in it, but it&#x27;s great for everyday use because it doesn&#x27;t smear and is somewhat water resistant.  It&#x27;ll hold up to a tear or two, but not an all out crying jag, or a drizzly day but not a downpour, a brisk walk in the heat, but perhaps not a marathon.  It removes easily with a cotton ball saturated in warm water, or in the shower. You just have to get it good and wet for a few seconds, then it comes right off with your fingers or a wet washcloth.  It does leave some residue behind, but it comes off easily with a little Oil of Olay on a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely, no clumps and looks good to me!</li>
    <li> love this product, it worked really great, it does not clump on my eyes like the rest of the mascaras that i&#x27;ve used. you too will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara. It is truly washable, but also fairly waterproof. Color is great. Great value! It does not smudge off during the day yet I can easily get it off with any soap and water.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years but had a hard time finding it the last couple of years. It is waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover cloths. I was glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> I joined hot yoga - I liked it but my mascara did not!  Waterproof mascaras worked well but were so hard to remove even with eye makeup remover.  So I looked for a waterproof washable mascara and found it in \\&quot;Remarkable Cover Girl Waterproof Washable Mascara\\&quot;.  Now my mascara stays on during hot yoga but I can still remove it so easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It applies easily without clumping and leaves the lashes looking full, and dark without looking fake like some of the products on the market.  It never runs or smudges and I have no problem with that even though I swim regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand &amp; kind of mascara for years. It goes on well, looks good &amp; comes off easily. I&#x27;ve been trying different types of mascara lately &amp; none are as good. Like they say if it works don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; to this mascara at all.  It started running the second I put it on and within 5 minutes had come off and gathered black goo into the corner of my eyes. Why is it so hard to find anything BUT BLACK in waterproof mascara? I still miss the old Marathon Mascara!</li>
