      <li>I t feels like I just got a relaxer its amazing</li>
      <li>this product is my new best friend</li>
      <li>but it might not be ideal for anyone who wants to have iron-created curls.</li>
      <li>I tried this 3 days ago and so far I am impressed, I used it as directed</li>
      <li>If you havenatural hair and want it to be more manageable you might want to consider giving this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
      <li>but i did not want anything that i had to blow out and straighten over and over again causing more damage</li>
      <li>Therefore, this product is great if you want to keep your hair bone straight</li>
      <li>and my hair is getting better.</li>
      <li>so there can be more body.</li>
      <li>i just want a smoother twist or braid out that blended better with the texlax hair that i was growing out</li>
      <li>Many expressed concern because of the heat usage</li>
      <li>I was really pleased.  </li>
      <li>I used a heat protectant just to be on the safe side then wrapped it.  </li>
      <li>The straightest I&#x27;ve been able to get my hair, since giving up the relaxer.</li>
      <li>This was pretty good to use.  </li>
      <li>This product has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Because my hair is chemical FREE I did need to make 2 adjustments to the directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Only thing I notice is a lot of fly always....</li>
      <li>it made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I never used a product that kept me looking great all night long!  </li>
      <li>And the price is right!</li>
      <li>This stuff works great on unprocessed hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product because really help me with my hair.</li>
      <li>but there was a huge difference on their new growth and because of the results they got with their new growth they felt that the product would have better and more noticeable results on chemical free/natural hair.......</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner works so well that I can do a good blow dry and press the edges</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using the product it made my tightly curled hair look like it had what is referred to as a soft-press which I have NEVER been able to achieve!!</li>
      <li>My hair looks like I have a fresh relaxer.</li>
      <li>ironed it--because my hair is chemical free it is more resistant and as such I assumed I might need to apply addition</li>
      <li>i have tried the beautiful textures straightening system and it was ok but after working out it reverted back in less than a week</li>
      <li>I stopped using it right away</li>
      <li>and I used this on my combination hair (4 in of new growth ) and this product made it really easy to blow-dry and style my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dark &amp; Lovely perms, shampoos, and conditioners for many years.</li>
      <li>Thanks for getting it right!</li>
      <li>And this product allowed me to get my hair very straight.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this when I am in the middle of stretching.</li>
      <li>My hair has so much movement!</li>
      <li>I NEED wax, oils, and silicones in that exact order to keep my hair from reverting AFTER it has been heat processed.  </li>
      <li>I tried this just an hour ago and it did exactly what it said it would do....</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>mixed ANOTHER quarter-size amount of product in a 4oz spray bottle filled with warm water and then spritzed the mix on each section of hair as I flat</li>
      <li>When I flat iron my hair, I usually do more of a curl</li>
      <li>but  my hair got pretty straight except for my curly ends and</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>, I love when companies come out with GOOD products that actually help black hair instead of just putting something out without showing actual results.</li>
      <li>I am now waiting to see if the product wears off like it&#x27;s suppose to, which if it doesn&#x27;t I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
      <li>and i did use the whole system for that kit.  </li>
      <li>I used this product by itself without using the whole system.  </li>
      <li>After wrapping my hair, my hair was just straight and will not hold a curl.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample and just tried it last night.  </li>
      <li>, regardless I plan on making this a part of my regular regimen when I want frizz free bouncy hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s leave my hair very manageable</li>
      <li>My hair was smooth and shiny and my new growth was soft and manageable, I would definitely be purchasing the full size product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because my new hair stylist used it in my hair and it came out so amazingly soft and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I followed package instructions which are simply wash and condition hair, then apply a quarter size amount (it smells really good), blow dry, then flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Really loosens the natural curl pattern of hair.</li>
      <li>While it made my hair beautiful, shinny and managable, after 3-4 uses I noticed my hair was starting to thin and break.  </li>
      <li>but it was for a little less I would still be happy.</li>
      <li>i am transitioning out of a relaxer right now and june will make it a year since my last relaxer</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so new, there is no picture of it yet.</li>
      <li>and I felt like a new women...</li>
      <li>so I had quite a bit of new growth.  </li>
      <li>my hair still looks brand new.....</li>
      <li>A mists or two of shine spray made it have a natural looking sheen!</li>
      <li>The Hot blow drying is KEY to keeping the kinks out.&lt;br /&gt;Fights</li>
      <li>i put it on my natural roots and stretched with little effort with a blow dryer leaving the roots a bit damp for a nice looking twist out</li>
      <li>My new growth came straight again and it hepled with daily frizz as well.</li>
      <li>Just be careful, I have coarse 2 and 3 type hair, that becomes very fine when flat ironed.  </li>
      <li>So far its been a week since i used it</li>
      <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.</li>
      <li>and it stays straight for 2 weeks, even with occasional sweating.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair.  </li>
      <li>have been touching it up with the flat iron LESS often, and I can now use a lower setting to touch it up!  </li>
      <li>I hot combed my hair (to detangle it) and flat ironed it to complete the look and the results were simply</li>
      <li>and it laid my 2 1/2 inches worth of ng down.</li>
      <li>It was the only new thing I had used in ages....</li>
      <li>&quot; The recent addition of this product makes the product line complete!</li>
      <li>Personally I don&#x27;t see how chemically treated hair can revert, but I do know that natural afro hair does revert.  </li>
      <li>Natural hair for me is not a personal option, but I have been struggling with what to do with my relaxed hair after working out.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money if you have thick new growth like I do.</li>
      <li>on this 4B natural hair that likes to flat iron.</li>

    <li> I workout just about every day. Natural hair for me is not a personal option, but I have been struggling with what to do with my relaxed hair after working out. I tried this 3 days ago and so far I am impressed, I used it as directed and though I don&#x27;t usually blow dry my hair I wanted to give the product every chance to work. I am not sure if it will help my relaxer for 6 weeks but at this point I am willing to work with each week as they come.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your time.it didnt work for me. my hair was hard and a mess. not worth it at all.I am soooo not happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on unprocessed hair. Really loosens the natural curl pattern of hair. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because there is not much difference in my hair that was already relaxed. Good purchase if you are transitioning.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product four stars versus five is because it worked TOO well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and conditioned my hair and worked the serum from root to tip of my wet hair. I then blow dried and flat ironed my hair as usual. I have not gotten a relaxer in 6 weeks. When I flat iron my hair, I usually do more of a curl so there can be more body. The second I went outside however, my curls grew limp - this has never happened. I thought my hair would then frizz but they did not. After wrapping my hair, my hair was just straight and will not hold a curl. Therefore, this product is great if you want to keep your hair bone straight but it might not be ideal for anyone who wants to have iron-created curls. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> I am in the middle of transitioning  from  a perm and I used this on my combination hair (4 in of new growth ) and this product made it really easy to blow-dry and style my hair.  I look like I have a perm.  I am not sure how my curls will look after my first wash but if they bounce back I will be stocking up on this item.</li>
    <li> I am a sceptic....but I tried it and I love it!  I am hooked....my hair holds up under all my dancing.  I never used a product that kept me looking great all night long!  Thanks for getting it right!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my new hair stylist used it in my hair and it came out so amazingly soft and full of body.  It&#x27;s almost been a year since I put a relaxer in my hair and I am debating on if I going to put one back, regardless I plan on making this a part of my regular regimen when I want frizz free bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product even though I am a natural hair sister, sorta scary that this product cannot be applied to dry hair. Strict warnings on that. My hair didn&#x27;t revert immediately but by day 3 it does and slightly w/any shower you take. So frustrating another half used bottle of product :( ....but I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;*Hot Tip**3/26/14 I just picked up Herbal Essence Cocuai no frizz cream (not serum), it&#x27;s so new, there is no picture of it yet. And THAT product works!! Hair stayed sleek and smooth even in the rain!!! on this 4B natural hair that likes to flat iron.</li>
    <li> although i do not damage MY hair with nasty filthy perms or colors i just wanted something to stop the humidity and the poof effect my hair gives when i am in the water or around heat or any other type of steam - it works in the sun when you have your hair flat ironed but bends the straightened hair when you go to sleep but this product is good over all</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on TV and ordered it.  While it made my hair beautiful, shinny and managable, after 3-4 uses I noticed my hair was starting to thin and break.  It was the only new thing I had used in ages.... I stopped using it right away and my hair is getting better.</li>
    <li> I agree with Beverly.  This product had my hair straight as if I had a relaxer, but the downfall is that is kept my hair shedding like crazy.  I just stick to the shampoo and conditioner, same results, no shedding.  I used this product by itself without using the whole system.  Just be careful, I have coarse 2 and 3 type hair, that becomes very fine when flat ironed.  The shampoo and conditioner works so well that I can do a good blow dry and press the edges and it stays straight for 2 weeks, even with occasional sweating.</li>
    <li> I am 12 weeks post relaxer and I used this product and it laid my 2 1/2 inches worth of ng down. it looked as if I just had a relaxer and I felt like a new women... this product will forever be a staple product... this product remindes me of Christmas.. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very, very effective. It works. It does exactly what it says. I have not relaxed my hair in nine months. And this product allowed me to get my hair very straight. The straightest I&#x27;ve been able to get my hair, since giving up the relaxer. My hair looks like I have a fresh relaxer. Just follow the directions on the box. When flat ironing, use the chase method. I used an additional oil based heat protectant as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> Caucasian woman with thick coarse hair here!!!!!  Decided to try this product with my flat iron.  I mist say three days in and my hair is staying very straight!!!!!  Only thing I notice is a lot of fly always....nothing a little hair wax can not fix...</li>
    <li> The product was excellent.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The reviews I found on this product were mixed some loved it and some hated it, so i was unsure of how it would work.  I received a free sample and just tried it last night.  I have relaxed hair that was last relaxed and colored in September so I had quite a bit of new growth.  I followed package instructions which are simply wash and condition hair, then apply a quarter size amount (it smells really good), blow dry, then flat iron.  I used a heat protectant just to be on the safe side then wrapped it.  I was really pleased.  Many expressed concern because of the heat usage but I didn&#x27;t mind because it was only that once. My hair was smooth and shiny and my new growth was soft and manageable, I would definitely be purchasing the full size product.  Hopefully it will keep my hair in this condition for 6 weeks but it was for a little less I would still be happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product because really help me with my hair. It&#x27;s leave my hair very manageable</li>
    <li> I just bought this today from Target for like 8.99 because I discovered it when it was promoted on twitter. I decided to look at reviews for it and ALOT of people seemed to like it and said it worked for them. I tried this just an hour ago and it did exactly what it said it would do....REVERSED. I t feels like I just got a relaxer its amazing, I love when companies come out with GOOD products that actually help black hair instead of just putting something out without showing actual results. It is worth the money if you have thick new growth like I do. It also will help if you are trying to stretch your relaxer which I always encourage people to do. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this when I am in the middle of stretching.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;i used it a week ago after having my hair relaxed two weeks ago, and it made my hair looked great it even made flat ironing a breeze. My new growth came straight again and it hepled with daily frizz as well. So far its been a week since i used it n my hair still looks brand new..... this product is my new best friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dark &amp; Lovely perms, shampoos, and conditioners for many years. Even though I am always pleased with the results, I always hate it when my hair starts to \\&quot;go back.\\&quot; The recent addition of this product makes the product line complete! This leave-in serum works like a charm. If you perm your hair, this is a MUST! And the price is right!</li>
    <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. Since my hair was cut into a short cut, sometimes I can&#x27;t pull together style that will work well while out, I use this product.  I wash, apply, blow-dry, flat-iron, and I&#x27;m back to straight&amp;#34;er&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t plan to use this long term as I am transitioning but it works for the occasional days.</li>
    <li> i am transitioning out of a relaxer right now and june will make it a year since my last relaxer i have tried the beautiful textures straightening system and it was ok but after working out it reverted back in less than a week and i did use the whole system for that kit.  but i did not want anything that i had to blow out and straighten over and over again causing more damage i just want a smoother twist or braid out that blended better with the texlax hair that i was growing out and this product did a wonderful job it smells good and it has tons of slip.  i put it on my natural roots and stretched with little effort with a blow dryer leaving the roots a bit damp for a nice looking twist out i will be using this product again.  it also a great detangler if you just want to use for that.  I am mixed with my texture for now similar to a 3b. you can also use the anti reversion beautiful texture shampoo with this product it works great.</li>
    <li> Even though the product says it is for relaxed hair I decided to try it because of the claim that it PREVENTS REVERSION.  Personally I don&#x27;t see how chemically treated hair can revert, but I do know that natural afro hair does revert.  Because my hair is chemical FREE I did need to make 2 adjustments to the directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the required quarter-size amount of product with some cream hair dress and then rubbed it through my damp hair--the product requires the use of a blow dryer and using a blow dryer over dries my hair, so I added a cream hair dress to help prevent my hair from over drying during the blow drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed ANOTHER quarter-size amount of product in a 4oz spray bottle filled with warm water and then spritzed the mix on each section of hair as I flat ironed it--because my hair is chemical free it is more resistant and as such I assumed I might need to apply addition product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product it made my tightly curled hair look like it had what is referred to as a soft-press which I have NEVER been able to achieve!! I NEED wax, oils, and silicones in that exact order to keep my hair from reverting AFTER it has been heat processed.  To give the product a fair chance at working I did NOT use any wax, oils, or silicones when I hot combed my hair (to detangle it) and flat ironed it to complete the look and the results were simply AMAZING!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was softer than usual and very silky!  A mists or two of shine spray made it have a natural looking sheen! I can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair and best of all no greasy hands from touching my hair! It has been raining here all week and my hair is still holding the soft-press look! WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been touching it up with the flat iron LESS often, and I can now use a lower setting to touch it up!  I am now waiting to see if the product wears off like it&#x27;s suppose to, which if it doesn&#x27;t I really don&#x27;t mind given the results I got! If you havenatural hair and want it to be more manageable you might want to consider giving this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I am still keeping tabs on this product and have since read reviews posted elsewhere online where reviewers who have chemically treated hair stated that there was no notable difference on the chemical treated portion of their hair but there was a huge difference on their new growth and because of the results they got with their new growth they felt that the product would have better and more noticeable results on chemical free/natural hair.......</li>
    <li> I have been one to experience lots of breakage while stretching my Relaxers. I usually stretch to about 10 weeks. Around this time its hard to detangle and I would have to resort to co-washing every day. This product has made a huge difference. After shampooing, applying a protein and deep conditioner, I applied this product, focusing on my newgrowth. I blew it dry and flat ironed small sections. My hair has so much movement! it made my hair smooth and silky. I will be forever using this product. I will work on making my stretches longer now that I have this!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair.  4c.  This was pretty good to use.  I have 4c hair so my expectations for stright hair may have been misguided, plus I&#x27;m not good with flat rins.  but  my hair got pretty straight except for my curly ends and m,y hair felt so silky.</li>
    <li> Good Job !  This Product is great if you follow instruction . The Hot blow drying is KEY to keeping the kinks out.&lt;br /&gt;Fights the humid air and does extend the life of  your relaxer .You  must apply this product on wet hair so it&#x27;s not practical for every day use for us Sisters.</li>
