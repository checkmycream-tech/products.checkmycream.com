### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>lid - PERFECT.  </li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>I saw this product on Dr. Oz and was told it was wonderful.</li>
      <li>but so far..it&#x27;s the best temporary solution I have found....</li>
      <li>This an excellent cosmetic product which delivers what is promises to do - to make the under eye wrinkles disappear immediately.  </li>
      <li>For the price, its a great find, in my opinion ~ and I&#x27;m 58 and have had compliments&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
      <li>Well after reading the reviews I thought this would be a great product to try.</li>
      <li>If you use it alone, you will look ashy, but it blends great with foundation.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy to find it on my favorite site,Amazon.</li>
      <li>If it sounds too good to be true,it probably is.</li>
      <li>This product was not as good as the Avon product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it has any good reviews at all.</li>
      <li>good, good, good, good.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>

      <li>Absolutely the best product on the market can see the results immediately!</li>
      <li>Believe me, I wouldn&#x27;t say it if it wasn&#x27;t true!!</li>
      <li>One had used it before and loved it, the other had never used it and was impressed after she did.</li>
      <li>any residue just dot with water or moisturizer NO rubbing nice easy sweep motion.</li>
      <li>and I thought OK I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to be able to order it online.</li>
      <li>hope holder 12 hours will be more better</li>
      <li>This product is second best.</li>
      <li>It has a glue-like quality that dries the skin, which is why the directions say not to put any concealer or anything at all on top.</li>
      <li>Still looking to see if we can find something better.</li>
      <li>I do love the product.</li>
      <li>Have used this product before and liked it very much.</li>
      <li>Worked great as long as there was nothing liquid on top of it.</li>
      <li>I think it would be great for younger people who don&#x27;t have fine lines yet (25-40 age range).</li>
      <li>It was recommended on Dr. Oz show by someone who does eyelift surgeries as a cheap alternative.  </li>
      <li>I put it on then carefully smooth it out with my finger</li>
      <li>B/c when i need to use this stuff, I REALLY need to use it! :)</li>
      <li>then u originally had...</li>
      <li>this product is a Godsend if you want a quick but temporary lift.  </li>
      <li>Two drops under each eye and quickly spread from bridge of nose to temple</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed a burning and tightening sensation around my eyes and quickly washed it off.  </li>
      <li>Lasts a full 8hrs and is worth every penny I spend on it</li>
      <li>It very affordable &amp; easy to use.</li>
      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I have been using sudden change for many years and wouldn&#x27;t do without it.&lt;br /&gt;Morning puffiness and bags dissapear.</li>
      <li>I saw this item on the Rachel Rae show and thought it was exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>If they can make this work there is obviously a way to make a product that works but in my opinion,there are too many manufacturers to keep something that works off  the market.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>If this serum did the trick it would be on the first page of the ENQUIRER as National Headline.  </li>
      <li>you have dry skin, you will not be able to use this product over lotion and the result, for me was awful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use moisturizer so it is a very drying product.</li>
      <li>It does take some practice putting it on to avoid residue and drying too fast.  </li>
      <li>OMG I can&#x27;t believe how well this product REALLY works.</li>
      <li>I saw it on Dr. Oz and thought it was cheap enough to try it.</li>
      <li>Though it has been around for decades, people really seem   to be rediscovering it.  </li>
      <li>It Really works.</li>
      <li>It made me feel so much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product makes much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>Which defeats the whole purpose.  </li>
      <li>I have lots of allergy issues and wake up every morning with very puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>I think this product does REALLY well in reducing puffiness under the eyes...</li>
      <li>it does leave crystals, but i&#x27;ve noticed that if i put it on over my makeup and don&#x27;t touch it, you can&#x27;t really see it...</li>
      <li>I discovered it on Dr. Oz who I absolutely adore</li>
      <li>I think the trick is to stay very still until it dries....</li>
      <li>It really works for me</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t put too much on...and keep it with yu if you go out</li>
      <li>too much money out there pouring out desparate money to try all of them..</li>
      <li>If i start to rub it, then it becomes really noticeable or if I put it on under my make-up.  </li>
      <li>By the time I have finished my routine and get ready to put on my make-up</li>
      <li>This easy to use product applied under eyes erases bags and wrinkles in a matter of seconds giving me a day long youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>I had passed by this on the shelf so many times thinking that it cost too LESS to work should have tried it years ago saving money and getting the job done.</li>
      <li>While it certainly made an impact, and I loved the tightness around the eyes I never got past the white residue that looked like I used egg whites on my eyes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything for my under eye bags and this was so highly recommended</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product,and the amazon shop who supplied it.</li>
      <li>I did not notice a significant difference when I did use it, to make it worth the trouble?</li>
      <li>package says 2 drops..may have used a few more...</li>
      <li>I used it several times, but then there are more days when I don&#x27;t feel that I have time for an extra step in my makeup routine before heading out for a busy day.  </li>
      <li>My left eye doesn&#x27;t cover as well as my right eye.</li>
      <li>It took me a few tries to get it just right, but it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love this product, just use a little bit and those wicked nights disappear from under your eyes!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since it first came out,and i am undone when i can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
      <li>it certainly tightens as promised, but it leaves kind of a cellaphane-like film behind that accentuates and actually even CREATES little fine lines.</li>
      <li>After about an hour your skin isn&#x27;t tight any more but your under eye bags are back!.</li>
      <li>Thought I would really like this.......it actually helped with the puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Nothing new...use too much it leaves a white film.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
      <li>I would have purchased this directly at the store</li>
      <li>This is an old review...no longer use the product</li>
      <li>If your applications turns white, you used too much.  </li>
      <li>However, as some of the other reviews mentioned, after it drys on your skin, and you smile or move that area of your face</li>
      <li>I tried the serum several different times to be sure I&#x27;d followed the directions, and it did not help dark circles at all.</li>
      <li>I look so much more refreshed and at least 10 years younger!</li>
      <li>But later in the day I noticed a white residue around my eyes and it was very crusty.  </li>
      <li>I bought another more expensive one in the past (one that is advertised on shopping channels) and this is so much better and cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Only used this product once so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same old stuff they have had around for years.  </li>
      <li>If not totally gone, they are markedly diminished.  </li>
      <li>I did not find there was much difference other than that.</li>
      <li>Maybe others are happy with it for temporary relief of puffiness who don&#x27;t mind the look of wrinkles, but I have enough wrinkles already. :(</li>
      <li>Let it dry completely</li>

<li> If you find it beginning not to work so well after several hours, it can be renewed by a very, very little bit of water applied over it; too much water</li>
<li> This is a miracle at reducing puffiness as long as you nave a life where you don&#x27;t have to move, I mean like Play Dead, for More than 3 minutes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Long night? Got allergies? No one will ever know. Lasts a full 8hrs and is worth every penny I spend on it (I buy one every month)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out,and i am undone when i can&#x27;t find it locally.I was very happy to find it on my favorite site,Amazon.This serum makes my eyes look great,and i get a lot of compliments about them...even at 68,i am vain enough to care about my appearance.I highly recommend the product,and the amazon shop who supplied it.</li>
    <li> this product is a Godsend if you want a quick but temporary lift.  It tightens up those lines and bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Though it has been around for decades, people really seem   to be rediscovering it.  It works great!  Eapecilly if you  have had a bad day due to sinus conditions, crying, etc.   Glad to see it is still around!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz and was told it was wonderful. I used it for aa week and the only change i saw was extreme dryness under my eyees.</li>
    <li> I saw this item on the Rachel Rae show and thought it was exactly what I needed however I am very disappointed. When you put it on it makes your skin really tight and leaves a white residue. After about an hour your skin isn&#x27;t tight any more but your under eye bags are back!.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me for dark circles.  It may work for under-eye bags, but that is not why I bought it.  It has a glue-like quality that dries the skin, which is why the directions say not to put any concealer or anything at all on top. I tried the serum several different times to be sure I&#x27;d followed the directions, and it did not help dark circles at all.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says on the bottle.  I bought another more expensive one in the past (one that is advertised on shopping channels) and this is so much better and cheaper.  Well worth the money.  This one is easier to use with makeup too.</li>
    <li> OMG I can&#x27;t believe how well this product REALLY works. I saw it on a TV show a few weeks ago and I thought OK I&#x27;ll try it. It Really works. I look so much more refreshed and at least 10 years younger! The bags are GONE!</li>
    <li> I have under-eye bags, which are hereditary.  Surgery is not an option.  After I saw the review for Sudden Change Under-eye Firm Serum, I decided to try it.  I followed the instructions, and it DID make a difference in my \\&quot;under-eye bags\\&quot;.  If not totally gone, they are markedly diminished.  I like the product and would recommend it to others.  The price was mimimal for the change in appearance!  I only wish the results were permanent.</li>
    <li> I follow the instruction to the letter but it did not work for me.I would not buy this product again.No miracles !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift and to this day she still hasn&#x27;t seen an improvement in her bags. The first few times she used it, we both thought it would maybe take a few days to work. But it&#x27;s now a month later...and not much difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried it under one eye to compare and I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years.  I use it when I have puffy lower eyelids due to allergies.  A little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t over apply because it will leave a residue on the lids. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have seen no change. I don&#x27;t think that this product does anymore than slices of cucumber. Definitly nothing \\&quot;sudden\\&quot; about it.</li>
    <li> I have spent plenty of money on trying to reduce the bags under my eyes to no avail until I tried this product. I had passed by this on the shelf so many times thinking that it cost too LESS to work should have tried it years ago saving money and getting the job done. Absolutely the best product on the market can see the results immediately! It does take some practice putting it on to avoid residue and drying too fast.  Two drops under each eye and quickly spread from bridge of nose to temple one time remainder sweep across your eye lid - PERFECT.  Let it dry completely (3 minutes) any residue just dot with water or moisturizer NO rubbing nice easy sweep motion.</li>
    <li> I think this product does REALLY well in reducing puffiness under the eyes... it certainly tightens as promised, but it leaves kind of a cellaphane-like film behind that accentuates and actually even CREATES little fine lines. I think it would be great for younger people who don&#x27;t have fine lines yet (25-40 age range).</li>
    <li> This product is not for someone in their 40&#x27;s trying to have younger looking eyes. It gave a \\&quot;sudden change\\&quot; of my eyes as promised, but in tightening the skin, it produced the look of more wrinkles that froze in place with the glue-like substance. :(  It was recommended on Dr. Oz show by someone who does eyelift surgeries as a cheap alternative.  Maybe others are happy with it for temporary relief of puffiness who don&#x27;t mind the look of wrinkles, but I have enough wrinkles already. :(</li>
    <li> The item put a film under my eyes and there was no change at all.If it sounds too good to be true,it probably is. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I do love the product. It stated that I would have this in 3 days. It took weeks to get this. I would have purchased this directly at the store had I known it was going to take this long.</li>
    <li> This product was like putting crazy glue under your eyes. I used it once and would never use it again!</li>
    <li> I call this my miracle product.  I like it so well I got both of my daughters a bottle.  One had used it before and loved it, the other had never used it and was impressed after she did.</li>
    <li> I have been using sudden change for many years and wouldn&#x27;t do without it.&lt;br /&gt;Morning puffiness and bags dissapear. I put it on then carefully smooth it out with my finger so there is not a lot of excess . Within minutes the bags and puffiness are gone.</li>
    <li> I saw it on Dr. Oz and thought it was cheap enough to try it. Believe me, I wouldn&#x27;t say it if it wasn&#x27;t true!! I would never even&lt;br /&gt;waste my time. It works!! It really works!! You can feel the stuff helping wrinkles and puffy eyes. It made me feel so much younger.&lt;br /&gt;Try it! You waste that much at WalMart when you go.... This isn&#x27;t a waste</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. You can&#x27;t use moisturizer so it is a very drying product. I do not recommend it.[[ASIN:B000NSTX20 Sudden Change Under-Eye Firming Serum .23 oz (7 ml)]]</li>
    <li> This is an old review...no longer use the product</li>
    <li> If this serum did the trick it would be on the first page of the ENQUIRER as National Headline.  It don&#x27;t work folks.  I&#x27;ve tried everything for my under eye bags and this was so highly recommended I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Well, I did it and GIRLS, it didn&#x27;t. I discovered it on Dr. Oz who I absolutely adore but this time the Doc was incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money folks.</li>
    <li> This product not only leaves a flaky residue, but amplifies wrinkles.  Also, you can not return it if the container has been used.</li>
    <li> This an excellent cosmetic product which delivers what is promises to do - to make the under eye wrinkles disappear immediately.  It very affordable &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a white film and feels like crazy glue. I used it once, and sent it back to the manufacture. There is a money back guarantee - I am still waiting for the money back.</li>
    <li> It tightened up my under eye pretty much, but left residue behind and my dark circles.  The residue was very noticeable and made my eyes look worse.  My husband asked me what I had all over my eyes. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have used the .23 size for years.  It does not work for dark circles, and does not claim to.  If your applications turns white, you used too much.  If you find it beginning not to work so well after several hours, it can be renewed by a very, very little bit of water applied over it; too much water and it will go white.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz so got it at Walmart. This cream left a nasty white residue that looks like dry glue under the eyes. I don&#x27;t understand how it has any good reviews at all.</li>
    <li> Well after reading the reviews I thought this would be a great product to try. While it certainly made an impact, and I loved the tightness around the eyes I never got past the white residue that looked like I used egg whites on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, you will not be able to use this product over lotion and the result, for me was awful.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have oily skin? Not sure how this would work but not happy with the crusty look it left.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It instantly tightens under your eye.  it does leave crystals, but i&#x27;ve noticed that if i put it on over my makeup and don&#x27;t touch it, you can&#x27;t really see it... If i start to rub it, then it becomes really noticeable or if I put it on under my make-up.  As long as you pay attention to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal.  In my mind, it&#x27;s a trade off that I&#x27;ll take.  B/c when i need to use this stuff, I REALLY need to use it! :)</li>
    <li> This easy to use product applied under eyes erases bags and wrinkles in a matter of seconds giving me a day long youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> I put this product on yesterday just like the directions said.  I immediately noticed a burning and tightening sensation around my eyes and quickly washed it off.  24 hours later, the skin under my eyes is still red and burning and swollen.  There is something in this product that is very harsh, and I would not reocommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> good, good, good, good. I used it immediately effect. But just holder three hours. hope holder 12 hours will be more better</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. I believe it is just egg whites. It does not work with other eye products and leaves a white film.</li>
    <li> Thought I would really like this.......it actually helped with the puffiness under my eyes.  But later in the day I noticed a white residue around my eyes and it was very crusty.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same old stuff they have had around for years.  Nothing new...use too much it leaves a white film.</li>
    <li> Worked great as long as there was nothing liquid on top of it. Feels a lot like egg white and as soon as I put make up over it, the result was gone.</li>
    <li> This product was not as good as the Avon product but they discontinued it. This product is second best. It does not get rid of all the swelling. I am Considering ordering it again when needed. Still looking to see if we can find something better.</li>
    <li> I have hardly used this.  The directions say you can&#x27;t use it with any creams.  I always put skin cream and moisturizers on before applying my makeup. This stuff will nor work with creams and make up.  It makes it difficult to use.  I did not notice a significant difference when I did use it, to make it worth the trouble?</li>
    <li> I have lots of allergy issues and wake up every morning with very puffy eyes.  My morning routine starts with facial cleansing, administering allergy eye drops, then applying this.  By the time I have finished my routine and get ready to put on my make-up it has &amp;#34;done it&#x27;s thing&amp;#34;.  I just wipe of the dried excess and make-up goes on with no problems.  I even bought a purse size to take with me to use as the day progresses and my eyes sometimes get puffy again.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle at reducing puffiness as long as you nave a life where you don&#x27;t have to move, I mean like Play Dead, for More than 3 minutes.  Then it turns into this crusty crap and you can&#x27;t put moistureizer on it or it comes off and looks like you are allergic to it.  If they can make this work there is obviously a way to make a product that works but in my opinion,there are too many manufacturers to keep something that works off  the market.  too much money out there pouring out desparate money to try all of them..</li>
    <li> I works but it leaves an unattractive residue around the eyes after it dries. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Saw this mentioned on Dr Oz, and ordered it. I like it ~ and it does give you an instant&lt;br /&gt;tightness under the eye, a mini-lift, and when it dries, you can apply face moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;after.  For the price, its a great find, in my opinion ~ and I&#x27;m 58 and have had compliments&lt;br /&gt;on it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you use it alone, you will look ashy, but it blends great with foundation.  You only have to apply it once and it last for hours.  It took me a few tries to get it just right, but it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Only used this product once so far. Can not comment yet. Hopefully will make my slight crows feet around my eyes  look less pronounced. Time will tell whether I purchase this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and liked it very much. I was so glad to be able to order it online.</li>
    <li> this definetly removes the puffiness from under your eyes....immediately.  However, when it dries it is visible on your skin.  it looks white and flakely.  And it feels weird. it feels like a dry film. I tried mixing it with concealer as it suggests, but it&#x27;s still very obvious and dries white and flakey.  My boyfriend asked what was under my eyes.  but, after the puffiness disapated, i tried wiping it off and my eyes seemed to remain &#x27;less puffy.&#x27;</li>
    <li> However, as some of the other reviews mentioned, after it drys on your skin, and you smile or move that area of your face it does crack and look white and flaky.  For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product makes much of a difference.  I used it several times, but then there are more days when I don&#x27;t feel that I have time for an extra step in my makeup routine before heading out for a busy day.  And I don&#x27;t think I look any different on the days I use it versus the days that I just hurriedly put on the rest of my makeup!</li>
    <li> Dr. Anthony Yun, nationally known plastic surgeon recommended this on Rachel Ray show. Amazing results. Lift/reduces puffiness within 3 minutes. Just difficult to use if you need concealor also.</li>
    <li> This product does work. I purchased it for my wedding and I looked amazing. No bags underneath the eyes at all!</li>
    <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t think this was going to work; because of the reviews. It really works for me and I look about 5 years younger. I put a little on my forhead and it looks like I botox it, but I can move my face For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> My left eye doesn&#x27;t cover as well as my right eye. Tried both ways with liquid make up and just plain</li>
    <li> PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I SAW IT ON DR. OZ.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT DRYS WHITE AND FLAKY ON AFRICAN AMERICAN SKIN OR ANY PERSON OF COLOR.  COME ON, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE MAKING THE PRODUCT WOULD HAVE MADE ALLOWANCES FOR DARKER PIGMENT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.  I guess it \\&quot;firms\\&quot; your undereye area, but only because it coats it with this horrible film that doesn&#x27;t move.  It leaves a ugly residue that won&#x27;t come off until you wash it off.  Which defeats the whole purpose.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all, infact the opposite.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t see a change....your doing something wrong.  I have the worst bags ever...and have spent way too much money trying different eye creams and serum&#x27;s.  The last one I purchased cost me $32.00 @ CVS...Purchased this one today for $13.00 and was amazed at the INSTANT results....You have to play with it....package says 2 drops..may have used a few more...but I could not believe the immediate result.  OK..now for the cons.....does not last very long..if applied incorrectly it can leave u with worse wrinkles then u originally had...but u can rinse it off with water...and try again.  Took me a few times..but I used it tonite to attend a party....and felt 10 yrs younger.  I think the trick is to stay very still until it dries....don&#x27;t put too much on...and keep it with yu if you go out so u can reapply later if need be.....It&#x27;s not a permanent fix...but so far..it&#x27;s the best temporary solution I have found....Will be stocking up on it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, just use a little bit and those wicked nights disappear from under your eyes! Recommend it to all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement in the eye area..  Although it felt like I had glue on my face, it did not actually tighten the face.</li>
    <li> Put this stuff on and within minutes you get white, flaky powder under your eyes. I think it is a totally worthless product, since you have to remove the white powder - and in doing so, you remove the serum.</li>
    <li> I wore this mixed with my liquid foundation and went to a party. I danced and got a little sweaty-and my face felt slimy! Yuck! I did not find there was much difference other than that.</li>
