      <li>It worked better than anything else!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as effective as anything I&#x27;ve ever used and with no skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It smells better than the body powder and seems to work better at preventing irritation.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad Amazon sells it in bulk.</li>
      <li>It is even cheaper, I buy three or four at a time and it lasts for a year or more.</li>
      <li>Definitely pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>if you can find a &#x27;powder puff&#x27; to apply it, it works much better.</li>
      <li>Love this powder.</li>
      <li>so I was glad to find it here and in quantity too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands, but this is the very BEST!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>but more like 6 - 8 months.  </li>
      <li>Strongly recommend for any age.</li>
      <li>For those days when you may get a little chaffing between you thighs, Perfect.</li>
      <li>It was fabulous.</li>
      <li>I have also used it on my 90 year old grandpa with great success.</li>
      <li>Best powder ever for little bottoms!  </li>
      <li>I really like it and am glad that it is available from Amazon.</li>
      <li>My favorite go-to powder for grand babies  bottoms or adult skin rashes.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome and very difficult to find in pharmacy&#x27;s any more.</li>
      <li>I have very large breasts.</li>
      <li>works very well - great product - glad to order on line since sometimes it is not available locally</li>
      <li>Have not been able tofind it in the local chain drug stores</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and anticipated.  </li>
      <li>In summer I reapply it once or twice during hot days.</li>
      <li>This baby powder is what I use for myself during the hot Arizona summers.</li>
      <li>Hard to find on the shelves of local stores - excellent product</li>
      <li>I came across Gold Bond Baby Powder by accident really while looking for SOMETHING that would help with her heat rash in the summer and at night.</li>
      <li>Baby has broken out in heat rashes from barrier cream, so the Gold Bond does a great job of soothing her diaper area.</li>
      <li>, it dries the skin too much if used too often.</li>
      <li>Luckily I was able to find it on Amazon and get a big box of it that should last through potty training and for the next baby too.</li>
      <li>Gold Bond sells a &amp;#34;body powder&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;baby powder.&amp;#34;  Although I am an adult, I much prefer the baby powder.  </li>
      <li>He rarely gets a rash when it is used regularly and helps heal them when he does get them.</li>
      <li>Bought this on a whim when my son was very young but for some reason I never used it until he was over one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that worked to clear up and prevent severe diaper rash for my first baby after spending a fortune on diaper rash products.  </li>
      <li>Her little tushie has never been so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Helped clear up my sons diaper rash.</li>
      <li>It is soft and absorbent, and now my boyfriend has asked to use mine.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find it in the stores near me at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to all forms of antiperspirant and/or deodorant, so-called natural or not.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t a medicinal odor and its soft on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It is soft and silky on your skin--very soothing, comforting, and healing.</li>
      <li>Been using this every day almost every diaper change on my 2.5 year old daughter</li>
      <li>That is odd, but true.  </li>
      <li>After using it for several months, I was able to go every other day without using it and now after two years, I only need to use it occasionally.</li>
      <li>This powder really keeps me dry and prevents irritation.</li>
      <li>No other powders I&#x27;ve tried come close.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I used it simply because I ran out of my sweat killer.  </li>
      <li>My second baby is 14 months old and we have only used Gold Bond Baby Med Powder and she has never had a diaper rash.  </li>
      <li>I found some adult anti fungal powders (even the regular gold bond medicated body powder) that were better, but not perfect.</li>
      <li>This will dry or clear up almost anything.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Until just recently, I used to buy this product at Walmart and constantly saw it in drug stores.  Now it seems to have vanished from brick-and-mortar shelves and buying it online is the only way to get it.  I see that other reviewers have made similar comments.  That is odd, but true.  Gold Bond sells a &amp;#34;body powder&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;baby powder.&amp;#34;  Although I am an adult, I much prefer the baby powder.  It smells better than the body powder and seems to work better at preventing irritation.  Bottom line: I really like it and am glad that it is available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin to the extreme. I came across Gold Bond Baby Powder by accident really while looking for SOMETHING that would help with her heat rash in the summer and at night. Then when the grocery stores stopped carrying it I was very disappointed. Luckily I was able to find it on Amazon and get a big box of it that should last through potty training and for the next baby too.</li>
    <li> The only body powder I use.  It is soft and absorbent, and now my boyfriend has asked to use mine.  So I ordered extra.</li>
    <li> I have very large breasts. So even wearing a bra, there is skin to skin contact between my breasts and chest that alway stays wet. This causes the skin to crack and tear. It is very painful. I have seen two different dermatologists who both said NO powders, that it was caused by a fungus and gave me anti fungal creams. None of them worked. I tried powders, then powders plus anti fungal creams, it was better but very uncomfortable. I found some adult anti fungal powders (even the regular gold bond medicated body powder) that were better, but not perfect. One day I was walking through the baby aisle and saw the gold bond baby powder and on impulse thought to try it. It was fabulous. I saw almost immediate results. After using it for several months, I was able to go every other day without using it and now after two years, I only need to use it occasionally. My store quit carrying it, so online I went! It is even cheaper, I buy three or four at a time and it lasts for a year or more. One note, if you can find a &#x27;powder puff&#x27; to apply it, it works much better. I won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
    <li> My baby loves this stuff. Her little tushie has never been so soft and smooth. Baby has broken out in heat rashes from barrier cream, so the Gold Bond does a great job of soothing her diaper area.</li>
    <li> Best baby powder ever.  Diaper rash is gone after one use.</li>
    <li> I have used this powder for a long time and I use it every day after swimming.  This purchase saved me money and was on time.</li>
    <li> best deal fro you money</li>
    <li> My favorite go-to powder for grand babies  bottoms or adult skin rashes.  This stuff is awesome and very difficult to find in pharmacy&#x27;s any more. There isn&#x27;t a medicinal odor and its soft on the skin.  Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This baby powder is what I use for myself during the hot Arizona summers. It is soft and silky on your skin--very soothing, comforting, and healing. I use it to treat and prevent the chafing and prickly heat rash that comes with the inevitable sweating brought on by our sweltering heat. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands, but this is the very BEST!</li>
    <li> Been using this every day almost every diaper change on my 2.5 year old daughter-a litle sprinkle keeps the rashes away!!! And if your child gets the dreaded diaper rash this works like a charm in conjunction with a diaper cream.</li>
    <li> works very well - great product - glad to order on line since sometimes it is not available locally</li>
    <li> Only product we use to treat and prevent diaper rash. Also works great in shoes. Keeps baby and feet dry.</li>
    <li> This powder is good for adults! For those days when you may get a little chaffing between you thighs, Perfect.</li>
    <li> Best powder ever for little bottoms!  This will dry or clear up almost anything.  Aside from Amazon, this stuff is hard to find, and if you do, not reasonable priced!</li>
    <li> This baby powder is great for diaper rash.  It is about the only product we found that works so well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that worked to clear up and prevent severe diaper rash for my first baby after spending a fortune on diaper rash products.  My second baby is 14 months old and we have only used Gold Bond Baby Med Powder and she has never had a diaper rash.  We can&#x27;t say enough for this powder.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but had problems in locating it at stores.  So I googled it and find out that I could order it online.  Since receiving the product, I have again found the product back at the stores.  We are not talking a month or so but more like 6 - 8 months.  So, I am very pleased that I can order online.  As for the product, it has been wonderful when you have areas on your body that are sheft or a rash.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and anticipated.  Definitely pleased with this product.  I use this myself.  Have to be careful though, it dries the skin too much if used too often.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim when my son was very young but for some reason I never used it until he was over one. I wish I had started using it earlier. He rarely gets a rash when it is used regularly and helps heal them when he does get them. I have also used it on my 90 year old grandpa with great success.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great. Helped clear up my sons diaper rash. Didn&#x27;t realize it was a package of 5 when ordering but very glad it was. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores near me at all.</li>
    <li> Good price and I use it daily so just wish they sold bigger containers of the stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use it daily. Wouldn&#x27;t buy 5 if I didn&#x27;t love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t shy away adults...this does not smell like baby power.</li>
    <li> I find this to be the best powder on the market and I am not a baby.  I have used this for 3 years instead of anti-perspirant.  I was surprised when I used it simply because I ran out of my sweat killer.  I even work out, working up a sweat and still have no underarm perspiration.  This is great for me because the powder has none of the chemicals that an underarm anti-perspirant has.  I use it in the summer as a body powder and it works just as well.  Have not been able tofind it in the local chain drug stores so I was glad to find it here and in quantity too.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. Just wish they made it in a bigger bottle. But haven&#x27;t found it anywhere. I&#x27;m just glad Amazon sells it in bulk.</li>
    <li> Hard to find on the shelves of local stores - excellent product</li>
    <li> This power lasts all day. No other powders I&#x27;ve tried come close. I don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard to find in local stores. RiteAid used to carry it, but no more. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Very good baby powder!! Strongly recommend for any age. Perfect I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to all forms of antiperspirant and/or deodorant, so-called natural or not. They make me break out in a rash or make the skin red and sore. I tried Gold Bond Medicated Baby Powder. It worked better than anything else! In summer I reapply it once or twice during hot days. It&#x27;s as effective as anything I&#x27;ve ever used and with no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This powder really keeps me dry and prevents irritation. I wish it came in a larger size. I would recommend it to anyone who needs powder to prevent wetness or irritation</li>
    <li> After trying several baby powders we gave Gold Bond medicated a try.  It worked so well I ordered this 5 pack.  Very happy grandbabies now!</li>
