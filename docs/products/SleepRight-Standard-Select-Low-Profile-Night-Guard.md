### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Best purchase I have ever made.  </li>
      <li>Excellent solution if you don&#x27;t want to bother with a mold impression for a custom night guard.</li>
      <li>Best night guard for teeth grinding!!</li>
      <li>Amazon advertised the best price.</li>
      <li>This is the best replacement I have found to substitute for what the dentist office wanted to charge me $300 for.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Perfect fit!</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I showed it to my dentist, and he agreed that it is a good fill-in for the $500 guards you get through your dentist.  </li>
      <li>Good alternative</li>
      <li>It is very comfortable and keeps me from grinding my teeth at night!</li>
      <li>Cheap and works GREAT.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The dentist frowned at this saying that his version was better.</li>
      <li>like I did with those jock types of mouth guards that need to be boiled and take up most of your mouth.  </li>
      <li>He also said its better than a sports mouth guard that some people wear for night protection, as it isn&#x27;t as bulky and it has some added pluses.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the sports guards for years and this product is so much better.</li>
      <li>Having never worn a night guard before, I was very happy that I ordered the low profile one.</li>
      <li>If you sleep without ever moving your jaw or head, you MIGHT be able to keep the two pieces clamped between your rear teeth.</li>
      <li>They said that based on the study they would be able to recommend alternatives.  </li>
      <li>very good, beats paying the dentist for a less good one at $400 plus.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking about switching brands but the new design is great.</li>
      <li>I switched from the melt and mold kind to this kind several months ago and LOVE them!  </li>
      <li>Great alternative to the spendy ones the dentist offers.</li>
      <li>It is easily adjusted.  </li>
      <li>, it travels well, it cleans up easily with just a rinse of water in the morning.</li>
      <li>I never had any problems with fit or irritations.  </li>
      <li>It still has the same great adjustment system  </li>
      <li>This guard is the perfect size for my small mouth.  </li>
      <li>but they also changed the price by $5.00 per item from our original order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small, so if you are short-on-space in your mouth anyway, this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>He said it would be most effective to wear for short stints, or just when you think you might grind (stress-related).</li>
      <li>But after talking to several hygienists, They assure me that this is just as good as the $300 version.</li>
      <li>Avoid at all costs, get the full mouth shaped spacers.</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for a year now and love it so much.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>He also said that its a good form, as it actually puts the jaw in a good position for those that have sleep apnea or possibly snore...opens the airways a bit as it trains you to bite a certain way.</li>
      <li>These are much more comfortable and last much longer; well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>On this one, I must have ordered a different model as it&#x27;s more comfortable than the first.  </li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>The mounts slide back and forth and they also swivel for a comfortable semi custom fit.  </li>
      <li>it is better than regular guards.  </li>
      <li>Maybe once a year or more she might have the same pain and out comes the SleepRight</li>
      <li>For the first one, it took me a week or so to become accustomed to holding it in my mouth while sleeping.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to work better for me if I lie on my back and not on my side.</li>
      <li>When we first ordered this item it was advertised as &#x27;IN STOCK&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It was ok and kept me from grinding my teeth; however, it was always on the big side.  </li>
      <li>This is my second purchase and I love my SleepRight.  </li>
      <li>However, I did have a funny feeling that if I wore it too much, the way it puts pressure on just the few teeth that touch the bitepad MIGHT start causing problems of its own - when I took it off</li>
      <li>And the amount of separation was too much for me.  </li>
      <li>Well that did no make much sense</li>
      <li>We almost could not leave the office because the wanted us to sign an agreement where the Doctor would finance the whole transaction with no money</li>
      <li>Works really well.  </li>
      <li>Overall, useful as a psychological tool and good to wear around the house, but be aware that you can&#x27;t really talk or anything without it falling out, and that other people can clearly see that you have a mouthguard in.  </li>
      <li>Maybe appliance would work better on a larger mouth, but I bought the slim-comfort - didn&#x27;t see a smaller one.</li>
      <li>The tiny strip that fits across the lower bottom teeth holds it right in place when positioned according to the directions.</li>
      <li>The new design lasts longer--like that.  </li>
      <li>The band does not stay very well on my lower gum and the whole thing tends to pop out in the middle of the night.</li>
      <li>cons though, both personal and from my dentist (the first two are direct from him): &lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wake up some nights with it completely moved in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I have a small mouth and the adjustable sides enabled me to fit it</li>
      <li>Is better than than ones you buy and mold to your teeth in my opinion but the floating pads are very hard and the band in the front takes getting used to.</li>
      <li>I did once or twice and woke up feeling almost nauseous, because it was going too far back in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I had been wearing a normal size Sleep Right guard for at least a year.  </li>
      <li>My trouble is mostly with daytime clenching, and I did find this product helpful in that regard - mostly because it was so awkward and uncomfortable to wear, it made me more aware of my habits and did help me to at least reduce the amount of clenching and grinding that I unconsciously was doing.  </li>
      <li>He agreed that the mouth guard was 85% responsible, as the leukoplakia was located where the guard came in contact with my cheeks (the other 15% was attributed to daily use of Listerine, as alcohol only intensifies it).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second one, as the front strap broke on my first after only a few months.</li>
      <li>The material that the night guard was made of, was harder than my previous Sleep Right night guards.  </li>

<li> The material that the night guard was made of, was harder than my previous Sleep Right night guards.  </li>
<li> mine was bought this time to be ready for when the existing one needs replacing, usually I get 4-6 months use</li>
<li> I bit completely through it in less than 3 weeks.  </li>
<li> There has to be something wrong with jerking us around for a WHOLE YEAR now also!!!</li>
<li> I had the regular model previously, and even that one moved around.  </li>
<li> The melt and mold ones usually got shredded within a week for me but these last months.  </li>
<li> Did not work at all for me, one side or the other would slip off.</li>
<li> The bite pads are extremely durable.</li>
<li> Bite pads are too soft, and thus might actually promote clenching (merely his opinion, not going off any type of study).</li>
<li> My hard plastic retainer started giving migraines from clinching - found the SleepRight and never looked back.  </li>
<li> The one thing that I didn&#x27;t understand when I ordered it, was that this product is not made to bite down on, but to separate your teeth so that it re-trains your muscles to hold your jaw in the correct positon while you&#x27;re sleeping so that you don&#x27;t feel the need to clench at all.</li>
<li> My dentists have always told me I have a small mouth, but I think maybe I need to get the regular size instead of the small profile and this might help my problem.</li>
<li> I was afraid that it would keep me awake at night, but once I figured out the correct settings and placement, it was like wearing contacts; you don&#x27;t really notice it if you don&#x27;t think about it.</li>
<li> I have had trouble keeping the strap in place at night, it tends to slip up on one side.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made in the USA and costs about $675 less than the ones that you get through the dentists office!</li>
<li> I have a small mouth</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I would want to sleep with it in.  </li>
<li> The strap that connects the 2 back pieces that separate the upper and lower teeth was uncomfortable and impossible to ignore.  </li>
<li> The thin plastic strip that holds the two pieces together is sort of like a stiff rubber band.</li>
<li> Doubtful, but it could present a choking hazard.</li>
<li> I swear I was afraid I would accidentally half swallow this thing and choke to death!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult going to sleep without it.</li>
<li> It has kept me from chewing up the inside of my mouth and tongue, and it has stopped that horrible grinding that was causing some of my headaches!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cheap and works GREAT.</li>
    <li> Is better than than ones you buy and mold to your teeth in my opinion but the floating pads are very hard and the band in the front takes getting used to. But it keeps my teeth apart.</li>
    <li> Having never worn a night guard before, I was very happy that I ordered the low profile one. I have a small mouth and the adjustable sides enabled me to fit it just right. The tiny strip that fits across the lower bottom teeth holds it right in place when positioned according to the directions. I was afraid that it would keep me awake at night, but once I figured out the correct settings and placement, it was like wearing contacts; you don&#x27;t really notice it if you don&#x27;t think about it. It does seem to work better for me if I lie on my back and not on my side. The one thing that I didn&#x27;t understand when I ordered it, was that this product is not made to bite down on, but to separate your teeth so that it re-trains your muscles to hold your jaw in the correct positon while you&#x27;re sleeping so that you don&#x27;t feel the need to clench at all. Surprisingly, I only have to wear it a once or twice a month. I have been clenching my teeth ever since I had my braces removed as a teenager. Over the years my subconcious clenching has caused stress cracks in my molars and migraine headaches. Wish I had gotten this 25 years ago.</li>
    <li> When we first ordered this item it was advertised as &#x27;IN STOCK&#x27;. During this time Amazon changed it to &#x27;Wait In Line&#x27; &amp; now &#x27;No Longer Availabe&#x27;. Amazon advertised the best price. However, they back ordered 2 of these items on us about 4 times now. Not only that, but they also changed the price by $5.00 per item from our original order. There has got to be something illegal about advertising an item at a better price than competitors, then changing the price after a back order notice. There has to be something wrong with jerking us around for a WHOLE YEAR now also!!! Never should have ordered &#x27;From Amazon by Amaazon&#x27;!!!</li>
    <li> My trouble is mostly with daytime clenching, and I did find this product helpful in that regard - mostly because it was so awkward and uncomfortable to wear, it made me more aware of my habits and did help me to at least reduce the amount of clenching and grinding that I unconsciously was doing.  However, I did have a funny feeling that if I wore it too much, the way it puts pressure on just the few teeth that touch the bitepad MIGHT start causing problems of its own - when I took it off, I had that sore feeling that one gets when they have braces and their teeth are moving around - which is not something I want my teeth to do.  Overall, useful as a psychological tool and good to wear around the house, but be aware that you can&#x27;t really talk or anything without it falling out, and that other people can clearly see that you have a mouthguard in.  I&#x27;m not sure I would want to sleep with it in.  I did once or twice and woke up feeling almost nauseous, because it was going too far back in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I switched from the melt and mold kind to this kind several months ago and LOVE them!  These are much more comfortable and last much longer; well worth the price!  The melt and mold ones usually got shredded within a week for me but these last months.  I bought one for my dad too and he had the same results.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It does stop clenching and grinding.  It&#x27;s small, so if you are short-on-space in your mouth anyway, this is perfect.  I showed it to my dentist, and he agreed that it is a good fill-in for the $500 guards you get through your dentist.  He also said its better than a sports mouth guard that some people wear for night protection, as it isn&#x27;t as bulky and it has some added pluses.  He also said that its a good form, as it actually puts the jaw in a good position for those that have sleep apnea or possibly snore...opens the airways a bit as it trains you to bite a certain way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some cons though, both personal and from my dentist (the first two are direct from him): &lt;br /&gt;- Over time, it could lead to jaw problems if worn consistantly, month after month.  He said it would be most effective to wear for short stints, or just when you think you might grind (stress-related). &lt;br /&gt;- Bite pads are too soft, and thus might actually promote clenching (merely his opinion, not going off any type of study). &lt;br /&gt;- He also mentioned the design being &#x27;flawed&#x27; a bit, but didn&#x27;t elaborate at all. &lt;br /&gt;- The piece is not durable.  I&#x27;m on my second one, as the front strap broke on my first after only a few months. &lt;br /&gt;- With my use, I got a case of leukoplakia from the guard.  Its defined as white, leathery patches/spots on the inside of the mouth.  However, it gave me and my dentist a scare, because it can be pre-cancerous.  He agreed that the mouth guard was 85% responsible, as the leukoplakia was located where the guard came in contact with my cheeks (the other 15% was attributed to daily use of Listerine, as alcohol only intensifies it). &lt;br /&gt;- I agree with others that there&#x27;s no way to keep this in place.  I had the regular model previously, and even that one moved around.  I&#x27;d wake up some nights with it completely moved in my mouth.  Doubtful, but it could present a choking hazard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, not a bad product.  Good alternative if your insurance won&#x27;t cover a pro model.</li>
    <li> after I ordered, i DID NOT use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went my dentest, I ordered a prispcristion  form my doctor for three weeks, I am comfortabe now..</li>
    <li> Eek.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of my mouth.  The strap that connects the 2 back pieces that separate the upper and lower teeth was uncomfortable and impossible to ignore.  And the amount of separation was too much for me.  Maybe appliance would work better on a larger mouth, but I bought the slim-comfort - didn&#x27;t see a smaller one.</li>
    <li> This is the best replacement I have found to substitute for what the dentist office wanted to charge me $300 for. It works great, it travels well, it cleans up easily with just a rinse of water in the morning. I keep A spare in my backpack for when I travel. The dentist frowned at this saying that his version was better. But after talking to several hygienists, They assure me that this is just as good as the $300 version.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have ordered.  For the first one, it took me a week or so to become accustomed to holding it in my mouth while sleeping.  I never had any problems with fit or irritations.  It is easily adjusted.  The mounts are positioned between the rear molars.  The mounts slide back and forth and they also swivel for a comfortable semi custom fit.  On this one, I must have ordered a different model as it&#x27;s more comfortable than the first.  My only problem is settling into bed and immediately realizing I forgot my mouth peace.  It&#x27;s difficult going to sleep without it.</li>
    <li> I had been wearing a normal size Sleep Right guard for at least a year.  It was what the store carried and I tried it out.  It was ok and kept me from grinding my teeth; however, it was always on the big side.  This guard is the perfect size for my small mouth.  It is very comfortable and keeps me from grinding my teeth at night!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have used SleepRight for years.  Even got my dentist to start using it.  My hard plastic retainer started giving migraines from clinching - found the SleepRight and never looked back.  My son has now started using as well.  Best night guard for teeth grinding!!</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm.  My wife sleeps with the device for two or three weeks and like a miracle the pain goes away.  Maybe once a year or more she might have the same pain and out comes the SleepRight and all is well again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we found SleepRight I took my wife to a specialist in jaw pain (TMJ) and they wanted to charge us $4500 to do a study. They said that based on the study they would be able to recommend alternatives.  We almost could not leave the office because the wanted us to sign an agreement where the Doctor would finance the whole transaction with no money down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talked with our Dentist who said you know when I was a kid we would put a stick the size of a pencil in our mouth.  Well that did no make much sense so when I found the SleepRight advertised on the internet at that time for twice the cost that it costs today I jumped at the opportunity to help my wife.  Best purchase I have ever made.  I just ordered two sets to give to friends.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and I love my SleepRight.  Can&#x27;t sleep without it.  It has kept me from chewing up the inside of my mouth and tongue, and it has stopped that horrible grinding that was causing some of my headaches!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! Excellent solution if you don&#x27;t want to bother with a mold impression for a custom night guard.</li>
    <li> The new design lasts longer--like that.  Very comfortable.  I was thinking about switching brands but the new design is great.</li>
    <li> very good, beats paying the dentist for a less good one at $400 plus.  mine was bought this time to be ready for when the existing one needs replacing, usually I get 4-6 months use</li>
    <li> The thin plastic strip that holds the two pieces together is sort of like a stiff rubber band. It flexes all over the place. If you sleep without ever moving your jaw or head, you MIGHT be able to keep the two pieces clamped between your rear teeth. Did not work at all for me, one side or the other would slip off. I swear I was afraid I would accidentally half swallow this thing and choke to death! Avoid at all costs, get the full mouth shaped spacers.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a year now and love it so much. I&#x27;ve used the sports guards for years and this product is so much better. The bite pads are extremely durable. After a year I still have no wear on the bite pads at all. With the sports guards I would bite through them in about 3 months. I have had trouble keeping the strap in place at night, it tends to slip up on one side. My dentists have always told me I have a small mouth, but I think maybe I need to get the regular size instead of the small profile and this might help my problem. I have never had it slip out of my mouth or slip backwards towards my throat. One thing I recommend that isn&#x27;t stated in the instructions is to wash it every morning with soap and water before placing it back into the container.</li>
    <li> These are junk.  I bit completely through it in less than 3 weeks.  The last product I used lasted closer to a year.</li>
    <li> it is better than regular guards.  helps with my tmj</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been chewing through these for years now.  I bet I&#x27;m on my 10th one.  Great alternative to the spendy ones the dentist offers.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth so I set the expander at the lowest.  The band does not stay very well on my lower gum and the whole thing tends to pop out in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> The material that the night guard was made of, was harder than my previous Sleep Right night guards.  It still has the same great adjustment system  and I don&#x27;t drool everywhere like I did with those jock types of mouth guards that need to be boiled and take up most of your mouth.  It&#x27;s made in the USA and costs about $675 less than the ones that you get through the dentists office!</li>
