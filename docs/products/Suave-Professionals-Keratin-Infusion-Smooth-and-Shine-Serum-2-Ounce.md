      <li>Glad you have it</li>
      <li>After trying many serums, I settled with Kerastase Serum Nutri-Sculpt.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>I love this stuff MORE than Biosilk.</li>
      <li>Not even sure if they make it anymore.</li>
      <li>I apply more after my hair dries if needed.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have been using many serums over the years.</li>
      <li>(Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see out the windshield).</li>
      <li>Love...</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
      <li>I love this product, it takes away the frizzies and is not too greasy looking.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit messier &amp; takes more care to get it evenly</li>
      <li>I was very excited that I would get my frizzy/curly/poofy hair under control.</li>
      <li>I bought this because my hair is frizzy and breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>have fine, curly hair.</li>
      <li>This product works so well on my fine 3c/4a hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is collar bone length, and has always been fine in texture.  </li>
      <li>I have fine color treated wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
      <li>I have to say when used in the correct amount, my hair looks shiny and silky smooth, without the \\&quot;greasy\\</li>
      <li>I purchased this product as a cheap serum to use when I&#x27;m leaving the beach.</li>
      <li>Although Luscious Curls is a light weight cream, I feel like I needed something even lighter in the summer time.</li>
      <li>Many contain the same ingredients yet cost much, much more$!</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>Some of the products I&#x27;ve used are John Frieda Dream Curls, John Frieda Full Repair</li>
      <li>and it also makes very shiny and healthy</li>
      <li>It gave my hair nice waves and keeps it soft.</li>
      <li>My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own and Suave Keratin Serum is light but mighty and has hardly any fragrance, which is nice in summer for the bee factor.</li>
      <li>My hair felt smooth and soft and it tamed most of my flyaway hair too.</li>
      <li>Although this might just be my own hair&#x27;s reaction to the product it actually seemed to take out the poof and enhance the frizz if that makes any since.</li>
      <li>I recommend using it on freshly washed hair to seal in the moisture...</li>
      <li>But this is far better from the price aspect and the performance is on par.</li>
      <li>Boy was she right.</li>
      <li>I find it best to use it on \\&quot;half-way\\&quot; blown dry hair, instead of wet hair.</li>
      <li>I used to use l&#x27;oreal previously and loved it.</li>
      <li>first bought it when I was on the swim team</li>
      <li>In hot weather it goes frizzy..</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product, and will now use this for as long as they make it.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to have all the appropriate hair hair products to help keep  my new, sleek &#x27;do lasting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the rare product that works better for less money.</li>
      <li>It really helps with my frizz (i live in Houston where the humidity is high) &amp; is super lightweight.</li>
      <li>Thanks Suave.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
      <li>This stuff really helped.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn my hair straight in years because it always turns out frizzy unless I have the salon do it.</li>
      <li>The keratin helps restore shine, hydration and strength and it really makes hair manageable.</li>
      <li>and you really like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smoothing, indeed.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t believe how much volume a couple pumps of this stuff took away from my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to thos I am very picky.  </li>
      <li>It tames the frizz for when I style my hair curly or straight.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, got it before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>I like the fragrance of this better than any other brand too.</li>
      <li>I bought their new Morrocan styling oil, but it is very frangrant, so I will wear it in winter.</li>
      <li>I have to use more to get the same result and that result does not last.</li>
      <li>I use a hot smoothing iron on it, and typically like a full but straight and glossy look.  </li>
      <li>I went to Target and CVS and spent I am ashamed to say a lot of money on many serums, trying to get the same glossy light feel without the oily heavy feel that most of the serums left me with.  </li>
      <li>I am sad that they have stopped selling this product in the stores but happy I can still buy it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products to tame my &amp;#34;fluffy hair&amp;#34; and this works for me.</li>
      <li>Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve been searching for products high and low to battle the frizziness of my hair.</li>
      <li>I needed something that would help me contain the massive swell that is my hair and smooth it enough</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this a little while ago, and is the first serum I have used. I was very excited that I would get my frizzy/curly/poofy hair under control. Although this might just be my own hair&#x27;s reaction to the product it actually seemed to take out the poof and enhance the frizz if that makes any since. So in a way it works although not exactly what I wanted...hope it works better for you!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair....Horse hair, as one hair dresser told me.  I have tried every product on the planet and discovered this one, by accident, at a closeout store.  It is almost impossible to find except on Amazon.  One packet of three lasts me at least six months.  It shines and tames my difficult hair.  I even use it on my 9-year-old grandson who has inherited my hair.  He calls it the &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; because it makes his cowlick lie flat!</li>
    <li> My hair is not so healthy Due to coloring recently. This seems to help.  Ive been using great shampoo and conditioners and this...I would recommend at least trying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a cheap serum to use when I&#x27;m leaving the beach. I have very curly, very thick, semi-long hair and after a morning surfing I look like a creature from the deep, or even Medusa (Just the hair part, not the face!) when I get out of the water. I needed something that would help me contain the massive swell that is my hair and smooth it enough so I can braid it or put it in a ponytail (Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see out the windshield). I use BioSilk and Schwarzkopf at home, but wanted something I could use a lot of without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, this serum is better than any of the salon brands I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a little thinner in consistency, which I find I prefer. It makes my hair really shiny, as expected, but it also seems to have strengthened my hair a little too. And it really facilitates de-tangling with a lot less damage and pain. I like the fragrance of this better than any other brand too. It&#x27;s a bit subtler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bottle is opaque since it sits in my car all day. All-in-all I&#x27;m really pleased with the Suave and will be repurchasing this when I run out of my salon brands. It&#x27;s the rare product that works better for less money. I would recommend this product to replace ANY serum out there, it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very smoothing, indeed. A little goes a very long way, as usual with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how much volume a couple pumps of this stuff took away from my hair. It made styling, after, easy as pie! I will be stocking up on this!</li>
    <li> Love this! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Seems to help with heat damage a lot. My hair no longer breaks off everywhere.</li>
    <li> After the first order it has never been the same.  I have to use more to get the same result and that result does not last. I wonder if there has been a change in the formula.</li>
    <li> I have used dimethicone based products for years.  This serum will make your hair shine but it is not as heavy as some others so my curls did dry out by noon and get sort of frizzy.  It needs to be about twice this viscosity if it is going to tame my cave woman hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair and sometimes it gets dry to the point of frizzy and it&#x27;s often hard to find products that don&#x27;t weigh fine hair down and make it limp. This serum is very light, hydrating and I found it to help with breakage!&lt;br /&gt;I first bought it when I was on the swim team and I had to wash my hair every day sometimes twice a day. My hair was frizzy and dry and it was breaking off at the ends. This stuff really helped. The keratin helps restore shine, hydration and strength and it really makes hair manageable. I still use it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on wet or dry hair. I often use it straight out of the shower on wet hair and apply from mid-shaft to end, and then a small amount on top to control flyaways. Surprisingly if you use too much on top then it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy which is great with my oily scalp. I apply more after my hair dries if needed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really helps with my frizz (i live in Houston where the humidity is high) &amp; is super lightweight. It does not make my hair greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This serum is great.  I have very frizzy hair and it helps tame it down, but not alone.  I use this on my hair, let it air dry, and then I use a flat iron to straighten.  It makes combing very easy.</li>
    <li> Great for curly, wavy hair, makes it smooth.</li>
    <li> Thats what i bought for my wife. She loves this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. She will be set for a long time. Not even sure if they make it anymore. Don&#x27;t you hate when they take something out of production and you really like it. Thanks to Amazon, got it before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> have not used yet but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
    <li> Love this.  Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it every day after I shower.  It helps keep my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love... just stock pile now.</li>
    <li> I have been using many serums over the years. I really loved the expensive salon ones such as Biosilk.I have shoulder length hair....and Biosilk is just expensive. I love this stuff MORE than Biosilk. It will give you the results you want without weighing your hair down or feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  See my hair thickening and growing.  Tried many products, but this works the best for me.  Thanks Suave.</li>
    <li> I love SUAVE! When I found out they had packs online that you could order, I fell in love! This product works so well on my hair! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum after using the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 day smoothing treatment kit. I wanted to have all the appropriate hair hair products to help keep  my new, sleek &#x27;do lasting. This serum is very similar to other brands,but is a bit less thick than Biosilk, which I have been using for a long time. I only have to use a small amount, even though my hair is long.  I find it best to use it on \\&quot;half-way\\&quot; blown dry hair, instead of wet hair. I have to say when used in the correct amount, my hair looks shiny and silky smooth, without the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look some serums can give. I think I will have a new serum from now on, especially since this product is much less expensive than other brands.</li>
    <li> this product works great for me it makes my hair smell good and it also makes very shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> Light weight, low priced &amp; it works on wet or dry hair. It is a bit messier &amp; takes more care to get it evenly distributed.[[ASIN:B0062W4T98 Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] However, it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found for my naturally curly, (frizzy in damp or humid weather) thinning, aging, colored hair that helps each time I apply it.  Just don&#x27;t overdo the amount, &amp; it should improve all those wayward unmanageable curly locks.</li>
    <li> OK.. So here goes my review.  When it comes to hair I am some what of a fanatic!  My hair is naturally blonde but I have highlights.  When it comes to thos I am very picky.  Highlights HAVE to be ash, not yellow!  My hair is collar bone length, and has always been fine in texture.  In hot weather it goes frizzy..Everyones nightmare!  I use a hot smoothing iron on it, and typically like a full but straight and glossy look.  After trying many serums, I settled with Kerastase Serum Nutri-Sculpt.  At around $50.00 a bottle it was expensive, but gave me the look I liked.  Then they stopped manufacturing it.  I went to Target and CVS and spent I am ashamed to say a lot of money on many serums, trying to get the same glossy light feel without the oily heavy feel that most of the serums left me with.  I saw the TV commercials about Suave, and at around $3.50 a bottle decided to give it a go.  WOW is all I can say.  For my hair about 4 pumps does the job.  My hair is silky, glossy and heat protected.  I LOVE this product, and will now use this for as long as they make it.  I am also going to try out the other products from Suave Keratin line, as if they work like this does I will be very happy.  Buy this product with confidence. It won&#x27;t fail.  ABSOULTELY wonderful!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if there is something wrong with my hair, but nothing seems to make it shine.  I&#x27;ve used this product once and maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough as i have super thick hair.  It did smell good for a couple of mins, but then that went away.  I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money because it was so cheap and gives me the same results as salon serums do.  I guess I was just expecting more from something with the miracle Keratin product in it.  I&#x27;m trying the shampoo/conditioner and a home treatment, so maybe the serum will work better after i have done those.</li>
    <li> I should not have purchased it.  too much hype not real difference at all.  did not work what I read it would do.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product at my local drugstore. I was looking for a good serum that would fight humidity frizziness  and was lightweight. This product works so well on my fine 3c/4a hair. I use it when I roller set my hair and before I flat iron it.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve been searching for products high and low to battle the frizziness of my hair. I have fine color treated wavy hair. My hair is naturally dark brown and goes down to the middle of my back. Some of the products I&#x27;ve used are John Frieda Dream Curls, John Frieda Full Repair Perfect End Deep Infusion, Federic Fakkai Luscious Curls, Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Moroccan Argan Oil, Ouidad Botanical Boost and Humidity Gel. I was using JF Dream Curls for about 4 years. It was working well, but sometimes leaves my hair dry. I felt like lately my hair has not been responding well to the product. So, I did some research and settled on FF Luscious Curls. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It gave my hair nice waves and keeps it soft. Although Luscious Curls is a light weight cream, I feel like I needed something even lighter in the summer time. I recently went to a hair color appointment at the salon and my colorist recommended Suave Keratin line. She said she was only telling me this because we were close, since the Salon sells the full line of Kerastase and other high end salon products. Anyway, she said it&#x27;s just as good as Kerastase line. Boy was she right. I&#x27;ve been using Suave Keratin Smooth &amp; Shine Serum for the past 3 months and it&#x27;s amazing. It tames the frizz for when I style my hair curly or straight. With curl styling, I use the serum in conjunction with FF Luscious Curls (I just use less cream). For straight style, I use 2 pumps on damp hair, blow dry with round brush and a little drop of serum to finish off. I haven&#x27;t worn my hair straight in years because it always turns out frizzy unless I have the salon do it. I&#x27;m so freaking shocked at how good my hair looks when I straighten it now and I don&#x27;t even use a flat iron. Note that I also use the Suave Keratin Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for color treated hair. This is an AWESOME product with breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to tame my &amp;#34;fluffy hair&amp;#34; and this works for me. I was so sad when this product was discontinued. Thank Goodness there are suppliers out there that still sell it. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own and Suave Keratin Serum is light but mighty and has hardly any fragrance, which is nice in summer for the bee factor. I golf and garden and don&#x27;t need a fragrant hair product. I bought their new Morrocan styling oil, but it is very frangrant, so I will wear it in winter.</li>
    <li> I use this product for flat ironing daughter&#x27;s hair.  Can&#x27;t find it at stores anymore.  Glad you have it</li>
    <li> I add a little before using a styling tool and a small amount when I&#x27;m finished styling and my thick, dry hair is less dry and feels softer.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and was sad that I can no longer buy it in any of my local stores!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, curly hair. This silicone serum doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down.&lt;br /&gt;It just smooths the frizz. I apply to wet hair and let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  not the best I have used, yet it is a good product at a GREAT price. Many contain the same ingredients yet cost much, much more$! I would def buy again. Smooths frizz, adds shine...</li>
    <li> i use it when i finish style it i put it in the end of my hair, it makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product not knowing how it would work on ethnic hair but I gave it a shot and it&#x27;s great...I recommend using it on freshly washed hair to seal in the moisture...but yeah it&#x27;s a good product &amp; I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  I use it with the leave in conditioner &amp; will not change to anything else.  I bought this because my hair is frizzy and breaks easily.  This has changed my hair for the better &amp; it&#x27;s getting healthier each week.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser does a Keratin treatment on my hair every 4 or 5 months to help strengthen and straighten it. I love using this product in-between. I use it several times per week after shampooing. It goes is easily, smoothes in, feels good and works well.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews and it has lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. I used to use l&#x27;oreal previously and loved it. But this is far better from the price aspect and the performance is on par. My hair felt smooth and soft and it tamed most of my flyaway hair too. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am sad that they have stopped selling this product in the stores but happy I can still buy it on Amazon.  I love this product, it takes away the frizzies and is not too greasy looking.  A little goes a long way.</li>
