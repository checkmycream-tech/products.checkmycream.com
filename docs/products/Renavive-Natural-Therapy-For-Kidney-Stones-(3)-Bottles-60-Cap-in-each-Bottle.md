      <li>I highly recommend this product for keeping stones away.  </li>
      <li>I was diagnosed with a one centimeter stone lodged high in the kidney.  </li>

      <li>I normally do a lot of research before buying a new supplement.</li>
      <li>My kidney stone did not entirely pass when it first caused me problems.  </li>
      <li>This tells me the Renavive did exactly what it claimed and I would recommend it to anyone suffering from kidney stones who would rather dispose of them naturally as opposed to a medical procedure or surgery.</li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference in my everyday life.</li>
      <li>* aaaah to be young and invincible</li>

      <li>So far, it must be working as I haven&#x27;t had a recurrence since starting to take this stuff.</li>
      <li>However, I have not needed to take these pills so as far as I&#x27;m concerned these have worked for me even if it is only for a while.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s doctor was amazed as they had discovered a large stone in his kidney and told him it would have to be blasted in order for it to be able to pass.  </li>

<li> I see one review in particular that is very negative on this product.  </li>
<li> My last kidney stone messed up my back up really bad in October and was having lots of pain in my lower back pretty much everyday, and if I lifted something heavy or leaned down for a while then my back would hurt for days.</li>
<li> no more back pain</li>
<li> - check my other reviews</li>
<li> I only take 2-3 a week along with cranberry juice and no more stones.</li>
<li> When I began taking the pills in mid-July I was in extreme pain due to kidney stones.</li>
<li> Not worth buying. ..</li>

<li> We were a little concerned to have to try another product, hoping it would continue to work as well.  </li>
<li> It took a few weeks</li>
<li> I have been taking it for a few years now.</li>
<li> She made a solid argument of how could it be worse than the coke thing</li>
<li> A stone the size of a green pea, was lodged in a tube the size of a spaghetti strand.&lt;br</li>
<li> If I string together enough of these days or eat poorly then I can feel it in my side.</li>

<li> No more kidney stones since hubby has been taking this.  </li>
<li> not sure if it worked</li>
<li> If i feel a pain or dull ache</li>
<li> I had Kidney Stones last year, had them blasted twice, that didn&#x27;t work, saw these pills, tried them and they worked.</li>
<li> My husband suffers with occasional kidney stones.  </li>
<li> and if you ever had this experience you know what I mean....</li>
<li> The pain is not as bad as before but it is there which indicates to me that the stones are present they are just behaving for the time being.</li>
<li> I was so desperate to relieve the pain that I went to great lengths include drinking disgusting (and horrible for my body) concoctions involving coke and asparagus</li>
<li> Do not buy, waste of your money :(  </li>
<li> and you know pain if your a kidney stone suffer so try it you won&#x27;t  be sorry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am writing this review after having used the pills religiously for almost 90 days. I am writing this now because I am reordering these pills and figured that I would forget to write it once the 90 days were up! I can honestly say that these pills worked for me. When I began taking the pills in mid-July I was in extreme pain due to kidney stones. The previous Spring I had kidney stones and no health insurance so I was given pain killers, told to drink a lot and sent on my way. I was so desperate to relieve the pain that I went to great lengths include drinking disgusting (and horrible for my body) concoctions involving coke and asparagus (that did not work and left me writhing in pain). I did not pass the kidney stones but basically waited it out until they went back into hibernation. Fast forward to July and I am back at square one. I was about to try to coke concoction again since I survived the last round and what are my other options? My mother found these pills online which I assumed would basically be a waste of time. She made a solid argument of how could it be worse than the coke thing so I gave it a shot. At the time I was drinking a gallon of water plus an additional 32oz of lemon concentrate water a day - no pain relief and no passing of the stone. I paid a little bit more by ordering through Amazon than through the company but I wanted to be able to write an honest and verified review plus I got 2 day shipping! By the third day I was pain free. That is not to say that I was kidney stone free but seriously I was in so much pain I don&#x27;t really care. Throughout my bout with kidney stones I have had to continue working in a hospital setting which is not conducive to pain or lugging around a gallon jug of water. These pills have truly been a blessing. The reality of these pills is that they are not a cure all. I try my best to drink water as I should throughout the day but there are days that I don&#x27;t get a chance to drink anything until the evening. If I string together enough of these days or eat poorly then I can feel it in my side. The pain is not as bad as before but it is there which indicates to me that the stones are present they are just behaving for the time being. Also I have nothing to do with this company - check my other reviews I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever left a positive review let alone such a lengthy one!! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/28/16 - I am updating my review which I believe is a couple years old at this point. I actually stopped taking these pills in 8/15 because I ran out. I no longer have the symptoms of kidney stones. This could mean a couple things and while I would love to believe that they are gone there is a possibility that the little buggers are dormant. However, I have not needed to take these pills so as far as I&#x27;m concerned these have worked for me even if it is only for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been taking for a few month&#x27;s and seems to be working well.  My kidney stone did not entirely pass when it first caused me problems.  I&#x27;m trying this as an alternative treatment to surgery/laesr breakup of the stone. Another CAT scan in about a month should tell the tale . . .</li>
    <li> Renavive Natural Treatment For Kidney Stones...  Work great.. My husband had and gets kidney stones.  These pills help with pain. Work great.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of internet research before trying Renavive.  I was diagnosed with a one centimeter stone lodged high in the kidney.  Went back for retest after 4 months and it was gone.  So much better than other alternatives.  Worth a try. Linda</li>
    <li> I bought three bottles as recommended and took it for three months along with plenty of water, exercising, etc, etc. I did everything they ask on their website... It didn&#x27;t do a thing, it has nothing to do with kidney stone treatment! I do not understand how they are #1 in this research I found on-line. Do not buy, waste of your money :(  Andrew</li>
    <li> not sure if it worked</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; son was having trouble urinating and having pain. It broke my heart and I didn&#x27;t want to put him through a lot of evasive procedures. I studied this product carefully and then gave it a try. It helped him rapidly and effectively. We continued with 2 capsules a day and have been using it about 3 months now. I monitor his health closely and there has been no recurrence of this problem.</li>
    <li> So far, it must be working as I haven&#x27;t had a recurrence since starting to take this stuff. I&#x27;m just taking one/day&lt;br /&gt;and see if that works. No side effects as yet. It beats the Flomax that I was taking as that stuff makes me a&lt;br /&gt;bit drowsy...</li>
    <li> I used it for 5 months straight and my 1cm stone grew to 1.5cm, it didn&#x27;t shrink my stone at all or stop it from growing. Wasted my time and money, very sad and disappointed!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for keeping stones away.  I&#x27;ve had stones twice &amp; even had surgery to remove the stones the second time around.  I&#x27;ve been taking this product recommended by my brother.  He as well had stones.  We have both been taking it &amp; it has made a big difference!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working.  I only take 2-3 a week along with cranberry juice and no more stones.</li>
    <li> Appears to work. Takes about a month to notice if it working.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR KIDNEY STONE TREATMENT</li>
    <li> I normally do a lot of research before buying a new supplement. However, I was diagnosed with 4 kidney stones by CT scan and was dealing with the intense pain that comes with the condition.  Seeing the dozens of positive reviews, I bit the bullet and purchased Renavive. I immediately began taking 3 capsules per day along with as much water as I could stand.  I noticed a strong diuretic effect right away. Over the next 2 weeks, the pain gradually lessened. By the end of the 3rd week, I was completely pain free and my energy level were back to 100% - without any medical procedure or surgery. The only remain issue was my appetite had not fully returned (which it finally did after the 4th week). I never passed any large stones but believe I passed a few small fragments. This tells me the Renavive did exactly what it claimed and I would recommend it to anyone suffering from kidney stones who would rather dispose of them naturally as opposed to a medical procedure or surgery.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for 4 years. He had a 3 kidney stones in one 2011.  We found this product online and decided to try it, and he has not had one kidney stone since then. A 3 month supply for less than $100, and all natural. Try it - if it works, you just avoided a huge hospital bill for tests, surgery and time off work. Renavive works!</li>
    <li> Hours after  using this, I felt something quaking in the left kidney, something  haven&#x27;t truly felt since 87  when I went into see&lt;br /&gt;Urologist: Dr Abouhossein for surgery to blast the stone.  Upon viewing xrays, it was his personal opinion that that kidney hadn&#x27;t worked in sometime*years* aaaah to be young and invincible&lt;br /&gt;.  A stone the size of a green pea, was lodged in a tube the size of a spaghetti strand.&lt;br /&gt; 11 days later released from the hospital. decades later edema, water retention, doughy arms and legs---actually filled with fluids&lt;br /&gt;Over night my watch was loose on my wrist, jewelry and rings are loose as well.  July 10,2014</li>
    <li> This product has been working now for over 1 year to keep my kidney stones from coming back.</li>
    <li> RENAVIVE REALLY WORKS. I have been plagued with kidney stones. I have one or more per year. Things got so bad the doctor was going to put in stents. I figured there had to be a better way. So I searched the internet for a natural cure. I came across RENAVIVE and said what the heck I have nothing to loose but the stones. I have been taking RENAVIVE now for 9 months and have passed multiple stones with NO PAIN. Yes I said NO PAIN. I started out by taking RENAVIVE 3 times per day and I did that for 3 month. Than I went to taking it twice a day and have not stopped.  I will continue to take RENAVIVE probably for the rest of my life as I feel for what it cost to take RENAVIVE vs what it cost to keep going to the hospital or doctor is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> So far it seems that this treatment works: no more back pain and I can sleep in on any side now</li>
    <li> Nice just as described thanks............</li>
    <li> I found these and hoped that it would work and IT DID! I took 3 a day for about a week then 2 for another week and then 1 a day from then on. NO problems. NO PAIN! Much better than what I got at the hospital. Those pills make you drowsy and make your thinking cloudy. These seem to take care of the problem. I see one review in particular that is very negative on this product.  I can only surmise that since we are all different on some level, that it did not work on that person.  All I know is that it definitely worked for me.  I had pain for 2 weeks and if you ever had this experience you know what I mean....if not, consider yourself fortunate.  I am now buying 3 more bottles.</li>
    <li> When Uriflow became very difficult to purchase, we were then referred to Renavive!  My husband has had several bouts with kidney stones and Uriflow worked like a miracle!!!  We were a little concerned to have to try another product, hoping it would continue to work as well.  Since my husband has been taking Renavive for over a year now, it has worked just as effectively as Uriflow and he has not had another incident.  He takes one daily for maintenance and it is obviously working.  Why this is not big news in bold print in the newspaper headlines for people with kidney stones, (instead of surgeries, ultrasound, and prescriptions) I have no idea.  It is all natural, which is important to us, and has not produced any side effects at all.  And.............since being on Uriflow and now on Renavive, my husband has not had any incidences with kidney stones.  Research and read how many, many other people have avoided surgeries, etc., by taking this all-natural product.  We highly recommend Renavive!</li>
    <li> I took Renavive for 3 months and recently went for a repeat ct scan.  My urologist couldn&#x27;t belive it, but the kidney stones were no longer there, they were gone.  Renavive works!! I will make sure that my stock of Renavive never runs out!</li>
    <li> I had Kidney Stones last year, had them blasted twice, that didn&#x27;t work, saw these pills, tried them and they worked. I had another bout last week, and I am better again. Product  works.</li>
    <li> Three stars because my body seems to be sensitive to the chanca piedra, (the very first ingredient listed in this product).  Chanca piedra caused me some pain but the product did do its job of eliminating the kidney stones gradually, way better than the alternative!  Wondered if this product could include Stonebreaker herb in the future???</li>
    <li> I had multiple kidney stones several times. I found this and tried it. It took a few weeks but I noticed the pain was going away from the stones. I went back several months later to the doctor to find out the stones were dissolved. I have been taking it for a few years now. If i feel a pain or dull ache I take two twice a day and within a day can feel a big difference.</li>
    <li> No more kidney stones since hubby has been taking this.  would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has the tendencies to get stones.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers with occasional kidney stones.  Renavive gives him relief from the pain and dissolves the stones over time.  My husband&#x27;s doctor was amazed as they had discovered a large stone in his kidney and told him it would have to be blasted in order for it to be able to pass.  When they went to do the procedure, he was tested again and the stone was gone!  The price is great.  I highly reccommend this product to anyone who suffers with kidney stones.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband but didn&#x27;t think it worked as good as i thought it would have</li>
    <li> Its been 3 months no results!  Would not recommend.  Not worth buying. .. Don&#x27;t waster you money on this product.</li>
    <li> Uriflow is great but hard to get. I decided it was time to try an alternative.  Renavive has all the same stuff and maybe a few incredients more.  I feel it&#x27;s been a good substitute and I&#x27;ll stick with it!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I did not see any results with it.  I used it as directed.</li>
    <li> Did not have any effect on my kidney stones. The stones were x-rayed before and after and they&lt;br /&gt; are still there</li>
    <li> This product works great to break down kidney stones quickly.  It was also inexpensive compared to other products that do the same thing.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Had two kidney stone attacks in two years before I started using Renavive treatment. Since using Renavive treatments, I&#x27;ve not had recurrence of kidney stones in 3 1/2 years!</li>
    <li> I was having lots of kidney stones and was looking for something to try and help with it. I found renavive and decided to give it a try and boy am I not sorry. It has made a huge difference in my everyday life. I can do more things now because of it. My last kidney stone messed up my back up really bad in October and was having lots of pain in my lower back pretty much everyday, and if I lifted something heavy or leaned down for a while then my back would hurt for days. But since I have take this all the pain is gone!!! I can lift things, lean down for long periods of time, and can rollerblade again (when you rollerblade you lean slightly forward) which hurt my back. I went rollerblading a few days ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how far I went and guess what NO PAIN!!!! I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much this product works and you know pain if your a kidney stone suffer so try it you won&#x27;t  be sorry.</li>
