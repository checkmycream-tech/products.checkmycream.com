<ol>
    <li> Love this holding gel. -</li>
    <li> Looks fine for the first 20 mins but then turns white making it appear you have dandruff</li>
    <li> Best Egde Gel for type 4 hair. I never get fly-aways with this and my edges stay &amp;#34;laid&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Where do I start....This edge tamer is the best. Goes on very smooth, does not leave white residue like other edge controls, and conditions your edges all at the same time. Not to mention the smell is to die for!!!! Please keep this product going Dr. Miracles. I would love to buy it in a bigger container too.</li>
    <li> GREAT HOLD DOESNT FLAKE AT ALL.</li>

    <li> Its a great edging gel but it does flake a little.</li>
    <li> Holds and conditions.</li>
    <li> I like this gel because it doesn&#x27;t flake. If you put on too much it can look white but I just add a little water to my edge brush and brush back and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair with thin edges. This laid my edges down all day. I only used a little product on my hair and it slicked it down! I used this product once, therefore I&#x27;ll give it a 4 star.</li>
    <li> Works so great and not sticky!</li>
    <li> I like the product but it doesn&#x27;t work on my edges as well as I would&#x27;ve like it to. The hold doesn&#x27;t last long and I have to put a bit much on my edges to make it lay down. I do like the feel of it on my edges though...it doesn&#x27;t feel thick and gunky.</li>
    <li> It slicks your edges well but it does leave a residue if you use more than a very small amount.</li>
    <li> Slicks down even the kinkiest edges</li>
    <li> when I first touch this I was like this is not going to work ( I previouly used ORS ), it not thick at all like ors and its light. it laid my hair down all day. I need to get some more, my hair is not heavy or anything and unlike the other brands i have tried i didn&#x27;t have to put any pro style in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair feel smooth and nice and it looks the hair done really good</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m sad that i don&#x27;t really like this product for me. It feels great, looks great but holds for about an hour or less even if i  slather it on. my edges will curl up into tight little curls and it looks weird. It flakes a lot but that is easy to wipe away. It could be my hair but i am moving on the other types of edge holding gels this isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
