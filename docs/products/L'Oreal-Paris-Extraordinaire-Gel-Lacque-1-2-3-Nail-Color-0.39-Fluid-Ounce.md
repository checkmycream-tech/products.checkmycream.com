### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
      <li>Ever since I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Gel-Lacque, my nails have looked impeccable!</li>
      <li>In both cases I&#x27;ve got great results.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative because I can switch up colors in a week or so</li>
      <li>I just want more colors of it now!!</li>
      <li>The top coat is the best.</li>
      <li>not as good as gel</li>
      <li>The thing that causes me to give this 4 stars is that it looks beautiful and dries very quickly so</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>If my nail is filed nicely and has no imperfections, it will be closer to 7.</li>
      <li>It is nice and shiny.  </li>
      <li>but it works nice for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how nice my nails look.</li>
      <li>This gel-lacuqe is nice because its very easy to take off and change it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad Amazon had it because this is the first nail polish line I have ever been really happy with</li>
      <li>I actually love these things.</li>
      <li>junkie)....I swear by this top coat.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more colors.</li>
      <li>what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;perhaps</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve tried most brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I reapplied the #3 coat it will extend the life of the polish.  </li>
      <li>I went to Amazon, read the reviews and got the idea to just use the top coat (step 3-glaze).</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m glad i found some online too.</li>
      <li>Hansen makes a better non-light gel polish system.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews about this gel-type nail polish and I have to say I disagree with most others.</li>
      <li>The reason I love the L&#x27;Oreal gel-lacque line is because this stuff dries like a quick-dry polish but lasts like a long-lasting polish.</li>
      <li>I do recommend these two nail polishes because they do make your nails look perfectly done and very shiny and best of all they dry quickly.</li>
      <li>The best part though is that it lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love the color she had, but my nails were strong.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and has the look of a gel manicure - the depth and thickness, if you will, along with the gloss but without the trial of removing a gel manicure and the damage to your nails.  </li>
      <li>Easy to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>even if you have to reapply a couple of nails at a time, the drying time makes this easy to do.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as gel at all.</li>
      <li>Goes on beautifully - the applicator brush spreads out really well and made it easy to apply and covered the whole nail.  </li>
      <li>I would give it less stars for that, but I can&#x27;t do it because the top coat is honestly the best nail product I have ever used (I have 300+ polishes and consider myself a total nail</li>
      <li>it goes on super easily, dries faster than I can smudge it, and lasts over a week.</li>
      <li>But this system goes on easy, dries super fast, and lasts more than a week without chips.</li>
      <li>I tried the product as described - the first coat, then the specific gel lacquer that was formulated to go along with it - it DID peel, and the color selection wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>This stuff lasted a full 8 days before chipping.</li>
      <li>I  hope they add more colors because I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it...</li>
      <li>Super glossy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>They are super glossy.</li>
      <li>I added a second top coat to my thumbs and ring fingers, because I drew a design on them the day after I did the original ones, and they are still going strong.  </li>
      <li>and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since I needed new polishes, especially a new top coat and basecoat.</li>
      <li>If you give it plenty of time to thoroughly dry, it easily lasts more than a week.</li>
      <li>comes off very easily with regular nail polish remover</li>
      <li>This stuff is totally dry within a half hour and looks beautiful for many days.</li>
      <li>However, when I used whatever polish I wanted without the 1st coat, and only used the 3rd as a top coat, it worked AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I used with some basic nail polish (not the Loreal Gel) and was pleased.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;m thinking maybe I finally found something that works and is not expensive.  </li>
      <li>have found in the past something that is superb doesn&#x27;t stay on the market long.</li>
      <li>I reapplied it on clean nails, thinking it was worth a second try.</li>
      <li>it removes so easily with regular acetone.</li>
      <li>I was my hands a lot a large part of what I do involves my hands.</li>
      <li>They are very scuff resistant.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to market your product as &amp;#34;UV free gel&amp;#34; it should actually be comparable to gel nail polish, which lasts about 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>It stays smooth, and mine hasn&#x27;t chipped, after several days.</li>
      <li>I bought mine in a NYC drug store and spent a LOT more money than I shoud</li>
      <li>I never bothered with frequent manicures up until now because they rarely lasted more than a couple days before chipping, so not worth the cost or effort.</li>
      <li>These dry very rapidly and the shine is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>like it than average top coat</li>
      <li>Nail polish never lasts on me and so far 3 full days later it is as shiny as the first day and no chipping at all.  </li>
      <li>but I would HIGHLY recommend TWO coats of the #3 topcoat.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It gives you more depth and shine with a little longer wear.  </li>
      <li>there is absolutely nothing special about this &#x27;system&#x27; it acts as nothing more than a base coat, color and top coat.</li>
      <li>a few more colors...</li>
      <li>does dry quickly and gives depth like gels do.</li>
      <li>Good base and top coat.</li>
      <li>The products went on very well and dried quickly.  </li>
      <li>Should have gone with the other reviews about how the polish comes off quickly.  </li>
      <li>and it all began to chip off, by 24 hours 2 nails were completely uncovered.  </li>
      <li>I saw this in a grocery store near my apartment</li>
      <li>Plus I could wear whatever I wanted as far as colors go.</li>
      <li>I have three kids under 10, one of whom is 18 months old.</li>
      <li>I fixed a door and scuffed my nail.</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly for a total of 4 coats of polish, and lasts longer than regular nail polish but not as long as a salon gel manicure, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  </li>
      <li>I have a suggestion I think other users might find useful.</li>
      <li>Polish applied as directed, dried quickly, and was chipped with 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Wish we could just buy the top coat alone, the base coat is just okay to me.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as I&#x27;d like and doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the Sally Hansen ones.</li>
      <li>I have used the base and top coats with other loreal non gel lacques and got the same amazing results.</li>
      <li>Combining these polishes with any of your regular nail polish works just as well, and at least you won&#x27;t be as dissapointed if it doesn&#x27;t last as long, I mean who wants to walk around with the same nail polish for more than a week!.</li>
      <li>The color goes on a little streaky, but the glaze smoothes it and really shines.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very shiny and stayed on for about 5 days before it started wearing off a little.</li>
      <li>I read reviews for other products too and came up with this routine that has made nails stronger than ever before, even when I had a new gel</li>

<li> I bought the gel primer base, gel glaze top coat and several colors originally at Target a few months ago.</li>
<li> I will continue to use these for as long as I can get them -</li>
<li> And being an optimistic, I tried the third application several days later after using no polish for a few days.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had to peel stickers, type, and do various other things, resigning myself to chipped nails, but so far, all i am seeing is a little wear.  </li>
<li> This was pretty expensive for lasting just as long as regular nail polish, or maybe even not as long.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have time to wait two hours for my polish to dry.</li>
<li> At least the price wasn&#x27;t high.  </li>
<li> As a few others have said, regular polish lasts just as long, if not longer.</li>

    <li> Ever since I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Gel-Lacque, my nails have looked impeccable! I never bothered with frequent manicures up until now because they rarely lasted more than a couple days before chipping, so not worth the cost or effort. But this system goes on easy, dries super fast, and lasts more than a week without chips. The only reason I have to change colors now is because of nail growth, not because of chips. I  hope they add more colors because I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it...UHMAAAAZING!</li>
    <li> I bought the gel primer base, gel glaze top coat and several colors originally at Target a few months ago. A few days ago I went to Target to restock and they were no longer carrying the brand, just Revlon&#x27;s color gel envy line. Well, I tried the Revlon line and I am not impressed (takes too long to dry and ended up smudged because I have no time to sit around and wait). The reason I love the L&#x27;Oreal gel-lacque line is because this stuff dries like a quick-dry polish but lasts like a long-lasting polish. No, it is not like a salon gel manicure, but regular quick-dry polish chips the next day and regular long-lasting polish takes fooooooooorever to dry. I have three kids under 10, one of whom is 18 months old. I don&#x27;t have time to wait two hours for my polish to dry. This stuff is totally dry within a half hour and looks beautiful for many days. I am so glad Amazon had it because this is the first nail polish line I have ever been really happy with and I&#x27;ve been wearing nail polish regularly for 30 years so I&#x27;ve tried most brands.</li>
    <li> I followed instruction for application.  The products went on very well and dried quickly.  Ok, I&#x27;m thinking maybe I finally found something that works and is not expensive.  Wrong--less than 12 hours on and it all began to chip off, by 24 hours 2 nails were completely uncovered.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for $4 apiece steps 1 through 3. I do gel occasionally but the damage to my nails is ridiculous. This is a great alternative because I can switch up colors in a week or so unlike gel, I stay the entire 2 to 3 weeks then I have to give my nails at least a month to recover. I like that it removes so easily with regular acetone. I have used the base and top coats with other loreal non gel lacques and got the same amazing results. Those are a  bit cheaper than the gel lacques. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as I&#x27;d like and doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the Sally Hansen ones.</li>
    <li> I got this set, along with one of the colors, as a Christmas gift. I was VERY disappointed. The polish started chipping off within a few hours.    I do not recommend this.  As a few others have said, regular polish lasts just as long, if not longer.</li>
    <li> there is absolutely nothing special about this &#x27;system&#x27; it acts as nothing more than a base coat, color and top coat. it has never lasted a single day longer than any other brand nor is it resistant to chipping, peeling etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would soooooo not bother. the only reason i still use it is because i wasted my money on it and may as well use until gone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s junk. Begins chipping off in less than 24 hours. Looks no different than regular nail polish. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen makes a better non-light gel polish system.</li>
    <li> not as good as gel but it works nice for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> The base coat and glaze are easy to apply. The color goes on a little streaky, but the glaze smoothes it and really shines. If you give it plenty of time to thoroughly dry, it easily lasts more than a week. This kit includes stages 1 &amp; 3 of the gel-lacque system. Stage 2 are the colors.  My only complaint was the limited choice of colors.</li>
    <li> I have used this kit with both Loreal extraordinaire colors and regular nail polish. In both cases I&#x27;ve got great results. I can keep my polish 5-7 days. If my nail is filed nicely and has no imperfections, it will be closer to 7. I have two little kids and I work around the house and the color stays on!&lt;br /&gt;It comes off very easily with regular nail polish remover and that&#x27;s what I love about it. I don&#x27;t want to put my fingers through the abuse of salon gel manicure. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It dries very quickly for a total of 4 coats of polish, and lasts longer than regular nail polish but not as long as a salon gel manicure, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  It&#x27;s very shiny and stayed on for about 5 days before it started wearing off a little. I touched it up and made it last another couple of days before I took it off with regular nail polish.  I&#x27;m going to try putting the #3 topcoat on every other day to see if it lasts longer.  I bought it at target and it was about $10 for primer and glaze package and $5 for the color.  Doesn&#x27;t cost anymore than regular polish.  Definitely worth a try!!</li>
    <li> After  having several gel manicures that lifted in a week, I picked at, my nails were paper thin... I tried this because a friend had it. I didn&#x27;t love the color she had, but my nails were strong. I went to Amazon, read the reviews and got the idea to just use the top coat (step 3-glaze). I read reviews for other products too and came up with this routine that has made nails stronger than ever before, even when I had a new gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;2 coats of OPI Nail Envy... then 1 or 2 coats of my color (not L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s gel), then a coat of L&#x27;Oreal Step3 glaze. A day or 2 later I add another coat of OPI Nail Envy or the Step 3. My nails are healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews about this gel-type nail polish and I have to say I disagree with most others. It goes on easily and has the look of a gel manicure - the depth and thickness, if you will, along with the gloss but without the trial of removing a gel manicure and the damage to your nails.  Of course, I agree that it doesn&#x27;t stay on any longer than regular nail polish but I would HIGHLY recommend TWO coats of the #3 topcoat.  It gives you more depth and shine with a little longer wear.  The thing that causes me to give this 4 stars is that it looks beautiful and dries very quickly so even if you have to reapply a couple of nails at a time, the drying time makes this easy to do. I left off 1 star because of it&#x27;s claim to last longer than it does and the price.</li>
    <li> If you choose to buy these two nail polishes don&#x27;t bother buying the 2nd step nail polish (the color), using a regular nail polish will have the same appearance and endurance as the pricy &#x27;gel&#x27; color a.k.a. step 2. I do recommend these two nail polishes because they do make your nails look perfectly done and very shiny and best of all they dry quickly. Combining these polishes with any of your regular nail polish works just as well, and at least you won&#x27;t be as dissapointed if it doesn&#x27;t last as long, I mean who wants to walk around with the same nail polish for more than a week!.</li>
    <li> I have tried this twice in two different shades and both times the polish was chipped off of my finger tips by the next morning. Just wearing regular nail polish without a base or topcoat lasts longer than this.</li>
    <li> Wish we could just buy the top coat alone, the base coat is just okay to me. I would give it less stars for that, but I can&#x27;t do it because the top coat is honestly the best nail product I have ever used (I have 300+ polishes and consider myself a total nail junkie)....I swear by this top coat. The staying power is out of this world. I have only used it with non-gel and non-loreal polishes and it hasn&#x27;t mattered at all. If you don&#x27;t want to go out and buy a bunch of expensive gel polishes but are sick of your regular manis never lasting more than a few days, this is for you!</li>
    <li> The top coat is the best. It dryes polish almost instantly. I do need to touch up polish every couple of days.I dont know why my nails stain when i remove polish. It does save me from going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Good base and top coat. Don&#x27;t give thick coverage</li>
    <li> This was pretty expensive for lasting just as long as regular nail polish, or maybe even not as long.  It started chipping after a day and a half of wear.  If you&#x27;re going to market your product as &amp;#34;UV free gel&amp;#34; it should actually be comparable to gel nail polish, which lasts about 2 weeks.  This doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
    <li> chips and peels just like anything else not claiming to be a gel polish.  does dry quickly and gives depth like gels do.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. Polish applied as directed, dried quickly, and was chipped with 24 hours.I reapplied it on clean nails, thinking it was worth a second try. Same issues. Usually I know what I may have done that would cause the polish to chip. Not this time, however. And being an optimistic, I tried the third application several days later after using no polish for a few days. Same deal - chipped is less than 24 hours. Don&#x27;t waste your $$!</li>
    <li> I have tons of nail polish, and I tend to chip my polish within a few days. My work manages to ruin any manicure within days. I got a salon manicure, and within 20 minutes at my office, it was ruined.  This stuff, however, stays. For the same price as regular polish, this stuff dries way faster, and shinier. It stays smooth, and mine hasn&#x27;t chipped, after several days. I&#x27;ve had to peel stickers, type, and do various other things, resigning myself to chipped nails, but so far, all i am seeing is a little wear.  I added a second top coat to my thumbs and ring fingers, because I drew a design on them the day after I did the original ones, and they are still going strong.  The only wear is a little bit at the tips of my nails.  I love this stuff! I just want more colors of it now!!</li>
    <li> I use only the base coat and glaze as not fond of colored nails.  These dry very rapidly and the shine is fantastic.  I will continue to use these for as long as I can get them - have found in the past something that is superb doesn&#x27;t stay on the market long.</li>
    <li> I used with some basic nail polish (not the Loreal Gel) and was pleased.  It is nice and shiny.  Not sure if I would compare with a gel and not sure how long it will last, but like it than average top coat</li>
    <li> I saw this in a grocery store near my apartment and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since I needed new polishes, especially a new top coat and basecoat. I actually love these things. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how nice my nails look. They are super glossy. The best part though is that it lasted a long time. Typically, a base coat+2 coats of polish+topcoat will chip within 2-3 days for me. I was my hands a lot a large part of what I do involves my hands. This stuff lasted a full 8 days before chipping. They are very scuff resistant. I fixed a door and scuffed my nail. They didn&#x27;t even chip or scratch then. That&#x27;s about 4 times longer than I&#x27;m used to. However, these are not gel polishes. Gel manis are going to last you longer. I&#x27;m not a fan of them because they tend to strip my nails and are hard to take off. This gel-lacuqe is nice because its very easy to take off and change it. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more colors. I will also try the base coat and top coat with non gel-lacque polishes and see how they work and update on how it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Last longer than regular polish&lt;br /&gt;- Scuff and chip resistant&lt;br /&gt;- Super glossy&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t stain nails as much as other polishes&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Will not last as long as gels</li>
    <li> I literally NEVER write reviews but have been  using the Extraordinaire for a couple months now. I have been searching for a Gel like polish that i can do myself and this is it. it goes on super easily, dries faster than I can smudge it, and lasts over a week. what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;perhaps a few more colors... but that&#x27;s it. Locally i can only find this product line at Walgreens so i&#x27;m glad i found some online too.</li>
    <li> Chipped after one day.  Not as strong as gel at all.</li>
    <li> Should have gone with the other reviews about how the polish comes off quickly.  Worse than regular polish.  At least the price wasn&#x27;t high.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have a suggestion I think other users might find useful. I tried the product as described - the first coat, then the specific gel lacquer that was formulated to go along with it - it DID peel, and the color selection wasn&#x27;t great. Also - my nails turned yellow. However, when I used whatever polish I wanted without the 1st coat, and only used the 3rd as a top coat, it worked AMAZING. My nails lasted for over two weeks, no chipping, and my nails were not yellow after. Plus I could wear whatever I wanted as far as colors go. I buy it now just for the 3rd. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love it! Goes on beautifully - the applicator brush spreads out really well and made it easy to apply and covered the whole nail.  Nail polish never lasts on me and so far 3 full days later it is as shiny as the first day and no chipping at all.  I&#x27;m sure if I reapplied the #3 coat it will extend the life of the polish.  Honesly 1 week is enough time for the same color though so I&#x27;ll prob. prefer to change the color after 1 week.  I bought mine in a NYC drug store and spent a LOT more money than I shoud/could have. Next time I&#x27;ll order online.</li>
