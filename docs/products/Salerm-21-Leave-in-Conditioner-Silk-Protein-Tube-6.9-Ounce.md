<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product with on-time delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  It keeps my hair nice and not oily looking.</li>
    <li> Really nice product I recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years &amp; I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m black &amp; I had been chemically straightening my hair for 13 years. Whenever I used this leave-in, my hair was UNBELIEVABLY silky &amp; amazing. Now, I&#x27;m at a point where I haven&#x27;t chemically straightened my hair in over a year. My hair is very thick &amp; unmanageable. But, when I slick some of this stuff on, it&#x27;s a completely different ball game. This stuff is amazing &amp; I will continue to purchase it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better leave-in out there. I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s a bold statement, but I&#x27;ve used a lot of leave-in conditioners &amp; this surpasses them all by far. Amazing stuff. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed</li>
    <li> Awesome product, leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy</li>
    <li> they are all great. I am happy</li>
    <li> Great product, do the job im happy..</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft and smells good :)</li>
    <li> So I already know how well Salerm works since my hair salon uses this stuff and its always been good. This review is based on the shipping. I ordered the leave in conditioner and the silk protein however I never received the B5 Silk Protein. Instead the first package was completely empty (I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that happen before) and the second and third packages contained two tubes of the leave in conditioner. The shipper and I corresponded via email but it appears they just could not get the order right. I will just keep both tubes and order another silk protein from somewhere else. What a mess that turned out to be. I would never order from them again however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My hair is always super soft after use. It is really great for natural hair! My curls stay in tact. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase.  Makes your hair very easy to detangle.  Only takes a little bit!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner! It works very well!! A little goes a long way..at least for my long thin hair. So i guess depending on the lenght and condition of your hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it leaves your hair great super shine and with a beautiful smell.  I used  this product before straghning my hair because it leaves you hair like sakin style ...Strongly recommended</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair.  It repairs and makes my hair shine and does away.  I have gotten this product at the salon in the past, but would not purchase anywhere but Amazon.  Thanks Amazon for having such great procducts for great prices and quick shipping</li>
    <li> My GF used this product and is not the same consistency as the one she previously had plus it doesn&#x27;t have same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check first before buying!</li>
    <li> I like the Salem 21 leave in conditioner. It gives my hair a natural shine. I try it once before dry my hair and my hair was so easy to comb. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and gets out of control during the humid months. This product keeps my hair looking silky and smooth.  Really, it works!</li>
    <li> Fast ship, item as described.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I will not use any other leave in on my hair. I put it on my dry hair and tie my hair in a bun before bedtime and put it on after I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff daily on my dry hair.  I use about a quarter size and at first it seems too much, but I brush my hair, sometimes I put it up on my head or in a pony tail and later when I let it down, boy is it sexy!!  Don&#x27;t be afraid to exeriment with this stuff.  It gives new life to my hair and I don&#x27;t have to wash everyday to get a good look.  I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> If you have porous hair this is a must!....a staple in my hair products. A must try!!! Works everytime. Love love love</li>
    <li> It did not work as I expected. I&#x27;ve been using it and probably need other product that&#x27;s reall for split ends and dry hair.</li>
    <li> good product, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING ....I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT...FAST DELIVERY.....</li>
    <li> Great product. A friend of mine with naturally waived hair like mine recommended me that product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 3 years, I can tell I feel the difference when I don&#x27;t put it after washing my hair. It makes my hair grow and shine.</li>
    <li> Good dispatch and comes quickly.</li>
    <li> I got my order today, it was one day later, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I put off reviewing this product because I wanted to test out the product for at least a month before giving my honest opinion on it.This product works! My hair was prone to split the second it grew past shoulder length until my hair stylist began to use this conditioner after my hair cuts. Now my hair is healthier and a tad longer (I can never really tell with medium-short layered curly hair). However due to certain ingredients found in this product I do not use it on my scalp but everything else works. A little goes a long way. The product itself was shipped on time and arrived a day early than the expected delivery date. Will definitely order again when the tube runs out. :)</li>
    <li> Is a very good aconditioner leave my hair very soft and shining</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product, if you&#x27;re looking to get smooth and shiny hair you should get this protein.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hair softer.</li>
    <li> If you have split ends this is the best product for the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave in conditioner It is officially my HG ! I use it mostly during the colder more drying months just for more nourishment and conditioning . I personally love the smell , the product itself is whitish yellowish and creamy goes on smoothly when evenly applied and I recommend focusing on your most prone to damage areas and it leaves you hair feeling and looking healthier , stronger , soft , smooth , and full of luster ! I used to have the large jar or tub of this an although it had a lot of product it was such a mess to be getting out of so I bought this tube instead and it is so much better just note when you think it&#x27;s done cut the bottle and half and I guarantee there still will be product left . Anyways great leave in conditioner for healthy lustrous hair ! My bf loves how it smells too lol . :)</li>
    <li> It is very good for the first hour after application</li>
    <li> Best way to soften &amp; detangle African American hair after washing! A little goes a long way! All u need is a quater size no more. Great smelling too!</li>
    <li> Best cream EVER for my dry thin hair</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair super soft!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I always come back to this! It has a pleasant smell and leaves my 3c/4a hair moisturized, soft, and shiny.</li>
    <li> Whether I am wearing my hair straight or curly.... I am always faced with a nagging issue of frizz! There is nothing more annoying that trying to look cute, taking the time to do your hair, and having alil humidity or heat cause your cute do to frizz! As, I am familiar with the Salerm products ( such as the Wheat Germ Conditioner) I thought I would give this a try. I had been reviewing BioSilk but I found them to be alil too expensive for the amount of product you get. Also, I feel as though enough conditioner is never enough. I have dark brown hair and if I am not fighting the frizz I am fighting a lack of shine. Over the months, and many YouTube videos later. I have learned some DIY ways to not only ad a nice shine but to also moisturize and condition one&#x27;s hair. I do like this product and the SMELL is unbelievably awesome! After getting side bangs cut in my hair last week....and being lazy I knew I didn&#x27;t want to have to constantly flat iron and curly my bangs. Yesterday after coloring my hair a warmer shade of brown  with John Frieda Precision Foam, I conditioned my hair, added some Salerm Silk Protein leave in, then added Marc Anthony&#x27;s Beach Waves! I am so stoked!. My hair is soft, shiny, smells amazing, and curly..... something it hasn&#x27;t done in many moons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with frizz issues or those with somewhat coarse hair seeking to have that silky straight look!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, my hair absorbs it really well, no build up at all. I needed more protein for my hair and this was the perfect match. It came quickly which was nice. I don&#x27;t use it everyday as it is not my staple hair product, but it definitely softens hair for sure, so I will continue using it as well as my other hair products. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using this for about 3 months. A little goes a long way. I can really feel the difference in my tresses after use of it. I have 3a texture and its perfect for me. I also use it when I need to slick down my hair for ponytails. Months later update: I really love this but it has parabens in it and I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of research on what not to put in your hair parabens is not it. Sorry Salerem I&#x27;ll have 2 fine a replacement</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hair product ive gotten for my damaged hair. Going from black to sandy blonde with highlights id recommend it to anyone . Dont second think it !</li>
    <li> Like the way my hair  feels</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth and shine</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BESSSSSSTTTTT LEAVE IN CONDITIONER! I have about 12... just in case.... lol. I AM OBSESSIVE that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy or straight hair when it wants to be or frizzy depending on the day. This leave in conditioner acts as a gel and make my hair have these beautiful curls and soft... no hard as gel is... I have almost all my friends using it!</li>
    <li> Great product. I used to work as a receptionist for a salon and I would see how would they apply the product to different customers with different types of hair and it would look wonderful. I apply it on the bottom half of my hair. I have long thin hair with no volume so this works perfect, doesn&#x27;t affect my volume and takes the freeze</li>
    <li> I know this product and can recommend to any freezing  hair( I am hair stylist)</li>
    <li> The best treatment out there. I leave it as mask for 15 min, and rinse, leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I get so many compliments on my healthy full hair!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Use it daily and keeps my hair in great condition especially after hair dryer and flat iron usage.</li>
