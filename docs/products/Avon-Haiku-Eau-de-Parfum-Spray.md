      <li>This one is fresh, and unique.</li>

      <li>This scent is so fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>She was trying to use up her old perfumes to enjoy them more.</li>
      <li>It becomes more prominent once you let the initial smell of alcohol wear off that comes with cheaper perfumes.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>The overall smell is very gentle, almost baby powder like but more refined and elegant.</li>
      <li>This is my first review, I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write them, but I really love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>, it was worth it</li>
      <li>It is very crisp and preppy fresh clean, it goes on very strong, but once it dies down it smells clean and floral.</li>
      <li>At first it has a strong floral aroma but after a few minutes it has a nice calming scent that lingers.</li>
      <li>It has become my favorite and about the only scent I can tolerate these days since it seems I&#x27;ve become &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; to perfume.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s the first note you smell immediately</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>It evidently works with my chemistry, since people often compliment it.  </li>
      <li>Overall a clean, floral, slightly sweet scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and soft but very distinctive.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a super sweet scent; it&#x27;s definitely more musky and woodsy with its jasmine and citrus notes.</li>
      <li>After 7 or 8 uses, the initially too strong smell dissappeared, so when you spray it, it won&#x27;t hurt your nose.&lt;br</li>
      <li>sprayed, the smell is WAY too strong initially.</li>
      <li>The scent is very reminicent of estee lauders peasures, so I would call this a cheaper alternative to that, which is my signatue scent</li>
      <li>Also very affordable.</li>
      <li>Cane in fast.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for having it always at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I have not used this perfume in years but decided to give it a chance since it was so reasonable on Amazon.</li>

      <li>I found my new scent!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A bit of a mishap when it was received but everything is in order now.</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle from a friend and I fell in love so light and pretty I will keep on ordering!</li>
    <li> It smells ok, but there&#x27;s just something about it I don&#x27;t like.  When I wear it I find myself thinking something smells weird, and realize it&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of my more expensive perfumes, but it&#x27;s still great. The scent is really strong which helps its longevity. It&#x27;s not a super sweet scent; it&#x27;s definitely more musky and woodsy with its jasmine and citrus notes. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle and packaging. I bought it back when it was $9, it was worth it even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sprayed, the smell is WAY too strong initially. I hold my breath, pushed the button, and can still smell it. However, after a min or two, the smell toned down to a noticeable but comfortable level, and stays subtly noticeable and nice for at least half a day. After 7 or 8 uses, the initially too strong smell dissappeared, so when you spray it, it won&#x27;t hurt your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell itself is nice. It is clean, it is floral. It might be a tiny bit citrusy, but it is so subtle and blend in so nicely as to be unnoticeable. It is also subtly musky. When first sprayed, the musk isn&#x27;t noticeable, but after a few hours, it comes out a little more. Words that it calls to my mind are \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, a clean, floral and fresh perfum. While it is too strong when first sprayed, its fine and tones down after a min or two, and its not a prob after a few uses. If you are looking for fruity or sweet or warm or spicy or musky scent, this is not for you. The lasting power is about 6 hrs, so I guess thats good?</li>
    <li> This is one of VERY few perfumes I love. I don&#x27;t like scents that are ordinary, sweet, or overly floral. This one is fresh, and unique. Even good enough to make it your trademark scent.</li>
    <li> I love Haiku. My sister got it for me for Christmas, and when I wear it total strangers ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and I get complimented on it all the time!</li>
    <li> I help sell Avon so I have seen the fragrances come and go but this one is a keeper. I use this one myself. It is a wonderful scent. I get compliments from people when I am out and about. Having gone thru many fragrances of Avons and also other companies, I can truly recommend this one. You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it.  You could also find a Avon Represenitive and try a sample. When you try it, all you will say is WOW! I found my new scent!</li>
    <li> This is my first review, I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write them, but I really love this perfume.  My mom bought it for me several years ago and now I can&#x27;t be without it.  I&#x27;ve also gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> It smells awful. I got it as a grad gift, and I&#x27;m guessing the person who gave it to me was just left over gifts they didn&#x27;t want. It&#x27;s more of a cologne type of smell. It would suit more on a man than a girl.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. She LOVES it and has bought it for herself and for others.</li>
    <li> I got this from my mom, for brithday one year, and people always ask me what I am wearing. Its smells awesome. I purchased the whole set through avon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d sniff myself all day in public, but I&#x27;d look like a weirdo. I love this scent, so happy Amazon carries it. Otherwise I&#x27;d be ebaying it and I want it now! :D</li>
    <li> I always loved this fragrance, it is clean fresh and light. The best part is the price is reasonable. I started selling avon a few weeks ago and now I can get the fragrance at a good discount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this scent for a long time.  I had it years ago and I never forgot the scent.  It&#x27;s unforgettable.  I get good compliments.  Connie L</li>
    <li> Lately I have been obsessed with purchasing scents that have notes of jasmine, or that are completely infused with jasmine. The reason for this is mt love for Estee Lauders Pleasures parfume which is high intensity jasmine but soft and subtle that its not overpowering your nose. I receieved this parfum at about 4:00pm today and immediately sprits some on my arm to test the fragrance and of course how long it lasts. It definitely has jasmine, that&#x27;s the first note you smell immediately and if you haven&#x27;t smelled jasmine before you will now. The overall smell is very gentle, almost baby powder like but more refined and elegant. It becomes more prominent once you let the initial smell of alcohol wear off that comes with cheaper perfumes. However by 5pm the smell half way faded and by 6 it was completely gone. You would definitely have to use this throughout the day hence the 4 stars. The scent is very reminicent of estee lauders peasures, so I would call this a cheaper alternative to that, which is my signatue scent and I wish I could bathe in but that would be too expensive.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I always get compliments every time I wear it.  Thanks for having it always at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> i love this brand its one of the fav that I like&lt;br /&gt;the smell burst out and everyone that&#x27;s around&lt;br /&gt;you can smell it</li>
    <li> My favorite scent!!!! I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> The price-quality relationship is balanced. It has an interesting smell, with hints of &amp;#34;Asia&amp;#34;. For nonconformist ladies it is just perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;ll use it.. but it&#x27;s not my favorite. It smells ordinary. I sometimes spray it on my dog. It&#x27;s definitely not a bad buy, but not a good buy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I did not feel like locating a representative and I needed to purchase this as a gift for my secret santa at work. Worked great, Thanks</li>
    <li> Cane in fast.  Love it I would buy it again</li>
    <li> If you love scents like tommy hilfiger and tommy bahama you will love this sunset haiku from avon. It is very crisp and preppy fresh clean, it goes on very strong, but once it dies down it smells clean and floral. Nice every day work fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sastified with tthis perfume i really enjoy and the smell is delicious. I will continue to order as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on how good this smells.  Very fresh, light, and non-offensive.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume!! It lasts long and the scent is a soft, fancy smell!! I&#x27;ve always loved this smell! I got it years ago as a present and never knew it was such a cheap price! I thought it was a more expensive bottle of perfume! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I discovered this perfume with a sample from an Avon rep years and years ago. I have worn it ever since. My favorite perfume of all time is YSL Paris, but that is not something I can afford. Haiku has similar floral and oriental notes and I feel it is an inexpensive and yet quality substitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear it, people ask what it is and tell me that they love it. I have had strangers ask me after I walk by. It starts out strong, and a little goes a long way, but it is not overpowering or cloying as some florals can be. The fact that Avon has a whole Haiku collection to choose from is a wonderful way to create a signature scent experience for yourself or the person you might be buying this for. I have never had anyone tell me that they disliked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It is one of the only reasons I even consider Avon anymore. I hope there are no plans to ever get rid of this product, but I would create a serious stockpile for myself if so.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product from an Avon representative in my town a few years ago. This one from Amazon is exactly like the one I bought directly from Avon. It has a wonderful scent and is in a beautiful glass bottle. Wonderful product, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because Spring time is just around the corner and I needed something on the lighter side. I have not used this perfume in years but decided to give it a chance since it was so reasonable on Amazon. At first it has a strong floral aroma but after a few minutes it has a nice calming scent that lingers. Overall a clean, floral, slightly sweet scent.</li>
    <li> Just as interesting if not more than its name.  I stumbled across this beauty while on a shopping trip in NY.  I was just as surprised to find out that Avon offered this wonderful fragrance.  It&#x27;s light and soft but very distinctive.  People are always remarking on how good it smells.  I love to spray it on immediately after showering.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this perfume.  Find the nearest Avon rep. and GET IT!!!!  I have even purchased it from Ebay.</li>
    <li> This scent is so fresh and clean.  It evidently works with my chemistry, since people often compliment it.  Although I thought it doesn&#x27;t last long, a couple hours after I sprayed it on, a woman told me I smelled up the whole art gallery (where I was doing volunteer work) and it smelled so good. She had to write the name down.  I&#x27;ve had people comment on it shopping in stores as well.  Always the word &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; is used.  I believe it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent and I do not normally like citrus scents.  I don&#x27;t detect anything citrus about it, certainly not lemon (I would then for sure hate it).  It has become my favorite and about the only scent I can tolerate these days since it seems I&#x27;ve become &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; to perfume.  That is, nearly all fragrances, all brands, cause a metallic taste in my mouth, often make me sneeze.  And the more expensive, the worse the adverse reaction on my senses.  So price-wise, this is great too!</li>
    <li> Very cheap for such an amazing smelling perfume . . I love  it so much I almost dont wanna use it &amp; save it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Avon has done it again with this wonderful fragrance. Light and hypnotic scent to  arouse the senses. Wonderful price for a wonderful cologne</li>
    <li> While visiting a relative I woke up in the night smelling her Haiku that she sprayed on towels in the bathroom. She was trying to use up her old perfumes to enjoy them more. I thought it was so pleasant. I knew the name of the perfume was Haiku so I went to the big department stores in my area to try to find it. No one had it but I did try spraying new much more expensive perfumes on my arms. So when I went home I tried amazon.com and found that it was such a reasonable price. And the smell of the Haiku rivals the expensive perfumes that I tried.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because the person did send it on time and it was what I had ordered. However, I did not mean to order it. I wanted order the Haiku-Sunset perfume. Personally, I strongly dislike the smell of the one that I had gotten. But the user did send it unused and as promised.</li>
    <li> Seem to be old as scent was weak and off its natural smell. Would not hold smell.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Haiku in college when I was broke. It still smells the same and feels the same.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my Mom because she liked a sample she received. She enjoys it. The price was reasonable and I could ship it directly to her.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and I will definitely purchase it again. It came quickly and it was just what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good!!! Beautiful case and its smell can keep a long time .</li>
    <li> If you want attention, wear this parfum. I wear it all year round. It never fails that someone ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing or that it smells good. It is clean &amp; not overpowering. Also very affordable.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. My best friend had gotten this for Christmas one year from her mom when we were in our early teens and I would use hers all the time, now I can buy it myself I use it all the time.  I get lots of complements from coustomers and coworkers.</li>
    <li> Perfect mix of flowers, smells wonderful on and not an over powering smell what so ever. Perfect perfume if you need to add a light smell of flowers without over doing it.</li>
    <li> I usually hate avon and its products but I love this perfume.  It is such a wonderful fresh scent. The smell is for a &#x27;day use&#x27; but you can wear evenings too.</li>
    <li> Great Smelling Perfume &amp; It Lasts All Day!!!&lt;br /&gt; Would Highly Recommend to a Friend.  I get alot of compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;In Expensive Also.</li>
