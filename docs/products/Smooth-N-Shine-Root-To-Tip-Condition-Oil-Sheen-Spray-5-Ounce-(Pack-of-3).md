      <li>But it was awesome when I straighten it.</li>
      <li>The best way to explain the difference is Googling afro ponytails....</li>
      <li>Also, the kit came with an awesome sample condition that I used on my daughter after we processed it.</li>
      <li>Good luck!  </li>
      <li>Great results on this 3abcd head of weather reactive frizz.</li>
      <li>My mom told me to get the product because she uses it on her hair and it makes her curls look great.</li>
      <li>I used this product and it turned out great.</li>
      <li>If you did not do that and your hair fell out, then it is nobody&#x27;s fault but your own!</li>
      <li>Good luck on your hair care journey</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t believe all this post-processing heat was good for my hair.</li>
      <li>hair product that it would be good for my hair</li>
      <li>I wondered if it was so good</li>
      <li>Strand test ON YOUR OWN HAIR, not a guinea pig&#x27;s, and go from there.  </li>
      <li>Wash n Go now with nice curls.</li>
      <li>I think I sat my own hair on fire........</li>
      <li>They are more manageable and look nice, but this is not the result I was expecting.</li>
      <li>When I put it on my hair it was very smooth</li>
      <li>I saw too many 1 star reviews &amp; hair damage stories and decided not to use it.  </li>
      <li>If you diffuse your hair with a blow dryer it will leave you with looser more manageable curls.  </li>
      <li>Now if you have healthy hair there is nothing to worry about.</li>
      <li>At age 9, I love the fro</li>
      <li>a friday night i did the \\&quot;strand test\\&quot; to make sure my hair didnt break or anything of that nature.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s condition more because of the \\&quot;keratin\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>So ladies who love your nappies or curls, do not use.  </li>
      <li>This product made my hair manageable, maintained moisture and is healthy after.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it&#x27;d get so tangled that it would take about an hour to comb through it all without tearing all my hair out.  </li>
      <li>both Cysteine Hcl and ethanolamine thioglycolate are close to the top of the ingredient list - like on a box of texturizer].</li>
      <li>SMOOTH N SHINE EVER AGAIN!</li>
      <li>When I got home &amp; opened the box I saw way too many warnings for it to be &amp;#34;Not-A-Relaxor.  </li>
      <li>but after us my hair is permanently STRAIGHT!!!!</li>
      <li>Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t dare put these chemicals on beautiful natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I regret ever using smooth n shine hair tamer more and more.</li>
      <li>, I bet most people would think this is just a cheap at home Keratin hair straightening treatment.</li>
      <li>A strong possibility exists that it can take the curl out of your hair with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked for me just fine,  so if anyone reads this</li>
      <li>so I assumed my hair would be fine.</li>
      <li>IT SAYS YOU&#x27;RE FINE</li>
      <li>Please read the label AND the fine print.</li>
      <li>why was it so cheap, but</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a bzzagent and got to try it free)</li>
      <li>So I figured I&#x27;d try the Smooth &#x60;n Shine Polisher Keratin.</li>
      <li>I loved her natural curl over the bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; I have beautiful \\&quot;mermaid\\&quot; hair if I let it air dry after I put a ton of products in it</li>
      <li>IF YOU DO BUY THIS PRODUCT, BE AWARE OF THE SMELL!!</li>
      <li>flat iron your hair or it won&#x27;t look very nice at all.</li>
      <li>B007TIW6WG Smooth N&#x27; Shine Keratin Power Super Hair Tamer]]</li>
      <li>I went fully natural in September of 2013 , and had been looking for something to make my hair more manageable!</li>
      <li>I was super excited to get to try this product specifically for the fact that this promised \\&quot;wash and wear curls\\</li>
      <li>The processing in step one can make your hair feel like straw, but run a GOOD conditioner thru and rinse before the second step and it will help with that.</li>
      <li>This one has been the most gentle.</li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking it wasn&#x27;t a perm and found out it was just that a mild perm.</li>
      <li>My hair started breaking when I washed it for the first time!  </li>
      <li>would not advise for naturals who love their naturally curly texture!</li>
      <li>Nope, no, wrong!</li>
      <li>It has a pretty wrapping, but don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
      <li>Smooth&#x27;n Shine Polishing Keratin Powder promises to relax hair and give a choice to choose curly or straight.</li>
      <li>my hair is soft and curly :) I will use again</li>
      <li>Well, even though it&#x27;s breaking off now, which it wasnt doing in it&#x27;s natural state, I&#x27;m not cutting it off!!!  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t blow it out to see how straight it will get, but I used it mainly to get more control of her hair.</li>
      <li>yeah right.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really say on the box that it is a mild relaxer</li>
      <li>Which could be real problematic for someone who works in the food industry - lucky for me</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and soft and has a defined S curl pattern.</li>
      <li>I will stick to my normal hair moisterizer that makes my hair feel great with little to no breakage</li>
      <li>But i figured the first step didnt do any harm</li>
      <li>The labeling and instructions are very misleading!  </li>
      <li>First once I opened it, it REEKS of perm solution.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would try this product for the first time it caught my eye</li>
      <li>Between the testing and actual application I invested more than 3 hours in the process.</li>
      <li>looks like I&#x27;m going to need to buy more products just to get my hair back to curly.</li>
      <li>I decided to go with curly - seemed logical</li>
      <li>and now I have to wait to apply some REAL relaxer!  </li>
      <li>I followed the directs exactly the way I was supposed to</li>
      <li>I am completely natural and this product had my hair light weight and slinging.</li>
      <li>Anyways I tried this product for the first time and it made my hair puffy</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll honestly cry if it breaks off like the other reviewer&#x27;s hair did.  </li>
      <li>she on the other hand wasn&#x27;t as thrilled.</li>
      <li>I read the directions over and over to make sure that I would be applying the product correctly, it was pretty simple, straight forward.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair 3 times since doing their \\&quot;semi permanent\\&quot; treatment, I&#x27;ve gone back to doing my old routine of mousse and hair cremes since this product was not at all effective.</li>
      <li>I loved it at first the after results are left my hair dry damaged</li>
      <li>twice Next you apply all of tube one, which was  easy (for me anyway, because i had my mother do it)</li>
      <li>whole point of me wanting my hair straight is because it was going to be my first day of school..</li>
      <li>Maybe it has to be a certain strength to qualify as a \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot; or \\&quot;texturizer.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>If you decide to use, apply to new growth only for retouches make sure you&#x27;re prepared to blow dry/</li>
      <li>You might be OK if you blow dry it straight as well</li>
      <li>i was done, my hair was straight but still very \\&quot;POOFY\\&quot;, i tried hair spray, to see if it would flatten.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>my hair is naturally really curly from root to tip.</li>
      <li>After I was done with this treatment the ends of my hair were absolutely straight.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my hair getting straight has to do with me dying it</li>
      <li>The product does absolutely nothing of what it says it will do, not to mention it contradicts itself.</li>
      <li>However, Im very upset it hasnt reversed after 6 weeks and multiwashes.</li>
      <li>It was really labor intensive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I was ready to cut my hair when I discovered this product.  </li>
      <li>I do however put my hair up every night to sleep, so this rule was really annoying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>daughter HAD the perfect naturally curly thick hair, but even professional iron-outs didnt last more than 2 days and especially were no match for humidity.  </li>
      <li>I received this product and I was excited to see if it would actually work.</li>
      <li>towards my roots my hair was completely unchanged but the rest was very very straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was super excited to get to try this product specifically for the fact that this promised \\&quot;wash and wear curls\\&quot; I have beautiful \\&quot;mermaid\\&quot; hair if I let it air dry after I put a ton of products in it I.E mousse, hair creme, leave in conditioner, detangler, and on occasion I&#x27;ll break out a serum, With no products it&#x27;s this wavy fluffball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After reading the directions I was a bit less excited, the amount of work involved for something that only lasted 5 washes was a bit disheartening, After the finishing all the steps of the treatment which include blow drying and flat ironing your hair, you:&lt;br /&gt;-can&#x27;t wash your hair for 3 days (yuck!)&lt;br /&gt;-Can&#x27;t wear your hair in a ponytail or headband for 2 days. Which could be real problematic for someone who works in the food industry - lucky for me I do not. I do however put my hair up every night to sleep, so this rule was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt; but still I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll wait for a day my mother has off, and I&#x27;ll have her help me and things will go a bit faster, and having company is always a bonus when you&#x27;re doing something tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you have to wash your hair twice Next you apply all of tube one, which was  easy (for me anyway, because i had my mother do it) she on the other hand wasn&#x27;t as thrilled. The \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; in tube one was clear...she had a hard time telling where she definitely got the stuff and where she didn&#x27;t on hair that was damp. Secondly the stuff in tube one smells HORRID. If I had to guess what the bog of eternal stench smelled like in Labyrinth I&#x27;d say it was close to to the smell of tube one. I&#x27;m not exaggerating at all, The room we did my hair in as well as my hair still stunk long after I had neutralized the tamer. My hair smelled so bad even my boyfriend, who came over hours after I had finished said my hair smelled funny. But anyway, the \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; was to be left in for 25 minutes, rinsed well, then apply the neutralizer for a bit and also rinse well...however, there was a revitalizing conditioner included...with no mention of it in the directions or on the box. so I just used it after the neutralizer.. two hours later from start to finish my hair was flat ironed and didn&#x27;t look any different then when I usually straighten it..with lack of faith I figured I&#x27;d tough out the 3 days. When it came time to finally shampoo and condition my hair, It did feel a bit smoother while in the shower, I had hoped my skepticism was about to be pleasantly surprised. Nope, no, wrong! I got out the shower, brushed my hair. put NOTHING in it in order to test their promise of \\&quot;wash and wear curls\\&quot; My hair looked as crappy as it usually does when I put nothing in it. What a waste of time! If I had spent money on this (I&#x27;m a bzzagent and got to try it free) I would have been infuriated. I&#x27;ve washed my hair 3 times since doing their \\&quot;semi permanent\\&quot; treatment, I&#x27;ve gone back to doing my old routine of mousse and hair cremes since this product was not at all effective. There is hardly any sign of my beautiful curls coming back, what curl I do have is  limp and lifeless. I regret ever using smooth n shine hair tamer more and more. I just want my hair back! D:</li>
    <li> I used this product and it turned out great. My natural hair is frizzy, moisture deprived and I did not want to embark on a product journey while walking around looking a hot mess. This product made my hair manageable, maintained moisture and is healthy after. I recommend the product and  2 other people I know used the super and there hair reverted back to its natural state after multiple washes.. Good luck on your hair care journey and I hope if not this product you find what your looking for.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product today because I saw it on sale at the store for $4.  I wondered if it was so good why was it so cheap, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  When I got home &amp; opened the box I saw way too many warnings for it to be &amp;#34;Not-A-Relaxor.  Then I saw gloves.  I thought this must be a chemical!  So before I hard it I said let me check Amazon reviews because they always tell it like it is.  Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you!  I saw too many 1 star reviews &amp; hair damage stories and decided not to use it.  Oh well I waisted $4, but I keep my hair!  Thanks again Amazon reviewers.</li>
    <li> This product amazed me at how it loosened the curl in my 4B naturally coarse, dry, hair.  But!!!  It actually damaged my already fragile hair.  I don&#x27;t even know why I expected this product to make my hair soft, moist, &amp; improve it&#x27;s condition more because of the \\&quot;keratin\\&quot;.  Well, even though it&#x27;s breaking off now, which it wasnt doing in it&#x27;s natural state, I&#x27;m not cutting it off!!!  Don&#x27;t use this stuff with hairtype like mine.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke.  I actually thought because it was a &amp;#34;keratin treatment&amp;#34; hair product that it would be good for my hair, WRONG!  I followed the directs exactly the way I was supposed to and this thing fried my hair big time!  I have used other relaxers in the past and none of them have done to me what this product has.  My hair is damaged beyond repair, I have breakage all over my head and patches of long and short hair because my hair keeps breaking off falling out. I called the 1-800-424-5458 number to complain and get a refund and low and behold they are not accepting any calls at this time.  What ever you do please don&#x27;t use this product, it took awhile to grow my hair to the length I wanted and now I have no choice but the cut it off now.  This company doesn&#x27;t give a crap about their customers.</li>
    <li> Contains elements that become formaldehyde when heated</li>
    <li> I have thick dark hair that are very stubborn and I have hard time controlling it. My grays grow exclusively upright. Do you have a half way natural product for me? I am all over it. Smooth&#x27;n Shine Polishing Keratin Powder promises to relax hair and give a choice to choose curly or straight. I decided to go with curly - seemed logical: my hair curl normally when wet and stay that way unless comb them. The process is very similar to coloring hair, but less messy. I expected my hair to curl as they normally do if not brushed. But they didn&#x27;t. My hair is rather wavy now - not curly. They are more manageable and look nice, but this is not the result I was expecting. Did I do something wrong? The instruction didn&#x27;t really say how to style curly hair for the first time - only maintenance. The conditioner is not even mentioned in the instruction. Was I supposed to use it same day too? Hmm, I am slightly confused. I wanted to let my hair dry naturally, but later on blow dried them with the diffuser.[[ASIN:B007TIW6JY Smooth N&#x27; Shine Keratin Power Regular Hair Tamer]][[ASIN:B007TIW6WG Smooth N&#x27; Shine Keratin Power Super Hair Tamer]]</li>
    <li> My hair started breaking when I washed it for the first time!  Never again!  Wash and go yeah right.  You will have to keep flat ironing your hair whats the point?  I&#x27;ve had to chop off all my hair</li>
    <li> my hair is naturally really curly from root to tip. I had dyed my hair just about 3 months ago and my hair suddenly started to act weird and get frizzy easier. My mom told me to get the product because she uses it on her hair and it makes her curls look great. She&#x27;s dyed her hair an unreasonable amount of times so I assumed my hair would be fine. well maybe I need to stop assuming.. After I was done with this treatment the ends of my hair were absolutely straight. towards my roots my hair was completely unchanged but the rest was very very straight. I almost started crying. I loved my curls and all I wanted was to get rid of the frizz and tame it just a little. I don&#x27;t know if my hair getting straight has to do with me dying it but I am very disappointed. I hope this treatment is actually temporary like it says. Even though my hair is very soft and shiny now it&#x27;s not worth having curls at the roots and straight ends. looks like I&#x27;m going to need to buy more products just to get my hair back to curly. NO MORE CHEMICALS FOR MY HAIR, lesson learned. And for all you naturally curlies out there... DO NOT USE THIS I repeat DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I encourage all sisters not to buy this stuff. It has a pretty wrapping, but don&#x27;t be fooled! I have naturally curly hair and decided to give this a try. It stripped my hair, left it dry, and my ends tangle up now, when they never did before. I called to get a refund in December of 2013. It took them 10 calls later &amp; (3) checks going to the wrong location to finally send me a check on 3/6/14 that I deposited. My bank sent me notice that the check had a stop payment on it &amp; turned around a charged me $12 dollars in addition to taking the $7.00 back. I&#x27;ll never use them again &amp; you shouldn&#x27;t either. The product does absolutely nothing of what it says it will do, not to mention it contradicts itself. The staff told me that it was my fault I deposited the wrong check. They read off to me several check numbers that had supposedly been sent to my house. I tried to explain all of the confusion; however, they said that it was my fault I deposited the wrong check &amp; will not pay the bank fee.</li>
    <li> This is a HEAT ACTIVATED RELAXER!  If you want your hair to be permanently straightened, then this product is for you.  Your curls will not revert back to curls if you blow dry and flat iron it after rinsing out this product.  If you want to keep your curls, DO NOT FLAT IRON HAIR immediately after using this.  If you diffuse your hair with a blow dryer it will leave you with looser more manageable curls.  You might be OK if you blow dry it straight as well but if you get it bone straight with a flat iron or pressing comb you can kiss your curls bye bye.</li>
    <li> Awful,terrible and disgusted. I recommend not using this product. I was so happy at first, but noticed my hair was breaking off very badly. I had to have my hair cut and treated with a protein treatment, which I will continue for 6 weeks. Wish I would of never straightened my curls out, but it&#x27;s returning back slowly. Hope my hair looks normal before my brother&#x27;s wedding in September. Unhappy customer.</li>
    <li> I have read a couple reviews. Now if you have healthy hair there is nothing to worry about. My curl pattern is a 4b/c so with this the wash and go inot for me. My hair looked like a marley braid dry. But it was awesome when I straighten it. My edges lay down. I am completely natural and this product had my hair light weight and slinging. It is very shiny, very soft, verlightweight. Unlike with a perm there is no burning sensation. When I washed my hair I didn&#x27;t feel any sort of burning or waxy feeling. Pretty simple to use. It really mad my hair manageable!!!! Especially in the center of my head. That&#x27;s my tough spot. This is only day one but so far no breakage.  So I&#x27;m happy I tired this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would be a nice way to de-frizz my curls, but I was so, so wrong.  First once I opened it, it REEKS of perm solution.  That should have tipped me to throw it in the trash, but I just ran with it.  Well, after the hour and some change I spent doing the chemicals and the 45m I spent drying and flat ironing my hair, it looks and feels worse than it did before the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  Seriously, my hair didn&#x27;t feel or look this bad after I BLEACHED it!  And now, after reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m really scared to wash it.  It feels brittle and straw-like, I&#x27;ll honestly cry if it breaks off like the other reviewer&#x27;s hair did.  Save your money, time, and sanity and just buy some kick-ass leave-in conditioner</li>
    <li> broke my hair off...please do not use.</li>
    <li> It loosen my curls just enough and it made my hair wavy! I loved it at first the after results are left my hair dry damaged and it began to break off! I will never use this product again! I ended up cutting all my hair off and starting over... Curlies I&#x27;m warning you</li>
    <li> I have really thick and curly hair, and too much of it too....I think I sat my own hair on fire........this product damaged my hair and now have to go trim at lease three inches!! so disappointing.......:(</li>
    <li> I went fully natural in September of 2013 , and had been looking for something to make my hair more manageable! My aunt and I used a texturizer and it left my hair hard and frizzy .. even with using the stuff that came with it.. then I saw this in Walmart .. I tried it.. my hair is soft and curly :) I will use again</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the WORST product I have ever used. My hair WAS natural 4B and 4C but after us my hair is permanently STRAIGHT!!!! This is not what I wanted. I wanted to temporarily soften the curls. I washed and washed my hair but no curl pattern came back. Not only that my hair became so dry and started falling out. I had to cut 5&amp;#34; off so because my hair was so horrible. DO NOT BUY....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser with a 5 year old biracial daughter. I&#x27;ve been trying everything I know on her hair since I could get her to sit still. Her hair is unevenly curly and gets unmanageable and tangled quickly, causing alot of crying and fussing. A relaxer would be to strong for her hair, so I used a couple of different professional texturizers on her. This one has been the most gentle. I haven&#x27;t blow it out to see how straight it will get, but I used it mainly to get more control of her hair. It calmed down the puffyness, and smooth down the cutical right away. It doesn&#x27;t look damaged at all. I did use a conditioner between step one and step two. The processing in step one can make your hair feel like straw, but run a GOOD conditioner thru and rinse before the second step and it will help with that. Also, the kit came with an awesome sample condition that I used on my daughter after we processed it. You could use that.&lt;br /&gt; I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle with this product, but it did better that I expected, and was easier on her hair than the professional stuff I used.</li>
    <li> If you are natural and want to stay that way, you may not want to use this product unless you want to tex-lax. It doesn&#x27;t really say on the box that it is a mild relaxer but I guess the word \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; is supposed to tip you off. That and you need to use the \\&quot;neutralizer\\&quot; after applying the \\&quot;protein smoothing treatment.\\&quot; Just by looking at the box, I bet most people would think this is just a cheap at home Keratin hair straightening treatment. And the whole \\&quot;lasting versatility without relaxing\\&quot; is enough to throw anyone off. I haven&#x27;t used it since I read the ingredients first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protein Smoothing Treatment: Aqua (Water), Cysteine Hcl, Ethanolamine, Sodium Bicarbonate, Urea, Hydroxyethycelluose, Ethanolamine Thioglycolate, Ppg-1-Peg-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Decyl Glucoside, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Aloe Bardensis Leaf Extract, Propylene Glycol, Etidronic Acid, Polyquaternium-7, Hydrolyzed Silk, Parfum (Fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutralizing Milk: Aqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogen Peroxide, Etidronic Acid, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Ceteareth-30, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dimethiconol, Hydroxycetyl Hydroxyethyl Dimonium Chloride, 2,6-Dicarboxypyridine, Ppg-1 Trideceth-6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to cosmeticsinfo.org, ethanolamine thioglycolate is in the same category as ammonium thioglycolate. \\&quot;Thioglycolic Acid and it salts and esters modify hair fibers to facilitate changes to the structure of the fibers, such as with permanent waves or with hair straightening. They are also used to chemically break down hair fibers so that unwanted hair can be removed by simply wiping it from the skin.\\&quot; This is typically the ingredient for no lye relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Cysteine is \\&quot;used for permanent wave applications predominantly in Asia. Again the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the hair&#x27;s keratin.\\&quot; See wikipedia.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium hydroxide (in the neutralizing milk) is caustic soda a/k/a lye. However, in small amounts sodium hydroxide is used as a cleaning agent/surfactant. See cosmeticscop.com. Since this is in the rinsing solution, I don&#x27;t think enough sodium hydroxide is in it to act like a relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s probably why this product smells so bad. It&#x27;s the smell of relaxer/texturizer in the \\&quot;protein smoothing treatment.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad thing if you want a mild, potentially less damaging texturizer to make wash and gos a bit easier but it is not a keratin treatment. A strong possibility exists that it can take the curl out of your hair with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 2 stars due to the way this product is marketed and packaged. Not sure how they are able to get away with saying this is not a relaxer. Probably a technical loophole with the FDA definition. It appears to use chemicals in a high enough concentration to break down disulfide hair bonds [both Cysteine Hcl and ethanolamine thioglycolate are close to the top of the ingredient list - like on a box of texturizer]. Maybe it has to be a certain strength to qualify as a \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot; or \\&quot;texturizer.\\&quot; It will still damage hair like a normal relaxer just not to the same extent.</li>
    <li> Everything on the box leads you to believe that this is just a keratin treatment.  It&#x27;s not until you open the bottle of smoothing treatment and begin applying  that you realize THIS IS A PERM. Curly girls BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were looking for a less damaging relaxer, then by all means continue. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t dare put these chemicals on beautiful natural hair.  Low rating because the box is SO MISLEADING.</li>
    <li> I gave this two stars because it is simple to use. BUTTTTTT it smells terrible, and my thinking was &amp;#34;since it is not a professional product it can&#x27;t be strong&amp;#34;......WRONG!!!!!!!! I have Thick Spanish hair not nappy at all, I can blow it out easily but since I am constantly in the gym i wanted something to make my blow out time shorter. I only left it in for 15minutes instead of the 20 suggested and thank god because it damaged my hair and it is now breaking and falling all over. When i blew it out is felt rubbery and kept tangling up.  :-(</li>
    <li> Awful! It may not show at first but it causes major breakage!</li>
    <li> Great results on this 3abcd head of weather reactive frizz. Wash n Go now with nice curls.</li>
    <li> So, I took the plunge and tried an at home Keratin. My hair is fine and soft and has a defined S curl pattern. But it can not handle humidity. Nor can it handle a relaxer. (Although I will do the occasional texturizer in August) So I figured I&#x27;d try the Smooth &#x60;n Shine Polisher Keratin. It was really labor intensive. Between the testing and actual application I invested more than 3 hours in the process. Then I was supposed to rinse continuously for 8 minutes. I began to prune after a while. THEN you have to blow it dry. Then you have to flat iron it. I put on heat protectant but I can&#x27;t believe all this post-processing heat was good for my hair. When I was done my soft wavy hair was gone, replace by coarse, dull, dried out looking locks that were NOT straighter than they would have been if I had just used a hot comb. When I got in to work I kept getting asked what happened to my hair. \\&quot;Humidity got to you, huh?\\&quot; Horrible. They have a money-back guarantee. But how do I get my hair back?</li>
    <li> I am biracial I have been using relaxers since I was 5 my hair was just so curly and in manageable I thought I would try this product for the first time it caught my eye so instead of reaching for my normal relaxer I decided to try this . I only relax my hair 2-3 times a year. My hair is always soft and very very manageable when I use a normal relaxer. Anyways I tried this product for the first time and it made my hair puffy I mean wild I followed all the instructions and I had to break down and put my hair moisterizer in I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t give you the option of putting any hair moisturizer in I will never buy this product again I will stick to my normal hair moisterizer that makes my hair feel great with little to no breakage and I can usually do anything with.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store and followed the directions and it damaged my hair. Yes it made my curls loose but the texture of my hair changed in a unfavorable way. I wish I would&#x27;ve never used.</li>
    <li> Horrible- my daughters hair broke off all around the hairline front and back, its going take a year to grow out. Will have to keep it short now for a long times until grown</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time a week ago because I wear my hair straight and was in need of a relaxer but did not want to used something so harsh.  It&#x27;s been nearly four months since I used a creme relaxer so you can imagine the new growth.  When I&#x27;d wash my hair, it&#x27;d take forever because my hair is halfway down my back and somewhat thick too. On top of that, it&#x27;d get so tangled that it would take about an hour to comb through it all without tearing all my hair out.  So I was at my wit&#x27;s end.  I was ready to cut my hair when I discovered this product.  I thought I&#x27;d try it and if it didn&#x27;t work then cutting  was the next step. Well, contrary to every other review I&#x27;ve read on here, this product really help me. It promised manageable hair and that&#x27;s what I got.  Some are disappointed because the product ruined their-what must&#x27;ve been perfect- hair,  but it doesn&#x27;t claim to work miracles.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a relaxer, so you won&#x27;t walk away with straight luxurious hair, unless you blow it dry AND straighten it, which is what I did.  Also it says on the box that it is a SEMI-PERMANENT, so common sense would tell you that it has chemicals in it that will change your hair to a certain extent. So ladies who love your nappies or curls, do not use.  Please read the label AND the fine print. The disclaimer also tells you to perform a strand test. If you did not do that and your hair fell out, then it is nobody&#x27;s fault but your own! Every product is not for everyone.  It worked for me just fine,  so if anyone reads this and they&#x27;re curious about using it, I say try it for yourself. Strand test ON YOUR OWN HAIR, not a guinea pig&#x27;s, and go from there.  Good luck!  :)</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! IT SAYS YOU&#x27;RE FINE IF YOU&#x27;VE USED A RELAXER BEFORE... YOU ARE NOT. THE LAST TIME I USED A RELAXER WAS OVER 2 YEARS AGO AND THIS THING FRIED MY HAIR SOOOO BAD IT&#x27;S RUINED. I WAS SO CLOSE TO GETTING MY HAIR PRETTY AND SOFT AND THIS THING RUINED IT I WILL NEVER EVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT BY SMOOTH N SHINE EVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I used this and my hair is just as nappy as it was when I started!  UGH!!!!  I followed the instructions to a tee and now I have to wait to apply some REAL relaxer!  pissed!</li>
    <li> I recently seen this product on another website and have been so excited about it because i have VERY curly,rough,nappy,long and hard to manage hair, and nothing EVER seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a friday night i did the \\&quot;strand test\\&quot; to make sure my hair didnt break or anything of that nature. I&#x27;ve seen people say the smell was horrible so i waited untill everyone was gone the next day.&lt;br /&gt; I shampood my hair, and then put step one in my hair. The smell was obserd !! But i already had a product smell the same way so it wasent a bother.. Then i washed it out, which seemed like it took FOREVER !! I combed my hair while washing it out and it stil seemed like it was still left in my hair.. So i went on anyway.. I seen that it said do not put the product on your scalp or skin as it may irritate you.. But i figured the first step didnt do any harm so i didnt pay it any attention. I put step two (the milk) in my hair and it DID burn for a bit.. Nothing bad to stop me though. So i went on and it seemed to go away as i let it sit for 10 mins.  Then i washed it out.&lt;br /&gt; It didnt \\&quot;FEEL\\&quot; soft as i thought it would at first. But i went ahead and blow dried my hair..&lt;br /&gt; It got softer as it was drying. My hair WAS poofy but not quite \\&quot;frizy\\&quot; as i thought it usually is. It DID take alot of curls out though, and i WAS surprised.  Then i straightend it with an instyler. I could immediately tell that my hair was stronger since it didnt break while combing and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;When i was done, my hair was straight but still very \\&quot;POOFY\\&quot;, i tried hair spray, to see if it would flatten.&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of me wanting my hair straight is because it was going to be my first day of school.. Since it wouldnt stay still i went ahead and put it in a ponytail. (even though it says dont, but i had no choice) but it is STILL soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i gave it four stars is because: my hair isnt flat like it should be (i even re-straightned i) but overall, i would use this product again and be aware to use a product that would tame the frizziness to stop it from poofing.&lt;br /&gt;+++ IF YOU DO BUY THIS PRODUCT, BE AWARE OF THE SMELL!!</li>
    <li> This product was not a good choice for my curly hair. I&#x27;m a natural girl no chemicals but I was looking for something to keep the frizz at a minimum. I bought this product thinking it wasn&#x27;t a perm and found out it was just that a mild perm. My culry hair is now dry and barely wavey, and stinks like burnt hair. I cant get this nasty smell out of my hair. The only plus is that my flat ironed styles last much longer (stinks bad), but I miss my clean smelling naturaly curly hair!!! I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The labeling and instructions are very misleading!  This is a relaxer. I used it several times on my natural hair (4b/c) and the ends never regained their curl pattern. I haven&#x27;t used the product for several months now and I only see a curl pattern in my new growth, the ends of my hair are bone straight. -this is after multiple washings! (What ever is left, most of my hair ends broke off or had to be cut due to damage caused by this product). The directions/description should say this is permanent,  your hair will not be &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; enough for wash n go styles,  it will just look like a relaxer that wasn&#x27;t left in long enough.  Also it should advise you to apply to new growth only for retouches. I&#x27;m  very dissatisfied with this product. If you decide to use, apply to new growth only for retouches make sure you&#x27;re prepared to blow dry/ flat iron your hair or it won&#x27;t look very nice at all. Or maybe don&#x27;t leave it in for entire 20min.</li>
    <li> The best way to explain the difference is Googling afro ponytails....My daughter&#x27;s hair texture WAS like &amp;#34;Freetress Afro Punk&amp;#34; and now looks like &amp;#34;Freetress Afro 5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter HAD the perfect naturally curly thick hair, but even professional iron-outs didnt last more than 2 days and especially were no match for humidity.  At age 9, I love the fro but she likes to switch it up to show her length. I was hesitant but decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  freaked out bc I read the reviews AFTER TRYING this mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, due to review warnings, I&#x27;ve kept&lt;br /&gt; her hair moisturized and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using, the product stunk and her hair was hard but softened after shampooing with my regular shampoo (ie creme of nature).  Her hair softened and was easier to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didnt blow dry all silky straight like the pictures, but was nice after flat ironing. Her hair lasted days with no fizz from playing, showering, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It been months, my daughter hair is still soft, manageable, and iron-outs last. However, Im very upset it hasnt reversed after 6 weeks and multiwashes. It seems to have permanently changed her texture. Her once curly thick pattern is now more of a soft bushy fro instead of curly fro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I will not be using again and dont recommend bc I loved her natural curl over the bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise for naturals who love their naturally curly texture!</li>
    <li> I received this product and I was excited to see if it would actually work. First let me say that I have natural hair, so I didn&#x27;t want to put this product into my hair so I asked my Mom if she would be my Guinea Pig, she agreed. I read the directions over and over to make sure that I would be applying the product correctly, it was pretty simple, straight forward. I applied the Smooth N&#x27; Shine to my moms hair, while the product was in her hair (wet), it defined her curl pattern. But after rinsing the product out and she blow dried her hair and Hot combed it, her hair was straight for that night.The very next day it was back to it&#x27;s original state. So don&#x27;t waste your money on this kit because it didn&#x27;t do anything for her hair.</li>
    <li> When I put it on my hair it was very smooth but when I washed it off I really didn&#x27;t see any different results.  It is a waste of money. I should have purchased a perm kit instead.</li>
