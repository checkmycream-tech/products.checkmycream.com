<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ready to bat those lashes! This eyelash curler is able to grip on to my short stubby lashes and give them a little curl. I apply mascara first and then curl.  This curler I was able to use with little effort, no pinching, pulling or lashes falling out. Bonus is that it comes with a set of false eye lashes and glue that look natural. I save this for my nights out on the town. Takes a little practice putting them on if you don&#x27;t wear lashes regularly, but they look nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was supplied for unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I would have no hesitation is purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Eh, its about the same as all the other eyelash curlers i have.  I have short and thin eyelashes, didn&#x27;t do anything for them.</li>
    <li> I received my Iris in Paris Eyelash Curler with False Lashes this past Wednesday. I have used the eyelash curler for the last two days and so far I really like it. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try the lashes yet. The instructions were easy to follow and the packaging was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how easy it is to use this eyelash curler. I have never used one before and I have not has any pain or discomfort from using this product. It is effective and did exactly what it said it would.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this eyelash curler her eyelashes are already naturally long so when she uses this eyelash curler it gives her twice the volume of lashes she already has naturally so its amazing</li>
    <li> Delivered quick!  I have long, very straight eyelashes - often times a curl will last only a short time, but this eyelash curler curls my lashes all day!  i&#x27;ve been around the bueaty block a few times and listen to me ladies when I tell you this eyelash curler will be the last one you&#x27;ll buy! (i&#x27;m buying another one today to keep in my travel bag).  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Now - I haven&#x27;t used the lashes yet, but plan to in a few weeks.  They look fine, packaged great.  No concerns.</li>
    <li> My wife was very excited. I bought this set from Iris in Paris for my wife and she loves it! She said it is one of the best beauty tools she has. She liked also the false eyelashes that come with this bundle. Great product and great customer service. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gift for my girlfriend and i stumbled upon this beauty set. She was delighted and impressed and that is why I decided to leave a review. She said the curler works great. She has small eyes and it&#x27;s been hard for her to find a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch. She knows Iris in Paris brand from Europe and she is very happy to own one of their products. The packaging is very fancy and it was a great gift. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> The Best Pink Eyelash Curler works great, I had two old curlers that I really did like. I purchased these to try as part of a promotional offer and the old ones are now retired. The width of this curler is perfect for getting close to the lash line, making a much nicer curl than others I&#x27;ve used.  The lashes were a fun bonus and the glue that came with them held them tight all day. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Sack! Nit even wide enough for my eyes. I have to curl half of my lash at a time. Lashes suck too</li>
    <li> Its best curler i have tried. For the price is great. Keeps my eyelashes curled all day.</li>
    <li> What a great eyelash curler! I have not really used one of these.. just turned 33 and decided when I received a coupon on this product, that I would test it out. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long! I have very long but very light colored lashes. I am very impressed with how well this works! I am really impressed with how easy it is to hold on to and use. I was a little nervous getting it near my eyes but it was very gentle and effective. The eyelash curler is just perfectly shaped and sized to gently grab my eyelashes and get a good curl! I now use this every day and find that I don&#x27;t need to put on mascara anymore! Well, unless I get all jazzed up for a night on the town.. then it really makes my eyes pop! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> feels a little small for my eyes, but works awesome!</li>
    <li> Very good glue. Excellent design. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t used the lashes yet, the curler is fantastic! It gives a great curl and it stays all day :) My short, little lashes look longer and more full! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Love the nonreplaceable pads.  The finger holes are a little small but the product works great.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara in daily use plus wiping it at night time is a nightmare for me.I find it perfect for occasion where you want to look good but natural.Very easily to use and it&#x27;s very effective also.Gives you long lashes in minutes.Bonus eyelashes and glue is certainly a plus.If you consider the individual price for all three it&#x27;s way more expensive than what you will pay for this.I have absolutely no complain with it.I got this at discounted price as a part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have a few sets of eyelash curlers but they always stick or break.  These are a good quality and adorable (I love the black and pink!) plus they come with eyelashes and glue... you can&#x27;t beat that! I&#x27;ve never applied false lashes before, but I tried these and they were really easy to use and so fun.  I was able to purchase this item with a coupon but I would definitely pay full price in the future.</li>
    <li> I know Iris in Paris brand from my trips to Europe and I was excited to find out that they now sell on Amazon US.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best lash curler that I&#x27;ve had, and I owned a few in my life. I like very much the design. The eyelash curler is smooth and easy to use, plus it holds my lashes up all day. I look fresh and awake. It is smaller than most eyelash curlers, but it does a great job, plus it fits perfectly in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;This bundle comes with thin, natural looking false eyelashes with glue, what a nice surprise! I used them at a birthday party and I got many remarks about my eyes. The eyelashes are thin and delicate, they enhance your natural lashes and makes them fuller. Big like to Iris in Paris for this beauty set!</li>
    <li> I am very eyelash-obsessed. In fact I rarely put on any makeup other than eyeliner and mascara. I have always had long lashes but they have started to get droopy as I have gotten older. When I got a promotional offer for this curler, I was so excited! This curler, combined with my favorite fiber and mascara, has made a HUGE difference in how luxurious my lashes appear! It is super easy to use and because it is pressure based and not electric/heat based (yes they do make those) I am not nervous when I use it. The false lashe that came with it are so soft and natural!! I tried putting them on but I am awful at getting falsies on so I blame that on my inability- not the quality of the product!</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler! I&#x27;m able to capture my tiny outer lashes without pinching my eyelids. And i think it&#x27;s so great that it comes with a set of false lashes (the adhesive is underneath the box). I bought this item with a coupon I received as part of a review promotion and this is my unbiased opinion. The curler did a wonderful job at capturing the tiny end lashes and it doesn&#x27;t pinch the skin! This is what I do: I swipe my eyelashes with makeup remover. I curl the lashes then add the adhesive and lashes. If I don&#x27;t get it quite right, I try again OR I use eye liner to cover  the mistakes.</li>
    <li> I am very happy after purchasing this kit. Normally eyelash curlers will get stuck or break on your eyelash. These are very well made and the eyelashes look so beautiful and natural. I will be ordering more of these for the women in my family. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this eyelash curler.  It was nice to get the false eyelashes as a bonus!  It has been a while since I have used an eyelash curler but thought I would go for it since I received an offer to get this under a promotion at a very discounted price.  I was very happy I did.  I forgot how awesome your eyelashes look, all day, when I curled them.  It does not pinch or pull, like some I have used in the past.  I am honestly very happy with this and will be using it from now on.  I feel it will last long because it feels good quality made.</li>
    <li> I don’t have much experience with eyelash curlers, so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare it to. But I bought it to give it a try and I AM IN LOVE WITH IT! I love the sleek black color of the curler and the packaging was nice as well.  I’ve heard of people saying other top brand eyelash curlers pinch, bend lashes in half and don’t curl lashes. That is NOT true for the mini curler by Iris in Paris. It didn’t pinch, bend my lashes in half and most certainly curled them. My lashes were very noticeable and made my eyes look more wide open. I had a friend apply the lashes for me for a party. LOVED how dramatic my eyes looked. It made my eyes lashes look long and full. I am very impressed with this product it was easy to use and inexpensive as well. I am so happy I was able to purchase this during a promotional period. I will be buying another one for my friend that complains about her name brand curler.</li>
    <li> Love the product. The curler is fantastic.</li>
    <li> So fun :-) I&#x27;ve never owned a set of eyelash curler before so I thought these were great price with the discount code I used. I ordered them and they came in very quickly. They&#x27;re good quality sturdy and easy to handle. The eyelashes are a plus :-)</li>
    <li> I have short lashes &amp; often look for ways to improve their look. This cute little set did just that. The curler is sturdy &amp; easy to use. In the past I have had issues with pinching my lids, pulling out lashes &amp; curlers causing my lashes to have a 90 degree bend in them - I didn&#x27;t have these problems with these Iris in Paris lash curlers. I am able to get close to my lids &amp; the padding on them is great, creating a nice curl rather than a bend. These are sturdy &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The falsies that come with this curler, that I snatched up during a promotional period, are just right, not too flashy, &amp; blend well with your real lashes creating a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the eyelash curler lashes and glue they are very nice the lashes look natural and stay on very well with the glue..I like the curler very much.</li>
    <li> Not the all time best.  But the best on the market.  One problem, easy to pinch eye.  But worth the danger.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;m never changing brand ever again!</li>
    <li> The item is great, but the packaging was opened. The curler does its job well.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler.  It&#x27;s lightweight and the perfect size. Very easy to&lt;br /&gt; use.  I plan to use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product did not come with the glue as told on the packaging, and the box was squished and opened. Not worth 20$</li>
    <li> Iris in Paris eyelash curler and false lashes is very nice. I have never worn false eyelashes before and recently I became interested in wearing them for a few special events I will be attending.  The false lashes look very real. It comes with a tube of glue. To apply the false eyelashes is very simple and easy. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the lashes out because I want to get use to wearing them. I applied the eyelashes and glue per he instructions and they looked great. I thought they would be in my way because they are false lashes but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought they would be. I also like that it comes with a container to keep the lashes in.  The eyelash curler is very easy to use. The curler curled my lashes without any problems. The design of the eyelash curlers is very nice. Not to mention I love the colors black and pink. I was able to get this set for a great price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Great curler. Curls lashes on first use, doesn&#x27;t need a lot of pressure and my lases stay curled all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyelash curler during a promotional period. I was shocked when I first saw it as it is smaller than my previous one. But don&#x27;t let the size fool you. It creates an amazing lasting curl. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used to date including the ones I tried that heat up. My curl was perfect all day. As an added bonus you get a very nice thin set of false eyelashes and glue. They can easily be used multiple times.</li>
    <li> I got these for a party I was attending. They were easy to apply and looked great when I was done.  This was part of a promotion and they couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time!  Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy eyelash curlers that will last a long time!  The neatest thing is that they come with a set of eyelashes and glue!  Super cool!  Also, the pads in these will never wear out so you do not have to worry about replacing them.  I particularly like the way these curl my lashes without any pain from sticking to my lashes.  I received these through a promotion, and I am happy with the results.  I recommend these to anyone who needs a new curler for their make-up kit and one that will last a long time!</li>
    <li> So only in the last couple years have I actually &amp;#34;learned&amp;#34; the benefits of an eyelash curler. My eyelashes have always been on the short thin side. I am really not into putting serum on my eyelashes so I started using curlers. My first experience was that of pinching my eyelids in order to get the eyelashes. Other experiences are the rubber/foam falling out. I have been able to get them to work but with a lot of finagling.  This one however I love and will let you know the two reasons why. Now I received this item at a discount and in return have to give my full honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST: It is small and compact and fits beautifully in the side pocket of my handbag. Great and convenient for a refresher curl throughout the day. SECOND: The shape of the curler head is a little flatter so the pinching of the eyelids does not happen. It grips the eyelashes perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to press it to hard but just lightly for a perfect curl as I move up my lashes. I have included the before and after photos so the proof can be seen for itself. I have stopped wearing mascara lately.&lt;br /&gt;So those are two big pluses for me another bonus is the cute black eyelashes &amp; glue that come with it. I have used those a couple times and really feel like no one knew I had on fake lashes..</li>
    <li> I love love the eyelash curler!  It does a wonderful job of curling my somewhat long but thin lashes without pinching me.  Using the fake eyelashes and glue was somewhat of an &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; for me since it was my first time and I&#x27;m hoping that it gets easier next time.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would have ordered fake lashes if not for a promotional purchase but I&#x27;m happy that I did.  I would suggest practice placing the eyelashes (with no glue, of course) on your eyelids a few times to size them and get used to something coming so clue to your eye BEFORE putting the glue.  Otherwise, you may end up with slightly crooked lashes ;) .  Overall, I will use the curler every day but will save fake lashes for special occasions.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler is second to none! It works so well. The set of eye lashes is great as well for special occasions. I have used a lot of lash curlers and this one is great especially when I took advantage of a promotion to get it. I really like the padded handles. I can&#x27;t live without an eye lash curler!</li>
    <li> I have okay eyelashes. They are a decent length, and fullness, but by no means those long beautiful lashes most of us want. I hadn&#x27;t really used an eyelash curler in a few years because the padding always got gross with leftover mascara and then it would fade and need to be replaced.  I ordered the Iris in Paris curler with a coupon and I&#x27;m so thrilled I did!  my personal opinion of this eyelash curler is that it is a good buy. First, it is nice and small and fits easily into my makeup bag. It is comfortable to use on my lashes as well. The best part is that it really does help give my lashes a longer, fuller look. I curl before I put on mascara and immediately I can see more separation of my lashes, a perfect curl and a longer look to them. The finger holes are on the small side.  My fingers don&#x27;t get stuck or anything, but compared to a full size curler, this one is smaller. The fake lashes look very natural if you place them correctly (I need more practice). I really like that they are reusable too!  Just be gentle and take care of them so that they will last for a few wears. I am now convinced that if you want longer lashes, an eyelash curler is a must have!  And this one is really a great one!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth getting!! I was hoping these would help to make my short lashes look fuller and maybe a little longer.  I was excited that they do both.  I ordered these during a promotional period to try out since I am sensitive to makeup and mascara, but still need to dress up and look pretty sometimes. I have to admit I was skeptical, especially about the removal but I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or problems. The first day I wore them, my husband asked me what I did differently about my make-up and commented that it looked nice- that was a great feeling!  The curler works very well too.  I am super satisfied.  I would give these 5 stars, you should check them out!</li>
    <li> Works! I love that the pad on it never gets ruined and you don&#x27;t need to replace. I can see using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is the first eyelash curler I’ve bought in years, I’ve been going curlerless for too long and decided to give it another try. So far I’m very happy with the eyelash curler, I don’t feel like it’s pinching my eyelid and after just a couple uses I feel comfortable using it and am happy with the results. I haven’t successfully worn faux eyelashes yet and am a rookie at it, but I’m looking forward to trying them out. Founder is very personable and personally reached out to follow up on her product which is impressive and appreciated.</li>
    <li> They eyelashes were somewhat a cheap quality, but the eyelash curler itself works wonders! I dont usually curl my lashes since they are naturally, but I used it after applying the false lashes and it worked fabulously and didnt pich my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Hello, I am enjoying my new eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;Will the pad need to replaced in 3 months?  I am considering getting another one&lt;br /&gt;for my locker at the gym.  I will wait a bit to see how long this one will&lt;br /&gt;last.</li>
    <li> I got this beauty set as gift for my wife. The packaging is very premium, makes a very presentable gift. She totally loves it, she uses the eyelash curler every day and is very pleased with it. She said it is perfect for her lashes, not so big like the other ones she had.&lt;br /&gt;This set is a bundle with eyelash curler and false eyelashes inside. The false eyelashes are a nice bonus to this pack.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was flawless, I am impressed by their attitude and manners.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another set as a gift for my sister.  Very happy with my purchase, I recommend this seller and brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try fake lashes for a while now, so when given the opportunity to try this product under a promotion I jumped on the chance. First off the eye lash Cutler itself is great. Now the lashes are like a whole different product of it&#x27;s own they are amazing. I always wanted full lashes and now I have them. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the lashes I will be ordering more. The glue is water based so its super easy application and removal. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Well I finally recied my eye lash curlers after the USPS lost my package!! They are really easy to use and stronger than most!! I have not used the fake eye lashes yet I am saving those for a wedding coming up!! But I have light blonde short eye lashes and after using these with other eye makeup I can actually tell I have eye lashes WHOOP WHOOP haha So there was no surprised when asked to give them a try I jumped all over the offer!!</li>
    <li> I have never owned an eyelash curler, so this is a first for me.  I have naturally long lashes but they do not curl up and I have never noticed that until receiving this product.  The size of the product is great, it is not extra large or bulky and not so small that it makes it hard to manage.  I love the padding on the part that holds the eyelashes, my lashes did not get stuck and it did not feel like it was pulling on them at all.  I am so happy that now my lashes do not hit my glasses when I wear them (so annoying) .  I have not tried the false lashes and glue yet, I am waiting until I have a special occasion to go to so I can wow them with my super long lustrous lashes.  I am lucky to have been able to receive this with a coupon and I look forward to using it everyday.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Every girl needs an eyelash curler in her bag of tricks.  This worked like a charm.  Easy to use, great results.  Lashes looked long and inviting.  I am saving the bonus of extra lashes included for my daughter.  She is so excited to try these out.  False lashes are all over the place now.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll have fun.  I am excited to teach her all about make up.  Finding this as part of a promotion (and it&#x27;s still on promotion) enticed me to go for it.  Every girl loves a bargain!  I would highly recommend adding this to your make up bag.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth getting!!  I was hoping these would help to make my short lashes look fuller and they do!  I ordered these during a promotional period to try out since I keep hearing about new mascaras that enhance your lashes. I have to admit I was skeptical.  I wear contacts and don&#x27;t like to experiment with things around my eyes especially mascara which can cause irritation and be difficult to remove, but the curlers and water-based lash glue are fine!  No irritation or problems at all for me!  You can see the difference when you only curl one eye&#x27;s lashes.  Very nice to have!</li>
    <li> My fiancé is all about doing her eyes, so I&#x27;m always looking to spoil her with different eye products (some men buy purses, I buy makeup and eye stuff :) ) So when this item was opened up for a promotional review period, I bought them for her. Of course she loved the eyelashes. She bragged that the glue wasn&#x27;t gunky (and her eyes looked gorgeus). She uses the eyelash curler nearly every day. This eyelash curler has replaced her other one because it&#x27;s more compact. Her natural eye lashes are shorter than she would like, but she said she is able to curl those with this curler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many curlers over the years...some cheap and some expensive. I can tell you for certain to stay away from ones you find at a drugstore because they are all crap. One didn&#x27;t even last a week! Either the top cuts a slit in the rubber pad because you have to press so hard or the rubber simply warps. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive Japanese ones too, but the pads wore out too fast. So, while looking for pad replacements, I stumbled upon this curler which states you never need a replacement pads. I was intrigued, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler is fantastic. It&#x27;s small, but easy to handle. It&#x27;s wide in width and height so you will have no problems getting your lashes through. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t black so I could see my eyelashes against it. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that I&#x27;d prefer silver. As for the pad, it seems to be made of a hard silicone type rubber. You don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to get your lashes to curl, so it seems like it will last a long time compared to typical rubber pads. Time will tell whether or not it will ever need to be replaced. If it does, I will update this review if it doesn&#x27;t last a reasonable amount of time. I would probably still buy it again though because it&#x27;s inexpensive and does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and does it well.</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up for my girlfriend because she was asking for one and she has hardly spent a day without it! It is easy to use and worked great! It is so easy to use she was trying to use it on me! Even though that didnt happen I can tell you that it is easy to use, compact and effective. This is something that you would get a lot of use out of. I got it as part of a promotion but my girlfriend insisted I take the time to come and leave a 5 star review!</li>
    <li> Works great and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I love the color of the eyelash curler and it holds very comfortably in my hand. The eyelashes are cute and not flimsy and the glue holds well. Very well made products I will be happy to use for life.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler is a good product.</li>
    <li> The curler is good and curls within a few seconds. It definitely makes my lashes pop out more. The falsies are definitely a fun addition also (although I&#x27;m not great at putting on fake lashes). I ordered this one because it looked cute and I wanted one that could last a long time that didn&#x27;t need to be replace. I use to have a curler, but I forgot how big of a difference they made until I tried this one. Overall, I am please with my order &amp; would recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Curler works great and I love the false eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;The curl of the Iris in Paris eyelash curler is GREAT. I was sceptical because I&#x27;ve tried so many eyelash curlers.&lt;br /&gt;It curls quickly and the curl lasts. It seems to be very sturdy and it says it will last so time will tell but I am optimistic. I have long eyelashes that are poker straight so one or two passes with this curler and a tip of mascara and I&#x27;m done! I love it it so much as a matter of fact, that the next time I make a purchase from Amazon I will order another, just in case Iris in Paris stop making them!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with a pair of thin false eyelashes, you hardly find thin, natural looking ones and the Iris in Paris ones are just right.</li>
    <li> Love this eye lash curler. I do not wear makeup often. This allows me to feel made up with putting anything on. The finger grips are comfortable. The clamp is great. No pinch at all. I was able to buy this product with a promotional code.</li>
    <li> Who can&#x27;t use another lash curler?  I love to keep multiple times of my beauty products in my travel toiletry bag and one for my make up bag in my purse as well as my bathroom drawer.  I received this curler with a promotional offer.  Was excited that it came with a free set of false eyelashes and glue!  No need to stop at the drugstore for anything.  Very happy with item.</li>
    <li> I have avoided using eyelash curlers for many years now because I had a bad experience with the old type that pulled my lashes and became painful. It is padded perfectly and is just the right size and shape that you can get a good grip on it. Gives a great curl, super easy, well made, not flimsy and hasn&#x27;t pulled out a eyelash. I can get sooooo close to the lid and curl away! Very nice that it came with a free set of false eyelashes and glue! I was so excited to receive this with a promotional coupon.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try false eye lashes for some time now and when I saw this item available with the eye lash curler I was happy to review when asked after I saw this promotion. The lash curler is made with great quality and is built to last. Love the color of the curler. It curled my lashes so nice. The lashes are very pretty and look so real ... they make my eyes POP! The lashes were way easier to apply then I thought they would be for the first time user. I would buy this product again because every girl wants to feel beautiful ... the these make me feel more beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake about a year ago to try eyelash extensions. While they made my eyes look amazing, they did so much damage to my, once thick and full, lashes. Since then, I have been trying lots of natural things to get my lashes looking full and healthy again. I decided I wanted to start using an eyelash curler, so I started hunting. I found several, but there were a few things that set this one apart from the rest and made me choose this brand. I LOVE that it comes with a set of false lashes with water based glue. They add just enough enhancement that you lashes look, full, healthy and real. Second, I started looking when this brand was running a promotion, which was a great plus for me. Third, the compact and unique design. All of these things were great selling points for me. The design is nice, because the shape is just a bit different, and it allows your entire set of lashes to be curled at once. With the padded curve, there is no pinching of your eye or lashes, which is wonderful. These curlers require very little pressure and they still hold your gorgeous curl all day long. In love with this product.</li>
    <li> I have one side of eyelashes that never curl with just mascara, my bangs kind of lay on that side and the weight from my hair on my lashes end up making them stick out. I havent ever been huge on an eyelash curler because I was terrified to use one  but when I had the chance to receive this curler as a promotion and review it, I wanted to take the risk!!! I will tell you it was WORTH IT! That ONE side of eyelashes that never curl are now pretty and curled! the padding on this curler was great and the size was perfect for my fingers and I felt I had full control of the curler! I also want to remind people NOT to use ANY curler with lashes that have mascara, curlers are to be used BEFORE you apply mascara! This is an awesome curler!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I have started curling my eye-lases (about 10 years), I have never felt like I have found the right curler. There is just something that doesn&#x27;t work right for my lashes. Either the slot is too small for my long lashes, or my fingers get stuck in the grips. When I came across this promotion, I decided to give the Professional Pink and Black Mini Eyelash Curler a shot. Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; fool you. I was afraid my long lashes wouldn&#x27;t fit in the curler, but to my satisfaction, they all fit and come out with an incredible curl. I have always felt that other curlers would never make my lashes looked curled. They looked simply plumped, but by a few hours later, they went back to looking normal. However, with this curler, I feel like my lashes are noticeably curled. Oh, and I loved the added bonus with this package...the fake lashes. I don&#x27;t wear fake lashes on a regular basis, but you just never know when you will need them for a special event.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really used an eyelash curler that much, because I&#x27;ve never really took the time to use it.  When you have 3 kids under the age of 3 you really don&#x27;t have a lot of time to be able to use on yourself.  However I will make time for my eyelash curler now.  My eyelashes are almost non existent.  They are a light brown and are very short.  When I was able to purchase this with a discount I was so excited.  I&#x27;ve never used fake eyelashes either and this is also in the box when you purchase your eyelash curler.  As soon as I got it I tried it out.  I loved that it curled my lashes and I didn&#x27;t even have to apply mascara for them to be seen.  Pink and black are my favorite colors so this was a must have!!!  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use my fake eyelashes, but when I do, I&#x27;ll come back an update my review.</li>
    <li> I have had several eyelash curlers in my life and this has got to be the best one yet. The others all were made the same way. This one is made a little different and seems to be more ergonomic for ease of use. I didn&#x27;t have to press hard in order for the curler to work its magic on my eyelashes. It was easy to hold and I really like the looks of it. This curler comes with a bonus pair of eyelashes and glue which is a great plus. It fits great into my makeup bag and I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Long eyelashes make a huge difference when creating a look. They seem to scream “LOOK AT ME! STARE AT MY EYES!!” And the only way to create truly dazzling long eyelashes is with fake eyelashes and a great eye lash curler. Iris in Paris makes is convenient to have both in one kit. In this one kit there are 3 beauty tools: a Pink &amp; Black Mini Eyelash Curler,  natural looking handmade false eyelashes and eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using all three items you get great looking eyes quickly. The Pink &amp; Black Mini Eyelash Curler is an important tool when creating a look. In fact, it’s one tool that I use every time I’m getting ready. Even if I don’t apply false eyelashes, it’s important to curl my lashes. It makes them appear bigger and fuller. The Iris in Paris Pink &amp; Black Mini Eyelash Curler is the perfect size for curling every eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;The False Eyelashes are a nice touch. They are simple enough to look realistic and yet full enough to make a big difference. They are made of realistic looking lashes and not that cheap plastic material that some fake lashes are made of. When I apply them over my lashes using the waster based glue it gives me the appearance of fuller thicker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the kit is really nice for someone who is just starting out and doesn&#x27;t know where to begin. And for people who like the convenience of a one-stop-shop. They look great when applied and are easy to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I wear makeup almost daily.  I&#x27;m a bartender and I do a lot of theater so I have to know my stuff when it comes to presentation.  When the opportunity to try this curler out in a promotion, I jumped on it.  At first it took a while to get use to it.  I&#x27;ve had the same curler for years!  This one is not as curved as standard curlers, I love that!  It makes it so much easier to get every lash in one try.  I also love how the pad is not super spongy like others, which makes it much harder to pinch your lashes too much, or your eye for that matter.  The lashes are perfect for everyday use, just don&#x27;t forget to trim to your eye.  They are comfortable and look natural, which means people can&#x27;t tell you are wearing fake lashes.  Another factor about this curler that I thought was odd at first but came to love was the handles.  The finger holes are slightly smaller then my other ones.  But this means I have a tighter grip on them and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about dropping them, unlike my other ones.  I think this is a great product and I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of growing out my lashes after getting extensions and these burgers definitely reach to curl my short lashes and will be using the false lashes for nights out. Great lash curler!</li>
    <li> Finally a curler that keeps my lashes up! It&#x27;s sensitive on the lashes and the curler does its job. I spent twice as much on curlers that did nothing for me. I love this curler!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are very short and very few and far between.  I loved my new eyelash curler as it made a big difference in the way my eyelashes look and feel.  I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash curlers and nothing compares to the way this curler made my eyelashes feel so much more thicker.  I was impressed with how easy the eyelashes were to put on.  I&#x27;ve only put on lashes a few times before and always seem to have problems, with the Iris i Paris lashes I was able to apply them without any problems.</li>
    <li> I never really used them before BUT Now that I Finally tried Fiber Mascara I had to give it another try because... Well honestly I felt like i had more to work with:)  I personally will NEVER put glue near my eyes again because Embarrassing is an understatement for the feeling I got one someone pointed out that my eyelash was &amp;#34;hanging&amp;#34; ughhhhh&lt;br /&gt;So yeah these are the two tools I HAVE to have this curler and 3dplus fibers.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try some awesome Fiber Mascara let me know and I will let you know how I got it free:)</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler, it works just as described and I can see many more years of use for my lashes with this curler, in my future. I would purchase this again if needed.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works great!I used the eyelashes for a wedding they were ready to apply and stayed on all night in fact they stayed on for three days! I applied a few drops of glue and I am still wearing them a week later! I curled my lashed Applied the lashes put on one coat mascara curled lashes again and applied more mascara and I look like a movie star :-) :-)</li>
    <li> The new products arrived in perfect condition and are great quality! I will be buying again from this seller. The lashes aren&#x27;t flimsy and stay on really well with the included glue. The eyelash curler honestly feel a little cheap, but when it&#x27;s being used I can tell that it&#x27;s really good quality and will last a long time if really taken care of. Great products!</li>
    <li> Are you looking for a great eyelash curler, this is it!  Not to mention you get a bonus pair of lashes, you cannot go wrong there.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I lost a large patch of eyelashes that fell out after I had chemotherapy so I have been looking for new eyelash curlers that don&#x27;t pull out my lashes. When presented with the opportunity to try this product for a promotion in turn for my opinions I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. My eyelash curlers usually last 9-12 months because they either stop curling due to the springs wearing out, not enough replacement pads or I don&#x27;t like them becuase they kink my lashes instead of curling them. I have blonde hair as well as blonde eyebrows and lashes, so I am always looking for ways to get bigger, fuller, longer looking lashes. I use many different products to augment the look of my lashes up to and including false lashes when warranted. Using this product is no different than the other eyelash curler just place your lashes between the pad and as close to your lid as possible, then squeeze for several seconds. This curler has a nice grip and is very easy and comfortable to hold. I was so excited that this purchase included a BONUS pair of false eye lashes and the adhesive. This is worth the expense and will not disappoint.</li>
