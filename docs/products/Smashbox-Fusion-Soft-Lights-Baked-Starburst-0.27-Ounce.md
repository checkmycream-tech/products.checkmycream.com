### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My eyes are one of my best features, however, as I age</li>
      <li>Finally, a great bronzed!!</li>
      <li>This is probably best for someone with a lighter skin tone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>has the perfect combination of bronzer and highlight.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for any skin tone and gives a great glow</li>
      <li>It is great as a bronzer or could be used as a blush.</li>
      <li>I found Smashbox cosmetics on Amazon about a year ago and love everything I have tried!!  </li>
      <li>It gives a very nice hue to your face.</li>
      <li>I have used everything from Channel to Lancome to Revlon, if it is good, I will pay for it.  </li>
      <li>I loved this and the way it went on.</li>
      <li>This added a gorgeous effect to my skin</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t a streak of color to be seen anywhere, no metallic bits of any kind, it didn&#x27;t look &#x27;shiny&#x27;.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have fair skin, you won&#x27;t even be able to see it</li>
      <li>This is a really nice bronzer.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I liked the glow it gave and the dimension it added, but I found myself using my Mac bronzer more to add some sunkissed glow to my look.  </li>
      <li>BUT I have found that it&#x27;s fabulous to use to set cream blush!  </li>
      <li>Fabulous bronzed without being too sparkly!  </li>
      <li>Patty Hearst saw more daylight as a hostage than my chest sees in a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love Smashbox as a company</li>
      <li>Love Smashbox &amp; this product is no exception.  </li>
      <li>&quot; more cleavage than I ever show, so</li>
      <li>However, I ordered these shadows,  expecting to love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the mix of colors.  </li>
      <li>Had a wedding to go to and the top I found to wear</li>
      <li>I love the lip glosses, foundation primer, mascara, and now have the hydrating powder on order.  </li>
      <li>However, all the other cosmteics I have tried of theirs are Great!!!  </li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>they are either too dark...too light or brown looking.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I really like the array of different colors and how they combine to produce the perfect effect.</li>
      <li>The best bronzing powder I have used - the varying shades of neutral pinks and tans blend into a beautiful shade of golden brown with a hint of blush that looks natural and gives a subtle glow that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>and I actually liked the look of this bronzer but only after I applied a lot more than I should have had to.  </li>
      <li>I have been buying some cheap bronzer from Walmart that looks just as good and last me longer.</li>
      <li>It gives a great glow and really enhances the lasting power.</li>
      <li>For me it is perfect because I&#x27;m fair skinned and if it were too dark I would look ridiculous.  </li>
      <li>I love fusion soft lights.</li>
      <li>It looked deeply moisturized and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this product..am on my 3rd one and will be reordering soon.  </li>
      <li>Love it same price as store too !</li>
      <li>This formula has slight sparkle to it that creates lovely highlights and catches the light without looking garish.</li>
      <li>Again, luminescent and radiant and it didn&#x27;t seem to add any color (very important if you have perpetually reddened skin like me!).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add color.  </li>
      <li>As noted, it doesn&#x27;t really add color on me.  </li>
      <li>Kind of cakey and seemed to highlight my drooping lids and few wrinkles....  </li>
      <li>Once again Smashbox came through for me with realistic cosmetics that don&#x27;t turn on you in REAL light!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I swirl my brush around and dust it on my face - mainly cheeks and nose area - after foundation, powder, and blush.  </li>
      <li>bought the Baked Starburst and didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a dark bronzer this is NOT the product for you, but if you are looking for a more natural look, this works.</li>
      <li>I stepped outside and brought a makeup mirror with me, and in daylight it STILL looked fresh and dewy, not made up.</li>
      <li>Like many of the other reviews, I found the bronzer to be a little light despite the darker colors shown.  </li>
      <li>Well, I found a new use for this product.  </li>
      <li>It gives a very natural look when applied.  </li>
      <li>This is the 3rd smashbox I&#x27;ve bought for my mum after she bought the first one for herself on a cruise the colors match her complexion (mixed race).</li>
      <li>Pale girls, try this one first!</li>
      <li>and even I can barely see this product when I put it on my skin.  </li>
      <li>is worth every stinkin&#x27; cent it costs, and it seems as though this would last a long, long time.</li>
      <li>used Smashbox&#x27;s very large fluffy white blush brush.</li>

<li> Yeah, that pale.</li>
<li> my chest needed a little somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27; since it sits behind shirts all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Use everyday !!</li>
<li> Instead, it provides a subtle shimmer that adds a bit of dimension to too-flat looking makeup.  </li>
<li> the color was also disappointing.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff in the &#x27;bronzer&#x27; and &#x27;highlighter&#x27; category. I&#x27;m so pasty that it&#x27;s hard to find anything that isn&#x27;t glittery, too brown, too tan, too pink, TOO OBVIOUS. If I put it on and you can tell that I just dusted myself with product, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Baked Starburst and didn&#x27;t have high hopes. I expected, like every other product like this, to look like I just fake-baked or rolled in some kid&#x27;s glitter. At the very least I expected an obvious blushy look where it was dusted, judging by the palette. Had a wedding to go to and the top I found to wear showed about 10\\&quot; more cleavage than I ever show, so my chest needed a little somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27; since it sits behind shirts all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I almost had that ghostly pale Twilight look to my skin, and I feared that if I passed out in the street someone might call in a dead body. Yeah, that pale. Patty Hearst saw more daylight as a hostage than my chest sees in a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Smashbox&#x27;s very large fluffy white blush brush. Swooshed it through the entire cake, and dusted. There wasn&#x27;t a streak of color to be seen anywhere, no metallic bits of any kind, it didn&#x27;t look &#x27;shiny&#x27;. But somehow my skin had a luminescence, almost like an inner glow. It looked deeply moisturized and healthy. I stepped outside and brought a makeup mirror with me, and in daylight it STILL looked fresh and dewy, not made up. So I braved putting this stuff on my face, expecting to look like I&#x27;d just climbed 40 flights of stairs (redness, shine). Again, luminescent and radiant and it didn&#x27;t seem to add any color (very important if you have perpetually reddened skin like me!). If I wanted color I&#x27;d put on blush! This added a gorgeous effect to my skin but it didn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;d used any product. Once again Smashbox came through for me with realistic cosmetics that don&#x27;t turn on you in REAL light!&lt;br /&gt;This is worth every stinkin&#x27; cent it costs, and it seems as though this would last a long, long time. My palette didn&#x27;t even look as though I&#x27;d used any by the time I&#x27;d applied it generously to my chest, neck, and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pale girls, try this one first!en look as though I&#x27;d used any by the time I&#x27;d applied it generously to my chest, neck, and face.  Pale girls, try this one first!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the product I was using that Smashbox discontinued.  It&#x27;s a little too &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; for my taste.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the middle of a Minnesota winter as a pick me up and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bronzer for the fairest amongst us all.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice bronzer.  I swirl my brush around and dust it on my face - mainly cheeks and nose area - after foundation, powder, and blush.  Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint and brightens my skin a bit.  It doesn&#x27;t really add color.  At all. Instead, it provides a subtle shimmer that adds a bit of dimension to too-flat looking makeup.  My skin tone is light-medium/olive.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again for the price.  Yeah, it&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  At least not $29 worth of an effect.  This is probably best for someone with a lighter skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I liked the glow it gave and the dimension it added, but I found myself using my Mac bronzer more to add some sunkissed glow to my look.  Well, I found a new use for this product.  As noted, it doesn&#x27;t really add color on me.  BUT I have found that it&#x27;s fabulous to use to set cream blush!

    <li> This is the 3rd smashbox I&#x27;ve bought for my mum after she bought the first one for herself on a cruise the colors match her complexion (mixed race). At 74 he doesn&#x27;t need to use a lot and it lasts her over a year</li>
    <li> I found Smashbox cosmetics on Amazon about a year ago and love everything I have tried!!  I love the lip glosses, foundation primer, mascara, and now have the hydrating powder on order.  However, I ordered these shadows,  expecting to love them.  They were like drugstore cover girl type brands.  Kind of cakey and seemed to highlight my drooping lids and few wrinkles....  the color was also disappointing.  I have used everything from Channel to Lancome to Revlon, if it is good, I will pay for it.  My eyes are one of my best features, however, as I age, I have to be careful with eyeshadow.  I need it to make me look younger and accentuate my eyes.  this just did not do what I expected.  Oh well, it is trial and error with eye shadow with me.  I was hoping smashbox would be the one....not.  However, all the other cosmteics I have tried of theirs are Great!!!  Especially lip glosses.</li>
    <li> Love Smashbox &amp; this product is no exception.  Luminous , glowing effect.</li>
    <li> luv luv luv this stuff.  I have tried all kinds of bronzers ...they are either too dark...too light or brown looking.&lt;br /&gt;This has the perfect combination of bronzer and highlight.</li>
    <li> I love the mix of colors.  It gives a very natural look when applied.  I had been looking for a combo like this for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I loved this and the way it went on. The only thing is there is not much there so it did not last long for me. I have been buying some cheap bronzer from Walmart that looks just as good and last me longer.</li>

    <li> Use everyday !! Love it same price as store too !</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and even I can barely see this product when I put it on my skin.  If you don&#x27;t have fair skin, you won&#x27;t even be able to see it so I would recommend going with a different product.</li>
    <li> Love Smashbox as a company and I actually liked the look of this bronzer but only after I applied a lot more than I should have had to.  I&#x27;ve only had this about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m already nearing the bottom of the container.  Totally unacceptable for me given the price point!</li>
    <li> I love fusion soft lights. It is great as a bronzer or could be used as a blush. It gives a very nice hue to your face.</li>
    <li> Fabulous bronzed without being too sparkly!  Finally, a great bronzed!!</li>
