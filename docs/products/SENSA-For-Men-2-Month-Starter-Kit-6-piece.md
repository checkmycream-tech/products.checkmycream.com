      <li>seller as good</li>
      <li>I read all these good reviews and thought,</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it this way instead of dealing directly with Sensa as many have had problems trying to get returns from them.</li>

      <li>It makes me feel full quicker.</li>
      <li>I still eat everything on my plate,but I think hunger does not hit me so quickly after I eat my food.</li>
      <li>Well, THEY WORK for suppressing your appetite really well!!  </li>
      <li>It was worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>I just think that this is more about behavior modification / awareness rather than something that really does much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I started using Sensa about a month ago, and it seems to work well suppressing my appetite. I do sometimes forget to use it, but usually remember to use it on my next meal. I am looking forward to the 2nd month of use, and am also happy that you can purchase it locally at GNC Centers.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work.  I was hoping and praying that it would work.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.  I gained 3 pounds in the first month I used this.  It did nothing to curb my appetite.  I read that it worked for many people and didn&#x27;t work for others- put me in the latter group. I DID remember to put it on all my food, as some who fail don&#x27;t. As a side note, I am a P90X-6-days-a-week guy and I get really hungry a few hours after my workouts and I&#x27;m not sure if that accounts for my lack of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you.  It was worth a shot.  Just started a protein shake program that seems to be more effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the seller was AMAZINGLY fast with the shipping.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it this way instead of dealing directly with Sensa as many have had problems trying to get returns from them.</li>
    <li> Used regular sensa last year &amp; lost about 35 lbs in 6 months. This one I just started on 5/1/12 &amp; I&#x27;m eating less. It makes me feel full quicker. I believe the key to weight loss is a slow steady method.</li>
    <li> i hope sensa works as desribed. i think 30# in 6 mo is good. it was cheaper here than trysensa.com. i just need to find mo 3-6.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for a month with no sign of weight loss.  He exercises every day and watches the size portions he eats.  He will give it one more month to see if things change.</li>
    <li> followed the directions and used the product exactly as described, lost a few at the very beginning but after first 2 months nothing. I do not recommend this especially for price</li>
    <li> well i think it depends on the person buying this product, just as anything else.&lt;br /&gt;You must be dedicated to it, carring around tis little plastic box,,to some might be an  annoyance.. up to you,,</li>
    <li> seller as good..product so so</li>
    <li> The 2 stars are because the product works. I does help control your hunger and does help with over eating BUT the entire time I was using Sensa I felt like I was getting sick. I used the product for a total of 3 months (less about 20 pounds) and felt like I was thrown off or about to get a cold. I tried to start up again after several months past and immediately started with that under the weather feeling so I stopped and through the rest away.</li>
    <li> what a waste made me eat more hahaha</li>
    <li> I bought this and this is a real joke. Saw that other people raved over losing 30 pounds on sensa, so I wanted to try it.  This is a big joke even when dieting. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCCT CAME JUST AS ADVERTISED, AND WAS JJUST A GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY.I MUST ADMIT I HAVENT FOUND THE MOTIVATION TO USE IT YET, BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS???????????????</li>
    <li> I read all these good reviews and thought, oh what the heck right?  I read up on Sensa and everything!  I went out and bought the Sensa single packs that make glasses of coolaid juice right?  Well, THEY WORK for suppressing your appetite really well!!  They do not taste too good at all but that&#x27;s nothing a little MiO can&#x27;t take care of.  ;)  It does have a lot of fillers in it but thats what you want when your trying to lose weight!  You feel really full and you wind up eating just a portion of what you normally woulld!  it did make me sick though.  like sick enough to make food turn on me regularly.  I dodnt even want to smell food, much less eat it.  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Sensa powder, you often forget to put it on EVERYTHING!  Also, I guess you can sometimes get confused of what side to put on what food because of what the instructions told me. (There is a sweet side and a salty side and they tell you that it doesn&#x27;t mean what it sounds like, she said the food didnt nessissarrily have to be sweet or salty to use either one of them.  like she told me as an example that you could put the sweet on corn and stuff.  Anyways, while still confused about that, I just wanted to close by letting you know that I am usually a pretty motivated person!  So, I thought with that on my side, I just knew that this diet was going to be a huge success for me!  But...I was wrong!  I didn&#x27;t last very long AT ALL!!!!  I wasn&#x27;t loosing a single pound and was walking on my treadmill every day and dieting!!  I went into this determined as hell thinking I was going to remember to put this s*** it on everything I ate but, you see, thats not normal behavior for me so, ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM!  Just ain&#x27;t happening!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought Sensa for men 2-month starter kit. I have taking the first month and 10 days of the 2nd month. I haven&#x27;t lost any weight at all. In fact I have gained 2 lbs. I Sprinkled everything I ate even chewing gum. So when I finish the 2nd month I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
    <li> Sensa is the easiest way to lose weight, All you have to do is sprinkle on what ever you eat and  watch the pounds fall off. In two and a half months i lost 25 pounds! 200 when i started Sensa for men now 175.</li>
    <li> I forget the shakers, and they don&#x27;t seem to help me. I&#x27;m not hungry after eating using this, but that&#x27;s because I just ate! AND if I think about it, I won&#x27;t continue to eat after I&#x27;m no longer hungry anyway... but this isn&#x27;t why... I just think that this is more about behavior modification / awareness rather than something that really does much. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped and delivered in 2 days. My husband is trying the product but it is too soon for any real weight loss results. Shipper exceeded our expectations with prompt delivery and product as expected.</li>
    <li> I still eat everything on my plate,but I think hunger does not hit me so quickly after I eat my food.</li>
    <li> NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK OF IT JUST YET.... KEY TO THIS THING IS EATING LOWER FAT FOODS, DONT DRINK CARBONATED SUGARY DRINKS,  AND FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TEE.</li>
    <li> I can see where this product would work.  When sprinkled on your food its mal-odor is so bad that you don&#x27;t want to eat it.  With every mouthful another whiff and after several bits you stop eating.  Unfortunately, if you are hungry you simply take another portion and skip the Sensa.  I bought several months supply and stopped using it after only a few days.  I suppose you could put any foul odor on you food, not eat it and loose weight! I wish it was that easy.</li>
