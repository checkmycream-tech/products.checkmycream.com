      <li>Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade is an excellent product to tame &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for 15 years, and it works great for my wavy hair that has a lot of body--great for adding a day&#x27;s worth of oil to just-washed hair, if your hair works better like that.</li>
      <li>This is a very light pomade.</li>
      <li>Best of all it takes very little to do a great job</li>
      <li>I get many compliments now, people love my hair color, cut.......</li>
      <li>They changed their product -- and not for the better.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that we started using Aveda products.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in Germany now where it&#x27;s a lot more humid than in CO</li>
      <li>I have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really fantastic!</li>
      <li>and I have yet to find a hair product I like more.  </li>
      <li>And I like the smell a lot :)</li>
      <li>Aveda keps the hair looking healthy, shiny without feeling tacky..</li>
      <li>I love the consistancy of this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products....without sucess.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and love it  </li>
      <li>Morrocan Oil is much better.</li>
      <li>The product is ok.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Using more might create a greasy look/feel.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>I can say that this one comes closer than most products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many, many, many).</li>
      <li>I would state its more of a creme rather than a Pomade but whatever.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Have used this product for over 20 years and  almost as many hair styles.</li>
      <li>and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and it&#x27;s very good, better than anything you would get from a drug store and for this price this product will last you awhile.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida where ther is a lot of humidity and this works great.</li>
      <li>Also great for places near the beach that have a lot of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>It also works great on natural hair as well.</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;ve managed to make it work by applying it on my hair before spraying hairspray with a strong hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the best, keeps my hair healthy, and has a terrific smell.</li>
      <li>First, I kind of wave my fingers ever so lightly, like a light dusting, over the ends</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and it gets wavy very fast.</li>
      <li>And stay away from the roots; just lightly do the ends.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(I&#x27;m not being cheap</li>
      <li>It is light</li>
      <li>I loved the texture of the pomade and it was not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>This product adds shine, does not weigh my hair down, smells good and keeps it looking very stylish.</li>
      <li>I will need to look no more as this pomade, combined with Crack, is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>It does a great job, moisturizes hair, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I was excited about receiving it, but never did.</li>
      <li>Clean  with a clean smell .</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smells and was looking forward to loving this as claims suggested.</li>
      <li>its ok I really can&#x27;t rave about this product I use it every once in a while</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any more problems with frizz in very humid weather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s literally unbearable so finding good products for the summer is a regular hunt.</li>
      <li>I use Chi silk infusion when straightening my hair and use this on all the little fly always right on top.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for my natural hair!!!</li>
      <li>great shine, protectant for your hair, use after blow drying, use small amount on hair, flat iron or curl, beautiful shine</li>
      <li>I use is on wet hair to avoid some of the strong essential oils fragrance which smells real good...</li>
      <li>Makes my grey hair look good</li>
      <li>Perfect for dry hair, when your ends are starting to split, or when you just want that silky sheen.  </li>
      <li>Great smell and its no too heavy, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Aveda is totally worth the cost.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product IS the ONLY product that calm, straighten and add shine to my natural frizzy hair here in Miami where its humid 90% of the year (and I&#x27;ve tried many anti-humectant, anti-frizz products that failed me). Fast shipping also. A little goes a long way which is a WOW factor because my hair is soooo thick! I definitely CANNOT go without this product!</li>
    <li> I live along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, so it is extremely humid and it frequently rains.  I have kinky African American hair that I only occasionally straighten.  Even after my hair reverted during the day due to the weather, putting this product on at night would &amp;#34;re-straighten&amp;#34; my hair, so I didn&#x27;t have to apply the flat iron again...at least my hair would not be poofy for a couple hours in the morning.:)</li>
    <li> Just opened my aveda that was wrapped in plastic......it is liquid . I have always good purchases with amazon, this is sloshing out of the package and unusable. Getting onto everything, never have seen anything quite like it.  Says if seal is broken its not exchangeable well it was broken under the plastic. I bought this in December ,to keep on hand when I ran out and have always done this .. With no problem.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. I wish I could get my money back. Really greasy and provides zero hold. Useless</li>
    <li> This product does the trick for high humidity and just a little goes a long way!  My hair stays soft and smooth all day. Also I was impressed with how quickly it arrived in my mailbox!</li>
    <li> My hair is dry....colored.....sun damaged......you get the picture.......not a pretty one.  I have tried so many products....without sucess.  Someone had given me a jar of this Aveda product awhile ago.  There was not very much left in the jar.  I started using a little at a time......things were looking up.  I went online to locate this product and the rest is history......tameable hair.  I get many compliments now, people love my hair color, cut.......what have I done.  Didn&#x27;t have to change hair stylist.......just found a product that works!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this. Its a waste of money, and it is expensive. It did nothing for my hair. Morrocan Oil is much better.</li>
    <li> The product feels and smells great, but so far I&#x27;m not impressed because of the price.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a drugstore pomade as far as results are concerned (I have thick kinky curly hair).  However, it seems to have a lot of quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> Amazing find for culy hair that my hairdresser told me about. I thought I had tried every product out there for curly hair but have never found something like this!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Perfect for dry hair, when your ends are starting to split, or when you just want that silky sheen.  My wife told me about this stuff about 3-4 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily since.  Once applied, it will also do an amazing job at keeping your hair in the position that you shape it.  Just remember that a very little goes a looong way.  One container of this lasts me over a year.  Get it!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the reviews for a product which helped frizziness.  I used this once,and was extremely disappointed.  It makes my hair look very greasy, and the smell is a bit offensive.  It doesn&#x27;t smell clean and fresh, but stale and old.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m especially disappointed because this was expensive, and I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. [...].</li>
    <li> Not too greasy, but the odor is a little strong if you are going to be around others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any more problems with frizz in very humid weather. Best of all it takes very little to do a great job</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, maybe a little bit too greasy for my short, Asian hair, but I just used a little less. However, I could not continue to use it because the smell was sooooo fragrant. I have a pretty sensitive nose to a floral smell (I can&#x27;t wear perfumes) and this product has an overpowering fragrance. Too bad it&#x27;s in your hair, so it&#x27;s right next to your nose, all the time, until you take a shower!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair shine  &amp; only one!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this helps in rainy and foggy weather.  But don&#x27;t over use it will weigh your hair down.  But it is a good product and a great price.</li>
    <li> My hair is very short. I use it everyday. It lasted 6 months. This is a very light pomade. It does not give texture but it does give good shine.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. My hair was still frizzing and puffing up!!! I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is raving about.</li>
    <li> If you want to spend 20 bucks on some hair grease then go ahead, but this did nothing that a dollar jar of hair grease could do. It did not do anything to prevent frizz at all. I have natural hair and this product did nothing for it. It does smell nice- like gardenia flowers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and I have yet to find a hair product I like more.  It really smoothes the hair and has a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Great Anti-Humectant properties.  Great product. A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  You only need the smallest amount, and it never fails to deliver an incredible sheen that makes my hair look alive, without making it stiff or sticky.  I also find the scent great, something very important to me.  If the scent was unpleasant, I couldn&#x27;t use it, no matter how good it was.</li>
    <li> Only product that I have found that keeps my curls from frizzing without making my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 15 years, and it works great for my wavy hair that has a lot of body--great for adding a day&#x27;s worth of oil to just-washed hair, if your hair works better like that. I love the smell of this, however, I am very sad to report that I developed sensitivity to some natural fragrance, probably from using Aveda products for nearly 20 years. I still use this, though--it&#x27;s that worth it. Plus, you can use this so it doesn&#x27;t contact skin much. I imagine this product has a small number of very loyal users.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell. I am very sensitive to smells and was looking forward to loving this as claims suggested. I guess my nose is weird or simply unique in what she considers a great smelling product....In addition, it was simply grease. Not defrizzing, bouncing curls or waves...left hair flat, smelling gross and greasy...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all.  It smells funny and it is greasy and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair besides weighing it down.  Now I have weighed down hair that is frizzy.  Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Always have loved this product.  The smell is a bonus!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007CXWRE Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade, 2.6 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this today, so I cannot rate product just yet. However I have a question about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question: Can you use product on WET hair also and does it work as well?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years and nothing else comes close to giving me these results.  (and the smell is so yummy)  One jar lasts forever because you need so little of it!!&lt;br /&gt;The way I do my hair:  spray heat protectant, dry and curl, medium hairspray for body and hold and then, I put about a half of a pea-size amount on my fingertips and rub fingers together to warm it up so it spreads sparingly and evenly.  First, I kind of wave my fingers ever so lightly, like a light dusting, over the ends and then I go back and gently pull/ loosen the curls, using my fingers as a pick.  I don&#x27;t like barrel-curls and this give you pretty texture/ movement.  (I&#x27;m Caucasian with ends that will just always be frizzy, and it&#x27;s shoulder length with lot of thin hair that doesn&#x27;t have root body.)&lt;br /&gt;I really mean half of a pea-size; with a heavy hand you&#x27;ll have to rewash it before you can leave the house!!  And stay away from the roots; just lightly do the ends.  It will be a sad sad day if/when they ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair looks when I use this product. But the cost was outrageous in terms of value. I only use this once a week because I have to wash my hair at least 3 times to get the stink out. I actually went as far as adding Rose Oil to it to help take the stink away, but I can still smell it in my hair Sunday morning when I wake up. I have not gotten around to flat ironing my hair while using this to see how it would do with holding my hair straight but it does a good job keeping the frizz out of my hair. You just have to be able to like having your hair smell dirty and oily to use it often, otherwise you will have to wash your hair several times to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 20 years and  almost as many hair styles. It  keeps the hair well conditioned and manageable, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have dry, course hair that certainly gets even drier in the Colorado climate. I have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair. I can see if you had fine hair that this product would not be a good thing! I always have to remember that it&#x27;s the anti-humectant that I like, not the humectant. The humectant version does nothing for my hair and I have purchased it on occasion by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great too! Makes styling a snap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years. I am an African American woman and keep my hair cut short like Halle Berry. I love the consistancy of this product. I do not like to use heavy oils on my hair. This product adds shine, does not weigh my hair down, smells good and keeps it looking very stylish. Sometimes I will put this product on at night then wrap my hair before bed. I wake up and do not have to do a thing to my hair. I would recommend this product in a heartbeat! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to find. There are only 2 places near me that I can get it. These places are both an hour away. I was pleasantly suprised to see that Amazon.com sells it.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy curly dry hair in the back.  I just use just a tiny little bit of this product and it smooths and softens the worst part of my hair.  It is expensive but since you only need a very small amount, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> If you have dry, coarse, and frizzy hair this is a must! I have used this product for year. It is pricey, but worth it. A little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need much of this and isn&#x27;t for all hair types. I have blonde and very thick hair- So I need a heavier product to manage my hair. Several friends have tried and don&#x27;t get the same results. I think if you have thinner hair it would definitely make it too heavy. And with anything Aveda... the smell is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> The product is expensive (all cosmetics are overpriced in my opinion), but this one is great- it does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a coworker. I am natural and I can&#x27;t say that this product added to or took from the hairstyle that it was used for. It is light so that was good.</li>
    <li> Arrived melted, which I kind of expected, so I put it in the fridge. However, it has never firmed back up. I love this product, just wish it would&#x27;ve been solid.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is very sensitive to humidity, so much so that I cannot keep it straight in the slightest amounts of humidity. I used this recently on a trip to Florida and it worked so well! My hair didn&#x27;t begin reverting to my natural texture until I was literally in the water at Miami beach. My hair was rained on and sprayed by water rides before that. I am very impressed! A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t mind paying the high price because I will have it for a long time and it works!</li>
    <li> I like the product. Clean  with a clean smell . Have not used it that long. There&#x27;s not that much of the product for the price. Anti humectrant, I really don&#x27;t know if you can really say that.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that truly gets out the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; or the \\&quot;curl\\&quot; of hair that  naturally is a bit curly like mine. Also great for places near the beach that have a lot of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;We have a \\&quot;soft water\\&quot; system in our house as we have a lot of lime in the water due to limestone rock in the ground, in our water in the Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;The soft water is great for clothes washing but NOT hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveda. anti-humectctant is also a helper for this condition.</li>
    <li> tried this to keep youthful straight spikes from turning into matronly curls when I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; at Zumba &amp;/or yoga.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> You just need a tiny big to smooth for a finished look! I love Aveda products! This one smells really good!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, wavy hair that gets very frizzy. I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for years. When I don&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s only because I run out and happen to be short on funds. When that&#x27;s the case, I opt for cheaper products, but I&#x27;ve found none that compare! I always go back to this. I should note that typically I straighten my hair. I put is on right before running the flat iron through it. It leaves it soft and tames the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 2 1/2 years natural. Brought this due to a suggestion of helping to stop my hair from reverting after a blow dry and flat iron. Just got my 1st blow dry and flat iron in over a year.  After a week my hair is still straight, soft and shining using this product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works like it should... Adds the wet looks and piecey look to a haircut or style. Nice product, works great.  Nice price, nice size.  Would buy again, if needed. Thank you,</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way with this product.....less than a dime size amount for M-L hair.  Using more might create a greasy look/feel.  Start with a very tiny amount to see how your hair reacts.  I use after blow drying to finish my style and use at roots and also on ends.  I have used this product for years and it&#x27;s very good, better than anything you would get from a drug store and for this price this product will last you awhile.  It actually does add thickness as well and smells nice- the smell you would expect from Aveda as most of their products smell the same.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I have a jar of this I&#x27;ve had for about 2 years! I use the tiniest bit at a time. I have very fine hair, and it gets wavy very fast. It also gets very dry. When I heat style, I use the teeniest bit of this (too much will make it go greasy) to keep my hair from going wavy in the Southern humidity or if I&#x27;m in CA. Also, to keep the ends from splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair, I will run a little bit of this through it on days when I&#x27;m not heat-styling my hair, and it gives me a pretty, natural look. It&#x27;s really the best, keeps my hair healthy, and has a terrific smell. The key is not to use too much or your hair will get super-greasy. It is expensive, but not really, when you look at cost-per-use. I&#x27;ve had my jar for two years, and it&#x27;s still half-full and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m not being cheap, it&#x27;s just I can&#x27;t over-use it or my hair will look greasy). A little goes an extremely long way. Great product. I won&#x27;t switch.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.. Makes my grey hair look good</li>
    <li> I only use a tiny bit on my relaxed hair, mostly my ends and then i wrap my hair at night. When I wake up its very moisutrized and soft feeling. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, its actually quite subtle. It is expensive but i&#x27;ve only used about 1/2\\&quot; and its been almost a year. It also works great on natural hair as well.</li>
    <li> Good for pressing and blow drying black hair, A small amount locks in moisture where you want it and out where you dont.  Hair does not revert back to frizz.</li>
    <li> I obviously live in Texas and let me tell you, everything is bigger in Texas, ESPECIALLY the heat. It&#x27;s literally unbearable so finding good products for the summer is a regular hunt. I will need to look no more as this pomade, combined with Crack, is an excellent product. The two compliment each other so much. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and love it  You only need a tiny bit on your fingers and go over the ends and no frizz.</li>
    <li> Referred to me by my daughter and it is ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again  when needed&lt;br /&gt;Not a whole lot to say, it works</li>
    <li> I read this product was great so i decided to order it. I was excited about receiving it, but never did. Not the fault of the company, but of the USPS. I notified the company and was given a refund right away. Will try it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Creates a nice shine and good hold.  Would recommend to others.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great product and you need only a little.  They have two types one for oily hair and the other for dry.  Purchase the correct one.  Believe it come from Italy.</li>
    <li> this anti-humectant from Aveda is the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;! i have such unruly natural curls  at the sides of my face and my bangs. just a dap of this product and straightening iron and BOOM!!  straight hair that humidity and ruin! ;D</li>
    <li> Item was as pictured and brand new. I loved the texture of the pomade and it was not heavy at all. I was thinking that it was going to be more like a gel, but it is more a moisturizer which is perfect for my hair type. You do not have to use a lot so the 2.6 ounces should last a few months. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected:-(</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, but it does not work as I expected to.  I read that this product will help women with high porosity hair to retain their  definition in humid weather.  Well, I have 4b/c hair and by the end of the day my hair has lost all definition and curl.  I will continue to use it since it cost so much, but I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great is very light on your hair also you don&#x27;t have to use a lot for it to work but i did use other product with this as well</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  It worked as advertised in protecting my hairstyle from humidity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before from authorized retailers and it&#x27;s fantastic, but THIS particular jar was melted and just didn&#x27;t seem right. The product inside was watery and greasy. I threw it out. Something just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews of it being a good anti-humectant. It did not work well for me as such. It was really an epic fail. Not only that but it is extremely greasy and if not used sparingly it will weigh your hair down and make it stiff. It also came with no instructions whatsoever, not even printed on the jar. I had to rely on YouTube for those. Even though I was disappointed in this product because it didn&#x27;t do what I had bought it to do, I&#x27;m still giving it 2 stars because it gave my hair a great shine and it smells nice, but I will not be repurchasing it and I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the way it leaves my hair after I blow dry it.</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase for my transitional hair to ward off the humidity</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 4 years but I wear my hair straightened or heat styled.  I live on the coast in the southeast.  The humidity here is unbearable.  Even when I did have a relaxer, I would step out of the house in the morning and all the effort that I put into styling my hair would just melt away.  I had to start wearing sew-ins and I wouldn&#x27;t dare be caught at a club or someplace that had the potential to make me sweat.  Until I found this.  My hair lasts ALL DAY LONG.  A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a true pomade because it emulsifies once you rub it in your hand.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that if you use too much it could make your hair look greasy and flat.  I recently went to an amusement park and my hair lasted from 9am until 10pm. No frizz, no fly aways.  I&#x27;m truly amazed.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that we started using Aveda products.  WE purchased this for African AMerican hair and it is so great for the hair.  Excellent product.  Some people have complained about the smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all to me.  It is wonderful for the hair and you only need a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my natural hair!!!</li>
    <li> It tames my Irish frizzy hair well on those humid days when blow drying and a bit of oil won&#x27;t cut it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It tends to separate in the container so you may have to mix it up. I would state its more of a creme rather than a Pomade but whatever. Works just like it should. Great for edges and fly aways. Great smell and its no too heavy, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY SHOPPING!</li>
    <li> This product makes the hair soft, shiny, and manageable.  A little goes a long way.  I have been a long time user of this product.</li>
    <li> The product basically does what it claims -- whether applied to wet or dry hair -- but more than the tiniest amount will make your hair extremely greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed with very curly hair. And although I love my curls and usually wear it naturally, once in a while I like to wear it straight. It used to be a waist of time cause my hair would curl up shortly after straightening it with an iron. NOT anymore! My hairdresser in Colorado used this pomade and I was sold! (BTW I don&#x27;t have thick hair) I&#x27;m in Germany now where it&#x27;s a lot more humid than in CO and the stuff still works. I use just a very small amount, rub it in my hands and then evenly distribute it through my hair, mainly on the ends. I&#x27;d say I only use about 1/2 Teaspoon if that. With this product less really is more otherwise you&#x27;ll just have greasy hair! This stuff is really fantastic! I walked outside yesterday and it was raining and my hair was still straight - yes I had an umbrella, but without this pomade my hair would have been curly again! And I like the smell a lot :) A MUST-HAVE! Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have been using this product for over 20 years to cut down on frizz. It does a great job, moisturizes hair, and lasts a long time. I use Frizz-Ease extra strength hair serum and 6 drops of Argon oil worked into wet hair, let it dry 20-30 minutes, then use a thermal spray before straightening the front and sides a bit. I use a dime-sized dollop of Aveda on my hands and work it through my hair (concentrating on the ends) before Frizz-Ease hair spray. Works for me! The Aveda is totally worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I use this product on the ends of my hair to keep them from drying out and from getting split ends. You only need to use a small amount, or else hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product I used years ago -- this is no better than Vaseline in a can. They changed their product -- and not for the better.</li>
    <li> Best anti humidity product out there. Keeps the freeze and poofy hair under control during wet weather or near the beach area. I use is on wet hair to avoid some of the strong essential oils fragrance which smells real good...just a bit too much for me.</li>
    <li> The product is ok. I would not say it actually resists humidity. It is thick and oily so it weighs the hair down. I have thin ethnic hair so I tend to avoid products in my hair in order to retain volume and bounce. This product eliminates both. I only use it on really rainy days.</li>
    <li> its ok I really can&#x27;t rave about this product I use it every once in a while sometimes it feels a little sticky</li>
    <li> Very different from one that I bought in the salon. The texture is very soft and didn&#x27;t work very well in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for years and still love it! I  always buy from the aveda store.. when I received this product I found it to be really liquidly..</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the high ratings here, which prompted me to purchase this product.  It did nothing for my hair in the humidity and functioned like any other hair \\&quot;grease\\&quot;.  The container is small and expensive and not worth purchasing. FYI - I have natural, pressed, African hair and it reverted to curly within an hour of the Miami humidity hitting my hair. It got even worse once the Jamaican weather reached it. Once my hair was curly again, it also did nothing to tame frizz.</li>
    <li> great shine, protectant for your hair, use after blow drying, use small amount on hair, flat iron or curl, beautiful shine</li>
    <li> Aveda keps the hair looking healthy, shiny without feeling tacky..&lt;br /&gt;It has a delicate aroma .It keeps the hair looking well-kept, even in humidity.</li>
    <li> Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade is an excellent product to tame &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; in your hair.  It also smells just divine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for my very thick curly bushy hair on humid days.</li>
    <li> This product was used on my hair once before and I was pleased with the results.  I used this product on my hair and had the same experience.  I would recommend this product to people with natural hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I hoped. Maybe I am using too much. Will try to use less in future.</li>
    <li> Excellent anti humectant pomade</li>
    <li> product did not work on reducing frizz in my hair</li>
    <li> This tiny thing does not provide any anti-humidity protection for my hair whatsoever. It is waaaay too expensive for its size and the inability to do what it claims it can do. But, I&#x27;ve managed to make it work by applying it on my hair before spraying hairspray with a strong hold. Given this product can make your hair pretty greasy, it balances out with the hairspray that has a alcohol in it which has a drying effect. With both those combinations, your hair will be decently humidity proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I buy a LOT of products promising to add shine, control frizz and stop my dry, parched, over 40 Caucasian, fine, damaged, processed hair. I can say that this one comes closer than most products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many, many, many). It does weigh heavy on the hair, it does make it look a bit greasy... BUT, I&#x27;d rather have a heavy, tiny-bit-greasy look than the look of what my hair does when it&#x27;s humid: it swells and gets bumpy ugly waves and frizz! I tried to wear my hair in a sleek pony tail when it was terribly humid and this product DID keep my pony tail nice and sleek. I got a few waves, but it did tame the frizz. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion after trying so many products that my hair is always going to be dry, frizzy and uncontrollably wavy at times... but this product does come the closets to making me feel a little better about my tresses when it&#x27;s soupy outside. Give it a shot! Use it sparingly until you can measure how much you need.</li>
    <li> This kinda doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair, except to make it greasy</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length curly hair and when I use the flat iron on my hair I use this as the finishing step.  I use Chi silk infusion when straightening my hair and use this on all the little fly always right on top.  A little goes a long ways... Be very careful not to use too much!  I usually dab my fingers in it and rub my hands together, swipe over the top of my hair and then take the flat iron and go over it.  I live in Florida where ther is a lot of humidity and this works great.</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizz out of my hair, provides texture, even darkens it slightly. And smells nice. Just a little lasts a long time. Stopped wasting money on other products, although I do mix it occasionally with others.</li>
