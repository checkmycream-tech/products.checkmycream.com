    <li> fast ship, but the reason for the 4 star is we thought that this was &amp;#34;refillable&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I will wear nothing else....ever!  This is my favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Awesome!my favorite cologne for him</li>
    <li> My husbands only scent.  I love it on him too.</li>
    <li> Most women relly like the smell of it. I like the smell of it. My wife doesn&#x27;t. I still by it, but don&#x27;t wear it around her -- i.e. working out at the gym, or bike riding, it is noce to &amp;#34;de-orderize&amp;#34; shall we say, oneself as strenuous activity continues.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad and he absolutely loves it. Has a great scene that lasts throughout the day</li>
    <li> Love it...always do...</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this order and the product was outstanding.</li>
    <li> This cologne was recommended to me and it was well worth the price. The fresh fragrance lasts a long time and is not overpowering. Great for the evening. Delivery was spot on and the order arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> angel its my firts name,so,its in me......</li>
    <li> This is a subtle scent that lasts and smells wonderful.  It has become my husband&#x27;s favorite.  He doesn&#x27;t like a strong scent that announces itself.  More importantly, his wife LOVES it!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this odder ever since i frist try it i fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;no bad thing to say about this item.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was counterfeit. The bar codes and tracking numbers had been cut out using a box cutter and the holes were taped over. The smell does not seem right. The store I purchased mine from was Amazon, not one of the third party merchants. Amazon refunded my purchase since the item could not be returned.</li>
    <li> My husband smells great when he uses this.  And so does the house when he walks through.</li>
    <li> this is the one i like best</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. at first i didn&#x27;t like it. we were both unsure but it grew on both of us. and he receives a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> I was afraid that it was a phony or watered down but it was the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted, smell projects and lasts.</li>
    <li> cologne arrived on time and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Enough for my job.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it it was very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It is okey for its price.&lt;br /&gt;Good to buy.</li>
    <li> I swear to you out of the nine different fragrances I purchase recently. Today when I want to work, this one was the only one that I got compliments on.  I promise I will purchase this again and whatever alternative fragrances this company produces.</li>
    <li> Using this for years.For me one of the best evening fragrance you can get.When I tried first time I almost hate it but now is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My second bottle of this spray. Love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son and he loves it.  One spray is enough and it has a nice fruity smell that is not too manly.  Perfect for a teen in my opinion.</li>
    <li> A Female Friend asked me 2 purchased this cologne (N the female version) I purchased the Male version... N its very good. Soft, smooth, longlasting etc... I only weae male fragrances,  so it was very easy adding this 1 2 my collections...</li>
    <li> For those who do not like the strong over powering musky smell..&lt;br /&gt;I Do Not reccomend buying this..&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time purchasing Thierry Mugler.&lt;br /&gt;Ive purchased a few, including leather and sport..&lt;br /&gt;This one has a distinctive female like musk too..&lt;br /&gt;I would say &amp;#34; I hate this smell &amp;#34; never liked the strong over powering musk smell</li>
    <li> terrific product,  will continue doing business. was fast and accurate</li>
    <li> Love this on my husband!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it&lt;br /&gt;On time delivery</li>
    <li> Received as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased a refill of the eau de toilette that I have been using for more then 10 years.  It arrived timely and is consistent with every prior refill I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my order!</li>
    <li> An AMAZING fragrance! I have worn this scent off and on for years and every time I wear it I always get compliments. This is a Must Have for any modern guy.</li>
    <li> Even though I really wanted to buy Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel Men Pure Malt, I didn&#x27;t really want to spend $90.00 on it. So I bought original Angel Men instead, and I do not regret it at all! It smells amazing, very woody, with hints of caramel and coffee that I notice. It lasts forever and smells better and better the longer you wear it. It has become my signature fragrance and I have recieved many compliments from ladies and gentlemen alike. I would definitely recommend this cologne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since it was first in stores. I think this was actually a knock off because it didn&#x27;t have the same smell. It smelled more of alcohol. I&#x27;d suggest not buying here and find a store that actually carries it.</li>
