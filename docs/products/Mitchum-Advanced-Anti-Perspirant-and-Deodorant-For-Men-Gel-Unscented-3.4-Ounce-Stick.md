      <li>Its so watery,thin,and the good neatral scent the unscented had is GONE!!!il</li>
      <li>It was great and was incredibly effective.</li>
      <li>Nothing worked as good as it did.</li>
      <li>and he loved it too.</li>
      <li>If you MUST use this product, then I recommend changing shirts every couple of hours to avoid ruining them for good.</li>
      <li>The gel itself is good for what it needs to do but not at the cost of everyone&#x27;s clothing.</li>
      <li>, good thing</li>
      <li>, I used it for years and loved it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although odor control is great, the AP is not that effective.</li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using Mitchum Gel for years, and have loved it.</li>
      <li>I have been a long-time user of Mitchum products and absolutely loved their PowerGel product</li>
      <li>I am over 60 years of age and cannot remember using anything but Mitchum deodorant and have loved it and recommended it.</li>
      <li>This used to be a good product till they changed it and put the O for oxygen on it.</li>
      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>Good Product at a Good Price</li>
      <li>&quot; is still good advice.</li>
      <li>I have used Mitchum deodorant for many years and always been happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I have been a Mitchum fan and VERY satisfied user for may years.</li>
      <li>Have used Mitchum gel for many years!  </li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>What did they do to my favorite deodorant!?  </li>
      <li>Amazingly they modified the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
      <li>I will say that the gel was never as effective as the roll-on; now the roll-on is just as ineffective as this gel version.</li>
      <li>I used the product for years and really liked it</li>
      <li>Great bargin, great seller thanks</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe they added h202 to counteract staining, but that creates its own problems.</li>
      <li>Of course Mitchum is effective.</li>
      <li>But it does smell nice, even though it&#x27;s advertised as unscented...</li>
      <li>I really liked the Power Gel Sport or Unscented Power Gel and would buy it if I could find it</li>
      <li>, I like that there&#x27;s no smell, and I like that it&#x27;s effective all day.  </li>
      <li>a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since I have a VERY strong BO, I used mitchum for men, the sport one.  </li>
      <li>Well I love michum and to be honest</li>
      <li>Huge mistake when they tried to change a good thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for about 12 years, primarily because they had a good gel formula and didn&#x27;t feel inclined to tinker with it.  </li>
      <li>used to even recommend the old formula to friends as it was the best unscented anti-perpirant/deodorant on the market</li>
      <li>The old formula which was used for years was the best!!</li>
      <li>The product is the most amazing one I have ever tried when it comes to an anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>What you may not know is that it is a cruelty-free product unlike most of its kind found in supermarkets everywhere.</li>
      <li>Scent free, great antiperspirant and easily applied.  </li>
      <li>The good reviews are for the original product.</li>
      <li>Good price, delivered right to my doorstep!  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST Mitchum, in my opinion, yet:  Effective, economical, fast drying, no residue to scrub off my shirts, non-sticky, non bleaching or staining, non-irritating to my pits (like the Mitchum roll-on of twenty years ago).  </li>
      <li>One of the great benefits of this product is you needn&#x27;t apply much for it to do its job!</li>
      <li>No smell that will interfere with my favorite after shave or cologne.</li>
      <li>I wish I had researched pricing a bit more before making this purchase so I didn&#x27;t now feel ripped off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing 35 or more.</li>
      <li>(I have bought many deodorants that were called \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and none of them had any noticible odors.)</li>
      <li>it runs out the top like water.</li>
      <li>I used to love Mitchum.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since this product had a formula change in 2014 it is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  Previously Mitchum was the best anti-perspirant on the market, I used it for years and loved it.  This new formula makes it one of the worst.  It&#x27;s so thin that is drips down your side, gets all over you and your surroundings when you apply it.  You also use much more of it now than previously because half of it never gets on you.  I&#x27;ve recently switched to something else after using the new formula for a while now hoping it was a short term mistake.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time. Exactly the product indicated. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Functionally works great.  New formula has oxygen which I guess separates the liquid from the gel and causes it to drool all over the outside making the container all sticky.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00MTSBFO6 Mitchum Men Advanced Oxygen 48 Hour Anti-perspirant &amp; Deodorant Invisible Solid ~ Sport Scent 2.7oz Stick (Quantity 1)]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product, for several years. I&#x27;m not purchasing this product any more. The one I usually buy was and is, still not available at the super market I go to. I will have to order this at a new store and have them call me when it arrives. I have been using Mitchum for many, many years. I&#x27;m guessing 35 or more. Nothing else works. Now not even this product works. HELP!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received this order the other day.  Hadn&#x27;t bought it in a very long time.  The scent is even better now and lasts a long time.I recommend this deodorant for the  manly scent it gives off,  and gentle feeling it carries.  My husband loves it too.  It is like an old friend came to our door again.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Advanced Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant For Men, Gel, Unscented ruins clothing because it now contains hydrogen peroxide. Also, it STINKS, smells like musk. We&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for 20+ years. Sorry, Revlon/Mitchum, you&#x27;ve lost two more customers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
    <li> Warning - this &#x27;unscented&#x27; deoderant has a horrible odor.  I ordered a 4 pack for my husband &amp; it smells so strong we had to throw them out.  If you have sensitivities to scents avoid this product.  Body odor would smell better.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that most antiperspirants ruin shirts with pit stains. This antiperspirant seems to do it the fastest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at the grocery store and the next day my t shirt had these faded marks after a day. I was amazed. I do sweat a lot, but it will be cheaper for me to find a different antiperspirant than to buy this one that will destroy all the t-shirts I own instantly...</li>
    <li> This is the one deodorant I&#x27;ve found. Try it use it works for men or women it&#x27;s worth it to stay dry. Mitchum works where others fall short.</li>
    <li> Updated my review after trying the new \\&quot;oxygenated\\&quot; version.    *  The newest version is runny, and drips out whenever the stick is resting on its side.  *  When removing the cap and trying to apply, deodorant runs out onto the floor, countertop, body, etc.  (This is why I&#x27;ve lowered my rating to 1 star and will stop buying this brand after being a customer for the past 10 years.)  *  The new container has a bunch of smooth holes in the end, instead of the rough slits.  So the end of the stick is smoother, there are no longer any protrusions inside the cap to prevent leakage.    The original version had 3 slits in the end, and a thicker formula that never dripped out.  But:  *  The glue under the \\&quot;security foil\\&quot; scratched up my underarms; the solution was to file down the top of the dispenser with the smoother side of a nail file immediately after removing the foil.  *  The deodorant gel attached to dark clothes (in the underarm area), and left a whitish patch that was virtually impossible to wash out.    The deodorant does expire and doesn&#x27;t work well at all after about a year, so I can&#x27;t \\&quot;stock up\\&quot; when it goes on sale.    I was trying to be a helpful consumer and called the manufacturer (Revlon) regarding the comments above, but the rep took a defensive attitude instead of taking note of my comments.    The only good part about Mitchum Unscented Deodorant is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and does not trigger my allergies.</li>
    <li> I use this unscented gel and then spray my favorite body spray or cologne for scent.  I also use Certain Dri [[ASIN:B001F0QX1E Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant (Pack of 3)]]once a week.  The full combination of these 3 products guarantees no sweaty pits or bad smell anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a chick, but I use the men&#x27;s version of this because it&#x27;s easier to find and often cheaper (and I&#x27;d bet money no different in formula than the \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; version.)  I like the way the gel dispenses with a nice, intermediate thickness, I like that it dries quickly and invisibly, I like that there&#x27;s no smell, and I like that it&#x27;s effective all day.  If I had underarm hair, I might like it less, because underarm hair could probably absorb a lot of the gel and make the user go through a stick much faster than I do.  I don&#x27;t, though, so it&#x27;s an ideal product for me.</li>
    <li> Not only does this deodorant fail to stop perspiration and odors for even an hour or two, but it doesn&#x27;t dry properly and leaves gross residue on your shirts. I am embarrassingly wearing a mitchum-stained dress shirt at work right now, and feeling rather angry that this product does exactly the opposite of what is advertised.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a lot of fragrances and so I use this product and have for over 10 years.  I no longer get a rash or itching caused by other deodorants.  This product works well and I don&#x27;t perspire as much as this product does its job.  I don&#x27;t put a lot on and it dries quickly and it hasn&#x27;t stained my clothes yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years because of the allergies but also it does not have an overwhelming fragrance that overpowers your cologne.  It has worked well for me and I feel that you will like it also!</li>
    <li> Mitchum Advanced Anti-Perspirant - always my favorite and I would recommend its use.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with all the negative comments here. I&#x27;ve been using the unscented gel for a very long time without problem but once they changed the formula it is so sticky that I can&#x27;t put on a shirt afterwards. And if I wait too long, it turns into a hard shell. The packaging gets all sticky too. So I&#x27;ve been looking for a new unscented (and fragrance free because unscented evidently doesn&#x27;t mean without scents) and I&#x27;d appreciate if someone could post an alternative. The reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that I tried the Arm and Hammer unscented deodorant and the thing doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours and this Michum really does last 48 hours. I guess I had always just assumed other deodorants would last as long. Oh well, now the search begins for an alternative.</li>
    <li> This thing feels like glue and leaves white residue under your armpits.    But it does smell nice, even though it&#x27;s advertised as unscented...</li>
    <li> I used this product a week ago for the first time, and I&#x27;ve just discovered that 3 shirts have been ruined.  Apparently the chemicals in the gel react with certain dyes.  In 2 shirts, the gel bleached out the dyes, and in one shirt it caused dark stains.    These shirts are ruined.  I&#x27;ve tried stain treatments and washing, and nothing works.    I strongly recommend you use a different product.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for years. This power Gel is is the best of their products. It last for at least 2 days before reapplying. Keeps wetness down, and dry all day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mitchum Power Gel for Women for several years and love it.  They must have changed the formula.....  In the last 6 weeks both my husband (he uses mens formula)and I found that several of our shirts had been ruined!  Two of my brand new shirts were bleached out....only under the arms!  Three of my husbands shirts had the same result only one of his was also bleached out on the front, you could see exactly how he had pulled the shirt over his head and had gotten deoderant on the front of his shirt.  THEY NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FAST BEFORE THEY LOSE ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS.  It only took a few ruined shirt to figure out the deoderant was the problem.</li>
    <li> This new product leaves a stain on my clothes...&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The deodorant stained and ruined nearly every shirt I owned. I couldn&#x27;t believe that they wouldn&#x27;t come out after washing it. All of the stains are white, right under the arm pit area. I&#x27;m surprised they are allowed to do business. The gel itself is good for what it needs to do but not at the cost of everyone&#x27;s clothing.</li>
    <li> Mitchum provided at one time an antipersperant/deodorant in a white cream form which was clearly the best product on the market. For some unknown reason, they pulled it and nothing including Mitchum Power Gel holds a candle to the cream. Further, the gel has ruined several of my good shirts. The cream held up very well after a day of fishing off shore, contact sports, and heavy yard work.</li>
    <li> I had been using this deodorant for years, oblivious to the fact that it was ruining my shirts. At first I thought I was the cause, and some weird aspect of my body chemistry was bleaching/staining the armpits on all my shirts. Then I bought a stick of regular Sure deodorant, and my problems with armpit stains vanished. I haven&#x27;t ruined a new shirt since. These stains WILL NOT come out with any amount of pretreating, and several black/dark colored shirts have even been bleached, or seem to have some white residue on them. Several shirts are now and have been ruined due to this product (10-15), and I will NEVER use this or any othe gel deodorant again. If you MUST use this product, then I recommend changing shirts every couple of hours to avoid ruining them for good. Even then it&#x27;s not a guarantee, as I adopted this practice, assuming I was the cause, and still ruined a couple of shirts. The stains, honestly, look like grease stains and can prove to be very embarassing if you are unaware of them. Possibly the only shirts that were not affected by this were my white T&#x27;s    The packaging seriously needs a warning about this.</li>
    <li> I used Mitchum unscented roll-on for years (and the gel in a pinch if my drugstore was out of the roll-on). Lately, I was starting to wonder if I&#x27;d developed some kind of medical problem, because my armpits ALWAYS smell bad halfway through the day whereas before, I could, as advertised, actually skip a day by mistake and not alert everyone around me with funky armpits. Thank heavens for the people who pointed out the ingredient change in other reviews. I&#x27;ve ordered Secret Clinical strength and hope it works. (Yes, I&#x27;m a lady who used \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; Mitchum - there is no unscented version in the pastel \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; bottle). I will say that the gel was never as effective as the roll-on; now the roll-on is just as ineffective as this gel version.</li>
    <li> I love the effectiveness of mitchum antiperspirant.  It is a great product.  I will most likely purchase it again n the future..if I live long enough..Yest it has a very long effectiveness rating in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I realize that the term \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; does not always mean a product does not have an odor. However, I have found that when referring to deodorant, it usually does. (I have bought many deodorants that were called \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and none of them had any noticible odors.) Not so in this case. I found that the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; Mitchum gel has an odor that I find offensive. (A strong--and somewhat sweet--alcohol scent that does not abate sufficiently when the gel dries.) In spite of that, the product works very effectively at stopping wetness and body odor. I just wish it was truly unscented and not just un-perfumed.</li>
    <li> This new formula is awful.  It drips because it is so watery.  The container must be stored in an upright position.  Do not put it in a suitcase or a drawer on its side.  It will drip out of the container and make a mess in your suitcase or drawer. I will NEVER buy The Mitchum Antiperspirant again. I think their Marketing and Research people made a &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; product.  I want the old formula back!!  That one was great!  This one is simply not usable and awful.</li>
    <li> I live in an equatorial country where the relative humidity is over 85% much of the time, and the temperature never drops below 80F.  This deodorant is far better than any I&#x27;ve used here in the last 8 years, and works for 2-3 days at a time, even though I shower twice a day. The fact that it is unscented is a plus.</li>
    <li> I used to stink a lot till I started using this product. I keeps me dry and not smelly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others who also smell bad at times. learn it, love it, live it</li>
    <li> This CRAP ruined my shirt. I used it ONCE and noticed the color on my shirt was ruined. My dress shirts are custom made and very costly and now it is trash! Stay away from this product!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best deo on the market. Others pale in comparison to this product. I thought I would never find a product to rid me of the decomposed roadkill / rotten garlic smell under my arm pits. Seriously. It was causing my confidence to go down the drain. No matter how much of the \\&quot;other stuff\\&quot; I used, the smell would come back like a boomerang!! I dont even need a \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot;. The regular Mitchum works fine. Ive had no problems with staining. I love putting my arms up while I watch t.v and not have to smell that deathly draft of arm pits. Mitchum is the best! Cured my chronic smelly arm pits!</li>
    <li> Perfect for every man, especially those who wear a cologne/scent.  No clash with the flowery/masculine? smells that generally accompany stick deodorants.  You&#x27;ll like this one a lot.  It&#x27;s my favorite.  Does not stick to your underarm like glue (like a lot of deodorants) and washes off easily while providing all the odor protection you need.</li>
    <li> Mitchum has long been my favorite brand of anti-perspirant.  They have changed the formulation so that now with each use watery gel runs out all over the place.  I had hoped it was an anomaly and purchased it more than once with the new formula but it is all the same, very messy.  I will be changing brands.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing this item for years at local retail stores.  Comes well packaged but these bottles seem a bit watery.</li>
    <li> I have used this antiperspirant for years and been very pleased with the results, but this new dispenser is an absolute disaster. All of those holes let the product flow out whether you want it to or not. It dispenses many times as much product as needed - this is very wasteful and takes forever to dry. Do NOT buy this again until they fix the dispenser.</li>
    <li> I liked the old Mitchum gel, but this new version is terrible.  As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product is so watery that it leaks all over, running down the sides of the container when you roll even a small amount out to be applied.  This gets on your hands, your bathroom counter, etc. and is hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making matters worse, while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside. So forget packing it in your gym bag or suitcase--you&#x27;ll find it everywhere: a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I used other anti-perspirants my whole life. I switched to Mitchum because it has more active ingredient than most others. It seems to work much better, and I believe it doesn&#x27;t have the waxy junk that can ruin your T-shirts.</li>
    <li> This product has mixed reviews - I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years every day, so I will say there is some truth in the reviews that say it can bleach.  The Power Gel works great - it keeps me dry and you can even skip a day without noticing.  Unlike other gels with scents, this has never once bothered my skin.  Some of the others can itch terribly - not so with the Mitchum unscented Power Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that you need to let it dry after you apply before wearing a shirt, especially a dark colored one.  I have noticed that while it does not consistently bleach, some fabrics are more sensitive to it than others.  Once it is dry you are fine, and an undershirt generally does a good job of protecting the outer shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that limitation, I recommend it so long as you use it carefully.</li>
    <li> I am also a long time user of the Alcohol Free, Unscented rool on.  It was recommended by a colleague back in 1993, I am super sensitive to preservatives, particulary Sulfate so most ant-pespirat products &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my skin.  The new Oxygen contains both Alcohol and Sulfate. I recently purchased the stick here on Amazon, and spent a full day with my armpits on fire.  I found that they were literally red, when I looked in the mirror. I still had half a spray can of the old formula and have been using it since. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when it is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please spare a thought for those of us who are allergic to Sulfate, and have used your product for decades and are now left stranded.</li>
    <li> worked as is intended</li>
    <li> Either Mitchum executives don&#x27;t travel or they don&#x27;t use their product, because packing this with your other toiletries is an absolute mess. I&#x27;ve been loyal for as long as I can remember and I&#x27;m confused why they chose to ruin this perfect product so completely, but I can&#x27;t wait around for them to fix it. I just threw out 3 unused Mitchum tubes and switched to Arm &amp; Hammer Unscented.</li>
    <li> I really like unscented soaps &amp; deodorants - this is what cologne is for. I have been using the Mitchum unscented for years &amp; I am very happy the product. I know some other reviewers complained about stains &amp; I don&#x27;t doubt that this is something that can occur. This has not been an issue for me. I would also add that human perspiration can do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I am a working lady, 26 years of age. Since I have a VERY strong BO, I used mitchum for men, the sport one.  As it kept me from having a bad BO, as well as having the smell of a man. Now, with the new oxygen product, which the odor is so strong of a man, I cannot use mitchum anymore.  The ladies&#x27; products are not strong enough for me to feel confident with. So I will also have to start looking for a new product that I can use and trust. So sad, I used mitchum for about 10 years now. I don&#x27;t mind paying for a product that works, but I will have to start spending money on looking for another product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty bull crap, it&#x27;s nasty, disgusting, and smells like rotten horse s%#$, especially the,&amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34;, is nastier than s$@# in your mouth. Don&#x27;t buy it. The people who make this nasty crap must be a bunch of yay-hoos.</li>
    <li> Pretty good price for the product.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for over a year and it works just as good as when I first tried it. Some deodorants seem to stop working after a while but Mitchum has been quite consistent for me--even during the summer. Great product.</li>
    <li> Something has changed with my last order.  We&#x27;ve used this brand for many years but no longer; something in the formula must have changed as it makes everyone in our household itch.  Should drop the M and just call it &#x27;itchum&#x27;.</li>
    <li> The new Mitchum &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; formula is a terrible mess. Leaks all over my gym bag and counter top. I&#x27;m switching brands. Notice that Mitchum does nothing about reversing this mistake. Bye, Mitchum.</li>
    <li> Great stuff I can never find it on the shelf so now I have enough to last a while.  Will order again for the speedy delivery service.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product from my local grocery store. Imagine my surprise when I discovered the store had the product marked down and were no longer going to carry it. I tried another product after I ran out of my last bottle of Mitchum&#x27;s and hated it. Got online and found it on Amazon. Must buy multiple bottles but that just lets me stock up for a while and gets the best price. Have used this Mitchum&#x27;s since my two sons were teens. One of them was a profuse \\&quot;swetter\\&quot; and needed a heavy duty deodorant. The rest of us followed his need as I wasn&#x27;t going to buy a different deodorant for each person. Time has past--teenagers are now middle aged adults, and I&#x27;m still attached to Mitchum&#x27;s. At this late date I don&#x27;t plan on stopping the use of a good product. As long as they keep making Mitchum&#x27;s I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Have used the old formula for years.  Ended up with a couple of these but I am done.  The new formula is watery and spills everywhere.  The cap slips off and the bottle falls to the floor, splashing the gel everywhere.  Takes a long time to dry when I apply it.  I&#x27;m done and switching to another brand.</li>
    <li> Well I love michum and to be honest it is the only deodorant that can stand up to the Iraq heat. And since they do not sell it on any of the army bases here I had to do what ever I needed to to make sure that I could get it here. But this is the best deodorant that I have and will ever use.</li>
    <li> When I was younger I used Old Spice and a friend of mine who claimed to be more sophisticated than me said that Mitchum was the way to go.  So of course I had to run out and buy a deodorant and having now been using Mitchum for over 10 years and have never tried another drugstore deodrant.  However as I have aged and once again wanted to try something else I bought a Versace deodrant from Nordstroms for about $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mitchum makes me feel cleaner and less self conscious about possible B.O. than the more expensive Versace.  It goes on smoothly has no after smell and provides protection all day which is important in the Las Vegas summers that I have to suffer through.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed it came with no filters. You get what you pay for. A cheaply made mask and strap system. Spend double the amount or by throw away masks.</li>
    <li> A horrible mess. Do not try to travel with this item, it will get all over everything in your bag. Watery formula combined with a bad dispenser equals a mess and huge amount of wasted product. Too bad too. I used the previous versions for 10 years. Time to move on.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I used to love the older non- &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; version of this product, which apparently is no longer made.  In this version, the gel turns to a runny liquid the second it hits the air...so as soon as you turn the knob, the gel comes out, turns to liquid, and runs down the side of the package and all over your hand.  If you can actually manage to get some in the appropriate places, it does seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchum, please bring back the original formula!</li>
    <li> What a sloppy disgusting mess!!! The new delivery cap drips out everywhere but where I need it and I instantly noticed stains on my clothing. Don&#x27;t you idiots test this before putting it on the market??? I&#x27;m throwing out what I have...you&#x27;ve lost a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> The Gel is a lot like water. I also do not like the small holes at the top. It does do what it is suppose to do. The solid with the three slots was much better for me.</li>
    <li> If you want to feel like a disgusting, drippy, watery mess with stained shirts, go right ahead and buy this. I don&#x27;t know who thought making the base for this nothing but water and consider it to be a good idea, but they need to reevaluate their lives. The formula that was just fine worked for YEARS</li>
    <li> I was stunned to see all the negative reviews about this product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for dozens of years and have never had a staining or bleaching problem. How much of this stuff are these people swiping on? One of the great benefits of this product is you needn&#x27;t apply much for it to do its job! It&#x27;s great that the unscented version is truly just that. No odor or perfumes whatsoever. I&#x27;ve tried other brands in a pinch when traveling, and have been quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum deodorant for years (at least 30).  I like the men&#x27;s unscented, and have never had a problem with any sweat stains or odor.  Now, I can&#x27;t find the Mitchums I like!!  The solid is NOT solid!!  Everytime I use it I feel sticky instead of dry.  Also, it is so soft that it breaks off when I apply.  Unfortunately, I have about 5 of them that I&#x27;m going to donate to a homeless shelter.  I will not use Mitchums again.  Why waste the money on something I am not satisfied with.  I will be shopping for a new product.  Sorry Revlon....you messed up on this.  If it ain&#x27;t broke....don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Mitchum before.Decided to change the anti-perspirant deodorant .However it was a huge mistake.In less than hour I felt  odour.With other anti-perspirants this could only happen at the end of the working day.Waste of money.People complain about bleached armpits on clothes.If you read the small letters on the bottle with ingredients it says that one of the substances is hydrogen peroxide(bleach) which explains the ruined shirts.I am just wondering who&#x27;s genious idea is to include hydrogen peroxide in product that has frequent contact to fabrics and clothes and is quite simple to figure out that sooner or later will bleach them.</li>
    <li> I was mistaken when i bought this product. I thought i was buying  deoderant but it was actually super glue for your armpits. This is incredibly sticks and never dries. Maybe the worst product ive ever bought.</li>
    <li> I used this anti-perspirant for about 10 years but not anymore the new formula sucks. I have switched to Dry Idea http://amzn.to/1Ib90IS</li>
    <li> When they re-formulated this product they took a big step back IMO.  This product is more of a very thin and runny gel vs a much thicker gel in the past version.  And, it is less effective for me and does stain/bleach some of my dress shirts though not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that it is 3.2 oz would mean it is subject to confiscation by TSA if they were being picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a different brand/product.</li>
    <li> Prolonged use of the product seems to result in stiff, white stains on the underarm areas of most of my shirts. Problem has gotten worse over the last year, and the stains will not wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironic, as the whole point of using a colorless gel AP/DEO was to eliminate underarm staining--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although odor control is great, the AP is not that effective. I actually sweat more profusely when using this product as compared to a standard deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware--</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and smelling sweet the way NO other deoorants do</li>
    <li> Did not work and it stained my shirts. It also has a terrible smell. Absolutely useless. Why are these so expensive? Its the worst anti-perspiration I ever tried.</li>
    <li> [I used Mitchum cream for over 40 years and they took it off the market.  None of the others, roll on, gel, powder, etc. compare and it has become a big problem for me]  Is there anywhere I can get the old one in a jar?[ASIN:B001EWEP3Q Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant  Power Gel, Sport, 2.25 oz (63 g) (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum for over 20 years, since the new formulation, new packaging and new drippy, runny formula. I cannot continue to use this product. I pains me because I truly do like the results but the staining of my clothes, the product running down the side of the container at each application is a deal breaker.  Someone needs to be fired for this fiasco. Sorry just my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to perfumes and the like, they make my eyes water and itch.  This is one of the few brands of Deodorant that I can use without any problems.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores and expensive there. A very tiny dab is sufficient for me. I have had no skin problems with use daily for years. I find it expedient to &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; the plunger a turn or less, to back the product away from the opening. This reduces product coming out of the chamber while in my gym bag, especially sitting in a hot car. Six bottles is several years supply for me, but it seems to keep well.</li>
    <li> After 20 years, I&#x27;m moving on to something else. This product is a watery mess as others have stated.</li>
    <li> Great price, this is an effective product especially in the summertime a and the recent heat wave makes it really necessary</li>
    <li> GREAT ANTI PERSPIRANT/ DEODORANT, BEST ON THE MARKET.  EXCELLENT PRICE..</li>
    <li> This has a very heavy perfume that lingers even through laundering.  The other clothes in the same load of laundry also acquire the scent.  GROSS.  Who wants to smell like deodorant??  It also causes the armpits of my husbands undershirts to turn yellow.  On the positive side, he doesn&#x27;t smell like BO, but he never really did anyway.  Why do they put &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; on the package when clearly it is NOT.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t ruin my clothes, but it is definitely NOT unscented.</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of this product, but no more. The reasons I&#x27;m leaving this product are the same as the other reviewers - stained clothes, dripping product that leaks out into my drawer (not everyone has room to stand their deodorant stick upright), it takes longer to dry, etc.  I found some solid Old Spice products that work as well for me as the old Mitchum, so my business is going to Proctor &amp; Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some marketing types at Revlon can study the lessons learned from the New Coke debacle in the &#x27;80s and draw some parallels.</li>
    <li> Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow zero stars, so I will have to settle for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula and the packaging are horrible. They got rid of the classic Mitchum I&#x27;ve used for years and have lost a customer. I&#x27;d strongly recommend everyone find a better deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mitchum since I was raised...this deodorant never broke me out or left me funky..plus i am very active...only bad thing is the dripping outside the package what&#x27;s that about</li>
    <li> As others have noted, it is NOT unscented,  despite the labeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, it is a pain to apply, and runs all over.  It&#x27;s kind of like runny jello that&#x27;s breaking down into a watery mess the whole time.  You dare not tip the container or it will run out, and it drips and runs down your side as you&#x27;re applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is ineffective in my experience,  and does not prevent BO anywhere nearly as well as the old power gel did.</li>
    <li> I have been using MITCHUM for many years. Last year I noticed a huge different in the formula. Its very thin and watery and leaks from the container, [very messy]. I had to use my hair dryer to dry my underarms because it was so wet. I finally tossed it and purchased clinical which works fine but much more expensive. Is this why you changed the formula so I would have to pay more? [Would like an answer if that is possible.] I use  MIFCHUM because it doesn&#x27;t give a me a rash like some other deodorant. I guess the reason my shirts didn&#x27;t stain is because I dried my underarms, I just couldn&#x27;t stand the wetness. Will you reimburse me for the deodorant I had to toss or change back to the original formula? I will continue using your product, like I said no rash.</li>
    <li> I am a female but I use this deodorant right alongside my husband.  I have found this to be the only deodorant that is strong enough to keep me smelling clean.  Their claims that you can even skip a day are justified.  It really works.  We won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum forever (50 years?).  What did they do to my favorite deodorant!?  It is now a watery drippy mess, it drips down my side when applying, occasionally leaves blobs on the bathroom counter and the container doesn&#x27;t nearly last as long as the old product.  Time to find a  new product because this clearly sucks.</li>
    <li> Where is the Mitchem that I began using in the 1960&#x27;s?  As a female, it was the only deodorant that I could use confidently.  And I used the silk applicator top for years.  When it was changed to roll on I adapted.  But now the only one that works says it is for men.  WTF?  Why did you take away the only deodorant that worked for me?  Is it under another name?</li>
    <li> The new formula sucks. Do not buy. If you don&#x27;t hold it upright it runs out the top like water. Why change something that was perfect?</li>
    <li> I used to love Mitchum.  They have reformulated and the product now has oxygen.  The new formula is much less viscous and drips down the outside of the new package (gel comes through many dots versus a few slits).  The antiperspirant now constantly drips down the side of the package and dries, which gets all over your hands each time you pick up the container.  I&#x27;m constantly having to wipe down the package.  It gets two stars because the product still works, but the new runny formula combined with the new packaging results in a mess.  I need to find a new unscented antiperspirant that works as well.  Hate to give it up after many years of use, but having to wash your hands after applying it because the containers gets so messy is the deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2014 Update.  I contacted Revlon to complain about the new formula.  Thinking I may have received a bad batch, they sent me an envelope to return the partly used antiperspirant and they sent me a replacement.  The new one was exactly the same as the one I returned... I&#x27;m having the same issues.  I&#x27;m almost done with my last container of Mitchum and am trying to figure out what brand to try next.</li>
    <li> I used Mitchum for what seems like for ever, over 10 yrs.  I always bought a couple of the double packs at a time so they would last me a while.  I tried the new one with the oxygen and it sucked.  It was really watery and had a weird smell, I always bought the unsented.  I bought another one from a different store thinking it was a bad batch, I was wrong.  I ended up buying the Degree Clinical uncented and it works better than Mitchum ever did.  If they had not changed the formula I would still be using it, and have kept using it for another 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> I have to say I thought it was me.  I have been using this product for years and years and had no issues.  The last nine months or so every one has been runny and messy.  It is impossible to use and do not recommend.  I hope they go back to the old formula, otherwise it is unusable.</li>
    <li> This is the very best product... We will use it everyday,  But we cant use no other. So we will use Mitchum</li>
    <li> This is not the Mitchum Anti-Perspirant Gel you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum for Men gel for at least 35+ years and have loved it until recently when you changed the formula.  Now it is NOT a gel but more of a LIQUID.  When I put it on it drips all over the place.  I hate it.  I have changed to the solid brand but don&#x27;t like it as much as I liked the old gel formula.  Please change the formula back.</li>
    <li> What were they thinking? This used to be a good product till they changed it and put the O for oxygen on it. Now it is sticky, wet, and yucky! Can&#x27;t feel dry even after blow drying! Ridiculous. I will miss the old formula but I&#x27;m not using this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been a Mitchum customer and user for years but on recent trips to local stores the only product for men on the shelf if the new Oxygen Odor Control. I am on my 2nd container of the Gel and will never buy it again. I really liked the Power Gel Sport or Unscented Power Gel and would buy it if I could find it but it is not carried in any of the stores I visited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search is on to find a replacement brand for Mitchum. I will not buy another Oxygen gel. I gave it a rating of 1 because I could not give it a Zero.</li>
    <li> Love Mitchum so when I saw this bargain I leap all over it, Great Product</li>
    <li> This is an excellent buy and it works in an excellent way. I am glad I bought this and have appreciated it&#x27;s dependability for a while now!</li>
    <li> I am sad to say that after using Mithcum gel for more than 20 yrs. I will have to start looking for something new. The newest &amp;#34;48 hour&amp;#34; gel is terrible. It melts as soon as it hits the air. Please bring the old formula back!!</li>
    <li> The gel and liquid separate so sometimes when you open the top to use, liquid/oily substance spews out into your hands. The power gel was better.</li>
    <li> This is not unscented... I can not put the scent into words but find it with a stench of perfume. I am a guy, I very much dislike that companies scent everything, even the mild ones are waaay too much, oh and I have allergies.   How the hell are people to match the antiperspirant, shampoo, body wash/soap, and /or cologne scents?? Another $7 down the drain.</li>
    <li> The new &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; formula is horrid.  It&#x27;s half water, drips all over just from opening the cap, and runs down your side as you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally have to shake a bunch of water off the top before using it each time just to keep most of it from dripping down onto the floor, my pants, etc.  Probably wasting half the bottle just &amp;#34;prepping&amp;#34; it each time like this.  And even once you get past the watery annoyance...the new formula smells like a chemical factory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Mitchum exclusively for twenty plus years, but I&#x27;m jumping ship and finding something, anything else.  Unless and until they revert this formula (or at least sell the old one as &amp;#34;Classic Mitchum&amp;#34; ala New Coke) they&#x27;ve lost a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> Id give it a zero if I coud. WHAT THE HECK??!! Why in the world would they change a great thing??  IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO FIND A DEODERANT THAT WORKED FOR ME..I HAD BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS...AND NOW IT SUUUUXXXXX!!!!!! Its so watery,thin,and the good neatral scent the unscented had is GONE!!!il I am so irritated!</li>
    <li> I mean it literally does absolutely nothing. Here is just one example from yesterday: I woke up Sunday morning at 9am. Took a long shower. Put deodorant on - and plenty of it. Threw on a t-shirt and some shorts. Jumped in a taxi and headed to the airport. When putting my bag in the overhead compartment, I could already smell my armpits. Literally this is 2.5 hours later. The only reason I purchased this is because I thought it would be great at smell protection. It&#x27;s like a random glue without any odor or antiperspirant protection at all. I&#x27;m actually amazed this company still exists.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubbie when I developed some severe issues with scented items.  He was a bit leery of a new deodorant, but he tried it.  (took us a while to find a regular one that worked well enough for him, especially with all the outdoor work he does in the heat).  Well, this fit the bill.  There is a faint hint of a smell when I stick my nose right against the bottle, but nothing that bothers me when it is on him.  I use more natural stuff on myself ([[ASIN:B000B969B4 Liquid Spray Mist Deodorant - 8 oz - Spray]], but he needed something stronger.  This fits the bill perfectly!  As of today, he has been using this for 5 months.  No issues with scents, no issues with it bleaching shirts.  Works great.  ** Just an update - still using this for my hubbie and he LOVES it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!!! HAZARD to your apparel. White stains (residue) under your arm pits on all dark colored T/shirts! Even the label reads NOT - B.S. You&#x27;ll see it right after 2 months of usage! Very disappointed! Switch to Degree Men&#x27;s Clinical Protection!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not unscented,  despite what it says on the label. I can&#x27;t tell you if it keeps your armpits dry, but I can tell you&#x27;ll need to take a shower to get the scent fully off. If you or the people you live with are sensitive to scents, do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Mitchum customer for over 2 decades and I do not like the new product or product packaging enhancements at all.  It&#x27;s watery, doesn&#x27;t work as well, there is so much waste with the multiple air holes, the cap doesn&#x27;t properly adhere so it makes a huge mess when traveling! I wrote to Mitchum, and their response to me was a generic reply that they use for everyone and didn&#x27;t address my issues at all. I&#x27;m changing deodorants!!!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve ruined a great product. The original formula was one of the few that didn&#x27;t cause me irritation, but the new watery formulation and multiperforated container are an absolute disaster. The stuff leaks out everywhere and gets sticky residue all over the container making it so messy to use that I have to pick it up with a tissue to avoid 10 minutes of handwashing to get it off. It&#x27;s REALLY bad for travel, when you can&#x27;t guarantee that the container will remain upright. In your bag, it leaks all over everything. On a recent trip over seas when I first discovered this disaster, it made a huge mess of everything in my travel kit. They&#x27;ve done the same thing to their Almay product, too, which uses the same formula and container. This is the &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; of antiperspirants. Whoever their focus group/test was were idiots.</li>
    <li> Ruined the underarms of my shirts. Very upset. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> My clothing - nightie, purple tank top, t-shirts were being ruined one by one.  Now I know why.  I will throw out my new Mitchum Advanced Anti-Perspirant and buy something else.  I was a loyal customer for 10 years, but the new formulation is a failure.</li>
    <li> New formula is garbage. Runny, doesn&#x27;t dry, feels awful. I will be switching to a new deodorant brand.</li>
    <li> Not sure but product seems fake... been using Mitchum for years.. packaging suspect... products runs ..Not happy at all!!!</li>
    <li> Good price, delivered right to my doorstep!  My favorite antiperspirant, I&#x27;m a woman, but it is unscented. I have used this for ten years, simply the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and just started using their &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula. What a disappointment when a product you&#x27;ve trusted for a long time has been completely ruined. Like other reviewers here, I&#x27;ve experienced the drippy mess this has become. Every morning, I open the cap to the liquid dripping down the package and onto my bathroom counter top. Even worse is flying with it. When you pull it out of the bag, it has made a drippy mess everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of it all, the new packaging and formula runs out in about half the time of the old packaging. Probably because most of it ends up on the bathroom counter top and floor, or being wiped away with a paper towel because it has dripped down the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; I have ever experienced in a product this side of &amp;#34;New Coke.&amp;#34; I would bet they are being bombarded with complaints.</li>
    <li> Not good purchase. In the order of 4 that i received i received one unscented and the other three were scented. I only wanted unscented.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for since last winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed discoloration of my white undershirts, but figured they just needed replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer, I spent about $250 on new shirts for work and to wear on my days off. Getting my clothes ready for the dry cleaners this weekend, I noticed that almost all the shirts I wore in the last 2 weeks have bleaches armpits. Shirts are ruined. They are either bleached (darker colored shirts), or discolored (lighter shirts with patterns). Ruined 2 Lacoste polo shirts that I have worn only once she I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product!</li>
    <li> I bought a two-pack of this &#x27;unscented&#x27; deodorant a couple of days ago. I used it yesterday morning. I went to work and started smelling a musty smell on my clothes. I thought maybe it was my sweater, but no, my sweater was clean. I kept smelling that awful smell throughout the day. It wasn&#x27;t until I got home, pulled off my sweater and smelled my armpits. That confirmed it--my pits smelled like a dusty old attic or a couch in a retirement home. Very disappointed. How did this stuff make it past the testing environment?    I recently used the Mitchum solid white stick for men, which is great, and I also used to &#x27;borrow&#x27; my wife&#x27;s Mitchum baby-scented deodorant. That was great, too. Heck, I even remember my mother&#x27;s roll-on Mitchum from way back in the 70s or 80s--that was powerful and effective stuff. This garbage is going back to the store for a refund.    And I&#x27;ll note that if Revlon (the owner of Mitchum) is refusing to step up and address the legitimate grievances of dissatisfied customers, maybe it&#x27;s worth avoiding this brand altogether in the future. Sad to say that about a brand I used to trust inherently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m with others posting here who don&#x27;t like this new (runnier) gel and I will be looking for a new anti-perspirant after many years using Mitchum. I actually emailed Revlon (parent company) to ask why I couldn&#x27;t seem to find the Unscented For Sensitive Skin Men&#x27;s Antiperspirant; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin - it&#x27;s just that THAT &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; actually didn&#x27;t have a scent, unlike this one. A Revlon rep wrote back to tell me they&#x27;d discontinued it and have no plans to offer a similar product. Bye, Mitchum. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat as many of the reviewers here.  The new Mitchum formula is simply gross.  It has a much lower viscosity than the previous formula and takes forever to dry.  Heaven forbid you put your clothing on before it is dry, because it will bleach your clothes.  I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for about 12 years, primarily because they had a good gel formula and didn&#x27;t feel inclined to tinker with it.  Sorry to see that mentality come to an end, but after tossing this most recent container of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Mitchum in the trash, I will go find a different deodorant.  Sorry the folks at Mitchum had to mess with something that worked so well before.</li>
    <li> This new Oxygen formula is DESTROYING my husband&#x27;s shirts by leaving a sticky residue on the underarms that bakes in during washing process. He is returning the remaining sticks and we are contacting the Mitchum toll free number. He is a longtime user of Mitchum power gel and swears by it. He bought this thinking it was the same product but just an updated package. It isn&#x27;t.. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER.</li>
    <li> Unsented it&#x27;s not. It may not be flowery or spicey but it has a distinct chemical smell. It&#x27;s transparent but sticky as all get out. Awful.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers, I have been using this product for years (probably 7-8) and will no longer purchase this product. They changed the formula this year (noticeable by change from slits to dots). It is basically water. It makes a huge mess on me, in my drawer, bag, etc. It seems to be worse in terms of white residue on dark shirts. The actual antiperspirant performance is as good if not slightly better. But the consistency makes it completely unusable in my book.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the same product you are used to, this is a different formula it is a watery mess and you will throw it away. They made a change in the formula and it is a mistake.  All positive reviews were for the old formula. The new one was a bad mistake. Read the dates on the reviews. The recent reviews are all bad.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum faithfully for many years. The new formula and packaging is horrible. It leaks out of the container. It also has stained four shirts just this week. I cannot believe the failure of adequate testing that the release of this very flawed product reflects. Truly awful.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d bother to write a review about an anti-perspirant, but Mitchum&#x27;s change in their men&#x27;s forumla, inspired me to do so. I&#x27;d used the prior Mitchum men&#x27;s unscented Gel anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant for years. It worked better than anything else I&#x27;d found, and was benign to the skin. The new formula, feels like a film of thin glue when it dries on the skin - very uncomfortable. It did not work, and worst, I developed an immediate rash. I had purchased four bottles, and tossed them all. \\&quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it,\\&quot; is still good advice. Mitchum&#x27;s unfortunately, missed that one in the book of wisdom. I would recommend against purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> After trying many deodorants and antiperspirants, I don&#x27;t buy anything else. When you wake up in the morning and your nose is next to someone&#x27;s armpit, you want that person to wear an unscented antiperspirant that prevents that stench. I think my husband and I have found the right one. Only two drawbacks. One, at the end of the container, the dial only goes so far, so I end up wasting what probably amounts to another 3 applications. Second, we have had some clothing that has bleached in the armpit area. Since we&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 years, I don&#x27;t know what else could cause that stain. As pricing goes, walmart.com has a 3 pack of 3.4 oz. for $11.79  which comes out the same as amazon&#x27;s 4 pack for $15.74. However, Walmart has amazon beat on the 2 pack of 2.25 oz. for $4.82. The result is $1.07 an ounce and you don&#x27;t have to wait 5-14 days to get it. Both companies have free shipping if over a certain amount. If this product didn&#x27;t stain my clothes, I would give 5 stars. Note: Not sure if all the stores offer this, but today I found a better deal that the online store didn&#x27;t offer: 2 pk. of 3.4 oz. for $4.82 &#x3D; $0.71 per ounce.</li>
    <li> The power gel is invisible and will keep you smelling fresh all day! The price is reasonable especially at Wal-Mart. If you need a powerful deodorant look no further.</li>
    <li> Of course Mitchum is effective. What you may not know is that it is a cruelty-free product unlike most of its kind found in supermarkets everywhere. Mitchum is not animal-tested.</li>
    <li> I use to use Mitchum Gel for the longest time.  It was the best unscented anti-perspirant on the market....  However, they changed the active ingredient.  Currently, the roll-on and power-gel have the \\&quot;new ingredient\\&quot;  However, the smart solid and regular solid have gone back to use the old active ingredient, and both those products work great.  Do not use the roll-on or the power-gel.  The change in the active ingredient ruined both products.</li>
    <li> Agree with other comments here. Reformulation was an incredible mistake. Mitchum Advanced was clearly a step back...someone was asleep at the wheel when this reformulation was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product runs out of the container if not stored upright. It oozed out into a vanity drawer and permanently marred the finish. When I travel, I have to put the container into a plastic bag! Mitchum Advanced is particularly sticky under your arm too. I haven&#x27;t noticed staining on dark shirts but am only just beginning the second container of a 2-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for many years and been so satisfied - until they unleashed this trash. Time to move on from Mitchum.</li>
    <li> It was a great well loved product. Not anymore. Drains up to my elbow/wrist. Spoils all clothing. Done with this product.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T STAND THIS NEW FORMULA! It smells bad, feels bad, apparently ruins your clothes (too early for me to know). I won&#x27;t have to worry about the clothing stain problem as I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brand of deodorant. Thanks Mitchum! You forced away a decade-old customer of your original gel formula!!!!</li>
    <li> Some clothing items become &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; if you get this product of them.  Has happened to a couple of my t-shirts.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good item</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to deodorant for most of my adult life.  However, the reformulation with oxygen (whatever that means) is terrible.  It turns to liquid and leaks out of the container.  When I travel, I have to put it in a Ziplock bag to keep the goo from leaking out all over everything.  Unfortunately I bought two of these, so I&#x27;m stuck for a while before I can look for something else.  On the other hand, maybe I&#x27;ll just cut my losses and dump the stuff.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant for men and women who tend to perspire a lot.</li>
    <li> Like many other people here, I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for years. Since they switched to &amp;#34;new &amp; improved oxygen technology&amp;#34; (read: hydrogen peroxide), the product is more water than gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they added h202 to counteract staining, but that creates its own problems. Namely, bleaching and wateriness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling with this item is not possible. It will leak and ooze over everything else in your travel pouch. Even daily use requires you to wipe the bottle down unless you want your hands covered with sticky, slightly gelatinous water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to Almay Unscented and it looks and feels like the old formula Mitchum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to complain, go to their website and call the 800 number.</li>
    <li> It is name brand, works great, orger 4 at a time so I never run low or have to worry about getting on the shopping list.  Its cheaper, no tax, free shipping. WIN,WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used Mitchum gel for many years!  Has worked perfectly until now.  The new formula and packaging is terrible.  Gel oozes out of the package and leaks everywhere.  Please don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and pack this in your airline luggage, it will create a huge mess!  I takes forever to dry and bleaches out the fabric in your shirts.  This is nuts, to take a great product and ruin it with no response from the mfgr.  I am afraid they&#x27;ve just killed the brand and I&#x27;m now going to have to experiment with new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very SAD!</li>
    <li> I think they put the roll-on formula in the gel package.  Horrible. The oozing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; escapes the container and  messes up the inside of my gym bag.  I loved the old formula because it did not stain clothing.  This junk ruins clothes. I used Mitchum gel for many, many years.  I&#x27;m junking my remaining supply and searching for a replacement.</li>
    <li> New applicator, new forumula... both are TERRIBLE!!!  The product is more runny and liquidy, and VERY STICKY WHEN IT DRIES.  Ruins shirts.  The new applicator (with 86 tiny holes) forces the runny gel to fall all over your floor, bathroom counter, torso, etc... everyplace you DON&#x27;T WANT IT.  The old applicator with 3 central slits was perfect, so why change it??  And especially why change the product itself, so that it is now runny and STICKY WHEN IT DRIES??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Mitchum unscented Gel for decades, but it&#x27;s now time to look for another product.</li>
    <li> The new formula in this Advanced version is completely ineffective. I never ever had any perspiration problem using the old formula. Shame on you Mitchum for not heeding your long-time customers&#x27; complaints and bringing back the old formula. I hope you loose your entire customer base altogether!!!</li>
    <li> New formula is not the same and not working.  Drips...sticky - and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Why did they change it?</li>
    <li> I purchased it after trying their other anti-perspirant and I is Terrible. It sticks to my shirts and I stink. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I wish I had researched pricing a bit more before making this purchase so I didn&#x27;t now feel ripped off.  A 2 pack of this identical product is $4.97 at Walmart, so, of course, a buying 4 at Walmart would cost under $10; well under half as expensive.  The only positive is that with Prime it was delivered to our house for free but that doesn&#x27;t come close to making up for the pricing chasm.</li>
    <li> I too have been a long time user, but now that they reformulated it, I can&#x27;t stand it.  I thought my wife was buying the wrong kind until I read the reviews. Sorry, but I can&#x27;t stand how it drips out of the container then onto my hand, then drips down the my side as I&#x27;m applying it under my arms. I don&#x27;t have a staining issue like other people, but the reformulated, holes instead of slits and dripping is enough for me to say adios.  Too bad, I searched long for this deodorant and was happy until they changed the formula.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user of Mitchum products and absolutely loved their PowerGel product (in fact I just purchased the LAST 6 pack available on Amazon Prime just a few minutes ago).  But recently, Mitchum changed formulas from their old active ingredient of&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20% to a new active ingredient of Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate 25%. and changed the packaging to call it Mitchum Advanced with Oxygen odor control technology.  The consistency of the gel is different, the applicator is clearly designed to make you use more product at one time (took a couple of days to get the hang of how to put on about the same amount for as the power gel) and it leaves the armpits of your T-Shirts discolored and &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; for lack of a better description. It was so bad, that my wife thought she did something wrong when she washed the whites.  She showed it to me and wanted to know if something had changed.  I now know what changed...The Mitchum formula.  I&#x27;ve read other&#x27;s comments that it stains or bleaches shirts as well, but I always wear a T Shirt under my dress shirts, so thankfully nothing expensive has been ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the kicker.  I went to the Mitchum site and posted a consumer complaint, explaining what their new deodorant was doing to my T-shirts and asked from them to reinstate their previous formula.  I was shocked when I got a call from Revelon a few days later and they wanted more details as to what the problem was and asked me to send them no more than 7 Tshirts that were ruined along with the remainder of my current container.  Evidently, they intend to study the problem more and will reimburse me for my lost T shirts.  I&#x27;m amazed. That&#x27;s poor product research, but good customer service.  If they ever switch back to the original formula, I&#x27;ll switch back, but if they don&#x27;t then I&#x27;ll have to find a new brand that works like Mitchum Power Gel (after the 6 that I just ordered get used up).  I&#x27;d be glad to hear suggestions for comparable products being used by men who don&#x27;t like this new &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; formulation.  Men don&#x27;t switch deodorants very often...once we find one that we like, we stick with it.  But, if your one of the many here that have had tangible problems with using this product, let Revlon know via their website and if they get enough requests to put the old formula back, they might!  I&#x27;ll post an update once I get something back from Revlon.uggestions for comparable products being used by men who don&#x27;t like this new &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; formulation.

    <li> I love this deodorant. This is the only deodorant that actually works for me. I have tried every single brand of deodorant there is and none of them have worked. A few might keep the dreaded B.O monster at bay for a bit, but not for long. Mitchum keeps me non-smelly all day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews here that state this deodorant has stained the underarm area of their clothes. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that(I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now). I was wary of staining but no problems so far. I even applied the deodorant directly to the underarm of an old T-shirt. No stains. I don&#x27;t doubt the people who have had problems with this it&#x27;s just something I haven&#x27;t experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual application, it goes on a little messy. I put it on and sometimes let my pits dry out before putting my shirt on. Besides that minor *complaint* I can&#x27;t recommend this deodorant enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stink free! Yea!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Mitchum Deoderant since I was a teenager in Junior High School.  It was the only deodorant that helped me with a sweating and odor problem which had started during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that Mitchum only made a men’s deodorant for years, which I have always purchased (because it corrected my problem in the early years of my life).  As a result, I have continued to use Mitchum Deoderant now for 67 years.  The one I currently buy is Mitchum Advanced Men’s Unscented Deoderant – 24 hour protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I wanted to give my view about the change from a flat surface (where the deodorant squeezes out) to a surface with tiny little holes in it.  Personally, I was much happier with the flat surface because the deoderant came out evenly and was not at all messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The old formula which was used for years was the best!!</li>
    <li> Scent free, great antiperspirant and easily applied.  Only qualm is it&#x27;s chilly to put on in winter.  But any gel is.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon, have this in my Subscribe and Save list and it just appears on my doorstep.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have been a Mitchum fan and VERY satisfied user for may years. However, something really bad has happened at Mitchum.  The Mitchum gel I bought last month simply does not work. It dispenses well but it provides virtually no deodorant protection. I am saddened and at a loss regarding what to do about this horrendous situation. I just plain stink. After consultation with my wife the only real option is to just to throw the 2/3 full container away. I briefly considered donating it to the homeless shelter, but as a liberal, just could not do that to those poor folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the dilemma is what next. I really have been delighted with Mitchum for so many years that I cannot give up on them after just one bad experience. I will go back to the good old reliable Solid. Rest assured, I will never again waste money on Gel!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable, all of the sudden my perspiration gone through the roof, I thought it was my new medication or that I was getting older. Finally I decided to look here it turned out they changed their formulation and everyone is complaining about it. Furthermore, all my shirts turn yellow in the arm pit area.  I turned to Amazon to look for rating and decide on a new brand after years of use. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing scented deodorants and antiperspirants of one kind or another since I was a kid, and it only occurred to me a year or two ago that I pay a lot of money for cologne because it smells right, but I wasn&#x27;t paying much attention to my underarm deodorant.  I didn&#x27;t smell like my cologne, you see -- I smelled like my deodorant!  So I ditched the old stuff and tried out this Mitchum unscented stuff, and now I just smell faintly of my very subtle cologne, rather than reeking of a deodorant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No antiperspirant is going to stop your underarms from sweating completely, alright?  Even the prescription strength stuff won&#x27;t keep you from being sweaty when it&#x27;s 95 degrees outside with 85% humidity. Same thing with stimulants like caffeine and ritalin -- they will make you sweat more, particularly if you&#x27;re drinking hot coffee.  You&#x27;re just going to sweat, because that&#x27;s a natural physiological response to both heat and stimulant intake. Your body will sweat to get rid of excess heat. That being said, within reasonable boundaries, this stuff works well to keep me from getting too gross. You really should make sure you let your pits air out and dry off before you put your shirt on, but even if you don&#x27;t, this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to stain my shirts nearly as badly as other brands used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the value?  As in, the price per ounce?  You get a WAY better value on amazon than you do in the drug store or grocery. Maybe try one from the store first to see if you like it, but the value here is substantially worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this version of Mitchum for the past seven or so months.  I have NOT experienced  A N Y  of the problems in the ridiculous rants I have been reading in these comments!!!  I have not experienced any bleaching of my very colorful golf and tee shirts that I wear here in Florida everyday.  I have no problem applying to my under arms what-so-ever (and I am a senior with shaky hands).  The container is meant to stand on end especially when opened for use, on the counter or in a cabinet or a drawer deep enough to hold it upright so there is no leaks or spills. Ah-duh.  If you bring the gel up to barely, repeat barely above the numerous holes (to apply quickly and evenly) so you don&#x27;t waste it, you leave a thin, fast drying amount to get you 8 to 48 hours effectiveness easily.  To close the container just slip on the cap lightly and reverse twist the bottom knob about 4 of five turns and the cap will be &#x27;sucked&#x27; down and seated closed and the slight vacuum prevents leakage.  To open to apply,  just pull off the cap and twist about 5 turns to bring up about the exact amount of gel needed through the holes - nothing spills.  If you pay attention to what you are doing you will get the hang of it after very few tries.  Easy-peazy.  This is the BEST Mitchum, in my opinion, yet:  Effective, economical, fast drying, no residue to scrub off my shirts, non-sticky, non bleaching or staining, non-irritating to my pits (like the Mitchum roll-on of twenty years ago).  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened, but thuis stuff makes your underarms smell incredibly bad after about 6 hours. It is almost an odor of a pungent metal. Highly do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> WORST Smell I have ever encountered. Smells exactly like burning plastic. Takes FOREVER to dry. Ruined two of my $100 dress shirts because it took so long to dry it bleached out the under arms. I would rather do without. That&#x27;s how bad this stuff is. Stay away at all costs. Unreal...</li>
    <li> Michum used to be the best unscented deodorant/anti-perspirant I could find – it was awesome! But now that they have changed the formula and added &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; it drips all over the side of the container making it extremely messy to pack – I have to put in a Ziploc. And every time you go to apply it, it drips all over your body, the counter and the floor. Time to find a different product.</li>
    <li> Good Product at a Good Price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING  Mitcham unscented roll on since 1982. Have had shirts stained and some T shirts turn hard in the armpits. I realized a long time ago you have to let the stuff dry before getting dressed. In all these years using the old formula I never perspired or had odor regardless of my activity or time between bathing. With this new formula I&#x27;m perspiring and smelling myself within the same day! Also the ball on the new roll on is three times larger than the old one, I guess that&#x27;s to make you use more. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this new formula and bottle and with great sorry I&#x27;ll be looking for another product after 32 years!</li>
    <li> Like the others here posting about the change in the formula that recently happened, I&#x27;m really not happy about it.  It&#x27;s very runny.  It&#x27;s runny to a point that if I put it in a bag to go on a flight, it will leak out.  Fortunately, the TSA has trained me to use ZipLock bags, otherwise I would have had my clothing ruined.  It will drip down the sides now, hitting the floor and wall near my sink!  I have to keep a tissue under the container on the counter, otherwise it will leak on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had any of these problems before the formula and packaging change, and I&#x27;ve used this since 2001!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish they&#x27;d roll back this change.  They&#x27;ve absolutely ruined an otherwise perfectly good product.</li>
    <li> I was a BIG fan of the original Mitchum &amp;#34;Power Gel&amp;#34; and have used it for years.  This new &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; formula is terrible!  It ruined a few of my shirts by creating a hard spot on the shirt that looks like a wet spot.  Even after washing the shirt it doesn&#x27;t come out.  The smell of this new formula is also awful.  I can&#x27;t believe they would change the formula like this.  It reminds me of the &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; fiasco.</li>
    <li> Unless they figure how to improve this product so it doesn&#x27;t leak when I travel I&#x27;m moving on to another product. I used Mitchum for as long as I can remember, but now the formula is different and so are the openings in the top. When I travel it liquifies and spills out, creating quite a mess.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago. It has bleached out several of my shirts. I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> The product is the most amazing one I have ever tried when it comes to an anti-perspirant. I have used Michum for more than 20 years, and the brand never fails. In my experience, it&#x27;s only the unscented ones that works really well. Stay away form the perfumed ones. They don&#x27;t really work. This one does. Even if you sweat a lot, it will keep you smell-free for at least three days.</li>
    <li> I am a big guy and sweat a lot. This is good stuff for anyone who perspires more than normal and the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> H O R R I B L E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to even recommend the old formula to friends as it was the best unscented anti-perpirant/deodorant on the market and they have done a 180 and now are the worst. I&#x27;m trying the unscented right guard gel, it isn&#x27;t as runny but I WISH Mitchum would get their $_it together and bring back the old formula. One more customer lost - Mitchum is blowing it. I&#x27;d sell their stock if I owned any it is that bad.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years.  I am so glad I found it at Amazon.  It is so convenient to keep it on hand in all the bathrooms.  I have never had any staining, white substance or failure of the product to do the job.</li>
    <li> Thought it was just me having problems with the new formula. Have used it for years but now that I know it is the new version I will be looking for a new brand. Gave 1 star because it wouldn&#x27;t let me give less.</li>
    <li> I contacted Mitchum a couple weeks ago about new packaging, I hate the new little holes to much product comes out. I said I would rewrite about the new formula. I just tried to call their 888 number listed and it has been disconnected. (I wonder why, to many complaints) Now I am complaining about the formula itself.  I have used Mitchum for 44 years I started when pregnant with daughter while living in Fla. also about 20+ years ago I had my new man try it and he loved it too. Now we both HATE it. It is not as effective and it leaves you very very sticky after using. I just read other reviews and see that we are not the only ones who do not like the new package or formula. So in closing their &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; is maybe &amp;#34;new but AWFUL&amp;#34;  We both will be trying to find a new deoderant.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum Men&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant Gel, Unscented for at least 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I either didn&#x27;t notice or pay any attention to the  \\&quot;New\\&quot; formula packaging.  However - after exercising at the gym and taking the Mitchum ouot of my gym bag, I found that the new formula had leaked out into the cap, (the cap was FULL).  When I wiped it off and tried puting on with the new applicator top - I drenched my underarms.  I had to literally hold it up to the light and carefully measure just the right amount to use.  It was like I was trying to carefully fill a hypodermic needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This continued to happen every time I put it in my bag..  I ended up losing 80% of the product to leaking.  When I wrote to Revlon - they never answered my questions, but instead asked me to call their 800 number.  The lady who answered had a hard time understanding me when I told her I has TWO bottles.  She said they would replace them and also said \\&quot;We haven&#x27;t heard of this happening to anybody else.  I guess you just got a couple bad ones.\\&quot;  This ended up being a lie, since I&#x27;ve read about this happening all over the web, along with staining clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this new formula even deserves one star. My husband and I have been using Mitchum Gel for years, and have loved it. But, we are going to have to look for a new deodrant since all we can find is this new 48 hour formula that is so terrible on so many levels. First of all, it has ruined several shirts. See all the other reviews to get details on that horror story. Second of all, the consistency is close to water, making it incredibly messy to use. Don&#x27;t even think about traveling with it, unless you can guarantee that it will remain in an upright position the whole time. And even then, plan on it getting everywhere. It kind of squirts out and runs down the sides when you try to get more out. I didn&#x27;t even bother bringing it back home with me, because most of it ended up in the baggie I brought it in, rather than staying tin the container it came in. Wow, Mitchum. Big screw up here.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to prevent trips to the store.  It was reasonably priced and we received it on a timely basis.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Smart Solid crumbles to pieces after one use. How do you apply pieces to your pits?  Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Do not use!!  They changed the formula and it will bleach your shirts and burn holes in the armpits!&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!!  I lost a lot of money on this!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years and this is a new problem the last 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for years and had never considered using anything else until the new packaging and formula made it difficult and unpleasant to use. The new grille at the top makes it almost impossible to gauge how much product you&#x27;re dispensing - sometimes I get way too much, other times hardly any. The gel seems almost liquid now as well - it often drips down the side of the packaging, runs down my side, and if I turn it upside down a load of \\&quot;gel\\&quot; pours out. The rest of the Mitchum Advanced I bought is going in the trash. I&#x27;ll switch back if they ever go back to the way it was.</li>
    <li> I have had two jars of Mitchum Advanced 48 hr Unscented that would not advance the deodorant.  The wheel at the bottom of the jar did not work.  Needless to say, I will not longer use this product.</li>
    <li> Reformulation &#x3D; disaster. I&#x27;d been using this product for about 10 years but no more. It now leaks, drips, and is sticky beyond belief. I called the company to report this and they acted as if my case was the first they&#x27;d heard of this. After reading these reviews, it&#x27;s clear they are in denial. Time to find a new unscented men&#x27;s deo.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product. I wear white T-shirts under my dress shirts and while the underarms of the dress shirts have not bleached out, all of my T-shirts now have stiff cream-colored stains on the underarms. The fabric is so stiff they are no longer comfortable to wear and I now have to replace all of my T-shirts. I wash whites in hot water with chlorine bleach and fabric softener, and even that combination of laundry cleaning products cannot remove the crusty residue left by Mitchum Advanced Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deordorant for Men. Mitchum should be responsible for replacing all clothing ruined by this defective product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked a gel, and this is no exception. Perhaps it does slow down sweat and odor, but it never really dries. It does the opposite really of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. At least with a cheap solid you start the day dry, even if you end the day sweaty. With this stuff, you start the day feeling slimey, you end it feeling slimey. No thank you.</li>
    <li> Get rid of the oxygen or you are going to lose millions of customers! I can&#x27;t stand that new stuff running down my arms! What in the world were you thinking? Did anyone think to test this first?</li>
    <li> It goes on too wet for me.  I&#x27;ve switch over the Arm and Hammer Solid.  Really works great and lasts at least two days.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years..extremely effective, however, recent redesign of gel delivery system (dots versus slits) causes excess gel being used and accordingly, same quantity gets depleted in half the time. I think its its a scam. Changing brands.</li>
    <li> This new formulation is the worst. When the product indicates it&#x27;s formulated with oxygen, they must mean that it&#x27;s in the form of water, because it&#x27;s so thin, you can hardly keep it inside the container. Don&#x27;t even think of traveling with it because it&#x27;s liable to leak all over the inside of your luggage or shaving kit bag. If you&#x27;re not careful in application, you&#x27;ll end up with it everywhere but under your arms, unless you are absolutely certain to keep it upright when there&#x27;s any sort of product near the opening holes. As for effectiveness, it&#x27;s hard to say whether or not it&#x27;s any more effective because you don&#x27;t dare try and put a suitable amount on in an application. I can only hope that some product engineer has lost his job over this new design.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Mitchum unscented gel deodorant for years. Nothing worked as good as it did. I bought some recently (not from Amazon) and noticed the package was different. I could not find any of the old stuff. I noticed right off the bat it was runny, sticky all day, and slow drying. The old stuff kept me from smelling all day and more in hot weather while working hard. This new stuff you can detect an odor at the end of a day with no sweating or hard work. And today I discovered it has ruined five of my shirts. Where the deodorant was the material is very stiff and discolored. A dark shirt looked like I had spilled bleach on it. I will not use this product again unless they change back to the old formula. I am astounded that they would do something like this.</li>
    <li> I stated using the gel a month ago and i love it! It protects the way no other deodorant does.  Now as for the bleaching shirts that was mentioned in other reviews i have not noticed.  I let the deodorant dry completely before putting on my shirt. I will never switch because is the best for my over active sweat glands!</li>
    <li> Be careful.  The new formula is terrible.  I was super happy with the old one.  It stays sticky when applied and the new applicator leaks.</li>
    <li> New formula is terrible. Leaks everywhere especially when exposed to low pressure on airplanes. Drips down body after application. Mitchum pls bring the original formula back!! Used for 15+ yrs now have to switch.</li>
    <li> What did Mitchum do?  This used to be such a great product, but the quality has plummeted.  This used to be my favorite deodorant, in both function and consistency.  They changed the formula recently and those long loved attributes are out the window.  This used to be a thick gel (&amp;#34;Power Gel&amp;#34; I believe they called it) but now it&#x27;s a runny mess.  It now has the consistency worse than that of a roll-on.  It has also begun to stain and leave hard residue on the undershirts that I wear, which never used to happen with the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, they modified the tip of the container from having a few small horizontal openings to having about a hundred small holes peppered all over the tip.  Since the consistency is so thin and watery, what ends up happening is that the product comes up through these little holes and starts running over and down the sides of the container.  Even twisting the dial to allow just enough product to clear the holes is futile.  Deodorant is not meant to be applied all over your fingers....unless I&#x27;ve been doing something wrong the last forty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Mitchum, please revert back to the old formula.  It was great and was incredibly effective.</li>
    <li> As this product started bleaching shirts I have had to stop using it and returned all of the product back to the local store where purchased.  At first I thought the shirt was just a cheap bulk dye job, then some of my best shirts that we had been washing in cold water started to show the same signs of bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the cause is known and the company has seen other reviews it appears that they couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
    <li> ...as a retired senior citizen it has become a bit more difficult to go grocery shopping. Thanks to Amazon I can buy a lot of my staple products in a much easier way and cut back on the heavy bags I have to lug home...or, the item I forget to purchase in the first place...</li>
    <li> This is a full-proof anti-perspirant. Also, it has been just fine for my skin. I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Mitchum makes the best D.O for the B.O out there... I don&#x27;t like smelling like a scented orchard or tidal wave or anything crazy. I get the unscented so it doesn&#x27;t affect expensive cologne, what I want to smell like.</li>
    <li> Recently Mitchum changed the formula, at least the active ingredient, for their gel deodorants (and possibly others).  The new one does not work for me.  I went through three shirts today, I could smell something bad all day and I realized it was me.  That means either the deodorant doesn&#x27;t work or it, the deodorant itself, smells bad.  Either way is not good.  This is not the first time this has happened, I don&#x27;t know if it expires or if it just doesn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s very inconsistent and I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s a Sunday and I&#x27;m not at work.</li>
    <li> I have been a user for 5 years after having allergic reactions to other brands. Mitchum gel worked wonders. They have now changed the formula and I am back to itchy armpits. Also, the new formula seems to always create moisture... Even more moisture when it has sat in my travel bag for a period of time. When you pull the cap off the liquid and gel flies everywhere. Mitchum apparently did no market testing because everyone is complaining about this now and would have been easy to catch. I was a huge supporter, but I would recommend avoiding this brand now. I even called the customer line and they did confirm the formula has been changed. I was sent a $5 gift card to try the solid... No luck either.. Off to find a new deodorant that works for me.... Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always used Mitchum and now that they changed the formula and has oxygen I hate the product. This new formula has started to ruin my clothes. I was so embarrassed when I was out in public and passed a mirror and my whole arm area was green!!!! The gel also leaks and drips all over the side. I have no idea why they stopped carrying the powder fresh smartsolid clinical performance it was the best product!!! After being a 20 year user I am looking for a new product to use</li>
    <li> When is Mitchem going to wake up and go back to their old 24hr formula?  The new product is messy.  I used the product for years and really liked it but, like others, have found the new formula is all wrong.  It drips, it&#x27;s very messy, does not travel well and does not work any better than the old formula.  I buy one ever few months hoping they have read consumer feedback and changed it, not yet...  The old formula was perfect, should have left it alone!</li>
    <li> EPIC FAILURE!  Why screw with an already excellent product?  I agree with many others that the gel is now way too messy.  The packaging is poor quality and product is not easily controlled.  I too, after several years using Mitchum, will be seeking out a new deodorant.  Very disappointing and sad!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 10 years and just figured out that this is what has been bleaching my shirts and ruining them.  Fantastic for odor and sweat control but not nice on clothes.  I had thought before that it was my sweat or maybe cheap shirts that was the problem but after wearing a nice, brand new sweater once for a couple of hours in cool conditions, washing it immediately and still finding bleached stains under the arms pits I started to suspect.  A little internet research later I learned that a couple of years ago they changed their active ingredient and this is when people started noticing bleached clothes (also when I started seeing this problem).  There is also a strange greasy build up seems to happen to shirts over time which is impossible to remove.  Not all shirts are stained by Mitchum for some reason, and it does not discriminate between expensive and cheap clothing.  Buyer beware and if you value your clothing, don&#x27;t use this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Mitchum changed their delivery system.  It used to have three small slots along the center of the top.  The lid had three tabs which went into the top and plugged the slots, so you could pack it in  your toiletry kit and it wouldn&#x27;t leak all over.  NOT ANY MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this new version has an array of about a hundred holes.  The stuff squirts out uncontrollably, slops on too thickly, but the crowning glory is that there&#x27;s nothing to plug the holes.  Even with the lid on, if it even falls on its side, all the gel oozes out and fills the cap and runs onto the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cap doesn&#x27;t friction fit or snap any more so if you pick it up by the cap (which is how you do it if it&#x27;s sitting among other bottles and applicators), it slips out of the cap and smashes on the counter or floor, spraying sticky gel everywhere because it&#x27;s got so many holes in the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for decades but I may stop now if I can&#x27;t get the old applicators.  I&#x27;ll call Mitchum and post back here with what they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got them on the phone, and the representative was very polite but would only say, \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you feel that way\\&quot; and confirmed there was NO way to get the old formulation or old container (with the three slots instead of 100 holes to control the application better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try Dial Dry Idea.  That comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Terrible idea to change the formula.  Once again somebody thought it would be a better idea to change something for the sake of change.  I wish there were a way to not give this a star at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of another product that performs like the old Mitchum formula?</li>
    <li> I agree with the other comments I read.  I have been using the Men&#x27;s Mitchum (unscented) gel for about 20 years - certainly as long as I can remember.  Sadly, I will now need to change products  The new formula &amp;#34;ogygen&amp;#34; is too liquidy and drips all over.  Sometimes, it seems to ooze as freely as water.  One comment I noticed talked about it being a particular problem for travel and I wholly agree.  Whether you fly or even drive somewhere, tilting the container on its side for a prolonged period results in a leaky mess - deodorant dripping down the side of the container, deodorant on your hands mopping it up with tissue - so unpleasant and hard to believe the issues being discussed did not surface during the company&#x27;s internal testing.  I wish someone could recommend a different unscented men&#x27;s gel.</li>
    <li> The mitchum anti-antiperspirant works well and doesn&#x27;t stain. The price from Amazon was great and the convenience was unbeatable. My only complaint is that I seem to go through the container pretty quickly. I think it&#x27;s very easy to put too much on as compared to a roll-on.</li>
    <li> The formula has changed, so it&#x27;s a bit runnier than it used to be and melts from the steam of my shower in my bathroom. Functionally, it&#x27;s just as, if not more effective than it used to be. Still the best option out there, to my knowledge.</li>
    <li> Goes on very, very wet. You might as well be using a roll-on liquid.</li>
    <li> Does well on the persperation but after a long day it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect against odor as much as I would like it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  However, Mitchum has redesigned the container and now if you pick it up by the cap, the cap slips off and the product falls out of your hand.  I hope they bring back the old containers.</li>
    <li> Wow an epic failure of a old and storied brand - a business school case study of how to completely destroy a product&#x27;s reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old formulation for 30 years!  They managed to complete ruin the product with this version.  Unbelievable!  Did they do any testing or market research?  I will be switching to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst product ever.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1) New formulation looks like a gel, but becomes very watery and leaks all over the place.  Take it on a flight and all the stuff in your kit will be covered in nasty goo that is hard to wash off.  Worst case scenario it will ruin everything in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Watery formulation collects condensation on inside of lid so every morning when you lift the top you will be treated to spattered deodorant all over your clothes and sink. (The watery-ness is so bad it seems like my product is defective, but everyone has complained about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) New and improved lid system doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  Amazingly they modified the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t stay on.  There is no positive click when the cap is pushed down and it seems like air pressure keeps pushing it off.  Did they hire a packaging engineer?  If so he/she should be fired or worse.  Of course the constant accumulation of watery, leaky deodorant all over the top doesn&#x27;t help to keep the lid secure.  You have to keep cleaning the top with a kleenex or rag to get the top  to stay on.  You will be throwing away more of the product than you will be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) New application surface.  It&#x27;s a grid with a hundred tiny holes instead of the the three small slits they had been using for the past 30 years. This brilliant new innovation helps the watery formulation to leak all over the place faster to guarantee that you will put too much on - see #5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) New and improved slow drying formula means you will have to stand around with a fan pointed at your armpits for 5 minutes before you put ona shirt.  In addition to the new watery formulation and the patented &amp;#34;way-too-much&amp;#34; applicator the deodorant takes forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sad.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This clear gel is glorious!  The pits are fit for smelling.</li>
    <li> Like many of earlier reviewers, I have been using Mitchum gel deodorant for years, probably over 15 years.  The reformulation introduced late 2013 or early 2014 has not caused me any problems with discoloration or bleaching, but it has greatly disappointed me as it runs out of the container if tilted, at all, so travelling results in a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try the solid stick type, but I have not liked that technique in the past.  Or I will switch to the Arid XX as one of the other reviewers mentioned.  I am very disappointed that Revlon has not heard these complaints and acted on them</li>
    <li> THEY HAVE RUINED A GREAT PRODUCT. Drips everywhere, stains, I mean Revlon found the one person that could make deodorant  a complicated mess!</li>
    <li> If my roommate didn&#x27;t use unscented, I would consider moving-out.  My sensitivity to scent has been a live-long challenge. Thanks, Moom Mitchum</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I always thought Mitchum had a great reputation so I decided to try it.  The first time I tried to use it, it crumbled away and half lay in pieces on the floor.  I kept trying every day to keep it low in the holder, use it very slowly, etc.  No matter what I tried whatever was above the edge of the holder just fell apart at the slightest touch.  Finally threw it in the trash and bought another brand.  Yikes!  That&#x27;s the first and last time for this brand.</li>
    <li> Ever since the product was reformulated by the manufacturer this product has really gone downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is now very runny and will leak all over (especially if flying).  In addition, when it dries it becomes very sticky and uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Seemed nice at first, but after a while I began to notice strange stains on the underarms of most of my shirts. Now nearly all of my shirts have stiff white stains on the inside and outside of the underarms. This product OBVIOUSLY did not go through proper testing and I am very upset because I am going to have to replace ALL of my shirts.</li>
    <li> I have a severe allergy to most deodorants, and Mitchum has been the exception.  However, the new formula is so bad, that I&#x27;m willing to just accept hives and rashes instead of dealing with this watery goo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum Unscented Gel for over a decade. It worked great, until recently. I noticed that the underarms of my shirts are now staining and totally ruined. I have 4 polo shirts I cannot wear in public any longer because of the staining that does not wash out. I looked into everything, and deodorant was my last guess. As soon as I switched to another brand Arid XX Dry, the staining doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. I contacted Revlon (the owner of Mitchum) and they confirmed that the formulation changed to this new Oxygen Gel type thing. I saw this on the packaging and thought nothing of it since I was buying it for over ten years. I figured they were just pointing out an existing feature but making note of it on updated packaging. Beyond acknowledging that the formulation did change, they offered me nothing, no reimbursement for my ruined shirts, no refund for the deodorant. I won&#x27;t be buying this or any other Mitchum products again, and suggest you look into it yourself before you do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Response to my complaint is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/09/2014 5:09PMCST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Mr. Lucas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your recent comments from our website and for taking the time to contact us regarding Mitchum Advanced Gel with Oxygen Odor Control Technology Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address your inquiry, there was a formukation change to the Mitchum Gel in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We appreciate your observations and comments about our product.

    <li> I have used Mitchum for men for many many years, I have no doubt the ingredients have changed, gel pours out and is spilled all over. I have to clean the spills after every use and where ever I store it.  At least a third of the product is wasted.</li>
    <li> This product is constantly leaking out of the container, messing up my drawer where I keep it, and always getting all over my hands when I use it. Bought a 2-pack and both are insufferable!</li>
    <li> Great bargin, great seller thanks</li>
    <li> The new formula is terrible.  It is liquid and not gel.  It runs down my sides and drips on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting new deodorant.</li>
    <li> Every time I take the cap off, it propels liquid all over my bathroom. It leaks when I travel too and makes a mess in my drop kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ruins clothing and gets all over your person when you put your clothing on. It feels like they made it so that a person would run out of it quickly! Poorly developed product and applicator. Stay away from this version of it.</li>
    <li> Sadly, another negative review here.  I concur with all the other reports of this product&#x27;s new, watery consistency.  This makes it all but unusable.  Seems pretty clear this must be due to a re-formulation.  I have not personally noticed an unpleasant new scent in this &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; product, nor have I had any of my clothing damaged.  Even so, I&#x27;ll be looking for an alternative ASAP.</li>
    <li> this was as it promised and i would suggest this great price and product if you use this brand you will be making a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 3 years, I love that I can skip a day and still be protected. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with discoloration.</li>
    <li> Yes, ruined a dozen of my undershirts.  I called Revlon (maker of Mitchum) on 3/4/15.  If you have clothes ruined, call the 888-864-8248 and ask for the CLAIMS department.  They will reimburse you for the unused deodorant, the ruined clothes and shipping.  They need proof of what it cost to replace.  I don&#x27;t have a receipt for my undershirts, but they are Hanes, and I will simply point them to the equivalent shirt.</li>
    <li> do not like the big container</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum antiperspirant -- and Mitchum ONLY -- since the 80&#x27;s.  But I won&#x27;t be buying Mitchum again unless Revlon makes the previous gel formula available.  I could find the old stuff in stores until a few weeks ago.  But now I&#x27;m even throwing away the 4 packages of Mitchum Advanced gel that I bought and buying something else.  It isn&#x27;t a gel.  It is a liquid.  It gets all over everything.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t care if it is supposed to work better than the old stuff.  I never had a problem with the old stuff, and it didn&#x27;t make a mess!</li>
    <li> The good reviews are for the original product. It changed and is now very sloppy in the way it is delivered from the applicator. It drips and splatters when applying. The drips will bleach your clothing. It is not even a slight bleaching effect. It splattered while applying and my blue shirt had pink dots where it splattered only a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as an antiperspirant when compared the previous formula. My shirts are soaked in the armpits by mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can save money and achieve the same effect by not wearing deodorant and splashing peroxide on your clothing.</li>
    <li> Horrible, the company reformulated and now it drips when you open it to use it. Not to mention the clothing that has been ruined because of the staining.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for decades.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 years of age and cannot remember using anything but Mitchum deodorant and have loved it and recommended it. The second last 50ml bottle I purchased was so thin in constistency, it dripped from the bottle. I took it back to the supermarket and exchanged it, only to have the same thing happen again. It is not the same &#x27;recipe&#x27; as before and sadly I have to change deodorants now. To what brand, I do not know.</li>
    <li> It works great for me i used to get rashes useing regular deodorant from other brands but i have been using this for years with no problems</li>
    <li> yes as everyone else is finding out and saying, now that they changed the product last year it is terrible. Will not buy it anymore. is just all watery and always running down the sides of the container, over your hands and everything else. I travel alot and keeping it in my shaving kit it gets all over everything else also. Huge mistake when they tried to change a good thing</li>
    <li> I used Mitchum for men for years and it worked great. New formula (&amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34;) causes body order after a few hours---not the 48 hours they claim.</li>
    <li> As someone who has used Mitchum for more than a decade, I deplorably despise this version of the traditional Mitchum formula.  In fact, I just got so angry, I slammed the deodorant stick on the sick and threw what was left away.  Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula is much more runny, wet, and slimy than the older version that I&#x27;ve used for years.  It rolls on wet and feels like I have to dry my arm pits off with a towel after applying it.  Every time I twist the deodorant up to bring up more of it, it runs down the side of the deodorant stick onto my hands.  It&#x27;s like squeezing one of those nasty slugs that come out when it&#x27;s real humid outside.  Today I go so fed up with it that I just got angry at how wet this deodorant was that I turned it upside down so it could run into my sink like water.  When it wouldn&#x27;t come out fast enough, I just slammed it on my sink and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy Mitchum again until I can find their old version in stores...I haven&#x27;t looked for it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same experience with the 2014 version being runny. The best way to combat this is let the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; dry first (hair dryer helps a lot), but I agree...it&#x27;s a pretty bad product. You shouldn&#x27;t have to go through a big process to apply antiperspirant. I switched to another brand.</li>
    <li> I cannot remember when I used a deodorant other than Mitchum and have no idea what it was.  When they changed the formula, I thought the product was really awful , wet and drippy, and the dispenser is left a gooey mess after each use.  And it leaks in your luggage when you fly.  Sorry to say that, after who knows how many years, I have to switch to another product.  What were you thinking, Mitchum?</li>
    <li> Sad to say I have to agree with all the other recent reviews.  I have been a Mitchum user practically all my life (54) and have always been satisfied.  Starting about a year ago I noticed they had changed to a different head (lot more smaller holes) and the gel was thinner. It practically drips down my arms and stains my shirts (okay for white but darker colors show the stain all day).  I will be looking for a new deodorant this time from Amazon.  Kind of like my beloved Craftsman tools now being made in China, Mitchum, please wake up and give us back the old product.  Until then I have to say goodbye.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why they changed this product. The label indicates that &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; has been added, which apparently means H2O (water!).  Also the packaging changed so that more comes out, and it drips down the side.  I have never had this experience before with any other brand of gel deodorant.  With confidence I can say I will never have this experience again, because I&#x27;m not going to buy any more of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than joining so many other reviewers in their expressions of anger and frustration, I am here to express my appreciation for the quality support that Mitchum provided for my interests in avoiding sweat and body odor throughout a variety of activities over the last 5-10 years.  It was never cheap, but occasionally on sale, and always reliable.  Adiós, amigo.</li>
    <li> Mitchem antiperspirant deodorant for women has apparently changed formulation as well.  It is runny, leaks all over the place and does not work as well.  I could go for a day and a half before.  Now I notice odor at the slightest exertion!  (From the Missus)</li>
    <li> The new formula is a disaster.  As others have said here, it leaks when you open it, it leaks when you travel with it, and it leaks down your hand and wrist as you try to apply it, then it leaks from your arms down your flanks.  I have not noticed it bleaching any fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have a recommendation for another brand that is a gel, like the Mitchum before they reformulated it?</li>
    <li> I totally agree with the other reviews that this new formula is inferior to the power gel. I have used Lady Mitchum for over 30 years and I am so disappointed with this new product. The oxygen product does not work for me. Where can I get the power gel Mitchum?</li>
    <li> I think they must have changed the formula for this along with the new packaging that was released recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;ve been using this unscented gell from Mitchum for a few years, and I&#x27;ve had no complaints ever. But with this new formula, it&#x27;s very watery to a point where it&#x27;s disgusting. The first couple &amp;#34;turns&amp;#34; to bring up addition gell each morning is so watery it drips down onto my hand while it&#x27;s still pointed up. I thought it was just the first bottle that had issues, but I&#x27;m having issue with the 3rd bottle of this batch from my &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on a business trip last week and the bottle literally leaked out completely, good thing I had this in a separate plastic bag along with a couple of other items that were easily washable. I have never had this problem before with the older product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a new product once my current batch of the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; is done, but I&#x27;m seriously considering just tossing the remaining batch out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using your deodorant for over 25 years. Prior to discovering it I had a problem with deoderants lasting even a full day.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased your new improved formula.&lt;br /&gt;It sucks.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;New and  improved is supposed to mean its even better than before. Evidently y&#x27;all have that mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;You just lost a customer.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle&#x27;s cute.</li>
    <li> Agree with other recent posts - what in the world did they do??  Will not ever be using again as it leaks all over the place!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the new formula is terrible. It&#x27;s runny, it smells bad and my underarms are sweaty after s couple of hours just working at my desk. I have not had to shop around for deodorants during the past 13 years I&#x27;ve used Mitchum, but I guess all good things come to an end :(</li>
    <li> Let me add my voice to the people who hate the new formula. I have used Mitchum deodorant for many years and always been happy with the product. Like others, I encountered the following:  1. A mess over my medicine cabinet.  2. Stained tee shirts. Ironically, I even tried \\&quot;Oxyclean\\&quot; and couldn&#x27;t get the stains out.  3. Deodorant running down my arms.  4. Travel toiletry bag destroyed.    Contacting Revlon was useless. Someone in the R&amp;D department should be fired.  COME ON REVLON!!! ROLL BACK THE FORMULA AND MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS HAPPY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> This smells so, so bad.I cannot stress this enough. So bad.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:801da5dcdd7514afac72d6bc7f98955a]] Avoid the new formula!</li>
    <li> As a Mitchum customer for probably 20 years, I can confidently say that this new and improved formulation is junk. It simply does not work - as an antiperspirant, as a deodorant, or as anything at all. Fortunately I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s yet ruined my shirts. It seems that the &amp;#34;Mitchum SmartSolid Clinical Performance&amp;#34; contains the previous effective formulation of &amp;#34;aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly 20%.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give it a try. I still haven&#x27;t found a &amp;#34;Mitchum Clinical Performance&amp;#34; in gel or roll-on, maybe the genius marketeers will get around to it someday, since they&#x27;ve completely ruined the mainline product. As I think others have mentioned, Gillette and Degree have similar &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; formulations to the previous (good) Mitchum, and since Mitchum has pulled a fast one on its customers with this &amp;#34;Advanced Oxygen Odor Control&amp;#34; goo, I&#x27;m trying out the Gillette product as well.</li>
    <li> I agree with your other customers about your product. I have been using Mitchum unscented roll on liquid worked fine. This Smart Solid is like rubbing with concrete,the deodorant for women is awful, ever woman  don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers.Why did you change something good for something bad? Please return the unscented liquid roll on. Thank You I was not talking about the men product I am talking about the Mithcum Smart Solid  and all the women products.</li>
    <li> It works for my needs and has no residue. No smell that will interfere with my favorite after shave or cologne.</li>
