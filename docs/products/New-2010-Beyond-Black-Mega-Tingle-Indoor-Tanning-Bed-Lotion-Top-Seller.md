      <li>This stuff is hot!!!</li>
      <li>This has to be the single best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for tanning.</li>
      <li>The product works and smells great, the shipping was faster than I even expected to get it, the customer service was amazing, and whenever I buy a tanning lotion I am definatly buying it from A-Z wholesale tanning.</li>
      <li>First I have to say that it has a bronzer, so it gave my skin a nice brown color after used.  </li>
      <li>gave me great color the next day</li>
      <li>I love hot tanning lotion</li>
      <li>The product is great - just took a long time for it to arrive.</li>
      <li>I bought this and after reading the reviews I thought this would be the most intense tingle ever.  </li>
      <li>It will also start to wash off  too quick.</li>
      <li>THE SELLER DELIVERED QUICKLY.....</li>
      <li>Not so much fun.</li>
      <li>it makes u tan right away no waiting a week for results</li>
      <li>it shows up right away</li>
      <li>I got out with the best tan and the tingle only lasted about 15 minutes after I got out unlike Dark Fire that lasted for hours!</li>
      <li>This was the first purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So, this was my first time purchasing a tingle product.  </li>
      <li>This lotion does burn a bit the first time you put it on.</li>
      <li>Overall, it was an ok lotion, will not be purchasing again.</li>
      <li>the tingle is HOT</li>
      <li>I could tell immediately after using this product the first time that it tans me.</li>
      <li>It became abundantly clear that reviews are really important so, I have since begun to review.  </li>
      <li>and I have used almost every hot tanning lotion</li>
      <li>I have tried just about every hot lotion out there</li>
      <li>This new product has a mega tingle as well as deep, dark rich auto darkening bronzers made with silicone emulsion and a great scent.</li>
      <li>I tan very well with it</li>
      <li>I really like the way it smells, which doesn&#x27;t change after tanning either.</li>
      <li>This product works very well</li>
      <li>This really helps to see where I need to add the lotion.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>It sure helped me to get darker faster than any other lotion I have used and darker than I have ever been.</li>
      <li>Last year I used Beyond Black and abolutely loved it.   </li>
      <li>I have had several compliments on my tan and by far this is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>The products are exactly the same, brand new and fresh, just like you would buy at a tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I have a deep tan to begin with, but BB just blew my tan all the way to a deep, rich, golden brown.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several different lotions (non-tingle) and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I was having issues finding something hot enough</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for use to get very dark for a special event, use it about 2 times before event.</li>
      <li>After my first use, I would just wipe some off after tanning with wet rag, knowing I am wiping off some of the bronzer.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a good base tan and wants to enhance it.</li>
      <li>I get dark fast naturally</li>
      <li>That said, I used Beyond Black today for the first time and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably 20+ fairly high end lotions and lately ive been using 14 karat gold before this pretty religiously, and that doesnt even come close.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion thinking I was going to get very brown and dark.</li>
      <li>It was an ok lotion, really wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, and it also left me orange.</li>

<li> Beyond Black has a very stong tingle / hot factor, so be careful, as it burns like hell and is not recommended for beginners, but if you want to get darker of shall I say BLACK, then this lotion is for you!!!</li>
<li> , i have look other places for this same lotion on to find it more expensive.</li>
<li> but it took a few hours for it to go completely away.</li>
<li> With this I have gotten a deep dark tan.  </li>
<li> I have been using Australian Gold Dark Fire.</li>
<li> I could not find it this year and orderd Insanely Black, which is suppose to be similar.  </li>
<li> and when I did that with beyond black my eyes actually started watering.  </li>
<li> I recieved the product 3 days before expected delivery!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is hot!!! If you like tingles, you will love this one! gave me great color the next day</li>
    <li> First off the product is \\&quot;Insanely Black\\&quot; not Beyond Black. So the picture is not right...It is a really good lotion if you want to get a good tan for something coming soon. But I have used it 3 times and its turning my feet orange around my ankles and the tops of my hands are as well..The pain of this lotion is SO intense, I am an experienced tanner and I cannot even hardly stand to tan longer than 15 minutes because it burns SOO bad. It leaves you itching like crazy. The seller is GREAT awesome seller, the product arrived fast with no worries or problems but I just did not like the lotion.</li>
    <li> This product works very well I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but I love it! I was using designer skin Halo lotion with tingle but after a while it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try and the tingle is HOT it lasted for like two hours whereas the other one I was using stopped working. I was also a lot darker with just a couple of tans. I love this product and I would recommend it to experienced tanners that use tingle products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the reviews. It became abundantly clear that reviews are really important so, I have since begun to review.  That said, I used Beyond Black today for the first time and WOW! I have a deep tan to begin with, but BB just blew my tan all the way to a deep, rich, golden brown.  I have been using Australian Gold Dark Fire. I would begin to put it on and by the time I finished, my forearms were on fire! I&#x27;d wash it off the forearm and deal with it until it would fade. Not so much fun. Today I applied Beyond Black and when I finished my application and walk to my tanning bed, I could feel the tingle begin to creep up on me! I got in the bed with the fan going and it was wonderful! I got out with the best tan and the tingle only lasted about 15 minutes after I got out unlike Dark Fire that lasted for hours! *ouch* I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a good base tan and wants to enhance it. I am hooked and will probably use this product for as long as I get the same results!</li>
    <li> I love hot tanning lotion and I have used almost every hot tanning lotion there is.  I was having issues finding something hot enough and I have tried ultimate dangerous obsession.  This stuff is hotter than the supposed world&#x27;s strongest tingle.  I know you are not suppose to put it on your face but I do and when I did that with beyond black my eyes actually started watering.  Great Stuff and I would definately recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it.  The product is great - just took a long time for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I tan very well with it and I love the tingle factor. I feel like I get a little darker everytime I use it. I have had several compliments on my tan and by far this is my favorite so far. Everyone needs to try this but get a base tan first or it might burn you up.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS SELLER BEFORE MANY TIMES AND I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... THE SECRET IS THE TINGLE.... I GET A GREAT TAN... I BOUGHT THE ONE BY THE SAME COMPANY WITHOUT THE TINGLE FACTOR AND DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT.... THE SELLER DELIVERED QUICKLY..... GREAT SELLER.... GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it makes u tan right away no waiting a week for results it shows up right away i reconmmend this to everyone i will never buy anything else again i love it !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was the first purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  I recieved the product 3 days before expected delivery!  I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying, after working at VS for 5 years, I know that everyone has different body chemistry and will react, whether by smell, or by end result, differently than anyone else.  Here is my personal review.&lt;br /&gt;I hate being too hot in tanning beds but I, for some reason, love tingle lotions.  I bought this and after reading the reviews I thought this would be the most intense tingle ever.  I realize that since I am an experienced tanner, the tingle eventually wears off.  The first time I used this, it felt awesome, perfect tingle and it smelled great.  Even after I got out of the bed, the smell was still the same as when I went in and the tingle stopped about 2 minutes after I was done.  The color is absolutely insane!  I&#x27;ve never been darker!  Everytime I use it, I get a shade darker.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone (who loves tingle!)</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It sure helped me to get darker faster than any other lotion I have used and darker than I have ever been. [[ASIN:B003KZBI30 Millenium Tanning Insanely Black Ultra Dark Bronzer Tanning Lotion Beyond Blaque, 60x, 13.5-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> great tanning lotion at affordable prices, i have look other places for this same lotion on to find it more expensive. I will definitely buy from again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. I have tried just about every hot lotion out there and i must say that this one kicks butt</li>
    <li> I got this product when trying to order another product, but I think it worked out the best in the end. I love tingle lotions and this one tingles for sure. I like this lotion but the after smell is terrible like most tingle lotions. It works. I could tell immediately after using this product the first time that it tans me. I get dark fast naturally but this helped boost my borwn color. I usually use bombshell but I am think this may replace my use of Bombshell just becasue I like that it tingles more. I will buy another bottle of this in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. The price is great, the tingle is hot &amp; the bronzers are not orange. I have ordered this lotion time &amp; time again. For myself, my mother &amp; mother-in-law! Great Product!</li>
    <li> I was NOT pleased with this tanning lotion at all!! I have used others with a tingler and bronzer in them, and I have never looked &#x27;rusty&#x27;.  I have a tanning bed in my home, and I used it year round.  I have used plenty of lotions over the years.  Each time I used this one I ended up with looking dirty!  My boyfriend even told me it looked gross.  So, I will NEVER buy this product again, nor will I recommend it to anyone else!  Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> I would have to say that it&#x27;s just ok at best&lt;br /&gt;I think Paint it Black and Worship Me are better then this stuff</li>
    <li> Beyond Black has a very stong tingle / hot factor, so be careful, as it burns like hell and is not recommended for beginners, but if you want to get darker of shall I say BLACK, then this lotion is for you!!! Awesome tan with instant results!</li>
    <li> I am very white, but I do get tan from the tanning beds.  I bought this lotion thinking I was going to get very brown and dark. It was an ok lotion, really wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, and it also left me orange. Just a heads up for anyone also very white with tender skin! Overall, it was an ok lotion, will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This has to be the single best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for tanning. If you are an expierienced tanner you need this lotion. I&#x27;ve tried probably 20+ fairly high end lotions and lately ive been using 14 karat gold before this pretty religiously, and that doesnt even come close. The product works and smells great, the shipping was faster than I even expected to get it, the customer service was amazing, and whenever I buy a tanning lotion I am definatly buying it from A-Z wholesale tanning. They have pretty good prices and their customer service is the best ive ever seen.</li>
    <li> This bronzer works 100%! I&#x27;m darker than I have been in years. I use it mostly outdoors. It does tingle and my skin reddens for a half hour or so where applied. This really helps to see where I need to add the lotion. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Hate it! The new product is actually \\&quot;Insanely Black\\&quot; not Beyond Black. The shipping was slow, and it hurt so bad i couldnt finish my 12 minute session. I ran home, took a shower (which didnt help) and put lotion all over. It took the pain away slightly after that but it took a few hours for it to go completely away. I had what looked like a rash all over! nothing attractive about this lotion. I cant even give this lotion away! The only reason it has one star is you have to!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about trying a tingle lotion, but I decided on this one and I&#x27;m very glad I did! I have tried several different lotions (non-tingle) and this is definitely my favorite. I have a fair complexion and I burn in the sun. With this I have gotten a deep dark tan.  This lotion does burn a bit the first time you put it on. But to be honest, I love the sensation! It hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out like other lotions. I really like the way it smells, which doesn&#x27;t change after tanning either. If you are looking for a tingle lotion to try, I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This new product has a mega tingle as well as deep, dark rich auto darkening bronzers made with silicone emulsion and a great scent. The price is great as are all the tanning lotions I buy at Amazon. An item might sell for about $100. at a salon, but at Amazon you can pick it up for for about $12 - $20. The products are exactly the same, brand new and fresh, just like you would buy at a tanning salon. I have been tanning for almost 20 years. You can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Last year I used Beyond Black and abolutely loved it.   I could not find it this year and orderd Insanely Black, which is suppose to be similar.  It is close, but I still prefer Beyond Black.</li>
    <li> So, this was my first time purchasing a tingle product.  First I have to say that it has a bronzer, so it gave my skin a nice brown color after used.  However, the very first time I used this, I was not prepared for the incredible burning sensation...I literally rushed home after tanning and jumped in the shower and washed all the lotion off.  Redness, burning lasted for about an hour or so.  After my first use, I would just wipe some off after tanning with wet rag, knowing I am wiping off some of the bronzer.  Now I have no problem using it, if I skip 5 days or so, the burning will start again, but after initial use, it goes away.</li>
    <li> I love Designer Skin tanning and skin care products.I decided to give this one a try. It will tan you DARK in at least 2 visits.Its drawback is the lotion smells bad after you tan. It will also start to wash off  too quick. I would recommend it for use to get very dark for a special event, use it about 2 times before event.I also do not believe it has as good of skin care properties as Designer skin does.I also bought Designer Skin Black 20x, which I have not tried it yet, I use Bombshell all the time.So I will update on it when I have tried it and compare with Beyond Black.</li>
