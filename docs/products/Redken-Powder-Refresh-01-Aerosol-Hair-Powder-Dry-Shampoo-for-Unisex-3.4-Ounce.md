      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so I bought it here and still love it!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Smell is refreshing though I don&#x27;t love.  </li>
      <li>This product allows her to spray and go and not look greasy :)</li>
      <li>It took more from this can to get the job done than it did with batiste.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend using it more than 2 days in a row...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i love anything fro, redken.</li>
      <li>Now I can go a day or two between each wash thanks to this great product..</li>
      <li>This brand was ok</li>
      <li>yeah its pretty good.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Best Dry Shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is the very best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and does not have any odor or residue.</li>
      <li>Great to use between regular washing of your hair.</li>
      <li>This works great on my red hair.</li>
      <li>I received the product when promised, everything was securely packaged etc.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted to keep it consistent, but my hair looks cleaner and smells better for a longer period of time with the Dove.</li>
      <li>The aerosol can works great and makes application easier than most of the messy powder ones I have seen.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and this works exactly as is should.</li>
      <li>Redken wears off really quickly.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look white or gray at all.</li>
      <li>this dry shampoo has saved me on many occasions!</li>
      <li>I usually buy it in a salon but was happy to find it online.  </li>
      <li>Truthfully, Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo works better and it&#x27;s only around $6.</li>
      <li>love this this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I like batiste better when it comes to aerosol dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Brushing it through doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
      <li>fast service&lt;br /&gt;only</li>
      <li>but the price was too much for the amount given</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great way to stretch your shampoo for a 2nd day ... not sticky or stiff, no offensive odor</li>
      <li>and it works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Upon my opening of the product, and being VERY familiar with Redken, I noticed that the can had been used previously.  </li>
      <li>Best stuff to get another day out of my fine, limp hair what looks dirty when it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>Anyway, worth it, esp, at this low price, at my hair dressers place, they charge 27 bucks!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>, Just spray on hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it and my hair looks just washed and new again.  </li>
      <li>It also took me awhile to find because they gave it a new name</li>
      <li>Wish Redken would not keep discontinuing products as I don&#x27;t like the new formula of the Refresh 01 as well.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my problem.</li>
      <li>Short, nothing special, but that kind of hair that I HAVE to shower everyday and wash it and blow dry it if I want to look like a presentable human being.</li>
      <li>I would never waste my money on this product again.</li>
      <li>for me it only lasts a few hours, but those are some precious hours.</li>
      <li>this is the first time I have purchased dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s busy schedule doesn&#x27;t allow her to always be able to wash her long, thick hair when she wants too.</li>
      <li>but it did not last as long as batiste nor was it as strong (not sure if that is the right word to describe it)</li>
      <li>The actual new can was noticeably heavier than the ordered can.  </li>
      <li>And its usually a trip to the grocery store or post office, nothing special like Target.</li>
      <li>I like the product in general</li>
      <li>It smells good, works well (unless hair is really dirty) and mixes in with my blonde hair.</li>

<li> Redken seals their products so that this doesn&#x27;t happen until at least the first use.  </li>
<li> I have tried multiple other brands of dry shampoo, store and salon, and I always run into two problems: I either get white residue left in my hair or there is no residue</li>
<li> won&#x27;t leave your hair white like other dry shampoos.</li>
<li> This dry shampoo does not work.  </li>
<li> Used this dry shampoo on the roots to freshen them up</li>
<li> This is the dry shampoo that all others aspire to be.</li>
<li> dry shampoo</li>
<li> Secondly, there was definitely an amount missing from the can, as my fiance went out and purchased a can for me without my knowledge</li>
<li> hate that its pricey because overall it is a nice product.</li>
<li> Trying to go every other day on shampooing my hair so the ends don&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
<li> other reviewers said they did.</li>
<li> Might work betterfor other hair types</li>
<li> it does come out a little white like powder on brown hair, but with a few brush strokes you can blend it in..</li>
<li> Was afraid to use, the package had clear tape over an obvious tear.</li>
<li> I have black hair</li>
<li> and I can go a day and a half before it gets sticky.</li>
<li> I previously ordered this product from another seller, which never got to me.  </li>
<li> I have very dark brown hair and this Redkin powder is invisable.</li>
<li> I usto be a everyday hair washer.</li>
<li> My hair is straightened with a straightener almost everyday to remove wave..</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s priced too expensive for how well</li>
<li> I usually just use baby powder.</li>
<li> I bought this because I have been doing P90X and my short hair is horribly dirty after everyday working out.</li>
<li> foam dry shampoo I&#x27;ve bought at drug stores fails in comparison to this.</li>
<li> I have tried others and been disappointed not with this one.</li>
<li> ~ so annoying.</li>

    <li> Quick ship and smells great!</li>
    <li> Best stuff to get another day out of my fine, limp hair what looks dirty when it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Great way to stretch your shampoo for a 2nd day ... not sticky or stiff, no offensive odor and it works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This works great on my red hair. If you mist the product according to instructions, then brush through it won&#x27;t leave your hair white like other dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> so i have mousy brown hair. Short, nothing special, but that kind of hair that I HAVE to shower everyday and wash it and blow dry it if I want to look like a presentable human being. Otherwise its a baseball hat day. When it was longer, it was a &#x27;flop day&#x27; or a &#x27;pony tail day&#x27; anyway, with this stuff i can spray it and comb it through and get a few hours of decent non-greasy hair. for me it only lasts a few hours, but those are some precious hours. And its usually a trip to the grocery store or post office, nothing special like Target. (te-he) Anyway, worth it, esp, at this low price, at my hair dressers place, they charge 27 bucks!!!!!!! eak!&lt;br /&gt;PS it does come out a little white like powder on brown hair, but with a few brush strokes you can blend it in..</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I usually buy it in a salon but was happy to find it online.  Best Dry Shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> This aerosol spray works well when you cannot get to shampoo you hair.  It \\&quot;refreshes\\&quot; your look.  It is easy to use and does not have any odor or residue.</li>
    <li> I previously ordered this product from another seller, which never got to me.  They were gracious enough to refund me, and I reordered from HGC.  I received the product when promised, everything was securely packaged etc.  Upon my opening of the product, and being VERY familiar with Redken, I noticed that the can had been used previously.  I figured this out by the odor of the product already coming from the spraypiece.  Redken seals their products so that this doesn&#x27;t happen until at least the first use.  Secondly, there was definitely an amount missing from the can, as my fiance went out and purchased a can for me without my knowledge and I received it the same day I got the order from the seller.  The actual new can was noticeably heavier than the ordered can.  From my experience, I will definitely think again before ordering from a private seller ever again.</li>
    <li> I usto be a everyday hair washer. Now I can go a day or two between each wash thanks to this great product..</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo does not work.  Trying to go every other day on shampooing my hair so the ends don&#x27;t get dry.  Used this dry shampoo on the roots to freshen them up and it does nothing but leave a residue on hair.  I would never waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> Wish Redken would not keep discontinuing products as I don&#x27;t like the new formula of the Refresh 01 as well.  It also took me awhile to find because they gave it a new name ~ so annoying.</li>
    <li> Was afraid to use, the package had clear tape over an obvious tear. The cap on the container had been taped over .</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo. I have tried others and been disappointed not with this one. Great to use between regular washing of your hair.</li>
    <li> Didnt work with my hair type. I have very fine hair. Might work betterfor other hair types</li>
    <li> I had bought this product at a salon but they no longer sell it so I bought it here and still love it!, Just spray on hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it and my hair looks just washed and new again.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the very best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried! I have very dark brown hair and this Redkin powder is invisable. No white dust!</li>
    <li> I like batiste better when it comes to aerosol dry shampoo. This brand was ok but it did not last as long as batiste nor was it as strong (not sure if that is the right word to describe it) It took more from this can to get the job done than it did with batiste. And plus it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Shipped on time too. Very happy with this purchase. . .the foam dry shampoo I&#x27;ve bought at drug stores fails in comparison to this.</li>
    <li> This is good, it has a nice smell and it works but I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s priced too expensive for how well it does it&#x27;s job. Truthfully, Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo works better and it&#x27;s only around $6. I bought this because I use Redken shampoo and I wanted to keep it consistent, but my hair looks cleaner and smells better for a longer period of time with the Dove. Redken wears off really quickly. I did not get white powder in my hair like other reviewers said they did.</li>
    <li> i love anything fro, redken. will use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Removes the grease look on days I dont have time to wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have been doing P90X and my short hair is horribly dirty after everyday working out. I like the product in general this is the first time I have purchased dry shampoo. I usually just use baby powder. The aerosol can works great and makes application easier than most of the messy powder ones I have seen. I have black hair so it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look white or gray at all. My hair is straightened with a straightener almost everyday to remove wave.. so I guess my hair could be considered wavy and medium thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I hate that its pricey because overall it is a nice product. I would not recommend using it more than 2 days in a row... your hair will start to look greasy.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s busy schedule doesn&#x27;t allow her to always be able to wash her long, thick hair when she wants too. This product allows her to spray and go and not look greasy :)</li>
    <li> yeah its pretty good. it has a great smell! but the price was too much for the amount given so yeah... blahdeedeeblahdeedeedeedeedeedeeblah yeah</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple other brands of dry shampoo, store and salon, and I always run into two problems: I either get white residue left in my hair or there is no residue and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this this dry shampoo. It WORKS!! This is the dry shampoo that all others aspire to be. My hair is fine and this works exactly as is should. I spray it in and there is no residue and the oil is gone. It also smells really good without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and I can go a day and a half before it gets sticky. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my problem.</li>
    <li> fast service&lt;br /&gt;only dry shampoo I use I have tried them all</li>
    <li> this dry shampoo has saved me on many occasions! It smells good, works well (unless hair is really dirty) and mixes in with my blonde hair. Since you have to brush it out, I&#x27;m assuming it would work well on all hair colors without leaving obvious powder lines.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this because it&#x27;s ashy and powdery on my medium brown hair.  Brushing it through doesn&#x27;t help much.  Smell is refreshing though I don&#x27;t love.  But would not reorder because it&#x27;s too powdery.</li>
