<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It&#x27;s a gentle abrasive cleanser (if two such words can be put together).  I can only give it my highest recommendation.  I&#x27;m 67 years old and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Apricot Scrub since my 20&#x27;s now I&#x27;m 70 so clearly I like it alot</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product on his arms and face.  They don&#x27;t carry it in this container at my local Target anymore so I got it on here for a great price.  I think this product is a fine for exfoliating, but be careful not to scrub too hard.</li>
    <li> Works good just think I like the exfoliators that foam Up better but work very good</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face, elbows,and hands.  It is well-priced and arrived quickly.  The best part is that it works!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but I received &amp;#34;St. Ives  Timeless Skin Moisturizer&amp;#34;. Also, this product expired more than one year ago!!! Check the due date before sell. You are threatening the people health.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scrub for 30 years. I love it! However in the last 4 years or so the jars have been very hard to find,amazon is the only place I can find them. I&#x27;m so glad you carry these and I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I guess it is what it is...nothing special. What surprised me the most was it was delivered on Sunday!</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve come across! You can literally see the dead skin peeling off with this product! Needless to say, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>

    <li> This is a product that I use often. It leaves my skin feeling soft and invigorated. The size is handy and will last longer than the tubes..</li>
    <li> The best- they haven&#x27;t changed the formula since I was a little girl, &amp; it seems they still haven&#x27;t. It&#x27;s wonderful for all skin types!</li>
    <li> Very good product wash your face every morning. Leaves your face soft and smoooth.!!</li>
    <li> great stuff, ordering from you saves me going out in this disgusting cold weather  thanks&lt;br /&gt;pat snead</li>
    <li> I was inside target looking at face washes when a lady recommended this stuff to me. I was desperate to find something gentle that would work for my very painful outbreak. I&#x27;m pregnant so I needed something that would be gentle and safe. Nothing else that I tried seemed to help. This stuff has me totally clear on my face, back, and chest. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A good face scrub. Doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of all my acne but aids in clearing up my face. I have an extreme case. I have white heads, black heads...the whole nine yards. I recommend this product to light acne sufferers. It is a very harsh scrub but I do really like it. It makes me face feel fresh. And it smells good too.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Instant smoothness.</li>
    <li> Eactly what was rested and th jars are huge.</li>
    <li> I was directed to use an inexpensive &#x27;scrub&#x27; quite a while ago and I use Chanel Skin Care products.&lt;br /&gt;As it ends up, this particular brand of scrub was just recently noted as being good to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been discovered that the numerous &#x27;scrub&#x27; products available contain a &#x27;nano&#x27; sphere that takes&lt;br /&gt;the place of the more easily broken down apricot particles found in St. Ives product.&lt;br /&gt;The article, in the Los Angeles Times, noted one other product that was also good to the environment&lt;br /&gt;besides specifically mentioning St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the news with regard to the damage to fish, etc., caused by the rest of the many&lt;br /&gt;products out there but pleased that I had been doing the right thing and doing it inexpensively at that.</li>
