<li> It takes a couple of coats, to get the perfectly white color, but that&#x27;s expected with any white nail polish.</li>
<li> it is a jelly and takes several coats to become opaque, but I knew and expected and desired this going in.</li>
<li> I had to throw it away because it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and takes hours to dry</li>
<li> I wear short dark nails now</li>
<li> The nail polish was an original essie, it was a fake and it turned my nails black.</li>
<li> product does not glide on as other Essie polishes i have used.</li>
<li> Not real!</li>
<li> Marshmallow is a really common name drop around nail polish blogs, especially when it comes to combining it with glitter and making glitter sandwiches and the like.</li>
<li> Loved the color but the quality of this polish was awful.</li>
<li> the nail polish is so thin, it takes 6 coats to make your nail opaque white</li>
<li> This polish paints in uneven streaks...</li>
<li> You do have to paint a few coats on but that does not bother her.</li>
<li> Hard to find at stores.</li>
<li> Very runny and nasty!</li>
<li> it leaves an unpolished, unappealing look.</li>
<li> Went on very thin and bubbly.</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> Awe, this color Marshmallow by Essie holds a special place in my heart. I used this white nail polish for white on white french manicures for 10 years and I used to get compliments non stop. I wear short dark nails now but I never forgot where it all started for me, with Essie Marshmallow. Best white polish ever.</li>
    <li> Not real! Very runny and nasty!</li>
    <li> fast delvery and good product</li>
    <li> I always enjoy Essie nail polish.  This color is very simple yet dainty and I received it on-time with Prime time!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother who was always interested in this colour. You do have to paint a few coats on but that does not bother her. Till then this is great!</li>
    <li> Pretty but takes forever to dry and you also need lots of coats to get it opaque</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally have a white nail polish. The color is flawless. A color I would assume a bride would wear on her wedding day. It takes a couple of coats, to get the perfectly white color, but that&#x27;s expected with any white nail polish. Will probably purchase with, again.</li>
    <li> A little shear so need multiple coats but perfect color all year round.</li>
    <li> Nice sheer white color, three coats makes the bottle color. Not an opaque white, good for jelly sandwich nails design.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an Essie brand polish. Went on very thin and bubbly. Loved the color but the quality of this polish was awful. Probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent for french manicures. It&#x27;s Essie brand, which is a good brand. For a minute all I bought was Essie brand.</li>
    <li> the nail polish is so thin, it takes 6 coats to make your nail opaque white</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly.  Polish is just what I wanted.  The price of this polish on line was much cheaper than in the local stores.</li>
    <li> The nail polish was an original essie, it was a fake and it turned my nails black. Will never purchase from anyone other than essie directly</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because it is what she wanted.  It was shipped quickly and there were no problems.  I would recommend this product to women.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be authentic, Essie polishes are never this runny. I had to throw it away because it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and takes hours to dry</li>
    <li> Love love love this color, always ordering it. Especially for the summer.</li>
    <li> Good color. Hard to find at stores.</li>
    <li> this color is way too light and to get the white-ish color you have to have 3 coats. The seller is the BESTS (not the first time I order from them) but THIS particularly nail polish is not great... I&#x27;ll just stay with Opi &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. This polish paints in uneven streaks... like lighter white to darker white... it leaves an unpolished, unappealing look.</li>
    <li> PERFECT...i&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND IT&#x27;S ALWAYS THE SAME BUT MUCH CHEAPER ON AMAZON</li>
    <li> Love the color brushed over Blanche for a french manicure</li>
    <li> not sure if product is original. product does not glide on as other Essie polishes i have used.</li>
    <li> Great color as Essie always delivers on their colors!</li>
    <li> Love this polish! Super fast delivery too!:)</li>
    <li> milky smooth is how i would describe this nail polish.  It does not disappear like the other whites or stain so easily.  I love it and plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> This was a trendy color this summer and I enjoyed it. The color is the same as it looks in the bottle after 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Marshmallow is a really common name drop around nail polish blogs, especially when it comes to combining it with glitter and making glitter sandwiches and the like. That&#x27;s why I purchased it, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Application is smooth, color is... delicious and marshmallow looking..? Keep in mind it is a jelly and takes several coats to become opaque, but I knew and expected and desired this going in. And Essie, as a more fancy brand than your average drug store polish, still holds a not-too-steep price point.</li>
