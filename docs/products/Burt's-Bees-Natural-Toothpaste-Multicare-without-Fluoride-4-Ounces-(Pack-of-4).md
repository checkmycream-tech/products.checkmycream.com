      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>We are so thrilled!  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste itself is very refreshing and tastes great.</li>
      <li>This is the best natural toothpaste we could find based on taste/results - it is just like using the best non-natural toothpastes, but without any of the garbage ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>good formula, good to see no toxic additives used.</li>
      <li>It is a good toothpaste PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, my grandma loved it, so I gave it to her.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this toothpaste for over two months I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>5 stars for sure!</li>
      <li>Plus, it has a nice taste.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, trying to get the paste onto my brush was even more</li>
      <li>It was like eating a cranberry herbal salad, so it didnt feel refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this toothpaste is non-flouride.</li>
      <li>I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees protects this product by sealing the opening and sealing the box.</li>
      <li>and I love the result.</li>
      <li>So I order more for my children to try out.</li>
      <li>What more do I need to say...</li>
      <li>It also feels very nice and is very</li>
      <li>The product was shipped quickly and the price was better than what I had been paying!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, the toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a good &#x27;natural toothpaste&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I MISS THIS STUFF SO MUCH!!!</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to find this at Whole Foods or Krogers</li>
      <li>Overall It was a good product, but the taste was not for me.</li>
      <li>However I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to switch to a &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpaste, since I take really good care of my teeth and thought that I natural toothpaste might not be up to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this pack of 4 on Amazon because I love ordering on Amazon as much as possible.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d order this product through the same vendor again for sure!</li>
      <li>Better formula and not as gritty as Dr Collins Restore.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product very much, but it feels like my breath doesn&#x27;t stay fresh for long.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Burts Bees and thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Whitening with Flouride was my go to, but this works very well.</li>
      <li>It is very minty but who cares, you bought this product because of the &amp;#34;novamin&amp;#34; like ingredients that are suppose to rebuild your teeth.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It tastes like real minty toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>HAHA</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried many different natural toothpastes.</li>
      <li>(my kids open it just fine) but the tube cracked on the side seam on both tubes I have had so far.  </li>
      <li>will however be buying the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Toouthpaste Multicare WITH Fluoride because fluoride is very helpful in protecting teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very environmentally conscious.</li>
      <li>After trying every possible natural toothpaste on the market, this was my dream come true.  </li>
      <li>My teeth can be very sensitive at times, so i wanted to try a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product and see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you were to give this toothpaste to someone without telling them that it was an all natural, not tested on animals, etc toothpaste, they wouldn&#x27;t notice that it is.</li>
      <li>Love the taste and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
      <li>These unfortunately are the main ingredients of most toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding a fluoride free toothpaste that contains Novamin.</li>
      <li>It is all natural, no fluoride, which I like, and it has the proper calcium, phosphorus mix to help remineralize tooth enamel.  </li>
      <li>The soft consistency of the paste starts to ooze out and, I concur, if you leave the cap open, it will make a puddle on your sink.  </li>

<li> /&gt;First of all, the tube is incredibly difficult to open.</li>

<li> The biggest disappointment is the tube.  </li>

    <li> This product appealed to me because it has no fluoride.   However, the actual toothpaste tube is made poorly and the cap it very hard to open. If you leave the cap open with the tube on its side, the toothpaste finds its way out onto the surface you&#x27;ve placed the tube on.   Burt&#x27;s Bees should work on their tubes!</li>
    <li> good formula, good to see no toxic additives used.Better formula and not as gritty as Dr Collins Restore. Hope that burts bees continue making this paste.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this tooth paste because my dentist wanted me to use a tooth paste with Novamin (calcium sodium phosphosilicate) in it. This tooth paste does have that ingridient. This is a very good product. I just did not enjoy the herbal taste, it was not what I expected. However, my grandma loved it, so I gave it to her. Overall It was a good product, but the taste was not for me. It was like eating a cranberry herbal salad, so it didnt feel refreshing. I perfer mint, lemmon or cinnamon flavor for toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After trying every possible natural toothpaste on the market, this was my dream come true.  It tastes like real minty toothpaste.

    <li> I love the fact that this toothpaste is non-flouride. It also lasts long and it works!!!!! Ya Da. Ya Da.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter found out recently that she is allergic to sulfates and flouride.  These unfortunately are the main ingredients of most toothpastes.  This caused her to have acne like breakouts.  We decided to give this a try and it has made a world of difference!  Plus, it has a nice taste.  We are so thrilled!  I was glad to find this pack of 4 on Amazon because I love ordering on Amazon as much as possible.  Thanks Burts Bees and thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use it for a month and I love the result. So I order more for my children to try out.</li>
    <li> What more do I need to say... Feels Great, works great! and its healthy.. Doesn&#x27;t taste to bad either. .. HAHA</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and am so sad it has been discontinued. It will be hard to find a replacement. My order was shipped promptly and was intact.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  It is all natural, no fluoride, which I like, and it has the proper calcium, phosphorus mix to help remineralize tooth enamel.  I hope Burt&#x27;s Bees will continue to produce it.</li>
    <li> I MISS THIS STUFF SO MUCH!!! WHY DID THEY STOP MAKING IT???????</li>
    <li> Love the taste and a little seems to go a long way. I needed a toothpaste without flouride since I have thyroid issues.</li>
    <li> The BEST toothpaste in the world!!  And they stopped selling it!  WTF</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried many different natural toothpastes. This is the best natural toothpaste we could find based on taste/results - it is just like using the best non-natural toothpastes, but without any of the garbage ingredients in it. However, we had to switch. I agree with the other reviewer on the negatives - the cap is so hard to open that kids need adult help to do so. And, if left even once without the cap securely closed, you will find an almost-empty tube with a toothpaste mess on the counter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy! I had a hard time finding a fluoride free toothpaste that contains Novamin.

I&#x27;d order this product through the same vendor again for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste because I saw it was fluoride-free. My teeth can be very sensitive at times, so i wanted to try a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product and see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the tube is incredibly difficult to open. I ended up screwing the lid off due to laziness. haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, trying to get the paste onto my brush was even more difficult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and beautiful.  I enjoy this product very much, but it feels like my breath doesn&#x27;t stay fresh for long.  I recommend using a mouth wash after the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this is getting harder to find without flouride. Whitening with Flouride was my go to, but this works very well.</li>
    <li> My son lives in South America and has me ship this to him. I used to be able to find this at Whole Foods or Krogers but when they stopped carrying it I searched on Amazon. Thank goodness I found it where they would ship me by bulk and a great price! My son gets canker sores and Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste is the only product he can use. The product was shipped quickly and the price was better than what I had been paying! 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Exactly as described. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a couple of months. It is an excellent toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very environmentally conscious. However I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to switch to a &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpaste, since I take really good care of my teeth and thought that I natural toothpaste might not be up to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this toothpaste for over two months I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It leaves my mouth clean and refreshed. It also feels very nice and is very pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were to give this toothpaste to someone without telling them that it was an all natural, not tested on animals, etc toothpaste, they wouldn&#x27;t notice that it is. This isn&#x27;t a good &#x27;natural toothpaste&#x27;. It is a good toothpaste PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however be buying the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Toouthpaste Multicare WITH Fluoride because fluoride is very helpful in protecting teeth. If you don&#x27;t want fluoride, you should definitely consider this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It is very minty but who cares, you bought this product because of the &amp;#34;novamin&amp;#34; like ingredients that are suppose to rebuild your teeth. Can&#x27;t say it works, but it hasn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
