    <li> This eye shadow palette is great! I bought the other two at the same time and I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple days. So far, I&#x27;m impressed.

    <li> I am in love with the Sigma Bare pallet. I was looking into purchasing a couple of MAC shadows and i realized that for an additional 15 dollars i can get the whole sigma pallet.

    <li> If you don&#x27;t already have the Naked palette invest in this! I love it but don&#x27;t use as often as I should because I love my Naked Palette. The colors are neutral and amazing! When I do use it I&#x27;m reminded how great it is.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color pay off</li>
    <li> I love this sigma palette; Good quality eyeshadows; I first saw it used by beauty guru, dulcecandy; she demonstrated it&#x27;s versatility for everyday looks &amp; night time looks- it really is useful for anytime; easy to blend....worth the cost</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t like a neutral palette? you can use any day or night, dark or light and look always amazing, and this one is my favorite :) i cant stop using</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette.  The colors are great and the brushes are amazing.  I would buy it again just for the brushes alone! I use this two-sided brush to put on eyeshadow all the time now.  It really helps with the blending and isn&#x27;t too soft where it doesn&#x27;t blend anything.</li>
    <li> My wife loves makeup e she says it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with this gift&lt;br /&gt;She recommends</li>
