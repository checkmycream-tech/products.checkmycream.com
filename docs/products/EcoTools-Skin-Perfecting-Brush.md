### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found it wasn&#x27;t the best at applying anything with a liquid consistency.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect contouring brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even considered trimming it myself, but I don&#x27;t want to ruin the otherwise perfect angle.</li>
      <li>best of all a great price!</li>
      <li>this brush has very nice bristles.!!!</li>
      <li>The price of the Skin Perfecting brush was the best for a brush like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great to put on BB cream or your foundation.  </li>
      <li>This make up brush is great for just about any lady in your life.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush..</li>
      <li>The bristles feel great on my skin and it does a great job of blending the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did a great job of blending the BB cream into my skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great quality brush and what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Eco Tools.</li>
      <li>I picked this up because I thought it would work great for my tinted moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>but it also works great diffusing the bronzer along the face.</li>
      <li>This brush is also great with evenly distributing coverage with the foundations and BB cream</li>
      <li>This worked great with my BB makeup.</li>
      <li>so I gave it 3 stars because it isn&#x27;t very effective for what it is advertised.  </li>
      <li>It cleans very nicely without a ton of effort</li>
      <li>I have many EcoTool brushes and all work perfectly.</li>
      <li>I wish I could say that I absolutely loved it</li>
      <li>and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>The B.B. cream went on flawlessly and smooth with no streaks.  </li>
      <li>However, the brush feels good in your hair, the bristles are well secured (it doesn&#x27;t shed).  </li>
      <li>However, it is a nice brush that it is eco-friendly and that makes me happy, so it got 3 stars based on the quality of the brush, and what the company is achieving by using recycled materials to create it.</li>
      <li>It works fairly well for that purpose; however, it does absorb a lot of the concealer.  </li>
      <li>This brush feels very smooth on my skin and is great quality for the price.  </li>
      <li>Once the cream is spread around fairly well, I use the brush to kind of buff it the rest of the way.</li>
      <li>love all their brushes!</li>
      <li>I bought this brush and LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Love all their brushes!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Even though this brush is recommended for creams, I think it works amazingly well as a contour</li>
      <li>I rated Ecotools Skin Perfecting Brush 4 stars because it is a nice makeup brush.</li>
      <li>This bamboo handled brush with contoured synthetic fibers has a nice feel and weight to it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of now wondering why anyone would bother with a brush intended for BB creams beyond the not wanting to use your hands/fingers factor.</li>
      <li>the bristles continue to feel nice after washed.</li>
      <li>I like how it came nicely packaged and felt like you were opening up a quality product.</li>
      <li>A sponge is nice too, but still I end up wiping to save time rather than stippling</li>
      <li>Nice handle though.  </li>
      <li>I know a couple of companies are coming out with their own brushes for B.B. cream and C.C. cream.  </li>
      <li>It is a great Eco friendly tool</li>
      <li>I tapped this into my Tarte matte bronzer and the the angled edge fit perfectly right under my cheek bones for a perfect contour.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the soft feel of the bristles and how well it is made.</li>
      <li>It kind of forces you to put it on in more of a tapping fashion.</li>
      <li>I used it first with powder and it worked nicely, for blush and contour which was GREAT and then foundation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pretty happy when I saw that Ecotools had come out with a brush for B.B. cream and C.C. cream.  </li>
      <li>This is great for two reasons-one, I avoid animal products, though I&#x27;m well aware this doesn&#x27;t apply to a lot of users.</li>
      <li>It creates great coverage that you can build, feels amazing and is super easy to clean.</li>
      <li>However, I find I am not in love with this brush style/shape for applying foundation.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m still searching the best way to use this brush since I like the contoured tip and size.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many products from Eco tools</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and feels really nice as well.</li>
      <li>I LOVE EcoTools</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
      <li>You’ll just need to find the use that is most applicable for you.</li>
      <li>This brush works better and it seems quicker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found myself reaching for this brush more for contouring since it is pretty dense and has crisp edges (its the perfect size for that)</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with the application</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using ecotools brushes for a while, and I love them.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I purchased this brush.  </li>
      <li>I would for sure buy another.</li>
      <li>They work outstandingly well</li>
      <li>I end up having to finish things up using a finger anyway, so I&#x27;ve mostly given up on the brush.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t add oil (as many beauty &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; say on the internet) since most of mine are synthetic bristles.</li>
      <li>It is also slightly larger than it may need to be for this purpose -- and in the end, I still find that fingers work best!  </li>
      <li>but I tried this with a tinted moisturizer and it was okay.</li>
      <li>brush is not my favorite in the line.</li>
      <li>I was even able to use this brush to contour the sides of my nose too.</li>
      <li>it arrived, I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>but I did use it with a tinted moistureser and works pretty good</li>
      <li>You do need to keep it clean!</li>
      <li>This pretty, soft brush isn&#x27;t the best for applying BB cream.  </li>
      <li>Since using this brush I&#x27;ve rarely bothered with powder or anything on top of the cream; I love the way it looks just as-is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it still feels fine.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and is better than most higher end brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I just don&#x27;t think it is a great brush for liquids, but may work well for those wanting more of a contoured dry brush.</li>
      <li>My brush is super soft amd works great.</li>
      <li>Any product that can be used for multiple things is always a great money saver.</li>
      <li>I still prefer to use a makeup brush or my finger to apply, smooth and blend.</li>
      <li>a couple of times to smooth out foundation at the jawline,</li>
      <li>So even though the packaging says to use this with a BB cream, I&#x27;ve used it with both heavier foundations, light concealers,and even powder applications for contouring and applying powder to set your undereye concealer.  </li>
      <li>I had to try to cut it myself, but it will never be as precise as the machine cut would have</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, works like a charm.</li>
      <li>I enjoy adding it to my collection</li>
      <li>Comfortable to grip.if</li>
      <li>I did deduct a star for that, but this is still a fantastic brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This EcoTools brush is a great quality brush for a low price.</li>
      <li>And two, from my understanding synthetics don&#x27;t soak up product like natural bristles do...which is good for making product</li>
      <li>Too oily for my fine hair, but worked fairly well on more course dry hair.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth noting HOW I actually use the brush, since at first I didn&#x27;t get the greatest results.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;m buying the rest of the brushes from the ecotools skin perfecting line!</li>
      <li>This is a very soft brush for the face that comes in a nice sleeve.</li>
      <li>The head has soft bristles and a nice bamboo handle featuring recyclable aluminum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t washed mine yet, but ideally it should probably be done every few weeks or once a month.</li>
      <li>Really good quality but didn&#x27;t seem necessary to me</li>
      <li>Okay brush, doesn&#x27;t spread very well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and extremely gentle, and they hold the blush (which is what I use it for, but the brush is good for powder and shimmer, as well)</li>
      <li>I had to use more of the BB cream than normal 2)</li>
      <li>have many brushes, some from large sets where I don&#x27;t even know exactly what they are for.</li>
      <li>But it is nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t loose very many hairs, as cheaper brushes do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love all their brushes!</li>
    <li> Just like any other brush</li>
    <li> Love it so much....easy to reach every single spot in the face....</li>
    <li> No problems here. Easy to clean, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I tried using this with tinted moisturizer or CC cream and the application goes on very streaky. I LOVE EcoTools so I was disappointed in this brush.</li>
    <li> Funny how this is recommended to be used with BB/CC cream and it is the worst with those products!&lt;br /&gt;Liquid foundation, BB and CC creams do not work with this brush! This brush soaks up so much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who contours I would recommend this for that, but other than that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast. My brush is super soft amd works great. I got mine from Rodriguez Distributors &amp; Cosmetics. I had a concern and they immediately helped me and they were so nive! best of all a great price!</li>
    <li> I picked this up because I thought it would work great for my tinted moisturizers.  The bristles were dense and soft but I have sensitive skin and for some reason once i applied the product the brush did not feel as soft as I would have liked it to be.  I found myself reaching for this brush more for contouring since it is pretty dense and has crisp edges (its the perfect size for that) and then I buffed out the edges with my real techniques buffing brush.  Overall, I give it an average rating.  I wish I could say that I absolutely loved it but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I admit I am usually lazy with foundation/CC/BB makeup, just using my fingers to apply. It works but if I am not careful, I end up with small streaks and areas where I miss. A sponge is nice too, but still I end up wiping to save time rather than stippling and I still get the same streaks. This really helps!! It kind of forces you to put it on in more of a tapping fashion. And since it is a brush, excess is drawn into the bristles (unless you are using WAY too much) rather than smearing on your face. Think of it as how finger paint looks versus painting with a paintbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With CC/BB creams, at least for me, I find that those products need more manipulation on my skin to blend. So I do the first part of the application with my fingers and then finish with this to even out any mistakes and improve the texture. With liquid foundation, I sort of put dots around my face (using a little more areas that need more coverage), smear them a little so they aren&#x27;t like puddles, then use this brush to finish the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many brushes, some from large sets where I don&#x27;t even know exactly what they are for. So I end up with about 5 favorites. This is now in that elite club! I haven&#x27;t washed mine yet, but ideally it should probably be done every few weeks or once a month. I don&#x27;t overdo it with make up, so mine (after about a month) doesn&#x27;t seem gunky or anything. But it still is in contact with your skin and a wet product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my brushes with either a little liquid hand soap in my hand or with shampoo. I don&#x27;t add oil (as many beauty &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; say on the internet) since most of mine are synthetic bristles. This one is synthetic. Oil can&#x27;t soak into these type of bristles...they are just plastic. Natural bristles may occasionally need conditioner (like YOUR hair) but since many are in contact with oily materials, I don&#x27;t really see mine looking dry or brittle if I skip it. I just swirl a tiny bit of water and soap around on the palm of my hand with the brush to work it into the bristles, then rinse rinse rinse. I usually flick mine pretty hard a few times after rinsing to get most of the water out, then shape with my fingers if it is out of shape. I let mine dry hanging upside down (I just use one of those pants hangers with the clothespin type clips!) and let it dry. It keeps any water from running down into the ferrule (the metal part) or sitting in there against the handle. Hope this helps!palm of my hand with the brush to work it into the bristles, then rinse rinse rinse.

    <li> This pretty, soft brush isn&#x27;t the best for applying BB cream.  I found it wasn&#x27;t the best at applying anything with a liquid consistency.  However, it does work for spreading already applied concealer or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that isn&#x27;t what it was intended for, so I gave it 3 stars because it isn&#x27;t very effective for what it is advertised.  However, it is a nice brush that it is eco-friendly and that makes me happy, so it got 3 stars based on the quality of the brush, and what the company is achieving by using recycled materials to create it.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve had and liked other EcoTools brushes in the past I have to say I was really disappointed in this one. I tried a couple of different BB creams, a tinted moisturizer, AND even a light liquid foundation to see if I couldn&#x27;t get decent results. Streaks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and comfortable, very gentle and they soak up so much product I was having to use more than double what I usually do because it wouldn&#x27;t come out of them. The finish was streaky every single time which required me to use my fingers to smooth it out... which was the whole reason I wanted the brush... to avoid using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of now wondering why anyone would bother with a brush intended for BB creams beyond the not wanting to use your hands/fingers factor. I say skip this brush and keep using your fingers unless you like streaks.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this brush as it&#x27;s pretty--bamboo handle, metal, and super-soft bristles.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all for what it was designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it both with BB cream and a liquid foundation.  The bristles held too much foundation/cream and would deposit it unevenly around my face.  Try as I might, it was impossible to smooth out. I ended up with entirely too much product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the bristles are so densely packed, this brush is NOT suitable for applying blush, unless you like yours in a big stripe across your cheek.  Similarly, it is not fluffy enough to use with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this (dampened) a couple of times to smooth out foundation at the jawline, but it&#x27;s really not worth purchasing the brush for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I got one of the newer ones but I&#x27;m assuming it the same and just looks nicer. It&#x27;s not as soft as it looks or as the other ecotools but it still feels fine. I haven&#x27;t used it with bb/cc cream yet but I did use it with a tinted moistureser and works pretty good it did look at tad streaking on some parts of my face not too bad,nothing going over can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update after using it with bb/cc cream</li>
    <li> This is marketed as a cream/foundation brush so that&#x27;s how I used it at first. It really didn&#x27;t work with my Clinique foundation. The bristles are very soft, but liquid foundation doesn&#x27;t spread well with it. It just absorbed too much. I did try it with dry powders and it works well for bronzer and blush which requires an angled head. It won&#x27;t replace my Sigma brush, but for powders this is a decent, cheaper dupe.</li>
    <li> I got this brush to apply concealer.  It works fairly well for that purpose; however, it does absorb a lot of the concealer.  It is also slightly larger than it may need to be for this purpose -- and in the end, I still find that fingers work best!  I end up having to finish things up using a finger anyway, so I&#x27;ve mostly given up on the brush.  But it is nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t loose very many hairs, as cheaper brushes do.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil treatment for dry hair. Too oily for my fine hair, but worked fairly well on more course dry hair. Not heavy enough for our daughter&#x27;s bi-racial naturally curly hair. So would only recommend this for a course dry hair type. Smell isn&#x27;t too bad, not great, but not offensive either. A bit high priced for Dove, but like most of their other mid-range products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this for applying BB cream. It seems to really soak up the cream rather than spread it on my skin but I did find that it works very well at helping me blend my concealer. I had been using a beauty sponge but found it a little hard to blend in the corners of my eyes. This brush works better and it seems quicker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for giving my a chance to try this out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. The bristles are soft and extremely gentle, and they hold the blush (which is what I use it for, but the brush is good for powder and shimmer, as well) very well. It&#x27;s a great product that I like more than my other, more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this with my Smashbox BB cream, which is pretty thick and decently pigmented. As long as I moisturized beforehand, I could generally get it blended in by hand, but it was a little bit of a task. I did make an occasional attempt at my beauty blender and foundation brush with pretty poor results, so I was excited to see this brush. EcoTools has never let me down before, so I had high hopes for this brush, and fortunately, they were mostly met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the bristles are synthetic (as are the whole EcoTools line, as far as I know). This is great for two reasons-one, I avoid animal products, though I&#x27;m well aware this doesn&#x27;t apply to a lot of users. And two, from my understanding synthetics don&#x27;t soak up product like natural bristles do...which is good for making product last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are DENSE to the point I was skeptical prior to my first use. Turns out they are just right for a thick BB cream. I think it&#x27;s worth noting HOW I actually use the brush, since at first I didn&#x27;t get the greatest results. Using my fingers, I dab the BB cream on my face as usual, then lightly spread it around so it&#x27;s thin instead of big blobs. Once the cream is spread around fairly well, I use the brush to kind of buff it the rest of the way. This incredibly natural, but with the benefit of some coverage. Since using this brush I&#x27;ve rarely bothered with powder or anything on top of the cream; I love the way it looks just as-is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the extreme point on the brush. I get that it was designed to get the sides of the nose, but compared to the rest of the brush, I feel like the ends are flimsy and just fail to blend like the shorter bristles do. I&#x27;ve even considered trimming it myself, but I don&#x27;t want to ruin the otherwise perfect angle. I did deduct a star for that, but this is still a fantastic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting that after nearly a month, I&#x27;ve not had a single bristle shed. As usual, EcoTools hascreated a high-end product at drug store prices.</li>
    <li> For all of you treehuggers out there - this is one brush you don&#x27;t want to miss. It is made to not only be gentle on your face, but also on Mother Nature. If you decide to use it, you can rest assured that you are contributing to preserving Earth by limiting your carbon footprint. Recommended as gift for any &#x27;treehugging&#x27; friends you may have.</li>
    <li> I have other Eco brushes that I love, however, this one did not live up to my expectations.  I would not recommend the brush for use with BB cream, I noticed several things that I did not like when trying to use with the BB cream:  1) I had to use more of the BB cream than normal 2) the consistency was not impressive and did not go on evenly.  Would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Since this specifically mentions BB creams for it&#x27;s use, that&#x27;s what I tried this brush with.  I normally use the BeautyBlender with both BB creams and regular foundation and like the coverage it gives.  The EcoTools brush on the other hand left streaks so that it was very apparent I was wearing makeup.  I also needed to use a lot more of the BB cream than I usually would as the bristles absorbed it.  The bristles are supersoft though.  I think it works better with dry makeup like powder.</li>
    <li> So even though the packaging says to use this with a BB cream, I&#x27;ve used it with both heavier foundations, light concealers,and even powder applications for contouring and applying powder to set your undereye concealer.  It cleans very nicely without a ton of effort and I have hardly had any (if any) shedding.  My only negative is that it&#x27;s not the softest brush and when you&#x27;re stippling product on your skin you have to be light handed or it may be slightly uncomfortable. On the other hand, the fact that it is a densely packed brush helps you get that &amp;#34;perfected&amp;#34; finish.  I generally like it better for smaller area applications (undereye, contour, etc) where I can stipple the product (gently) on instead of a full face foundation brush (the brush is between the size of a silver dollar and quarter).  Overall, it&#x27;s a great brush that could be used for several types of makeup application.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my wife who uses it with BB cream application.  The head has soft bristles and a nice bamboo handle featuring recyclable aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does apply the product but seems to leave streaks.  Put another way – there isn’t a whole lot of benefit from using this brush versus using fingers to smooth on cream.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the bristles are somewhat absorptive so you end up using more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, there are probably other applications for this brush that make more sense than BB cream.  Overall it is a good quality brush, on par with the expensive brushes.  You’ll just need to find the use that is most applicable for you.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many products from Eco tools and I love the fact that they are conscious with the material they utilize. The brush is soft and application is a breeze. To make its usage last longer remember to,softly wash the brush once a week ( my personal preference) with soap that is nit harsh such as Dove. Let it air dry and you are good to go. I use this brush with my Bare Minerals and love it</li>
    <li> I know a couple of companies are coming out with their own brushes for B.B. cream and C.C. cream.  Some are reasonable, but some are also expensive.  I was dying to try one, but I wasn&#x27;t dying to pay $30.00 for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy when I saw that Ecotools had come out with a brush for B.B. cream and C.C. cream.  I love my Ecotools foundation brush, and had wanted to try other brushes from Ecotools.  The price of the Skin Perfecting brush was the best for a brush like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I was very excited.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft the bristles were.  It felt like a high end brush.  When I applied my Skin79 Snail Nutrition I was amazed.  The B.B. cream went on flawlessly and smooth with no streaks.  No bristles shed out of it and it was so soft on my face.  I was so pleased with the application and I am so pleased with my new B.B. cream brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anyone.  I am so glad I purchased this brush.  I would for sure buy another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan with virtually every tool in the Eco line. They work outstandingly well and they last forever. This brush was designed to work with wet makeup and it does that very poorly. If you are looking for a brush to work with wet makeup...do not purchase. That said, the brush is still good at a number of other things (given the angular head) including contouring and it is extremely soft. I enjoy adding it to my collection so it&#x27;s not a total waste, but no good for wet makeup.</li>
    <li> Based on this brush quality I would explore other brushes from this brand.  However, I find I am not in love with this brush style/shape for applying foundation.  I did use with BB and CC creams as suggested.  It doesn&#x27;t give me the easiest finish, doesn&#x27;t feel natural to use.  I prefer a flatter brush.  I did feel that this soaked up quite a bit of product and the white bristles were difficult to clean and easily stained.  However, the brush feels good in your hair, the bristles are well secured (it doesn&#x27;t shed).  The brush is very well made, and is quite soft, and (though it stains) the bristles continue to feel nice after washed.</li>
    <li> My new favorite brush for applying my BB cream and concealer around my eyes and nose.</li>
    <li> This worked great with my BB makeup.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using this brush much.  Very fluffy so it didn&#x27;t pick up make up well.  Nice handle though.  Comfortable to grip.if you don&#x27;t mind the extra work.</li>
    <li> This brush was meant for BB and CC dreams but it also works great diffusing the bronzer along the face. Is washable and affordable.</li>
    <li> Really good quality but didn&#x27;t seem necessary to me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ecotools brushes for a while, and I love them. I&#x27;ve been using my hands to apply my bb cream, and we all know that&#x27;s a big no-no. I started to break out on my chin, so I decided it was time to apply my make up like an adult. I bought this brush and LOVE it! It creates great coverage that you can build, feels amazing and is super easy to clean. I love it so much that I&#x27;m buying the rest of the brushes from the ecotools skin perfecting line!</li>
    <li> plastic hair caking after interacts with liquid foundation. horrible and painful application</li>
    <li> I really like the eco tools brand ...... this brush has very nice bristles.!!! Would recommend to anyone who likes ECOTOOLS products!</li>
    <li> was disappointing, as the rest of the brushes from this brand are good</li>
    <li> I rated Ecotools Skin Perfecting Brush 4 stars because it is a nice makeup brush. I have other Ecotools brushes which I absolutely love and find them better quality than any other brand of brushes I have ever tried including MAC. This one is different because of the stiffness and not as soft as my other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried using this brush with my compact powder makeup and it absorbed too much powder and did not spread it evenly throughout my face. I tried using it as a contour brush and although it worked better, it felt too stiff. I tried using this with foundation and it came out ok, not as nice as a stifling brush or wet round sponge application. Overall, I&#x27;m still searching the best way to use this brush since I like the contoured tip and size.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft on the skin; in fact, if I close my eyes and brush it against my skin, this brush is almost undetectable from the feel my Sigma F80 (Flat Kabuki brush), which is a high compliment. Unlike most inexpensive (and some expensive!) brushes, I have not yet seen this brush drop a single hair. Its bristles are synthetic, and therefore cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, where this brush fails is in its intended purpose--to apply CC creams. I did not find this brush to perform very well when used with this type of product. However, what I have had some success using it with is liquid concealers, which I use in a MUCH smaller amount than an all-over-the-face CC cream. I tend to mix two different concealers to get a good match for my skin, so I put a little dot of each on the back of my hand, and then blend them together. I then use the EcoTools brush to apply the concealer to areas of my face where I need extra coverage, such as dark spots or blemishes before applying my CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush is a great brush for the money and may have several other good uses, but I do not feel its strength is with application of an all-over-the-face wet product such as a BB or CC cream.</li>
    <li> This EcoTools brush is a great quality brush for a low price. I was very impressed with the soft feel of the bristles and how well it is made. You do not have to worry about loose bristles on your face when using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew from the get-go that I probably would not want to use this brush for BB/CC cream like it is recommended. I have perfected my BB Cream routine by using a Beauty Blender. For review purposes, I decided to try this brush on my BB cream first. It did a great job of blending the BB cream into my skin. However, it seemed like too much BB cream was left on the bristles. I cleaned the brush immediately afterwards using two different brands of makeup remover. The brush was stained brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however like this brush for applying my HD powder or even for blush. The bristles feel great on my skin and it does a great job of blending the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brush, just not for what it is intended for. With the wasted BB cream and difficulty to clean, I don&#x27;t like this brush for BB cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.. I find it a little small to do my foundation with, but I have used it for concealer, cream blush and cream contouring and it does a really amazing job..  The bristles are soft, but yet the brush is quite dense.. I really like this brush..</li>
    <li> This is a very soft brush for the face that comes in a nice sleeve. The hairs are contoured, I believe, for use with a specific type of facial moisturizer. I don&#x27;t use that type but I tried this with a tinted moisturizer and it was okay. I still prefer to use a makeup brush or my finger to apply, smooth and blend. Sponges and other types of brushes tend to soak up the product. I think I will use this as a finishing brush, instead.</li>
    <li> This make up brush is great for just about any lady in your life. I like how it came nicely packaged and felt like you were opening up a quality product. The brush backed it up with the construction. The wooden handle is smooth and easy to hold. The bristles are super soft and tightly packed. They have not shed for me yet and the angle gives me a lot of control as to where I want to put powder, especially around my eyes. It goes on smoothly and feels really nice as well. I&#x27;m not sure I would try it for rouge since it might give too much of a sharp edge but I suppose you could spread it out.</li>
    <li> I have many EcoTool brushes and all work perfectly. This brush is no different. Being one with sensitive skin, the bristles are super soft and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin. This brush is also great with evenly distributing coverage with the foundations and BB cream I am currently use. This fits nicely with my essential EcoTool brush collection and I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect contouring brush and I think I found it!  Even though this brush is recommended for creams, I think it works amazingly well as a contour brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and not too dense (if they are too dense they end up picking up too much product and creating stripes or take forever to blend out).  I tapped this into my Tarte matte bronzer and the the angled edge fit perfectly right under my cheek bones for a perfect contour.  I was even able to use this brush to contour the sides of my nose too.</li>
    <li> I have been using other EcoTools brushes for a few years--they are hands down some of my favorites after trying many more expensive brands over the years. Overall I get better performance from feel to application to lack of shedding over the brushes that cost $35-50. Needless to say I am a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is not my favorite in the line. I don&#x27;t use BB creams anyway, but the brush doesn&#x27;t handle liquid makeups well for an even application although it may be my lack of experience with using a brush to apply liquid, I admit. The brush is fine for dry but the angle and bristle density is not ideal for my usual powder needs. So it didn&#x27;t suit my personal needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I just don&#x27;t think it is a great brush for liquids, but may work well for those wanting more of a contoured dry brush. I will continue buying other EcoTools brushes long into the future, just not this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality brush and what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Eco Tools. They are the only brush I use. This brush is slightly stiffer than I expected. It is sloped and works well with my Benefit Sugar Bomb powder which I brush under my eyes after applying concealer and on the bridge of my nose. It doesn&#x27;t shed and is better than most higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an Eco Tools brush for some time, I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bamboo handle is comfortable to hold, the bristles are soft, no streaking, and blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this brush as intended....for wet make-up, because I don&#x27;t use wet/cream make-up!  I only use a powder bronzer, and it works very well with my powdered bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....I would definitely recommend this for your powdered products, but cannot give you any help as far as liquid/cream make-ups!</li>
    <li> This bamboo handled brush with contoured synthetic fibers has a nice feel and weight to it.  I used it first with powder and it worked nicely, for blush and contour which was GREAT and then foundation.  The brush head is small, and I found it worked best for applying foundation around my eyes than the entire face.  I like to use a bigger stipple brush to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am deducting a star because the brush I got wasn&#x27;t cut properly.  One of the top edges had a section roughly 1/2&amp;#34; across  that was 1/4&amp;#34; taller than it was supposed to be.  I took a photo but not sure I can post it.  I had to try to cut it myself, but it will never be as precise as the machine cut would have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my MAC and other professional brushes, this is just as good quality but for about 1/4 the price!</li>
    <li> Love all their brushes!  Great to put on BB cream or your foundation.  You do need to keep it clean!</li>
    <li> This brush feels very smooth on my skin and is great quality for the price.  I have used this for lotions, BB Creams, and lighter liquid foundations and it has worked for all of those types of products.  The brush tends to hold on to a lot of the product so that is the only real complaint I have because I am washing a lot of the product off and I feel that some goes to waste each time I use it.  It is a great Eco friendly tool and I really like this brush for a few different products.  Any product that can be used for multiple things is always a great money saver.</li>
    <li> not for sensitive skin. I found some bristles to be pasted together at the edge, and it felt rough for my skin that is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Okay brush, doesn&#x27;t spread very well. bristle lines are visible on my face when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a concealer brush and I love it!</li>
