I&#x27;m enjoying the Frankincense and Myrrh Essential Oil. They seems to have some great products at reasonable prices. I&#x27;m looking forward to their learning center and blog.  Its always good to keep learning about ways to maintain &amp; improve your health!</li>

    <li> Disappointing. The frankincense and myrrh smell like they should but the aroma is weak. The myrrh is ok but I have had better. The frankincense is very weak. They will work in a pinch but in the future I will look for something with better quality.</li>
    <li> This was used during our Christmas time and pagent at the church. I had always wondered, as have many, how these smelled. Now we know!&lt;br /&gt;During the children&#x27;s time they didn&#x27;t think it was any oil or perfume Mom or Dad would wear!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. I could not get a drop from Frankincense bottle, because the thick oil in glass bottle. The Myrrh  oil is thin and watery. I am disappointed with this order.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected them to smell like, but I&#x27;m still learning about EOils</li>
    <li> My first encounter with either of these oils. Not the best smelling stuff but it did the trick.</li>
    <li> Happy with this combo pack.</li>
    <li> Great used in my childrens SS class at Christmas...</li>

    <li> Wonderful! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product for use in my home. I love them.</li>
    <li> The myrrh bottle was defected and would not work i was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.. Scents were overbearing and strong</li>
    <li> Very good quality will buy from again!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was not sure what they would smell like.  I do not like the scents but I bought them with out knowing.</li>
    <li> Best price ever thanks.</li>
    <li> These oils smell strange and do not seem to be as high quality as other brands I have smelled. The myrh is so thick it will not come out of the bottle and has a plastic like smell. I would not purchase these again.</li>

    <li> I received the oils, and started to use them, however only time will tell if they work the way they are described.  I gave them only 3 stars, because it is to soon to tell if they work for the purpose I purchased them, which was for toe nail fungus.  The oils do help the on dry feet, and hands, you do not need to use much.</li>
    <li> I love adding the frankincense to my moisturize .  Still learning all the things I can do with essential oils</li>
