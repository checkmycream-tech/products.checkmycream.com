      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very casual school/home scent this would be it, but if you&#x27;re looking for something more complex I would strongly recommend Inner Grace or Amazing Grace.</li>

    <li> Very happy with this scent. I wanted a clean smell. I get compliments on it a lot.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is because I can&#x27;t smell it! Once I apply it, I never smell it again, but I suppose others do bc I&#x27;m told I smell &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
