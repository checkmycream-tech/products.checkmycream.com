      <li>AWESOME</li>
      <li>but the smell was wonderful.</li>
      <li>This is a great product!  </li>
      <li>I wish Revlon would come to their senses and start up with this product again - it works beautifully with all hair types - and is just a perfect nice, inexpensive conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to see Flex offered online</li>
      <li>GOOD PRICE</li>
      <li>It is discolored but still smells so good.</li>
      <li>I am more than happy.</li>
      <li>It ceretainly shouldn&#x27;t be sold on Amazon for sure!</li>
      <li>It was always nice to have someone smell your hair and compliment you about it.</li>
      <li>conditioner is really nice and leaves a great clean smell to the hair after drying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>BUT IS NO WHERE EVEN CLOSE TO THAT OLD AWESOME SMELL,,,SAD TO SEE IT GO AWAY AND TO GO FROM .99 TO $35.</li>
      <li>no one has a fragrance as good as original Flex.</li>
      <li>EACH,,,,,,THATS PURE PATHEDIC!!!!</li>
      <li>I donated 14 inches of my hair to Locks of Love a year ago, and will do so again in another year.  </li>
      <li>I was able to find it in the Dollar stores&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Where is some more?  </li>
      <li>it came as promised, however, the bottle had leaked through the cap in the top.  </li>
      <li>best bring it back</li>
      <li>OK, I&#x27;M AN ADDICT.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent.  </li>
      <li>but I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I thought for sure it would be here at Amazon, but</li>
      <li>and it looked fine.  </li>
      <li>It was light brown and nothing will ever be like what it use to be.</li>
      <li>Great product, leaves your hair soft and smelling fresh</li>
      <li>Always leaves my hair clean and not greasy even after 3 days.  </li>
      <li>love the product and the fast service.</li>
      <li>Flex keeps my hair in good condition, even long...without the buildup and funky smells of other conditioners...</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>Exactly what I remember it to be.  </li>
      <li>The company I purchased it from didnt package it very well and had just thrown it into an envelope and mailed it that way.  </li>
      <li>so I wish it didnt cost so much.</li>
      <li>o (  I will not be buying it any more since it is too extremely overpriced.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to get that wonderful FLEX scent again, but NO, it&#x27;s STALE PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>So thanks to Amazon I found it albeit at least 3x much pricier than I ever paid for the product when it was popular.</li>
      <li>I used this conditioner when I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Even though it was very nice, it&#x27;s too expensive to continue to buy.</li>
      <li>It was dark in color instead of the light color it normally is.</li>
      <li>The product looks old.  </li>
      <li>It has been a search like no other to find it over the years; far different from a time where chain pharmacies, boutique pharmacies, grocery stores, etc., stocked this product - but no longer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wish that Revlon would produce this again.  Love the scent.  It is not in any other product.  I was able to find it in the Dollar stores&lt;br /&gt;for a time when it was on its way out.  Now the prices are too inflated.  I wish that Flex lovers could unite and inundate the company with pleas to make it again</li>
    <li> It was light brown and nothing will ever be like what it use to be. I feel dumb thinking it would be. Lesson learned the hard way.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see Flex offered online so I ordered a bottle, this product sort of smells like the Flex I knew.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the real thing.  The bottle I received look a little different than the one in the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have been using it off and on for 30 years, when I can find it  anymore.  My last online seller doesn&#x27;t have it anymore and I thought for sure it would be here at Amazon, but no.  I will contact Revlon and see if they are even making it anymore.  I donated 14 inches of my hair to Locks of Love a year ago, and will do so again in another year.  Flex keeps my hair in good condition, even long...without the buildup and funky smells of other conditioners... no one has a fragrance as good as original Flex.</li>
    <li> Hate paying so much....but I love this conditioner.  I will make it last a year.</li>
    <li> i WAS JUST HOPING &amp; PRAYING IT WOULD BE THE SAME SMELL BUT IS NO WHERE EVEN CLOSE TO THAT OLD AWESOME SMELL,,,SAD TO SEE IT GO AWAY AND TO GO FROM .99 TO $35. EACH,,,,,,THATS PURE PATHEDIC!!!!</li>
    <li> The product looks old.  I purchased from another person also and it looked fine.  It was dark in color instead of the light color it normally is.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner when I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s. It was always nice to have someone smell your hair and compliment you about it. This version doesn&#x27;t appear to have the same intensity of fragrance that it had then, a watered down version of it. Even though it was very nice, it&#x27;s too expensive to continue to buy. If anyone can recommend a cheaper solution to Wella Balsam I&#x27;d like to hear it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to get that wonderful FLEX scent again, but NO, it&#x27;s STALE PRODUCT! It&#x27;s been sitting around for 30 years and has gone rotten!  I spent $33 just for that wonder from the past, but wishful thinking.  HOW IN THE WORLD ANYONE COULD SELL THIS CRAP IS BEYOND ME.  It ceretainly shouldn&#x27;t be sold on Amazon for sure!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the price but the smell was wonderful. Just as I remembered</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I use it sparingly due to the ridiculous price. I mix it with water and spray it on my hair as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> HARD TO FIND! GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> Only disappointment is that it isn&#x27;t dense or thick enough but that&#x27;s Revlon&#x27;s problem.  It has been a search like no other to find it over the years; far different from a time where chain pharmacies, boutique pharmacies, grocery stores, etc., stocked this product - but no longer.  Why??? Who knows!  So thanks to Amazon I found it albeit at least 3x much pricier than I ever paid for the product when it was popular.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Flex in the local Target for around $5.00 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is really nice and leaves a great clean smell to the hair after drying.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product anymore however because it is terribly,terribly expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they have taken / stopped Flex products - it has been a staple in my entire life - to have it in my household over the past 30 years - it was reasonably priced and the smell is like no others.  I wish Revlon would come to their senses and start up with this product again - it works beautifully with all hair types - and is just a perfect nice, inexpensive conditioner.  I bought it on Amazon and paid a small fortune for it as I just had to have it one last time in my life : o (  I will not be buying it any more since it is too extremely overpriced.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I remember it to be.  AWESOME</li>
    <li> come on this is flex hair conditioner which i can not find in stores...love the product and the fast service. if you have thinning hair, it helps but takes the tangles out of all hair...and that is why you buy it, right?</li>
    <li> The product has been off the shelf for a number of years. Finding any was difficult. This was as expected, came as advertised. I am more than happy. Seller was as prompt in shipping.  Will continue to look for this product. My hair won&#x27;t be as manageable with out it.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;M AN ADDICT.  I WILL PAY THE HORRIFIC STREET PRICE AND HIDE OUT AND USE IT ONLY IN THE BATHROOM.  NO ONE ELSE NEEDS TO KNOW MY DIRTY LITTLE SECRET!&lt;br /&gt;THE OLD MAN IN BAKERSFIELD, CA</li>
    <li> Goes hand in hand with the shampoo. Great product, leaves your hair soft and smelling fresh</li>
    <li> Where is some more?  Always leaves my hair clean and not greasy even after 3 days.  Why did it disappear from the shelves?</li>
    <li> HI never in my life i used an internet site to buy anything,but one day i was only checking for flex conditioner balsam &amp; protein I was the happyest human being in this world, and i decide to buy 3 of them,but all my happynes turn into sadnes when i opened my pakage and find 3 bottles of conditioner that look already color brown instesd of yellow,and no smell at all.And that was the sadest day in my life.And if I&#x27;m sorry if I did some wrong spelling on my message.</li>
    <li> just thee very best ever conditioner been using this since like forever especially growing up in Central America it&#x27;s a Belizean thing smells bloody good gives body it&#x27;s just thee best bring it back Latin people die for this 👍👍👍👍😟</li>
    <li> it came as promised, however, the bottle had leaked through the cap in the top.  The company I purchased it from didnt package it very well and had just thrown it into an envelope and mailed it that way.  It is discolored but still smells so good. I remember paying $1.99 for it back in the day so I wish it didnt cost so much.</li>
