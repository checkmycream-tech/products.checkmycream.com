### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>With that said, I think the product is great.</li>
      <li>I was realy happy to find it again.</li>
      <li>It is a man&#x27;s cologne  no perfumery smell  and a great skin bracer.</li>
      <li>but I found it not to be a good aftershave.</li>
      <li>BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR BOTH OF MY SONS-IN-LAW BECAUSE MY HUSBAND USED TO WEAR IT AND LOVED</li>
      <li>Very refreshing after a shower or anytime.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
      <li>Love the way my husband smells on date night!</li>
      <li>BOTH MEN LOVE IT TOO!</li>
      <li>This does have a nice scent to it</li>
      <li>Most good after shaves will sooth irradiated skin.</li>
      <li>Refreshingly Light!  </li>
      <li>I used this product many years ago then lost my source.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it most of my life.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s mostly powdery to me.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of my Grandpa; strong, confident, and humble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A light and refreshing lime fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good cologne, it&#x27;s light and fruity.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Suttle yet strong scent.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great smell</li>
      <li>Quick and easy, came to my door.</li>
      <li>After a shave, as cologne it is a clean and renewing scent.  </li>
      <li>I was always captivated by the cool looking bottle with the lead crown cap.</li>
      <li>Glad it is so reasonable on this site.</li>
      <li>Just as described and sent quick as a flash.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice but does smell different than the bottle one we were replacing.</li>
      <li>That quickly fades though and a refreshing lime scent lingers for a short period.</li>
      <li>found first in 1966 in Bermuda where it is made and depend on keeping husband supplied forever after all these years.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand it is a nice Cologne.</li>
      <li>I expected it to be more of a citrus sort of fresh.  </li>
      <li>Lime does not last long so this is good if you plan to use cologne afterwards.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product only to find that the fragrance lasts for about a minute after you put it on.  </li>
      <li>It has a smooth feel and the scent lasts quite a long time, without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>Some of the older men&#x27;s colognes are</li>
      <li>My wife has a very sensitive  noise and this fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother her a bit i had to give up wearing aftershave for years until i found this</li>
      <li>This&lt;br /&gt;cologne came in on time and as far as I know my husband loves it!</li>
      <li>Waz really wanting to like this after reading other reviews.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews where the product has been panned because it&#x27;s no longer \\&quot;made in Bermuda\\&quot;.</li>
<li> And this is a fragrance I never grow tired of using.</li>
<li> sprayer is horrible and barely works, it fell off the one I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was excited to get this product only to find that the fragrance lasts for about a minute after you put it on.  After one minute, the fragrance is gone. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Lyme for a few weeks now. When I was growing up, my father used Royall Spice. I was always captivated by the cool looking bottle with the lead crown cap. I&#x27;ve read a few reviews where the product has been panned because it&#x27;s no longer \\&quot;made in Bermuda\\&quot;. With that said, I think the product is great. It has a smooth feel and the scent lasts quite a long time, without being overpowering. All in all, I will buy for years to come.</li>
    <li> I used this product many years ago then lost my source. I was realy happy to find it again. It&#x27;s a geart summer aftershave.</li>
    <li> Waz really wanting to like this after reading other reviews.  I expected it to be more of a citrus sort of fresh.  Like lime peel.  However, it&#x27;s mostly powdery to me.  I do notice the intention of lime but do not intend to wear this regularly. I have relegated it to antiseptic aftershave duty.</li>
    <li> Refreshingly Light!  After a shave, as cologne it is a clean and renewing scent.  You feel like your wearing something but not.  It does not linger on the face or body but provides just enough fragrance.  It is as I remember it...</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good cologne, it&#x27;s light and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer is horrible and barely works, it fell off the one I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over twety years and I absolutely love it. Very refreshing after a shower or anytime.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but does smell different than the bottle one we were replacing. not sure but maybe the company changed formula changed recently?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. Some of the older men&#x27;s colognes are no&lt;br /&gt;longer sold in the stores...the larger department stores, drug stores. This&lt;br /&gt;cologne came in on time and as far as I know my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Just as described and sent quick as a flash.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that! And this is a fragrance I never grow tired of using.</li>
    <li> It is a man&#x27;s cologne  no perfumery smell  and a great skin bracer. My wife has a very sensitive  noise and this fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother her a bit i had to give up wearing aftershave for years until i found this</li>
    <li> Overall a great smell but it does have a bit of a medicinal smell. That quickly fades though and a refreshing lime scent lingers for a short period. Lime does not last long so this is good if you plan to use cologne afterwards. It does dry the skin out a little as I don&#x27;t think it has any glycerin to help re-moisturize. I rate it 4 stars for the drying out of skin and cost. At this price point I&#x27;d expected for qualities from an aftershave like glycerine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it most of my life. Used to have people who traveled to Bermuda buy it for me. You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be cheaper as it&#x27;s made in Bermuda. Much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
    <li> A light and refreshing lime fragrance.  I use as a body cologne rather than as an after shave.  Like that product came as a splash.  A sprayer was enclosed should I decide to use product as a spray.</li>
    <li> found first in 1966 in Bermuda where it is made and depend on keeping husband supplied forever after all these years.  Glad it is so reasonable on this site.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR BOTH OF MY SONS-IN-LAW BECAUSE MY HUSBAND USED TO WEAR IT AND LOVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;NOW BOTH MEN LOVE IT TOO!</li>
    <li> This does have a nice scent to it but I found it not to be a good aftershave. Instead of soothing my skin it just seem to make it burn. Most good after shaves will sooth irradiated skin. I cannot recommend this as an aftershave. On the other hand it is a nice Cologne.</li>
    <li> Now mass produced in the USA instead of in smaller batches in Bermuda. I get compliments when I wear it. That hasn&#x27;t changed. No hassle buying on line. Quick and easy, came to my door.</li>
    <li> Suttle yet strong scent.  Reminds me of my Grandpa; strong, confident, and humble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent to go along with any outing.</li>
    <li> Love the way my husband smells on date night!</li>
