<li> The sandal wood smell is faint and tends to fade after some use, but the comb seems sturdy and well made, and the tines are smooth and rounded so they don&#x27;t snag my hair or scrape my scalp.</li>
<li> and i happen to have really long hair</li>
<li> my hair is over 25 inch long</li>
<li> I wish you had a long handled version.</li>
<li> I thought maybe the teeth would be wider since it says wide tooth comb in the product header.</li>
<li> but when I use it on my wet hair my hair does not get as tangled as when I use a plastic one.  </li>
<li> only thing its too small</li>
<li> I do notice less hair in the comb from using this.</li>
<li> It is a little steep price for a comb</li>
<li> it is very small a little less than 4 inch in length and about 2 inches width</li>
<li> and i have no problem using this small comb.</li>
<li> i find it helpful that the comb is really small because it enables me to carry around the comb in my purse</li>
<li> Small hair comb!</li>
<li> I was disappointed that it is purse size and not a full size comb.</li>
<li> It does work, but it&#x27;s difficult to grip.</li>

    <li> Small hair comb! I keep it in my purse. I wish they had larger ones made from this same wood. I have one from the Body Shoppe and I use it more then this one because of its larger in size, but I this comb is definitely a better quality wood and smoother on your hair . It did take a while to arrive like 3 weeks, however I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i have had this product for over a year now and i love it it is very small a little less than 4 inch in length and about 2 inches width and i happen to have really long hair my hair is over 25 inch long it comes below my waist and i have no problem using this small comb. i find it helpful that the comb is really small because it enables me to carry around the comb in my purse and i love the way my scalp feels when ever i am using the comb in my scalp its almost like a massage i really hope my comb never breaks so far i don&#x27;t see any major sign of wear and tear just little chipped wood, hopefully it stays like that on a side note i really want to know what the marking on the front of the comb means so if any one knows could you please let me know i would be very grateful</li>
    <li> Just beware its smaller than a standard comb, it can easily fit into your purse. I didnt mind that at all. Its a simple, beautiful little wood comb thats wont tear or break your hair and scalp. I love it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I know the measurement is on here, but for some reason this thing is even smaller than I thought it would be. It does work, but it&#x27;s difficult to grip. I&#x27;d go for a larger size if I could do it again!</li>
    <li> I like this comb, it&#x27;s small and cute. I thought maybe the teeth would be wider since it says wide tooth comb in the product header. I still plan to get another comb with wider teeth but this comb is okay. I do notice less hair in the comb from using this.</li>

    <li> I bought this to replace another comb that I had lost.  It is a little steep price for a comb but when I use it on my wet hair my hair does not get as tangled as when I use a plastic one.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The quality is good. Great gifts for friends. they have nice smell. I&#x27;ll buy more when I am out of these.</li>
    <li> Great for detangling hair. Smooth finish, no snagging or pulling. Great for long hair and durable. recommend for anyone growing out hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality but teeth too far apart.</li>

    <li> i love this comb, when i use it my hair doesnt get like frizzy or static, its the first time i use a wood comb and i like it. only thing its too small, i want a big one. but anyways this do the job!</li>
    <li> Pretty comb.  Well made.  Shorter than I realized.  I was disappointed that it is purse size and not a full size comb.</li>
    <li> This comb has a nice faint smell upon opening. After using it, the smell fades. It is nice to use, but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference from regular combs. I don&#x27;t get tangles as much buy that could be other changes to my hair regimen.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like plastic touching my food so why would I touch my hair with it? this wood comb is so nice &amp; gentle &amp; has a slight sandalwood aroma. I wish you had a long handled version. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. A nice, well made comb that smells lightly of sandlewood that fits into my purse. Great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for detangling my hair when it&#x27;s wet, and for carrying around in my purse. The sandal wood smell is faint and tends to fade after some use, but the comb seems sturdy and well made, and the tines are smooth and rounded so they don&#x27;t snag my hair or scrape my scalp.</li>
