      <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>So glad to find something that works!</li>

      <li>This is an ok product.</li>
      <li>and I have fuller eyebrows and lashes love it.</li>
      <li>I burnt most the eyelashes off of my right eye, and I bought this product in desperation &amp; after reading mostly good reviews about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this, especially for my brows - so happy!</li>
      <li>Lol, I also like it as a clear mascara or eyebrow gel.</li>
      <li>I received the product on time and my wife loved to use because it works like the big brands and the costs is very cheap.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>I am really impressed with this product, and i&#x27;m glad I took the chance and bought it because it truly does work (at least it did for me anyway).</li>
      <li>takes about 3 months for full affect.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>my eyebrows used to be way over plucked and now they&#x27;re think and full just how I wanted them.</li>
      <li>This is the best product for me, I apply every night on a clean face wherever I want the hair to grow and on my lower lashes only a week later</li>
      <li>and I can honestly see a major difference from before I started using this product!</li>
      <li>This is one of my main beauty products, my lashes are way thicker and longer, you just have to make sure you stick to it.</li>
      <li>thought it wouldn&#x27;t work at first because it was a cheap product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m attempting to grow out my brows a bit for the trendy new &amp;#34;feathered brow&amp;#34; look, and this stuff is really helping the process.</li>
      <li>I would say well worth it(:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and in a couple weeks my eyebrows were back to normal :)</li>
      <li>I pretty much swear by this product and will continue to buy it forever!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely excited to see how much more it can do in the long run.</li>
      <li>If apply to much on lashes it will burn!</li>
      <li>I bought 3 of these gel treatments, and have not yet even finished my first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying three more because last time</li>
      <li>First off: i was very pleased with the fast shipping which arrived way before the expected date!</li>
      <li>And of course, it stopped growing to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I applied it every night generously before going to bed and it really does work.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows were plucked a bit too much</li>
      <li>This product arrived sooner than I expected, and it was so cheap!</li>
      <li>This really helped me.</li>
      <li>It absolutely did not do anything for conditioning or lengthening my lashes.</li>
      <li>Canmake is much &#x27;wetter&#x27; and makes me feel like i applied something to my lashes instead of Ardell&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Came in fast.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really go with the rules I just applied  it once morning and night time</li>
      <li>After one week my lashes seemed much healthier .not</li>
      <li>It did so something but not as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>Got this mostly for my eyebrows, they were uneven and not shaped right.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cost friendly and the tiny bottle goes a lonnnnng way!</li>
      <li>other than that, when she sends me a picture of her brows, I will be able to tell.</li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because not only did it arrive in a timely fashion but it also completely filled in my left brow which has ALWAYS been much thinner and sparse in comparison to my right brow.</li>
      <li>This product helped  my eyebrows grow back to full</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed better, slightly faster, thicker grow out.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>love this stuff works both on lashes and brows in trouble</li>
      <li>After a week, I am noticing a lot of new growth, as well.</li>
      <li>First thing I found that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and actually worked!</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin and it caused me zero problems!</li>
      <li>I am surprised it works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t feel like paste.</li>
      <li>much longer yet but only using it for a short time.my mascara looks so much prettier when applied  not so sparsely like before,worth to try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Cargo Lash activator a few years back and had far better results.  </li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>Also can be used to tame fine baby hairs around the hairline for up-do and top-knot hair styles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for about 9 days now and not only are the eyelashes on my right eye longer than the lashes on my left eye, but they are fuller as well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about a year, my eyebrows are thick and very full.</li>
      <li>and it took longer than normal to grow back.  </li>
      <li>So if you just want to have your natural lashes back after ruining them and thinning them out from mascara use, this product will restore your natural lashes.</li>
      <li>I love this serum it works wonders been using it everyday and my eyelashes are so long I definitely recommend this</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for this product solely off of the reviews that I read prior to purchasing it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Saw a little growth while using this.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my eye brows they are thin at the front and I want them to be a bit thicker I have been using it for three weeks now and the front of my eye brows are still thin, so I do not now how long it takes to notice a difference but I have not seen one.</li>
    <li> I used this product only for my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does do what it claims. I apply every night before I sleep. My eyelashes were noticeably fuller and longer in about 2-3 weeks. I had more eyelashes too. However, if you want significantly longer lashes or dramatically fuller lashes, you will be disappointed. This is not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes and brows are definitely healthier. After a week, I am noticing a lot of new growth, as well.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Came in fast. After getting eyelash extension a lot of my eye lashes fell off. This really helped me. I don&#x27;t use it all the time but the little that I do, I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product. It did so something but not as much as I would like. For the price it is a good buy. I can see some differences in my lashes and especially my eyebrows</li>
    <li> If you have short lashes to begin with (Like myself) this product will not extend the length of your lashes. For those who already have long lashes, they probably think it&#x27;s making it grow longer, however, this serum is just a conditioner and only restores fallen hair or tattered hair. It will not make lashes longer! So if you just want to have your natural lashes back after ruining them and thinning them out from mascara use, this product will restore your natural lashes.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried at first considering the low price. But after two weeks of using this product on both eye lashes and eye brows, I have seen a growth. It&#x27;s not a flabbergasting amount but is pretty good considering the price paid! I would say well worth it(:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Latisse so my lashes are growing from that so I can&#x27;t say that this is affecting growth.  However, I used Latisse a couple of years ago, then ran out and just started again with it in the fall at the same time I bought this. I&#x27;m buying three more because last time with Latisse, I had to curl my lashes all the time in order to actually see the growth.  This stuff makes them turn up instead of grow down and out.  It doesn&#x27;t look like they were curled in a curler -- they aren&#x27;t that curly -- but they turn up naturally, and I don&#x27;t have to mess with the stupid curler which I never got the hang of. Actually, the lashes do seem to be a bit longer than I remember from the last time I used Latisse.  By the way when I say Latisse, I mean generic bimatoprost at 1/4 the cost of Latisse.  :)</li>
    <li> I pretty much swear by this product and will continue to buy it forever!! I have my terrible eyebrow moments where I over pluck really really badly and my eyebrows are so thin it&#x27;s embarrassing. I remember hearing about this product through a friend, I was very hesitant at first but decided to give it a try because I was so desperate. &amp; THIS ACTUALLY WORKS WONDERS!! Now at first I was getting frustrated because I expected growth really quickly. However with any hair growth supplement or treatment you have to be patient! By using this product twice a day I noticed a huge difference within a little less than a month! My eyebrows were already taking shape and rapidly growing. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about a year, my eyebrows are thick and very full. Not only does this product ACTUALLY work but it&#x27;s cost friendly and the tiny bottle goes a lonnnnng way! DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my main beauty products, my lashes are way thicker and longer, you just have to make sure you stick to it. I actually wear it during the day &amp; not the night like it says to.</li>
    <li> This product actually works! I&#x27;m attempting to grow out my brows a bit for the trendy new &amp;#34;feathered brow&amp;#34; look, and this stuff is really helping the process. I&#x27;ve noticed better, slightly faster, thicker grow out. And the product works fabulously as just a &amp;#34;brow tamer&amp;#34;... you can apply it multiple times during the day to tame unruly hairs and it doesn&#x27;t flake or turn white. Also can be used to tame fine baby hairs around the hairline for up-do and top-knot hair styles.</li>
    <li> love this stuff works both on lashes and brows in trouble spots cant grow hair</li>
    <li> The liquid is more like Elmer&#x27;s Glue all! It doesn&#x27;t come out of the container in liquid form which would make it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Feel like it did something but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it did!</li>
    <li> I just started using this 2 weeks so in August I&#x27;ll post up and update I brought 10 so I should see some good results by August.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time and my wife loved to use because it works like the big brands and the costs is very cheap.</li>
    <li> I am surprised it works! Well only for lashes, eyebrow has no difference. But I could see the difference in lashes on the next day! I have longer lashes now but not thicker. But still, it&#x27;s so cheap! I didn&#x27;t get it off amazon though. And of course, it stopped growing to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I do not apply it nightly only as indicated by the instructions. I applied it about 2-4 times a day especially when I see the mirror lol&lt;br /&gt;I applied it when I wake, before gaming, after dinner, before sleep. HAHAHA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who says that this does not work, you guys can try CANMAKE LASH ESSENCE.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002G0WOVU Laboratories CANMAKE Eyelashes Care Essence]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used that before and it works for me too, but Ardell is 1/3 the price! Canmake is much &#x27;wetter&#x27; and makes me feel like i applied something to my lashes instead of Ardell&#x27;s. When I apply Ardell, I sometimes aint sure whether it is even on my lashes.</li>
    <li> I saw results in my brows in about 3 weeks of  everyday use. It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t feel like paste. I also have sensitive skin and it caused me zero problems!</li>
    <li> I feel this works through a placebo method, but whatever it is, I like it. I had accidentally plucked my eyebrows incorrectly and was missing a spot, using this helped resolve the problem until I get to go to a professional. Lol, I also like it as a clear mascara or eyebrow gel.</li>
    <li> I saw very little difference in my brows, but my eyelashes did get &#x27;brittle&#x27; if thats the right word.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work on me.  It does  work for keeping my eyebrows from wiping off.  I finally broke down and had my brows tattooed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about two months ago. My eyebrows were plucked a bit too much and I decided I needed to regrow it. It&#x27;s very cheap and in a couple weeks my eyebrows were back to normal :) I thought that if it worked that well on my eyebrows it would do well on my eyelashes so I gave it a try. It worked great and I have naturally short lashes so after about 3 weeks my lashes were much longer and I am impressed :)</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I had a protein issue for a while and my eye brows became very thin and basicly not there at all. Since i have used this stuff they seem to be growing in faster than if it had nothing</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim because I&#x27;ve used other serums that just did not work. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now on both my eye lashes and eye brows. What I do from one of my night routines is get some Vaseline and warm it up between my fingers then distribute it on my lashes and brows. I then finish them off with this growth serum and WALA :). My lashes feel a tad bit longer and alot fuller. The only thing I dislike about this product is the applicator because it barely picks up any product :(. Other then that everything else seems to be working out the consistency, price, amount, ingredients, etc...</li>
    <li> I love this serum it works wonders been using it everyday and my eyelashes are so long I definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> After just 2 weeks of using, it fixed a part of my eyelashes that was thinning, due to excessive curling from cosplay, was miraculously fixed! I applied it every night generously before going to bed and it really does work. I did not try it on my eyebrows as I&#x27;d prefer them to be thinner so I can&#x27;t give feedback on that but I&#x27;m sure it would work. Great product. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try it so see if it is a good as Lusciou lash MD.  That is all I have to say at this time</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. It helped my eyebrows to thicken up within a month.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t grow your lashes or eye brows</li>
    <li> Works great on eyebrows but not on eyelashes it made my eyes blurry in the morning.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because not only did it arrive in a timely fashion but it also completely filled in my left brow which has ALWAYS been much thinner and sparse in comparison to my right brow. I am really impressed with this product, and i&#x27;m glad I took the chance and bought it because it truly does work (at least it did for me anyway). If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this product, I would say go ahead and purchase it because not only is it inexpensive, but hopefully, like me, you will see results. I bought 3 of these gel treatments, and have not yet even finished my first. It&#x27;s only been about a week in a half, or two weeks of me using this product twice a day and I can honestly see a major difference from before I started using this product! I absolutely love this stuff, and for the cost, its phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive this product and received no response to the emails I have sent regarding the status.</li>
    <li> I literally saw results in a couple of days. I was chocked to see that the thin patches on my eyebrows had been starting to grow and my lashes longer and slightly fuller. I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon before, but I feel like the results from this serum were so incredible that I had to share. Tonight will be the fourth time that I&#x27;ve used this and I&#x27;m extremely excited to see how much more it can do in the long run.</li>
    <li> It is good price. But I didn&#x27;t see any difference after 1 month.</li>
    <li> I would recommend getting a small paint brush instead of pushing this on your lashes. It needs to be applied to the lash line to work, the gel doesn&#x27;t really go down the lashed themselves. As for growth. I&#x27;ll have to come back and update in a month.</li>
    <li> I order this item and I have not seen any results from using it at night.  It suppose to help your eyebrow and lashes grow, but I am only using for my eyebrow. I have been using it now for about three weeks. I will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me as I expected,, I used this for a month and I didn&#x27;t get the results that I was expecting. Now I&#x27;m trying something else and hopefully&lt;br /&gt;I will have better luck. I had such high hopes for this product solely off of the reviews that I read prior to purchasing it. However it did not measure up..</li>
    <li> Did not really see enough result, but did not faithfully use product.</li>
    <li> It had good reviews so I bought it. My eyebrows didn&#x27;t grow where they were thin and I used it every night for over a month.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for me, I apply every night on a clean face wherever I want the hair to grow and on my lower lashes only a week later and I have fuller eyebrows and lashes love it. If apply to much on lashes it will burn!</li>
    <li> Works(:&lt;br /&gt;Just takes about 3 months for full affect.&lt;br /&gt;Last that long tho.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and if I skip it, my eyebrows and out. Sorry my eyebrows thin out. For some reason I can&#x27;t edit this message. Anyways if I use it they stays lush and thick as do my lashes</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are very thin and don&#x27;t really grow long enough to make my brows look full. I read a lot of reviews saying it only works on lashes so I was hesitant to buy it but I decided to give it a chance. I am so glad I did! It made my brows grow longer and gives it a fuller look. I&#x27;ve been using it for one month now and I love it! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It absolutely did not do anything for conditioning or lengthening my lashes. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> it does work but it works slowly.  i had very thin eye brows and now they are starting to be noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dejuan neilson&lt;br /&gt;280 wheeler rd&lt;br /&gt;gray, ga 31032</li>
    <li> this doesnt do anything....it might help nourish lashes but i bought this for brows- pointless buy, has no effect for me.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly works ! Use it every night</li>
    <li> The lady that waxes my brows suggested this gel.  I&#x27;d noticed that my brows were thinning at the end and it took longer than normal to grow back.  I tried this and truly noticed a huge difference after using it for about 5 days!  I was amazed!!  I decided to try them on my lashes, I&#x27;ve always had long and normal lashes.  But, after using this I could see a difference in thickness and appearance after the 2nd day of use!!!  I&#x27;m really excited about this, especially for my brows - so happy!</li>
    <li> This product helped  my eyebrows grow back to full&lt;br /&gt;It would never grow back untill I tried this&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really go with the rules I just applied  it once morning and night time&lt;br /&gt;I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work at first because it was a cheap product but I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Update-  This product is effective but if you use it wrong its like taking 1 step forward and 5 steps back. I used this nightly applying to all eyelashes and getting close to base. It did grow a hair where there was a gap but also I notice losing other lashes in other places. My advice is use it but only apply to gap areas DO NOT APPLY WHERE LASHES EXIST. Hope ive helped.</li>
    <li> Doe not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected, and it was so cheap! I have been using this for about a week and I am&lt;br /&gt;definitely starting to see results,&lt;br /&gt;My eyelash curler chopped some of my eyelashes off making them look uneven. After only a week, the smaller lashes are now the same size. My eyelashes feel healthier and stronger. I would without a doubt recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5/5!</li>
    <li> Package arrived broken, little to no product left in the tube, so I can&#x27;t determine if it would&#x27;ve even worked.</li>
    <li> First off: i was very pleased with the fast shipping which arrived way before the expected date! I was skeptical about buying this product at first because I knew nothing about eyelash regrowth. I burnt most the eyelashes off of my right eye, and I bought this product in desperation &amp; after reading mostly good reviews about it. Let me just say- it definitely works!!!! After 3 uses, my eyelashes were already growing &amp; there was already a noticeable difference! I&#x27;ve used the product for about 9 days now and not only are the eyelashes on my right eye longer than the lashes on my left eye, but they are fuller as well! (now I&#x27;m putting the product on my left lashes as well) I am very pleased &amp; satisfied with this product! So glad to find something that works! I love Amazon! Will buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and faithfully applied twice a day.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any lash growth, but I think it&#x27;s a bit thicker.  Then again, it may be wishful thinking!  I&#x27;ve tried Cargo Lash activator a few years back and had far better results.  You can get a small sample size at Ulta for like, $20.  I&#x27;d rather invest a bit more in something that works well!  However, I don&#x27;t consider this a total loss, because I had no allergic reactions (sensitive skin) and my lashes didn&#x27;t fall out or anything horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, random side note, I don&#x27;t review as often as I should, but I feel like it&#x27;s my duty, as there has been a huge influx of fake reviews on Amazon!  Buyers, please make sure you check the reviewer&#x27;s history if the product sounds too good to be true.  I used to buy solely on the number do reviews, but nowadays, I can&#x27;t trust &#x27;em :(</li>
    <li> Got this mostly for my eyebrows, they were uneven and not shaped right. It seems to be working, eyebrows are growing and filling in places that they never had before.</li>
    <li> Love ardell ♥♡♥♡♥ Great product &amp; great customer sevice..&amp; thats why I will be a repeat customer.. ty</li>
    <li> I used this product n it&#x27;s okay.  Did not work the way it said......n I used it every night.  Sorry but I did use it every night like it said and did not see a difference at all.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were treaded too thin recently and I felt very self-conscious about them. I started using the Accelerator and I love it! It has been two weeks and my eyebrows have grown rapidly. I will continue using it nightly!</li>
    <li> I am always picking at my eyelashes so this stuff helps me not to do that! I luv this stuff &amp; always receive it on time.</li>
    <li> After one week my lashes seemed much healthier .not much longer yet but only using it for a short time.my mascara looks so much prettier when applied  not so sparsely like before,worth to try.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work.. the applicator is not right for this product.</li>
    <li> This one takes time too - can&#x27;t see results yet</li>
    <li> First thing I found that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and actually worked!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!  There is no reason to pay $100+ for a Rx lash thickener!</li>
    <li> I brought this product about 6 months ago. I use it everyday twice a day no results at all. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom, she says it looks to be working.... She is in another state, and I didn&#x27;t open the package before I shipped it to her, but she says it seems to be a bit thick... she had to pump the wand up and down a bit to get the gel... other than that, when she sends me a picture of her brows, I will be able to tell.</li>
    <li> literally the best stuff ever. my eyebrows used to be way over plucked and now they&#x27;re think and full just how I wanted them. I use every night before bed. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am sure it works well... but I always forget to use it daily.  So it is my fault that I don&#x27;t know its results. It is very easy to apply though.(:</li>
    <li> I used it as said, however it does not work...I think you should stand good for this product please help</li>
