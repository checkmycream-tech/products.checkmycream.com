      <li>This is by far the best root cover up out there.</li>
      <li>I used to use a sharpie - I love it because it doesn&#x27;t wash out</li>

      <li>perfect for those greys that pop up around your face before it&#x27;s time to get your next color</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Thanks, Amazon, for making such good products available to us!</li>
      <li>I found the full instructions on their website, so I&#x27;m passing this along to y&#x27;all.</li>

      <li>Once you get that all cleaned up, it looks great and subtle.  </li>
      <li>It can be a bit sticky, so users need to keep their hands away from the product once its on the hair (although you may gently go over with a brush).</li>

      <li>Gently brush &amp; roll color wand from root to end until blended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for that in between time of coloring hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Brush &amp; style hair as normal.</li>
      <li>Must have been very old product or opened at some point.</li>
      <li>A small amount of product is all that is needed to cover even the most resistant gray hair.</li>
      <li>I like it better than other similar liquid products</li>
      <li>Kind of crisp and sticky when you apply it to the hair, then it dries to a crispness that is weird.</li>
      <li>It provides 100 percent coverage and blends in naturally with my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>My grow out starts two weeks after my professional color</li>
      <li>It covers the grey very well.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased several of the Greyfree Professional Temporary Hair Colors -- for myself, my husband, my friends, and my daughters.</li>

<li> I have 100 percent grey hair</li>
<li> I held back on giving this 5 stars, because it definitely feels a little tacky when it dries, not quite as much as mascara does on your eyelashes, but I suppose that is not surprising.  </li>
<li> Other than that, wear with confidence.</li>
<li> it works, but it makes your hair dry and stiff where it is applied.</li>
<li> Remember, you might want to lean toward a slightly darker color, because, after all, you are using it to cover gray.  </li>
<li> No special brushes or combs are needed for application.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that the Dark Brown which I&#x27;ve used in the past wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon.  </li>
<li> Even a little perspiration under my wig did NOT make the color run or transfer to my wig.&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions with this Lt.Brown Greyfree, but my Ash Brown Greyfree did have abreviated instructions on the tube.</li>
<li> Came to me all dried out</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never noticed it coming off after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
<li> It does cover well, though it&#x27;s messy to put on -</li>
<li> (I know it sounds weird, but it worked SO well) -</li>

    <li> Wish this color had more dimension. It&#x27;s flat Brown, no shine</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of the Greyfree Professional Temporary Hair Colors -- for myself, my husband, my friends, and my daughters. It&#x27;s a great product for in between touch-up times. It can be a bit sticky, so users need to keep their hands away from the product once its on the hair (although you may gently go over with a brush). Other than that, wear with confidence.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair-line around my face, to cover the grey &amp; blend well with my wigs.  This color is perfect for my light to medium brown wigs. It covers the grey very well.  Also, this color did NOT rub off on my pillow case. Even a little perspiration under my wig did NOT make the color run or transfer to my wig.&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions with this Lt.Brown Greyfree, but my Ash Brown Greyfree did have abreviated instructions on the tube. I found the full instructions on their website, so I&#x27;m passing this along to y&#x27;all. Hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to apply: Greyfree is best applied to dry hair. For best results apply very sparingly. A small amount of product is all that is needed to cover even the most resistant gray hair. Gently brush &amp; roll color wand from root to end until blended. Allow to dry naturally or use hair dryer. Brush &amp; style hair as normal. All styling products &amp; styling tools may be used before &amp; after applying Greyfree. No special brushes or combs are needed for application. To remove, simply shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product &amp; prompt delivery!!! Thanks, Amazon, for making such good products available to us!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist an owner of a salon..this is one of the best products in the market ...gives you great gray coverage in a pinch...especially if you can&#x27;t get to your hairdresser before a  special event...washes out easily too..</li>
    <li> Perfect for touch up on the go. wash&#x27;s out when you wash your hair. But it works, especially for those stubborn grey hairs.</li>
    <li> love this! perfect for those greys that pop up around your face before it&#x27;s time to get your next color</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like going without it. Greyfree is great for covering up the roots between hair coloring appointments. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist gave me a tube of this for my gray roots. It is really great for those in between color appointments, especially when life is so busy and you can&#x27;t get to the hair salon. I was running low so ordered two. Thanks to Amazon for listing theses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times now.  I like it better than other similar liquid products and it&#x27;s much better than a powder I tried.  The light brown seems to work best for me, although my hair is mostly a more medium-dark brown.  I&#x27;ve never noticed it coming off after it&#x27;s dried.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I have my hair cut and colored at the salon every 5 weeks.  This stuff is essential to me during the last week before my next color.  I apply it to my temple roots, and it blends in beautifully.  Remember, you might want to lean toward a slightly darker color, because, after all, you are using it to cover gray.  I held back on giving this 5 stars, because it definitely feels a little tacky when it dries, not quite as much as mascara does on your eyelashes, but I suppose that is not surprising.  It&#x27;s a good product and a good price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best root cover up out there. It goes on easily and is not noticeable at all. Most root cover ups do not match hair colors well, this one does. I highly recommend this product for that in between time of coloring hair. I would never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other grey cover sticks and this brand is the best! It&#x27;s not waxy nor results in a buildup. Great product!</li>
    <li> Greyfree Temporary hair color is a great product.  Easy to apply, good coverage and very convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> great love it. Only have grey at front. Now I don,t</li>
    <li> Great product for covering the grays in between your color services. Easy to apply and stays put.</li>
    <li> I do like the coverage I get with this.  I used to use a sharpie - I love it because it doesn&#x27;t wash out (I know it sounds weird, but it worked SO well) - but they stopped making that color sharpie.  So I tried this.  It does cover well, though it&#x27;s messy to put on - I get it on my scalp and hands.  Once you get that all cleaned up, it looks great and subtle.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t wash out each time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t tell the guys that I use this stuff, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This can be a lifesaver between colorings to cover your roots. It doesn&#x27;t run and is easy to apply. Does not clump and come in a mascara type container. Great to have on hand for emergencies when you don&#x27;t want gray showing.</li>
    <li> it works, but it makes your hair dry and stiff where it is applied.</li>
    <li> This is the best temporary hair color I have found and I have tried everything I can find. I have 100 percent grey hair and it is colored  light brown.  My grow out starts two weeks after my professional color so I use this product for 4 weeks until my next color. It provides 100 percent coverage and blends in naturally with my color treated hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> bought for husband, works great</li>
    <li> As my hair color turns grey so do the eyebrows - instead of plucking out the grey and leaving my brows looking spotty, I decided to dye them.  This product doesn&#x27;t permanently dye, it only adds color for the one application.  I am going to look into a more permanent solution.</li>
    <li> product was as described</li>
    <li> I love having a way of covering the white hairs that quickly sprout up at my temples and part line between colorings.  I have medium brown hair and bought the light brown option: it works perfectly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do if I didnt have it.</li>
    <li> Kind of crisp and sticky when you apply it to the hair, then it dries to a crispness that is weird.</li>
    <li> Must have been very old product or opened at some point. It only lasted three days and it&#x27;s gone. My last bottle lasted months.</li>
