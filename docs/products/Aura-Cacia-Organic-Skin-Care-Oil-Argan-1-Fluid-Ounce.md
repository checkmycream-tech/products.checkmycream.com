<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as ordered and delivered in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only brand of Argan oil I have tried, but I like it - it absorbs quickly and seems to improve skin texture over time</li>
    <li> High quality product; however, the packaging was not air-tight, so the oil leaked en route.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and very good product</li>
    <li> great for heat protection and smoothing hair</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this stuff at whole foods because I had recently heard about all of the hype surrounding argan oil for hair.  The more research I did, I noticed that people had fantastic results using argan oil on skin as well.  This worked pretty well in my hair--made it shiny and a bit healthier looking.  What I was really amazed with was how much of a difference this made with my skin (my face).  I wasn&#x27;t even planning on using this on my face, but given all of the good reviews I had seen about using argan oil on skin, I gave it a whirl, and I must say that I am very pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;m a new mom in my mid 20s and have always had hormonal acne issues.  I added this to my current face regimen (benzoyl peroxide &amp; alpha hydroxy 8%) and it has made my skin look so much better.  It has helped clear my skin more than it was being cleared by my current routine and left it looking very supple and bright.  I will definitely keep on buying this stuff as it has now become a standard part of my face routine.  If I had to issue one and only one complaint, it would be that I&#x27;m not crazy about the &#x27;pump&#x27; design.  I wish it was a dropper instead.  A very very small complaint given how wonderful the product is.  I recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this product!  I, too, tried it due to all of the hype about it; and, I love using organic items on my skin.  After sleeping with it on my face one night, I was hooked!  You wake up with THE softest skin ever!  And, when you first put it on, it leaves a beautiful glow that makes you feel as though you never want to put makeup on over it; but, if you do, your makeup looks fabulous!  Then I tried it in my hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it there either.  It helps to control fly away hair in the winter.  The ends do not stick out.  My hair feels soft and healthy.  Next, tried it on my hands and cuticles before going to bed at night.  Wow!  My skin drank it right up!  Once you try it, you really will want to take a bath in it!</li>
    <li> I have a child with eczema, plus the rest of our family experiences dry skin during New England&#x27;s harsh winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil may or may not work for you... but this is a very convenient size for trying a new skin product! I particularly like this brand for the easy to use pump applicators on top. We&#x27;ve used both this Argan Oil and the same line&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00502NMUS Aura Cacia Organic Skin Care Oil, Baobab, 1-Fluid Ounce]], as well as many other brands of oil available at Whole Foods and on Amazon, and this applicator is the very best. I can easily dispense a small amount to smooth over my own oily facial skin, or add several pumps to a handful of mixed oils to moisturize my little guy with the skin condition after his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;([[ASIN:B000BD1EFQ Home Health - Castor Oil Cold Pressed &amp; Cold Processed 8 fl. oz.]] really suffers by comparison when it comes to ease of use!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, my skin has always been oily and breakout prone, but also very sensitive to chemicals. With age and winter starting to leave me dried out for part of the year, I was really at a loss when every moisturizing cream I tried led to breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using some skin oils, beginning with [[ASIN:B004TGSHPG DHC Olive Virgin Oil 1 fl. oz.]] because I had it, then on to jojoba oil and now Argan, and I&#x27;ve been much more successful than when using prepared products with too many ingredients for my temperamental face. I wish I could say we&#x27;d cured winter skin, but we haven&#x27;t. It just feels better with application of some (tiny bit of) oil over freshly washed skin. Argan Oil does feel just amazing going on. I think it has the least greasy residue of any oil I&#x27;ve tried yet (Olive, Jojoba, Baobab, Avocado, Sesame and Castor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the same lines, my sensitive little guy still has eczema, but he hasn&#x27;t reacted badly to this Argan Oil, though I think the Baobab Oil is working out best for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods has this line of oils on sale this week (month?) for about what I paid here on Amazon, but the regular price is about 50% higher, so you may want to shop around before you buy.regular price is about 50% higher, so you may want to shop around before you buy.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product, a company that I have used before.  Bought this for my daughter and she likes it very well for dry \\&quot;t-zone\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I use it for my facial lotions. So far it is great and my clients skin has been radient. Mature skin care is very important.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Moroccan argan oil from friends and, of course, advertisements.  I was cautioned to buy organic 100% argan oil - absolutely do not buy anything that is diluted with other ingredients.  Since I am familiar with Aura Cacia, I decided to try it.  Wow!  I don&#x27;t understand how &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; can&#x27;t be &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  It immediately absorbs into the skin.  I&#x27;ve used it on my frizzy hair, face, elbows, and hands.  I think this stuff is great!  A friend also told me that the NOW brand is good and it is cheaper.  I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell but once you put it on your body, it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Awesome for skin care or mixing with essential oils!</li>
    <li> A very good product. Readily absorbed as a face serum. Will use in other homemade products.</li>
    <li> I love mixing this in with organic coconut oil to use as a face and body moisturizer for the summer.  In the winter I mix in organic shea butter as well and my dry, winter skin looooves it!!!!  I am turning 50 in 6 months and people still tell me I look like I am in my mid 30s.</li>
    <li> I have used several other Aura Cacia products and I am always satisfied.  I use 1 pump of the oil on my shoulder length hair when wet and it really helps to manage my fly away hairs.  I also use it on my face which is acne prone.  It does not cause breakouts, and really moisturizes, leaving my face with a dewy look.  I think it smells very good.  Not strong, but a faint pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia&#x27;s Argon Oil is the one I use more than any other ( their Rosehip Oil is exquisite, which I use religiously also ).&lt;br /&gt;The essential fatty acids necessary for the skin truly make this the &amp;#34; Gold &amp;#34; oil.  Keep your beauty chest filled with this&lt;br /&gt;at all times, no other oil will do more than this one.</li>
    <li> wanted to wait a few weeks to give an honest review. I&#x27;ve been using this every morning and night after washing my face as a moisturizer. I was using Josie Maran&#x27;s light argan oil before, but I ran out and was too lazy to drive a couple more miles to Ulta. I just picked this up at Earthfare instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it doesn&#x27;t stink. The Josie Maran stuff smelled like fried chicken. It made me hungry. This has a kind of sweet, very vague perfume-y scent. Not good, but not awful. Doesn&#x27;t matter, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long so NBD. I&#x27;d rub cat turds on my face if it would give me beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week I had a couple pimples pop up, but I decided to stick it out because my period was due soon and I&#x27;d already been through 3 bottles of the JM light argan oil with no big breakouts. I&#x27;m at probably 3 weeks of pretty consistent twice-daily use, and now I&#x27;ve gotten probably five new bumps on my jaw line, one under my nose, one on my chin, cheek, and two on my forehead. My skin was pretty well under control before I started using this brand of argan oil. I believe it to be the culprit causing my face to explode. Ok, it&#x27;s not THAT bad, but I&#x27;m not messing with it anymore. I&#x27;m going back to the stupid expensive JM until I can find something better that doesn&#x27;t break me out. You would think by 31 this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue anymore. Ugh. Good luck, everybody else! Hope it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is as good as the higher priced argan oil.  I use it on my hair and skin.  It&#x27;s very hydrating without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Vile. I usually use Josie Maran argan oil but ran out so bought this at a local store for the meantime.  It has made my child&#x27;s skin more inflammed and it smells like straight fertilizer... the kind where you&#x27;re driving by a fertilizer plant and knocks you back due to the stench. It&#x27;s just awful. The Maran oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.  Sadly I bought 2 of these for school and home... and it is just gag awful!</li>
    <li> I always have had very dry, beginning to \\&quot;age\\&quot; skin.  I am 50.  I have never felt moisturized enough even after applying moisturizer (all different kinds).  I saw the Jose Maran argan oil on TV but was a little pricey.  Saw this at my supermarket in the natural aisle so thought I&#x27;d look on Amazon.  I can get it a dollar or two less here at Amazon and I put it on subscribe &amp; save.  This stuff is wonderful.  Yes, it seems a bit greasy at first but soaks right into my skin.  I normally apply this as soon as I get out of the shower and by the time I brush my teeth and I am ready to apply my makeup this has soaked in.  And yes... it does have a bit of an odor... but one I would like to think is just the natural smell of the oil (i.e. tea tree oil has a whopping natural scent!).  But the scent of this argan oil does not linger.  This provides me with enough hydration that I don&#x27;t even need to use a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; any longer.  Although when summer rolls around and I am spending countless hours outside I will apply a moisturizer in order to get an SPF on my skin. My few lines look better just because my face is hydrated instead of looking like a desert.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> *:·SUPER .·:*¨¨*:·.HAPPY CUSTOMER*¨¨*:··:*A+++LOVE IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT.·:*¨¨*:·&lt;br /&gt;Great oil for skin and hair.  I have sensitive skin that can break out with anything and this stuff does NOT clog my pours.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Love, love this product! I use it on my face morning and night after mosturzing, making a major improvement in the feel and look of my skin. I have never used anything sooo mosturizing and wonderful feeling. It feels oily when you first put it on, but it is not at all. I will continue using this product in perpetuity!!</li>
    <li> I too, have been reading so much about the benefits of Argan oil, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on it. Well, when I saw that Aura Cacia carried their own Argan, I decided to give it a try because it&#x27;s a brand I trust and the price was right! I have to say, I was instantly impressed. It does amazing things to your skin and hair. I massage it all over my face at night before bed, and I also use about a quarter sized amount on my hair after washing it, (I have very thick, long hair that&#x27;s prone to split ends). I rub it in my hands and then massage it into my damp, detangled hair. The ends look and feel so much healthier already, it&#x27;s kind of crazy. When I use it on my face at night, I even use it on my lips! It really hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily at all. I use one drop for my entire face, including under eyes and then just rub in what&#x27;s left over into my hands. I also really love the story behind how it&#x27;s produced only by women and only in one place in Morocco. A victory for sustainable and woman-run business that is even protected by the Moroccan government!</li>
    <li> I do tons of aromatherapy work, pretty much mixing things up on a daily basis, and this if my favorite to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how people get hooked on expensive beauty brands that dilute their argan oil, or add preservatives or fragrance! Aura Cacia&#x27;s is not only much cheaper, but also pure.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and practically use it everyday!</li>
    <li> This works wonders for my skin. I was afraid that this would make me break out because I do have acne prone skin, but it actually improved my acne! I was very happy with the results. I only use it at night. It makes my skin very moisturized. I was afraid that this small bottle wouldn&#x27;t last me a long time, but a little goes a long way. This is probably my favorite oil. It does not sting or burn if you get it in your eyes like other products. I find it too heavy for my fine hair, but it&#x27;s lovely on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Whole foods for my hair originally. After some Google-ing I read it can also be used for skin. I started using it as a moisturizer and it has definitely changed my skin. I&#x27;ve tried Perricone MD, Cetaphil, Olay and a bunch other moisturizers I even tried Aquaphor bit my skin really likes this oil. I wish the company that sells this stuff sold it in a bigger size than 1 Oz.</li>
    <li> Jussct received this a couple days ago and so far I love it.  I looked up some reviews on the best brands of argan oil that were also reasonably priced.  Aura Acacia was one of the brands mentioned.  I am  familiar with Aura Cacias essential oils and am pleased with the quality of their products.  I read a lot about argan oil and was excited to try it out.  I have used many other kinds oils for body and beauty purposes: sweet almond, sesame, coconut, grape seed, olive, baby oil, jojoba, apricot kernel, vitamin E.  I do have to say, that in just a couple days, so far, I think I like argan oil the best.  I hesitantly applied the argan oil to my face.  I was hoping that what all the reviews said were true and that it would not make my face greasy but regulate facial oil production and help clear up scars and blemishes.  It absorbed into my face and provided a  moisturized but matte finish. There is no added fragrance to this argan oil.  The smell of this oil in its unaltered state is a little like a very faint scent of olive oil and vinegar salad dressing. When applied to my dry hair it created as shiny softer texture.  So far, I love this.  I will write more after a couple of weeks and report how well this argan oil banishes blemishes and scars and repairs dry hair.</li>
    <li> I recently started using Argan oil on my face.  I add Young Living essential oils to it (currently Frankincense and Lavender with plans to add Carrot Seed oil for SPF) and apply to my face after cleansing, instead of moisturizer.  I love the glass pump bottle it comes in.  So easy to just add the drops of EO right to the bottle for my convenience.</li>
    <li> I got introduced to argan oil at Sephora, through the Josie Maran product line. Much as I loved the oil, the price tag was a bit high for my taste. Which is why I turned to Amazon for a cheaper alternative. Boy, was I ever disappointed with Aura Cacia&#x27;s argan oil! This stuff stinks! I can only use it if I mix it in with another product that has a pleasant scent. Otherwise, I find myself completely disgusted by the smell. If I could, I&#x27;d give this product no stars whatsoever. Luckily, I found that the Acure brand of argan oil has a much lighter, less detectable odor.</li>
    <li> Wow I was really looking forward to the Aura Cacia Organic Skin Care oil-Argan but I was sent Rosehip instead. That&#x27;s really sad because I live in a remote area and its a long drive to pick up and/or return packages. I hope this isn&#x27;t a new trend. I have no idea how I like it because I can&#x27;t even try it. No thanks to the careless person that put the wrong item in the box!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the package it was carefully wrapped in bubble wrap. Oil filled as per picture , it smells like manure, And doesn&#x27;t contain any cloudiness at the bottom of the jar indicating a good oil. I purchased two of these and both are questionable.</li>
    <li> I had given up on finding the real thing. Just yesterday in my local grocery store I found this in the natural section. I bought this and the rosehip serum.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the argan is light and sweet. I am excited because this is the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Next I will try the macadamia nut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before and will always swear by it. My facialist is 65 and looks 45 and she told me this is all she uses aside from moisturizer. Sure it&#x27;s greasy because it&#x27;s an OIL but in less than 10 minutes it soaks into your skin. Every morning I wake up with fresh looking skin and it&#x27;s helped with daily dryness. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> As described &amp; delivered on time!</li>
    <li> I like to put this on the ends of my hair when I hop out of the shower. Its really helped keep down split ends :)</li>
    <li> Mom asked for this as a gift. She continues to tell me she likes it because it&#x27;s not sticky- this equals success.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR:&lt;br /&gt;Hair&lt;br /&gt;Body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD FOR:&lt;br /&gt;Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts (for me, anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Is said to be comedogenic because of high oleic oil content, you may want to avoid it if you have oily skin and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I had used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil (also organic,and cruelty free, although there&#x27;s been controversy about that) but I  balked a bit at the price. When I saw this in Whole Foods, I snapped it up, thinking \\&quot;What a bargain!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do have oily skin, breakouts, large pores and all the rest of it, I had no problems with the Maran oil.  It was light, soaked in fairly quickly, a little went a long way and there was no discernible odor.  This has an odor, and 3 days in, I&#x27;ve been breaking more than usual and the pores on my nose are very...evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very little bit on the ends of my hair worked well without looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will use up the rest of this on my split ends and on my skin after the shower, and back to Josie I go. I wondered why hers cost more and now I know.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re near a health food store, try to get a bit from a sample before buying.</li>
    <li> Use this as facial moisturizer...works amazing.  Highly recommend.  This is the best price I have found for organic argan oil also.</li>
    <li> Product seems pure, no extra ingredients. Seems to be helping my dry scalp. Bottle is a bit small.</li>
    <li> The product I am pleased with.  I apply  the Argan oil daily on my face daily and my skin is looking good.</li>
    <li> love it for a night moisturizer! not too greasy either!</li>
    <li> Did you know that in Southern Morroco the Tamri goats climb the Argan trees to feed on Argan berries &amp; after digesting them, they leave behind droppings rich in Argan oil?  Well no wonder this Aura Cacia brand smells like goat droppings!! After some research, I found out that local Morrocan farmers collect these \\&quot;seeds\\&quot; from the ground, wash them, and press them to obtain Argan oil. The difference is that some farmers collect seeds from the trees while others collect seeds from the ground after they have been digested by goats.... Perhaps when comparing Argan traditions these two practices yield similar topical benefits yet the smells are definitely different!! (Look for COLD PRESSED Argan oils to avoid stinky smells).</li>
    <li> For years I have been buying expensive lotions and anti aging products and now I found this!!!!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  I apply it at night because it is too oily for me to use during the day, since using it my skin is soft, more even and cleared up my eczema!  I was dealing with eczema above my eye for 2 years and nothing would help until I found this product, its truly a great product.    Some reviewers complained about the scent of the oil but I thought it was a nice light smell and I really liked it.  Also the pump is a nice addition.    I have been buying this as gifts because more people need to know about this great inexpensive, anti-aging product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this locally at Sprouts Farmers Market.  I had picked up one of Aura Cacia&#x27;s essential oil &amp;#34;recipe cards&amp;#34; for a hair treatment and already had the Rosemary &amp; Peppermint essential oils I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this!  I have post-menopausal, post-chemotherapy hair and life at altitude so my hair is dry, even with good hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the essential oils as directed in the recipe as I love other Rosemary-Mint items I have (mostly from Aveda).  Here is the recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.auracacia.com/recipes/argan-cooling-scalp-remedy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on in the morning if I won&#x27;t be taking my shower right away(and will be at home).  I don&#x27;t use it only on my scalp as I use both Rogaine and Aveda&#x27;s Invati activator on it; I use it on my hair, from root to tip.  I make sure to shake it before use and emulsify it a bit in my palms.  I don&#x27;t use it at night because my pillow gets oily and I don&#x27;t use it after a shower because it makes my hair greasier than I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just one week my hair is so much better!  I think it&#x27;s really prepping my hair well for my shower as I notice I need less shampoo (Aveda&#x27;s Invati), it lathers better, and my conditioner (also Invati) seems to work better.  I barely need any leave-in conditioner now before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; products before, but they were not 100% like this one.  Experts state if you purchase a product that&#x27;s not 100%, it most likely has a few drops in an entire bottle.  Getting this is a whole different product that&#x27;s not weighed down or diluted with other ingredients.</li>
