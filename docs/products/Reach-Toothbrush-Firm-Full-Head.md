      <li>Good product but require more durability of the brush that needs to be more sturdy even after many times of uses the brush needs to still be fresh as newly just got.</li>
      <li>Best Firm Toothbruch available!</li>
      <li>Our teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with soft or medium brushes, so this is a great buy to stock up and stick in the closet and not worry about finding for a while.  </li>

      <li>product as described shipped quickly</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>He thinks I&#x27;m going to ruin my enamel, but so far I&#x27;ve not hurt it a bit and have GREAT gum health for an old lady.  </li>

      <li>They seem to wear out quickly...</li>
      <li>pretty good, nice and hard.</li>
      <li>Great to have a firm toothbrush again</li>
      <li>worth buying.</li>
      <li>As expected, very firrm and in good condition,very happy with this buy, planning on buying more in the future if possible.</li>
      <li>Think soft and medium make teeth more prone to problems.</li>
      <li>(on the doctors recommend doing this with a soft brush on babies with skin problems-hard works better on adults-tougher</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s nothing like a good, firm toothbrush to make them feel really clean.  </li>
      <li>I have found other &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; ones, but none were as good as these.</li>
      <li>That pick was picking the enamel right off my teeth.  </li>
      <li>They really leave your teeth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Great firm toothbrushes that actually clean your teeth, unlike soft or medium ones.</li>
      <li>The Reach toothbrushes are better quality and worth the tad extra money.</li>
      <li>very reasonable priced.  </li>
      <li>Whichever comes first.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It cleans well but only with a lot more effort.</li>
      <li>Price competitive - and a whole lot easier!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> finally! so sick of soft bristles</li>
    <li> Boy, was I wrong about these toothbrushes!!  I naively wrote the review before using them assuming they would be the same Reach toothbrushes I had ordered in the past.  WRONG!!  They are without a doubt the worst I have ever used.  They fray after one or two brushings, making them USELESS.  I have started using a new one every two days to just use them up.  I hope Amazon is offering another brand of firm toothbrushes now; I haven&#x27;t looked yet.  DON&#x27;T BUY THESE!!!!</li>
    <li> They sent me medium instead of firm but I did not want to go through the trouble of sending them back. So they won and I lost.</li>
    <li> Good product but require more durability of the brush that needs to be more sturdy even after many times of uses the brush needs to still be fresh as newly just got.</li>
    <li> It is not good, I don&#x27;t like it, not soft</li>
    <li> A superior brush and this came in a huge bundle.  I&#x27;ve been using this over my other Crest and Colgate brushes, and because I brush hard, they&#x27;d worn out under 15 days.  I found myself recycling a bunch of their brushes and came across this firm full Head which doesn&#x27;t have those filler stuff, the most basic straightforward brush I found.  It works great and I haven&#x27;t changed my brush yet.  Fantastic product, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great firm toothbrushes that actually clean your teeth, unlike soft or medium ones. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I like these full firm toothbrushes and they are hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Husband only wants hard bristles.  This suits him well.  Ordered many. They will last till we go into a nursing home or he looses his teeth.. Whichever comes first.</li>
    <li> Convenient, quick, accurate. No longer have to dig though hundreds of toothbrushes, often illegibly marked in Japanese hoping to find my &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; brushes, at the local dollar (type) store. Price competitive - and a whole lot easier!</li>
    <li> As described. I prefer firm brushes and they are very difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Great to have a firm toothbrush again they are so hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> awesome. the packaging is not cute, Just a piece of  clear plastic bag wrappped around the individually packaged brushes. They really leave your teeth feeling clean. I&#x27;ll be buying these again</li>
    <li> Good value, fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> Great to find so many at such a good price. impossible to find in pharmacies where usually you see soft or medium brush heads.</li>
    <li> I have the best gums!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes brushes are the exception. You can hardly find a firm toothbrush in any supermarket and some doctors may say that firm toothbrushes isn&#x27;t good for your teeth, but I say that it takes a lot of plaque off your teeth and shines them pretty good. So I will continue to purchase these brushes for the rest of my days. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My favorite tooth brushes!</li>
    <li> Firm toothbrushes are difficult to find anymore, but they keep us out of the dentist.  Our teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with soft or medium brushes, so this is a great buy to stock up and stick in the closet and not worry about finding for a while.  I think dentist want people to use the soft and medium so you have to come in and get the tartar off your teeth that your toothbrush doesn&#x27;t.  They say the firm toothbrush is hard on your gums and nothing is harder on gums than a dental cleaning.  Did it once 25 years ago.  That pick was picking the enamel right off my teeth.  We use tartar control crest and firm toothbrushes and neither one of us have had to go to the dentist for years and years.  We are just turning 50 and our teeth and gums are doing great.</li>
    <li> glad to find firm brushes.  can&#x27;t use soft.  very reasonable priced.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying REACH Firm toothbrushes for over a decade.  They are the only ones that get my teeth really clean, but these are impossible to find in the stores anymore.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon and bought enough to last two years.  They were just what I expected and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Hope they keep making firm toothbrushes.  They are hard to find.  Used them all my life and get good dentist reports because of them.  Think soft and medium make teeth more prone to problems.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to purchase my &amp;#34;firm&#x27; brushes. It seems the stores are supporting the local dentists and not ordering them to get the job done for our teeth. The dentists get more visits from people wanting their teeth cleaned because the soft and medium brushes are useless!  THANX!</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid a great many years ago, I have cleaned my teeth at least once a day with a hard-bristled toothbrush.  People always tell me what beautiful teeth I have!  Medium- and soft-bristled brushes leave me feeling grungy.  So I am delighted to find that Reach still makes a hard-bristled brush, even though I drive my dentist nuts.  He thinks I&#x27;m going to ruin my enamel, but so far I&#x27;ve not hurt it a bit and have GREAT gum health for an old lady.  Thanks so much for selling these!  I&#x27;ll buy from you again when I&#x27;ve used these.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, but I gave the product 3 stars because the bristles softens rather quickly, and I really enjoy firm bristles.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find the firm toothbrush in any stores in my area, only soft or medium. It&#x27;s great the they still even make them firm, seems to work better for me. These are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> For those that still like hard bristled toothbrushes, this is a good deal and exactly what I wanted.  I was on the road and couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked the Reach toothbrushes for years.  But it is difficult to find the full head and firm versions in the stores&lt;br /&gt;in my area.  So this time I just bought a big pack of them to last me a long time...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the classic reach FIRM toothbrush. Having troubles finding these locally, so this is a great brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product and only place I find this outside the UK.</li>
    <li> These are the closest to truly firm brushes we used to be able to buy that I have been able to find, but definitely need replacing about every 50 uses. Wish they were a little bit firmer and lasted a little bit longer, but am just so grateful to find any at all worth buying. I have found other &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; ones, but none were as good as these.</li>
    <li> A firm brush. Finally. Great firm bristles and handle, plus the slightly angled head for the posteriors.</li>
    <li> As expected, very firrm and in good condition,very happy with this buy, planning on buying more in the future if possible.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes and their firm.  What else can you say?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anymore... After I brush my teeth, they actually feel clean. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Although I am please to find firm toothbrushes I was disappointed in the slippery handle.  I had to keep rinsing off my hand and the handle so I could maintain the grip.  Bristles were firm and performed as expected.  The style I have had before had lines on the handle for gripping.  I believe these toothbrushes were old inventory before the improved handle (with grippers).  My dentist cringed when I told him about finding the firm head toothbrush.  I just had my first cleaning, I am over 55, and dentist stated my plaque was bad, I told him not for my age, he had to agree. Thanks to firm toothbrushes and good genes.</li>
    <li> was what I wanted and expected</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes!  Can&#x27;t find good hard brush anywhere locally.  Will definitely reorder when needed</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Nice and firm.</li>
    <li> This product is nowhere to find.  Thank you .</li>
    <li> I bought both the Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40, Brushes Hard (Pack of 12) and the Reach Toothbrush Firm Full Head 12 Brushes Hard.  Both are very inexpensive and are good toothbrushes.  The Reach toothbrushes are better quality and worth the tad extra money.</li>
    <li> these are the best toothbrushes ever! Reach, don&#x27;t stop making these.</li>
    <li> I got it for uther than obvious use. Keep 1 un computer bag to keep keyboard debris free. Just brush dry up &amp; down/across a few times.&lt;br /&gt;If got a cast on makes a great scracher.&lt;br /&gt;If got area of bad dry skin rub with lotion then brush it to loosen it up-adults onlt. (on the doctors recommend doing this with a soft brush on babies with skin problems-hard works better on adults-tougher skin)&lt;br /&gt;Clean the bathroom sink drain opening-pulls it out if on edge.&lt;br /&gt;So far about it but with so many brushes will think of more. Being a little brush can do things bigger cant/longer handle gives better grip/hard pulls it out not just move it around.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great household item.</li>
    <li> They seem to wear out quickly... but they work great!</li>
    <li> not much to say, hard to find these firm brushes anymore so im glad I found these</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this kind of brush in stores, all you can get is soft or medium.  My mother wants a firm tooth brush and she is ninty one and has all of her teeth. So I use the firm brush as well. and look ma, no cavities</li>
    <li> Best Firm Toothbruch available!</li>
    <li> product as described shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Excellent product, quick ship</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive. Great quality!</li>
    <li> so happy to have a lifetime supply of hard bristled brushed... can&#x27;t find them at any shops around here.</li>
    <li> Soft bristled toothbrushes---yuch!  I know what the dentist say, but I hate anything but a stiff bristled toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These are great!  For whatever reason, it is difficult to find firm toothbrushes in local stores! Love ordering these in bulk!</li>
    <li> My son likes a firm toothbrush and he loves these. Great price too!</li>
    <li> For those of us who actually like clean teeth, these are perfect.  It seems that the rest of the public prefers bushing their teeth with puny soft little brushes that essentially do nothing.  While I am sure dentists like that (good for business), I don&#x27;t.  In my area it is impossible to find anything other then soft and a few medium bristly brushes.  Soft &#x3D; cotton ball on a stick and mouth full of plaque, medium &#x3D; if you brush for 30 min you might get those teeth sort of clean.  Hard &#x3D; effective and teeth cleaning, plaque shredding machine.  After being forced to use a medium bristle brush while trying to find a hard brush, I was shocked how much cleaner my teeth felt after finally getting to brush with a real tooth brush again.  You will be too.  Just be sure to stock up.  I am sure the ADA will find some numb nuts elected official or bureaucrat and convince them to make these things illegal.</li>
    <li> Hard to find firm toothbrushes, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my reach toothbrushes they&#x27;re colorful easy to handle and you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure to have a clean mouth and beautiful teeth thank you</li>
    <li> These can be hard to find these days.  The brand is good and they work well.</li>
    <li> Very easy transaction. Nice item</li>
    <li> I think these are knock offs from the real Reach product. The handle is so small, You can hardly grasp it! Even the brush head is smaller.</li>
    <li> Takes off all tarter.</li>
    <li> Now, these are real tooth brushes!!! Get some!!!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes around. Not only do they give a super thorough clean, they also last forever! Mine last 6-8 months. A++</li>
    <li> Great value.  great product, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> these are very firm brushes exactly what i wanted they do such a good job on your teeth and no they don&#x27;t remove your tooth enamel just the plaque if i had a gripe it would be the colors pink yellow and purple i don&#x27;t care for them i like blue green and red but they still work great .</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are not firm/ hard!  They are soft!!!  You can not return them either!  AMAZON refunded my money and I donated them!</li>
    <li> It is next to impossible to find &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; bristle in the store, so I am happy to find them on Amazon.  Reach seems to make a nice quality too.  Dentists will tell you not to use firm bristle, but I would rather brush softly with a firm toothbrush than have to scrub like heck with a mushy one.</li>
    <li> these are always hard to find in the stores. i was happy to but in quantity. have enough now for my guests too!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are Reach Toothbrushes.  If you have ever used them before, you know how good they are.  There really isn&#x27;t anything one can say about them since a Reach Toothbrush is a Reach Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love these hard bristle toothbrushes.  My teeth do not feel clean if I use Medium or Soft bristle.  I can&#x27;t find the hard bristles in the stores, so I am so glad Amazon offers this choice.  Great buy.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The products arrived and were as requested. I love a firm bristle on my brush and it&#x27;s hard to find this brand in the stores.  They are much more firm that the other brands and stay firm for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: they also make great brushes for hobby projects as well....when you wear them out on your teeth of course!</li>
    <li> Firm ... enough said. Can&#x27;t buy these at the store anymore.</li>
    <li> Reach brushes not easy to get., Good price and delivery</li>
    <li> I have great teeth and there&#x27;s nothing like a good, firm toothbrush to make them feel really clean.  I love these and will reorder when I&#x27;m done with the package that I have.</li>
    <li> I am not fully satisfied. I guess I have been spoiled by the former “Reach” brush. It had a full brush head with 5 rows of hard bristles and a protruding tip that reached difficulty places on my teeth or gums. It also had a longer flexible handle. The new brush has stiff bristles a hollow center and a shorter non flexible handle. It cleans well but only with a lot more effort. It does nor deserve more than three.</li>
    <li> Crap - not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but squishy soft.  Testament to the near-total control the corrupt American Dental Association has over dental supply &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; industry in this country.  Ended up buying &#x27;smokers toothbrushes&#x27; from another country for chrissake.  Reach is actually against you, like so many companies.</li>
    <li> Great brushes always order these when I need new tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> yes I love it thank you to carry this toothbrush</li>
    <li> Your brushes were shipped to France, and they are very satisfied with them.&lt;br /&gt;So when they wear them out if ever, I will order some more.</li>
    <li> At last, a toothbrush that does the trick!</li>
    <li> as described therefore fully meeting expectations&lt;br /&gt;arrived well packaged and on time&lt;br /&gt;my thanks</li>
    <li> All products arrived as described and are to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;115-3812026-5498618</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hard/firm...this is as close as I have been able to find....so far.  They are really neither (hard nor firm) and breakdown rather quickly....but that said....they are still a decent value</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find firm heads in the store so now I have stocked up on a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> pretty good, nice and hard.</li>
    <li> I actually feel clean when I use Firm toothbrushes. This is a great one. Been using for years now.</li>
    <li> Great product I really like stuff toothbrushes that makes sure my teeth is squeaky clean</li>
    <li> These are my favorite, but hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> These were mislabeled.The label said they were soft, we wanted firm which was upsetting, almost sent them back, but found them to be firm anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the few people who prefers a firm toothbrush which are impossible to find anywhere. These are great and I received them in just three days.</li>
    <li> hard to find these firm toothbrushes - great price.</li>
    <li> Glad to get these.  Just like old times.  Clean teeth!</li>
    <li> NO GRIP  on handle of toothbrush.  When brushing teeth  TOO slippery !! PUT AN ANTI SLIP GRIP AROUND THE HANDLE&lt;br /&gt;and charge 10 more pennies.  PLEASE IMPROVE QUALITY OF PRODUCT......!!!</li>
    <li> They are excellent , the brand is unique. We recommend them. These kind of toothbrushes are scarse in PR, they are not available in our market.</li>
