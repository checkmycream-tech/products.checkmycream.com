    <li> Very misleading...not a bumper sticker at all. It is tiny!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.  Product looks like it was printed on a home office printer with sticker paper.  Definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> It was just a regular sticker when I got it and I was pretty mad that I paid that much for nothing.</li>
    <li> It states the size in the description yet I had not noticed it, it was a lot smaller than i thought it would be, good quality</li>
    <li> Very small sticker. It&#x27;s a very poor quality sticker. In the item title it said bumper sticker and it&#x27;s ridiculously small. I regret the price I paid for the shipping to get this crappy sticker. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so little!!!!! I was expecting it to be a little bit larger, but it still looks cute on my car.</li>
    <li> Way too small for the outrageous amount of shipping they bill you with. The use of this sticker is now impractical.</li>

    <li> Holy moly was this a lot smaller than I had anticipated. Beautiful sticker just too small.</li>
    <li> Ugh the sticker is so tiny, the sellers said it was a lot bigger. But I ended up getting over the size issue. So I put it on my laptop instead of my car. Well when I was taking it off the paper, it ripped on the corner a little. But again, I got over it. Then the sticky part of the sticker was completely gone.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it looks like, but it was about 2 inches long...</li>
