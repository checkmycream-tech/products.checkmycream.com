      <li>it depends on what kind of hair you have?</li>
      <li>and I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>my wife uses it, she loves it as her hair is very fine</li>
      <li>I used to sell hair care products and have tried many styling products in my time.</li>
      <li>so I started using a bit more each time.</li>
      <li>and when he is out OMG we I have to pay more for 1 day delivery then</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
      <li>I use Thicket (perfect name by the way) on the front and low and behold I have bangs that you can&#x27;t see my scalp!!!!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Used it a while back and found it to be the best hair thickener out there, but it disappeared from stores.</li>
      <li>My hair does feel thicker, and it is much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Works okay to help hair  hold the style.</li>
      <li>thicket is a greatc hair thickener I love it</li>
      <li>I wanted more body for my hair, so I ordered Thicket.  </li>
      <li>all of my hair to make sure that it&#x27;s all distributed evenly.</li>
      <li>I was glad to see Thicket was available again after many years.</li>
      <li>And for goodness sakes, play around with the amount you use to fine YOUR magic amount.  </li>

      <li>so I feel comfortable writing a review.  </li>
      <li>the tube it comes in has gotten much smaller but  all in all still a great product for the money.</li>
      <li>[Original Review]  </li>
      <li>and it really helps thicken it as if she had more hair</li>
      <li>The product is not as good as it says, it makes ur hair flat</li>
      <li>I quickly brush (not comb)</li>
      <li>I still have not found that magic amount that will look noticeable and not horrible at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Thicket will not give you more hair or make new hair grow but it will give your fine hair  the &#x27;appearance&#x27; of having more volume than it actually does.</li>
      <li>This product is superior to any other I have tried throughout the years.  </li>
      <li>I am 70 yrs old and have fine hair and also thinning in the front from medication.</li>
      <li>Even better if you have short hair.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the final result.</li>
      <li>I should also note that you will most definitely want to wash your hair that night</li>
      <li>While I still stand by the statement that if you use just a bit too much of this product, you&#x27;ll be wanting to wash your hair right away, as it clumps together and makes your hair feel coated in a layer of yuck; I must also say that after learning to properly use Thicket and finding that magic amount and application method, I now feel lost without it.    </li>
      <li>I used it once and find the ISO Pomade a better product for my hair, which has been colored since I was 13 years old and is naturally curly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on wet hair and dry-seems to work better for me when I use it on damp hair right before a blow out.  </li>
      <li>The first bit I quickly spread across my fingertips and then through all of the hair near my scalp, then I take another pea sized amount of the product and run it through the length of my hair.</li>
      <li>I (along with probably many women who have thinning hair) do not like to wash every single day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using this product for now, and only really use it sparingly on special occasions.</li>
      <li>this is the only one that I really feel comfortable with...</li>
      <li>So if it makes your hair greasy, you have used too much.  </li>
      <li>I had thought that thicket products had gone out of business years ago,but I came across it on amazon,where else?it still works very well but not as well as 30 years ago,perhaps because,  </li>
      <li>Used really sparingly, it seems to thicken the hair.</li>
      <li>The next few times I used it I tried to find that magic amount that would make my hair feel thicker but not at the expense of looking like healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>Really nothing to rave about.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really add a whole lot of hair volume.</li>
      <li>You just have to decide whether or not you want to wash your hair more frequently just to use this product and trade your natural texture of soft and shiny with straw-like and sticky.  </li>
      <li>Has a texture that seems to coat the hair, and makes it lift away from the other hair causing it to look like there&#x27;s more volume.  </li>
      <li>With most products when you first try them out, you think you wasted your money.  </li>
      <li>It looks totally natural and my hair styles exactly the way I want.</li>
      <li>This works great for me as I only use a small amount and only put it on the ends of my hair, keeping it away from the scalp.  </li>
      <li>I cannot live without this product now.</li>
      <li>like it so far!</li>
      <li>The next few times I left my hair more wet and used more throughout.  </li>
      <li>the look is totally natural.</li>
      <li>It gives me a natural fuller head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
      <li>Good for my white hair getting thin strands.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I had only a little left, so I ordered more from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>At first I erred on the side of caution and used very little because some of the reviews talked about greasy or straw-like hair if too much was used.  </li>
      <li>It works instantly and makes my hair look thick and healthy.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and have tried many products....</li>
      <li>I blow dry upside down at first and voila!</li>
      <li>I first got Thicket a few years ago, but thought it made my hair greasy.  </li>
      <li>At least for the better part of the day, my hair feels thick and normal once again!     </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change, so perhaps I used too little.  </li>

<li> We like it , it only takes a very small amount.</li>
<li> I have much less hair then 30 years ago.</li>
<li> The first thing I noticed before any change of thickness was that my hair felt straw-like and dirty.  </li>
<li> After using it I&#x27;ve seen some slight improvement with hair seems a little fuller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my wife uses it, she loves it as her hair is very fine and it really helps thicken it as if she had more hair</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product.Seems I couldn&#x27;t see any change in my hair but, I only used thicket 1 time.I will try it again soon to see if I can tell any difference.</li>
    <li> I wanted more body for my hair, so I ordered Thicket.  I didn&#x27;t find the product satisfactory for my needs.  It was too sticky and gooyee for my hair.  I hope I can return it.  I used it once and find the ISO Pomade a better product for my hair, which has been colored since I was 13 years old and is naturally curly.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. After using it I&#x27;ve seen some slight improvement with hair seems a little fuller. Really nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> I have been using Thicket for about a month and I must say it is terrific. It looks totally natural and my hair styles exactly the way I want. What&#x27;s more is that a little bit goes a long way. I have thin hair and have tried many products....this is the only one that I really feel comfortable with...the look is totally natural.</li>
    <li> Works okay to help hair  hold the style. Best if used on wet hair. Even better if you have short hair. (Unfortunately I have long hair)</li>
    <li> Maybe it works for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it depends on what kind of hair you have?</li>
    <li> the product was not sticky and worked for me.  I recommend that you brush your hair thoroughly after applying -</li>
    <li> I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review.  At first I erred on the side of caution and used very little because some of the reviews talked about greasy or straw-like hair if too much was used.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference so I started using a bit more each time. I can now say I found that &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; amount that works for my hair, which is not only thinning but the hair I do have is baby fine.  I put a nickel  sized dab on my towel dried hair and blow dry it.  I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron on it unless I choose to.  I love the way it makes my hair look.  Your hair won&#x27;t FEEL thicker, but it WILL look fuller as the product claims.  I say... give it a try and buy a tube.  And for goodness sakes, play around with the amount you use to fine YOUR magic amount.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have limp and thinning hair.  Thicket gives my hair good body and ease in styling.  Best product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> thicket is a greatc hair thickener I love it and I have very fine hair and it works great on my hair</li>
    <li> Not empressed,wat too costly for the quality of the product. Will not purchase again. An off the shelf product would have worked just as well.</li>
    <li> Thicket will not give you more hair or make new hair grow but it will give your fine hair  the &#x27;appearance&#x27; of having more volume than it actually does. I love it. I even use it with other hair products. Don&#x27;t be afraid to play around with it until you find the feel and look you like--but be realistic about it - nothing will hide our lost hair.</li>
    <li> Thicket is the best hair thickener on the market! It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes your hair look fuller and thicker. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this one seems to be the best.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time and when I renew thicket I do find Amazon gives me the best price.</li>
    <li> We like it , it only takes a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have hair that has been slowly thinning for years.  This product thickens the hair fibers  covering up tyhe thin hairs.</li>
    <li> I had thought that thicket products had gone out of business years ago,but I came across it on amazon,where else?it still works very well but not as well as 30 years ago,perhaps because,  I have much less hair then 30 years ago. the tube it comes in has gotten much smaller but  all in all still a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> The product is not as good as it says, it makes ur hair flat and i didnt really se a huge improvement in the thickening of my hair. Not satisfied with the product at all...</li>
    <li> This works great for me as I only use a small amount and only put it on the ends of my hair, keeping it away from the scalp.  It does a good job so start with a small amount and increase it as needed.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Just takes a little bit on wet hair - follow directions and let air dry.  Thickness of hair and manageability greatly improved.  Use it every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thicket for a week now.  I put a dab in my hair after showering.  My hair does feel thicker, and it is much more manageable.  I do not need to use any hair gel.  It gives me a natural fuller head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I used to sell hair care products and have tried many styling products in my time.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on earth for my dad he is addicted to it lol all he does is order and order it and when he is out OMG we I have to pay more for 1 day delivery then the product lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times and it seems to make my hair look and feel thicker.  I did not have the greasy mess some complained about if anything it made my hair a little dry.  Certainly a little goes a long way.  This last time I used it in conjunction with Mane hair thickening spray and some fiber sprinkles.  Nothing helps my thin area in front but the rest of my hair looks like it is thick.  I am pleased with the final result.</li>
    <li> Yes it does make your hair feel thicker and you only need just a small amount in the palm of your hand. It also keeps your hair in place and doesn&#x27;t blow about. Very good, I have to say.</li>
    <li> This product is superior to any other I have tried throughout the years.  It works instantly and makes my hair look thick and healthy.</li>
    <li> *Edit/Update*: My initial review was left just after a handful of uses. While I still stand by the statement that if you use just a bit too much of this product, you&#x27;ll be wanting to wash your hair right away, as it clumps together and makes your hair feel coated in a layer of yuck; I must also say that after learning to properly use Thicket and finding that magic amount and application method, I now feel lost without it.    I started using a pea sized amount on significantly wet hair just out of the shower (I should also note that while my hair is very thin, it is quite long, just to give you an idea of how much product goes how far). The first bit I quickly spread across my fingertips and then through all of the hair near my scalp, then I take another pea sized amount of the product and run it through the length of my hair. I quickly brush (not comb) all of my hair to make sure that it&#x27;s all distributed evenly. I blow dry upside down at first and voila! At least for the better part of the day, my hair feels thick and normal once again!     I cannot live without this product now. I have had days where I was either not feeling well or just too tired to take the extra steps to style my hair, and I am almost terrified at the difference I see when I do not use Thicket. I&#x27;d tell anyone interested in trying this product to expect awesome results once they master the application (which after years of doing, is like second-nature to me now!).      [Original Review]  I have used this 5+ times now so I feel comfortable writing a review.  The instructions say to use on damp hair, so the first time I used a small amount on towel dried hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change, so perhaps I used too little.  The next few times I left my hair more wet and used more throughout.  The first thing I noticed before any change of thickness was that my hair felt straw-like and dirty.  After blow drying I did notice my hair felt coarser, but at the expense of looking like horrible hair.The next few times I used it I tried to find that magic amount that would make my hair feel thicker but not at the expense of looking like healthy hair.  I still have not found that magic amount that will look noticeable and not horrible at the same time.  I should also note that you will most definitely want to wash your hair that night if not first thing the next day when using Thicket because your hair will likely start to clump together after sleeping with it in.    Bottom line is that this product can and will do what it says.  You just have to decide whether or not you want to wash your hair more frequently just to use this product and trade your natural texture of soft and shiny with straw-like and sticky.  I (along with probably many women who have thinning hair) do not like to wash every single day.  I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using this product for now, and only really use it sparingly on special occasions.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say this is a miracle for thinning hair, but it does help a little.  I put it on after shampooing, before blow-drying, and it it does enhance my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I first got Thicket a few years ago, but thought it made my hair greasy.  Recently I tried it again, but this time I used only a very little dab between my thumb and fingers and rubbed it on my hair in the vicinity of my cowlick when my hair was dry or partially dry.  It worked well. I had only a little left, so I ordered more from Amazon.  So if it makes your hair greasy, you have used too much.  Used really sparingly, it seems to thicken the hair.</li>
    <li> Has a texture that seems to coat the hair, and makes it lift away from the other hair causing it to look like there&#x27;s more volume.  I&#x27;ve tried it on wet hair and dry-seems to work better for me when I use it on damp hair right before a blow out.  Helps with flyaways for the hair on the sides of my head, that&#x27;s getting pretty thin.  With most products when you first try them out, you think you wasted your money.  Try it out a few times, wet or dry, a little or a little more.  I like it well enough to place my second order/tube.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see Thicket was available again after many years. Used it a while back and found it to be the best hair thickener out there, but it disappeared from stores.</li>
    <li> I am 70 yrs old and have fine hair and also thinning in the front from medication. I use Thicket (perfect name by the way) on the front and low and behold I have bangs that you can&#x27;t see my scalp!!!! Does not damage hair in any way. And in between washings or a pick me up just wet and blow dry.</li>
    <li> Product was somewhat helpful. Didn&#x27;t really add a whole lot of hair volume.</li>
    <li> Good for my white hair getting thin strands.  especially on top.</li>
