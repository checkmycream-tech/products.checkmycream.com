      <li>This shampoo is absolutely fabulous for the summer months.</li>
      <li>This is great shampoo, especially for frizz control.</li>
      <li>It cleans nicely and rinses well - my husband really loves it for rinsing clean while leaving his hair</li>
      <li>Then I realized I really didn&#x27;t have to squeeze the bottle too much and the perfect amount came out with no waste.  </li>

      <li>This shampoo works best if your hair is dry to normal.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s tried tar shampoos and medicated shampoos and most don&#x27;t really help.  </li>
      <li>It creates a nice sudsy foam during wash, and rinses complete.</li>
      <li>Some frizz-control shampoos work by weighing down the hair more, but this shampoo still gives good volume to your hair.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up really well and rinses very clean.  </li>

      <li>Super bonus</li>
      <li>It smells fine, her hair looks clean and shiny, and the cost is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and</li>
      <li>They both have the same pleasant (lightly floral) fragrance and are a decent consistency.</li>
      <li>They worked easily into my hair and rinsed out completely, leaving my hair feeling clean and free of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight with no residue, and it leaves my naturally curly hair feeling light, clean, and fresh.</li>
      <li>so when I saw the commercials for this shampoo stated your hair starts with the right scalp I said that makes since</li>
      <li>My impression after the very first wash was that my hair actually did seem better when I combined the two products, rather than using one of them alone.</li>
      <li>The best thing I have found so far to deal with my miserably thick, frizz prone hair.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo does a great job of knocking down the frizz, and also cleans well enough to let me go two days between washing, which not all hair products can manage and is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely fresh but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger other than your hair just smelling clean.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is pleasantly scented, though not strongly scented.  </li>
      <li>Mounds of foam, more often than not, mean clogged pipes, drain issues, and unnecessary foaming agents that are best left out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike most Americans, I do not equate mounds of foam with deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>Subsequent shampoos saw more frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of frizz control - the first couple of times I used this</li>
      <li>the Clear Frizz control is fantastic.</li>
      <li>My hair lays smooth when in use along with [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy</li>
      <li>I was able to restore the shine with a blow dry and some Chi silk, but it sold be nice to air dry and have great-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been a fan of the Clear brand since I tried my first shampoo and conditioner over a year ago. For whatever reason, the Clear brand has done wonders for my dry, dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of fuzzies and flyaways on the top of my head. Maybe I put my reading glasses up there too often or maybe I just have too many rough ends up there. But I seem to wear a cap of fuzz on top of my head. Needless to say I was excited to try out Clear&#x27;s Scalp and Hair Therapy Frizz Control Shampoo in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work or how I would see if there was a difference but it was noticeably different on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they do but somehow, it works. My hair was smooth and easy to style on top. My frizz had settled down and my hair is really silky smooth. I know that terminology is overused but I keep running my hands through my hair telling everyone how nice it feels. Seriously. I was that goofy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend this for anyone with fuzzy, frizzy hair. It did a wonderful job for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried several offerings from the Clear line of products. The theory is that they nourish the scalp resulting in healthier hair. Mostly I have not been impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Clear Frizz control is fantastic. The shampoo is rich and spreads easily so that you are not using tons. It smells lovely fresh but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger other than your hair just smelling clean. I take cold showers and the shampoo still gets my hair clean and rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair ready for conditioning but not stripped.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pleasantly scented, though not strongly scented.  It&#x27;s a fresh smell, it&#x27;s neither masculine or feminine to me.  Just nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The lather is rich and fairly tight - it&#x27;s best to add a bit of extra water after lathering it up so it flows through the hair more freely.  It does leave my scalp feeling very clean and..well, nice.  It leaves my hair shiny and feels clean, and I&#x27;ve not felt like it&#x27;s left any build up on it.  My hair does not tangle a lot using this product line, and I&#x27;ve got very long, waist length hair, and if a product has a lot of build up, it will contribute to tangles.&lt;br /&gt;It reduces frizz well.  I use a serum sometimes but find I can leave it off if I use BOTH the shampoo and conditioner with this line.  It leaves hair soft, gently fragrant, but it&#x27;s definitely not a volumizing shampoo.  I find it pulls a bit of the natural wave out of my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels as if it has some sort of an oil in it. It coats your hair and I found myself working really hard to rinse it all out. Even after getting out of the shower I still felt like my hair had shampoo in it. Well after drying and styling my hair it looked great! Only problem was, It started to look dirty only hours later. I think this shampoo might work for people with thick hair, but my fine hair did not like this at all.</li>
    <li> I had been trying the corresponding Clear conditioner for a few weeks (with a different shampoo) before my shampoo ran out and I switched to this matching Clear one. My impression after the very first wash was that my hair actually did seem better when I combined the two products, rather than using one of them alone. The difference apparently wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough that I remembered it after that first time, though. Already by the second wash, I felt like my hair was pretty much the same as with any other shampoo-conditioner combination. It didn&#x27;t become unusually smooth. This is a fine product, but for me at least it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair.  This particular shampoo is just not a good match for my hair type.  Even after thoroughly rinsing, I could feel a greasy residue in my hair and on my scalp.  I only used this shampoo for 2 days, and my hair looked limp and greasy both days.  On the 3rd day, I used a clarifying shampoo to finally rid myself of the residue.  This shampoo would probably be better suited to a person with thicker, coarser hair than my own.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to use this shampoo and its coordinating conditioner every day for an extended period of time, but it is nice for incorporating into a rotation of products. It cleans nicely and rinses well - my husband really loves it for rinsing clean while leaving his hair fluffier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only nitpick about it is that you are not going to dunk your hair under the shower stream for a second and start lathering with this. I needed to have my hair 100% saturated to get a lather going. One does expect this to an extent, but less thick shampoos provide a little leeway if you want to start scrubbing while the water runs over the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of frizz control - the first couple of times I used this it left my hair pretty smooth. Subsequent shampoos saw more frizz.</li>
    <li> I like the Clear line of hair products, so I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner. The two of them together made my hair flat and rather oily, so I tried just the shampoo and got the same result. This shampoo works best if your hair is dry to normal. It has a very nice fragrance.  I gave this bottle to my husband who has thick coarse wavy black hair, and he really likes this product. He says it makes his hair softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> shampoo smells great, and leaves hair soft and dandruff free. It also helps to smooth frizzy hair which is a plus for dandruff shampoo</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly Italian hair.  I have been fighting with frizz since I became owner and caretaker of my own head (prior to age 11 my mother&#x27;s solution to keeping the frizz and curls under control was to keep it cut short as a boy).  I have been on a mission to find a low maintenance, affordable product to tame the curls and frizz.  The only process I have found so far has been about a 6 product one involving shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and at least 2 anti-frizz serums and a finishing creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical before trying the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control shampoo.  I only wash my hair 3 times a week because of the tedious drying and flat-ironing process.  So, I can&#x27;t use anything that is really going to cause build-up.  When I first opened the shampoo bottle and dispensed the product I had to look at the bottle more closely to make sure it was the shampoo and not conditioner.  It had a thicker, white, creamy consistency one normally sees in conditioner.  At first I felt like the product dispensed too slowly.  Then I realized I really didn&#x27;t have to squeeze the bottle too much and the perfect amount came out with no waste.  There are a lot of bottle designs out there that cause the product to come out in a gloppy mess with a lot of waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t really offer a lot of lather and you do need to use a fair amount of water while applying in order to get it evenly distributed.  I noticed other reviewers have stated that it is quite sudsy.  To those I say, you are applying it too vigorously and aggressively.  Pay attention the next time you are in a professional salon...you don&#x27;t plop it on the top of your head and then go to town with the scrubbing...that is what leads to hair breakage!  It rinses out easily with some finger combing.  There might be a little more effort required than of other shampoos but the end result is worth it.  Clear Scalp has a mild fragrance.  I like that.  With all the products one uses on a daily basis, you don&#x27;t want your shampoo and conditioner competing with the lotions, deodorants and colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frizz control is really the most important factor for me.  This product really came through for me.  It seemed to coat my hair strands with a sealer of some sort without it feeling like it was coated.  In combination with the Clear Scalp Beauty Nourishing Conditioner, I did not need any extra anti-frizz serum.  Considering the reasonable price of the Clear Scalp and the fact that I won&#x27;t be spending money on a lot of additional anti-frizz products, I am going to be saving a lot of money.  Clear Scalp is going on my regular shampoo and conditioner purchase list.the products one uses on a daily basis, you don&#x27;t want your shampoo and conditioner competing with the lotions, deodorants and colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frizz control is really the most important factor for me.

    <li> A great shampoo for a good price. I normally get a cheaper priced shampoo, but I think this is certainly worth it.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo, especially for frizz control. It has a very pleasant and feminine-type scent while in use. It is not overwhelming at all and doesnt last very long after shower. It does a great job at lathering quickly.My wife &amp; especially my daughter, has alot of frizz in her hair and this shampoo did very well to tame it. Before this she was using a kids mousse (Suave Suave Kids Cherry Vanilla Bop Mousse) which also did a good job taming frizz. I think its better and quicker to have a shampoo do this for you though. Overall we can definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different formulas in this line of shampoos and conditioners.  They all work nicely, and this one was no exception.  It cleaned my hair well, and it was easy to work through my hair.  As far as anti-frizz goes, I&#x27;m not convinced that this is any better than any other shampoo.  I&#x27;ve got some frizz issues and I still needed to use an anti-frizz serum.  Still, it wasn&#x27;t detrimental.  The scent is a generic sort of fresh-shampoo scent.  All in all, this shampoo provides good value, and is a good choice if you&#x27;re looking for a drugstore shampoo.</li>
    <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a semi-arid climate where the humidity is low, and the air can be even more dry during the winter, leaving both my hair more frizzy and harder to control.  This frizz-control shampoo has a nice mild floral fragrance that is not too strong and overpowering.  It lathers up really well and rinses very clean.  Some frizz-control shampoos work by weighing down the hair more, but this shampoo still gives good volume to your hair.  Everyone&#x27;s hair chemistry, thickness, and texture can be different, so I really do not think that there is a one-size-fits-all shampoo or conditioner that works well with every hair.  I think that this shampoo works best on thicker hair that is not as oily.  If your hair is thinner/finer or more oily, it may not work as well.</li>
    <li> cleans my hair but like any other shampoo but doesn&#x27;t tame down the frizz like it says that it will.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo I also use the conditioner. I use to try so many different shampoos I even developed dandruff and itchy scalp so I switched to a dandruff shampoo. still suffered and it wouldn&#x27;t clear up. knew I had to find another shampoo so when I saw the commercials for this shampoo stated your hair starts with the right scalp I said that makes since so I bought it and yes its awesome. I started noticing the difference about after a week my itch and dandruff went bye bye and this isn&#x27;t a dandruff shampoo I know they have the clear dandruff shampoo but figure this is working why change. Super bonus it makes my hair really shinny although it suppose to help with frizz I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair any less frizzy when using the other clear shampoos. yes I&#x27;ve used the dry hair clear shampoo and color treat shampoo from clear just got this frizz one because of cheaper than the dry hair but I do think they all are similar in ingredient. all in all this shampoo is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo says that it has \\&quot;vitamins and nutrients formulated to improve the strength and appearance of hair. For frizzy and hard-to-manage locks, this shampoo provides 24-hour frizz control\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, it was a very windy day and I have to admit that there seemed to be less of a &#x60;halo&#x27; of loose hair around my head when I came inside, but other than that one day, it seems to be no different from any other shampoos that I use, many of which are less expensive per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;The exception is the bottle. It seems to be made so that you can stand it upside down so that you can get all of the shampoo out. That is great with the exception that it then leaks a bit and you wind up with the bottle standing in a pool of slippery shampoo.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Smells great and not strong or overwhelming.  It leaves my hair smooth and more alive.  It is very concentrated, a small goop will give you a lot of suds.  No frizz, I have short medium hair but my wife has hers below the shoulders, and it does give her volume without the knots.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about the science behind the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy brand but this shampoo does seem to cut down on the frizz that often comes with humid summer days.  I have only used the shampoo with the conditioner that is manufactured by the same company so I can&#x27;t vouch for how well the shampoo performs by itself.  This seems to be a fairly priced and reasonably effective smoothing shampoo that I would order again.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use caused hairloss in clumps. Read reviews &amp; you&#x27;ll see many complaints of hairloss. Unilever also manufacterd A \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; product with complaints of hairloss. They settled a 10.2 million dollar lawsuit over. Rebranding? Avoid being hysterical over hairloss. Or your wife &amp; daughter being hysterical as is my case. The deserve 10.2 million negative stars.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair that I round brush to shape and smooth, and I&#x27;m always looking for hair products to help make this job easier. This shampoo does a great job of knocking down the frizz, and also cleans well enough to let me go two days between washing, which not all hair products can manage and is a huge plus. Overall, I definitely recommend this shampoo and will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Clear shampoo but this was the first time I&#x27;ve used the Frizz Control kind. And I have to say that it really works. Usually when I wash my hair it frizzes up a lot once it&#x27;s dry but when I used this product I no longer had that problem. I highly recommend it. This is truly a salon brand like product at a very low price</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Clear Scalp and Hair line of products for a while now and they seem to work fine. This Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo performs as you&#x27;d expect it to. It&#x27;s got a pleasant light scent, lathers nicely and washes out well. The frizz control elements are decent, but not as good as higher end products. Still, it&#x27;s a quality shampoo that we will continue using.</li>
    <li> I nearly used this whole bottle up, and it never really helped with frizz control. The only change I did see with this Shampoo is I started to get dry skin. It first started at the top of my forehead right where my hair line starts, then a week later I started getting dry skin at my hair line by my ears. I have never had this problem before with any other shampoo. It dries up my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it dries up my scalp, and does do what it claims which is control the frizz...plus it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest either. Just smells like chemical soap.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely fabulous for the summer months. It&#x27;s lightweight with no residue, and it leaves my naturally curly hair feeling light, clean, and fresh. It creates a nice sudsy foam during wash, and rinses complete. Great product.</li>
    <li> The best thing I have found so far to deal with my miserably thick, frizz prone hair.  I look forward to having this in my shower as I approach the winter months.</li>
    <li> I have relatively dry, frizz-prone hair. I ordered this product along with the coordinating [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together I found these products to work well. They both have the same pleasant (lightly floral) fragrance and are a decent consistency. They worked easily into my hair and rinsed out completely, leaving my hair feeling clean and free of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon blow-drying my hair there was a noticeable difference in softness and a notable decrease in frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t say these products completely eliminate frizz but they definitely help to reduce it. I also noticed my scalp was less dry while using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this shampoo and will be using it again. Great product!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like to spend much on shampoos - I&#x27;ve always felt that it was in the conditioner that I&#x27;d find my frizz control.  But I found using this Clear shampoo combined with other conditions including the Clear Conditioner did allow me to go a day without putting in extra leave in conditioners afterwards.  I was less likely to have my hair frizz up into a poodle by mid day on a humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the soft scents in the clear products.  They feel less flowery or chemical-like.</li>
    <li> Our daughter was complaining that some of the other shampoos and conditioners were leaving her hair flat.  How a 9-year old gets into thinking that her hair is flat is another story, but there you go.  This shampoo and conditioner does a good job, in her words \\&quot;it smells nice, and leaves my hair normal\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product got a \\&quot;Mom, please buy more\\&quot; from my daughter, the Frizz Factory.  She has rejected dozens of products, so this recommendation is not to be overlooked.  She has two requirements for hair products - frizz control, and the ability to comb hair after shampooing, so I&#x27;ll add the other details.  It smells fine, her hair looks clean and shiny, and the cost is reasonable. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the frizz control conditioner by the same company, and I liked it for the most part. It was easy to apply and easy to rinse off. It does have a pretty heavy odor, so if that is not something you like, beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry without any other products in it to see what it looked like. My hair definitely felt clean, and on the second day, there was still no buildup which I tend to get from products like Dove. There was also no frizz, and it has been very humid in my area. The one thing I am not happy with is the lack of shine in my hair. It did such a great job of cleaning that it took away the shine. I was able to restore the shine with a blow dry and some Chi silk, but it sold be nice to air dry and have great-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was still pleased with this product and would buy it.</li>
    <li> My wife has a lot of issue with shampoos causing her scalp to break out, and cause a lot of itchiness.  She&#x27;s tried tar shampoos and medicated shampoos and most don&#x27;t really help.  Most shampoos cause aggravation and make it worse, however this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make it any worse, which means she can use it on a daily basis.  It also works well for controlling most of the frizz.  This will be on her shopping list when she runs out.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works fine.  I found it to be more moisturizing than other shampoos I have used.  The texture is creamy and has floral scent.  Shampoos lathers well. I like the frizz control. My wife and i used this shampoo together.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair frizzes are gone forever, but Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control does a nice job at an almost unbelievably low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a pretty scent (the more expensive ones I use almost never have a scent you want!), and it&#x27;s very thick. You definitely can water this down by a quarter and have a shampoo that isn&#x27;t such a chore to suds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dry/normal, and it worked well using it for every third shampoo (I&#x27;m a big believer in rotating shampoos and clarifying once a month.) Nice in combo with the conditioner, of which I use very little to ensure that my hair isn&#x27;t the bad opposite of frizzy - that is, flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your frizz woes won&#x27;t be over forever, but it&#x27;s a good shampoo/conditioner set for your rotation.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this shampoo (or the conditioner).  It felt heavy, over-scented, and did not really help my hair at all.  I look like a poodle in Florida humidity, and this shampoo did not help to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work if your hair is shorter, but long long hair like mine - no thanks.</li>
    <li> Unlike most Americans, I do not equate mounds of foam with deep cleaning. Mounds of foam, more often than not, mean clogged pipes, drain issues, and unnecessary foaming agents that are best left out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember all those old sitcoms of the 60s and 70s? I think every single one, at one time or another, had an eppisode where a washing machine or tub exploded with a roomful of white foam.&lt;br /&gt;I think of those with every shampoo using Clear Scalp Frizz Control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is lovely, the scent nice and light. Cleanses well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful or your head will look like the Brady&#x27;s laundry room on Alice&#x27;s day off.</li>
    <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo]] along with the [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner]].  My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and also color treated.  With this shampoo I have found that it&#x27;s best for me to use it every other day, while conditioning every day.  I have noticed a bit less frizz in my hair, which is most likely from my hair being less dried out.  This shampoo also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and the price isn&#x27;t so high that I can&#x27;t afford for it to be my regular brand.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different Clear products and have been impressed with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair, sensitive to a lot of products, and don&#x27;t like scented products.  Clear products don&#x27;t irritate my skin, scalp or noose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cleans well without being harsh to my hair.  While my hair may not get fizzy it does have lots of \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;.  My hair lays smooth when in use along with [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
