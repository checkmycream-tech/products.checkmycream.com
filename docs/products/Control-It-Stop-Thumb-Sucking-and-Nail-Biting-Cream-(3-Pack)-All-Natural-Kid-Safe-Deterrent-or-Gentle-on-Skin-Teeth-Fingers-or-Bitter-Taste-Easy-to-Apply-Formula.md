      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>

      <li>Having bitten my nails for most of my life, this is turning out to be wonderful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m growing my own nails!</li>
      <li>The flavor is strong, it lasts, and the nutrients are excellent for your nails.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good start.</li>
      <li>I have bit my nails since I could remember so probably a good 27+years.</li>
      <li>This would be good for kids who bite their nails or even suck their thumbs or fingers.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>guess just use caution since it&#x27;s a good hunk of money</li>
      <li>She is waking up so refreshed and happy, and has a much more pleasant disposition throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>He took a lick and said it tasted \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; but his reaction was mild at best</li>
      <li>and I am VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it is very healthy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT AND JUST BOUGHT MORE!!</li>
      <li>And I love it!</li>
      <li>Adults who want beautiful nails again, it is so worth it!</li>
      <li>If you stay with it, this can be effective.</li>
      <li>I even tried putting a heavier amount on my own nails, yet caught myself biting my nails within 20min of applying it.  </li>
      <li>There was no hope of him re-applying on his own at school.  </li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but the cream is a lot more effective than the nail polish products out there.</li>
      <li>It works nearly TOO GOOD!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and does exactly what it should.</li>
      <li>At our wits end, I was going to order a vinyl glove to put over her fingers, when I saw the Control-It Cream, and I wondered if it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>It was cool and my fingers looked good...</li>
      <li>It was cool and my fingers looked good...</li>
      <li>I regressed like many others have, no doubt.</li>
      <li>It is now more opaque than before</li>
      <li>My nails have never looked better.  </li>
      <li>After 1 application on my nail-biting son, he quit, begging me not to put any more on (I did for a week.)   </li>
      <li>Many Mavala Stop</li>
      <li>, so I opted for this one which didn&#x27;t have quite as many \\&quot;throw up\\&quot; reviews.  </li>
      <li>It had worked for so many people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>in disgust he says no!  :)</li>
      <li>The Mavala Stop is way better, it lets you brush it on like nail polish</li>
      <li>It is much better than the paint on, nail polish type stuff.  </li>
      <li>so sent me some more</li>
      <li>Neither Mother nor wife has been able to dissuade me from my mission of nail biting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I regressed like many others have, no doubt.</li>
      <li>Most of the products yellowed the nails, and washed off every time you washed your hands.  </li>
      <li>BUT I don&#x27;t bite my nails and they are beginning to look pretty good.</li>
      <li>It washes off really, really easily.  </li>
      <li>(The nail polish stuff is too easy to pick off and remove.)</li>
      <li>but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well.  </li>
      <li>She is so proud of herself and her accomplishments, and both have received several rewards along the way.  </li>
      <li>I wish you all the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CJyour path to success prematurely!</li>
      <li>Simple and effective!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, do not stop your path to success prematurely!</li>
      <li>this product is good in general.</li>
      <li>I was really excited when I saw this online</li>
      <li>and I just got the jars because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t need the special packs</li>
      <li>Right?!</li>
      <li>and I was right!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash right off, it remains strong and true, and does the job it is intended to do.  </li>
      <li>Thanks very much, the product is doing its effect with accuracy and my nails are growing nice.</li>
      <li>I thought that I had not put enough on, but I ended up just putting a good amount on my finger and then deliberately licking it off, and it didn&#x27;t taste like anything for me.</li>
      <li>Then we bought this Control-it and it worked very well and lasted most of the day, we applied it in the morning and it lasts until 3 or so even with hand washing.</li>
      <li>I wanted to be sure I really did kick the habbit.  </li>
      <li>Even after washing my hands with soap, the taste of this stuff persists, and it&#x27;s an instant reminder to keep your hands away from your mouth (which is a good thing, if you have a long-standing habit).</li>
      <li>Please stick with this for at least 6 straight weeks to give it the best chance of becoming a healthier habit.</li>
      <li>Please stick with this for at least 6 straight weeks to give it the best chance of becoming a healthier habit.</li>
      <li>It used to be really nice to use, not the taste haha, but now it seems very sticky after applied.</li>
      <li>and it had so many high reviews.</li>
      <li>She was very willing.  </li>
      <li>You have to be very consistent.</li>
      <li>I think it would much too strong for children, and would never suggest putting it on a child&#x27;s nails.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what is says on da tin!</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this product, my fingernails grew out and you know what, I had to CLIP THEM!</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this product, my fingernails grew out and you know what, I had to CLIP THEM!</li>
      <li>Her whole personality has changed!!  </li>
      <li>My only warning is to make sure you wash your nails before eating as you may taste the product in your food (it warns you to do this in the directions, but I didn&#x27;t heed their warning!).  </li>
      <li>With the old formula, after tasting this cream one or two times I was much more resilient to keep my nails out of my mouth, now I have to think about not doing it.</li>
      <li>The 3 jars are actually a good thing too because I have one in my purse, another at work and the other at home...</li>
      <li>(I get hangnails/infections fairly often), and I simply want &#x27;normal&#x27; looking hands.</li>
      <li>it also is hard to get the taste out of your mouth when you do chew and makes it that much more effective.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product for my kids so they would stop the fingernail biting. The reason I bought this was because the taste was supposed to be so bad but both my kids said it didn&#x27;t even taste that bad, so the product didn&#x27;t work at all. I was not able to get a refund for the product because it was past the one month deadline since we were on vacation. What a rip-off.</li>
    <li> As a grown up, I had been biting my nails for 55 years.  It was ugly, embarrassing, and unhealthy.  I have tried everything out there, all the creams, polishes, gloves, rubber tips, you name it.  Most of the products yellowed the nails, and washed off every time you washed your hands.  This stuff is different, it is horrid tasting, and it cued me of my bad habit.  It doesn&#x27;t wash right off, it remains strong and true, and does the job it is intended to do.  It is not for sissies.  It is for adults who really want to break their bad habits.  I think it would much too strong for children, and would never suggest putting it on a child&#x27;s nails.  But, a consenting adult who will remember it is there,  it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff to break a long-time nail biting habit and boy, does it work. The cream itself really does the job of smoothing down and hang-nails. Even after washing my hands with soap, the taste of this stuff persists, and it&#x27;s an instant reminder to keep your hands away from your mouth (which is a good thing, if you have a long-standing habit). It also seems to make my nails grow in stronger. I&#x27;ve used it about two weeks now and can see a definite improvement, much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work.  It washes off really, really easily.  it is also sticky.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  I have been a nailbiter for my whole life, 38 years, and this did not help me at all..I am very dissappointed and will now reorder the Mavala Stop which definately works while using it..!</li>
    <li> You have to constantly reapply this cream...and who wants that cream all over your fingers. It was messy and it didn&#x27;t stop me from biting my nails.  Save your money, buy the nail polish instead.</li>
    <li> For those frustrated parents out there with children that bite their nails? From one that has gnawed his nails down to painful levels (Not even the PAIN, stopped me!) The first thing I have recognized is that the individual MUST WANT TO STOP! That one psychological hurdle has stopped me for 40 years. Neither Mother nor wife has been able to dissuade me from my mission of nail biting.&lt;br /&gt;  Once I decided for myself that it was time to quit, I got this treatment. It works nearly TOO GOOD!!! Only problem that I have now it that I have to make sure that I do not get this stuff on anything other than my nails. I had this on the finger side of my fingertips (opposite of nails...) and tried to eat popcorn and other finger foods. Only took about 3 bites to recognize I could not take the taste (maybe a new dietary tactic?)&lt;br /&gt;  So in conclusion, this stuff REALLY WORKS! Just be careful to only get it on those items you DO NOT WANT Near any taste buds!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried other products without success, but omega 3 comes out on top after just one week using omega3 i stopped biting my nails. i have gone 4 weeks now without even thinking about biting my nails OMEGA3 10 OUT OF 10</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for nearly 20 years and I&#x27;ve tried everything to stop. From the nail paints, to filing them so low you&#x27;d think I couldn&#x27;t bite them, to soaking my fingers in cayenne pepper solution. Nothing worked. I was really excited when I saw this online and it had so many high reviews. It had worked for so many people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t taste the stuff. I thought that I had not put enough on, but I ended up just putting a good amount on my finger and then deliberately licking it off, and it didn&#x27;t taste like anything for me. So it was really expensive and doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m quite disappointed. I tried all three containers (which are much MUCH smaller than I expected) thinking one might have been defective, but none of them tasted like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess just use caution since it&#x27;s a good hunk of money and I noticed other people couldn&#x27;t taste it either.</li>
    <li> I got this for my four year old, it worked like a charm.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  It is much better than the paint on, nail polish type stuff.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this product is good in general. I highly recommend it to those who suck their thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;I bite my nails a lot. This product made me bite my nails less, but it didn&#x27;t stop the habbit completely. Also, at some point I got used to it, so I don&#x27;t feel its bitter much; however this bitter cream could somehow help me remeber to stop biting my nails many times. If this product is helping me *remember* only, then I should figure out a way to remind myself using something else because this product is pretty expensive and becomes useless once I wash my hands (I wash my hands very well and frequently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, my nails grew little bit. Of course they look better than before, but I am very suspecious about the results after few months...</li>
    <li> Our 4 year old son is a nail biter. His fingers were a mess, he would actually bite the skin off of the top of his fingers and his cuticles that were constantly in a state of healing. He regularly complained that his fingers hurt, we tried a few \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; products that either didn&#x27;t work or flaked off, the teachers at his daycare also were not willing to apply this stuff 2-3 times a day. Then we bought this Control-it and it worked very well and lasted most of the day, we applied it in the morning and it lasts until 3 or so even with hand washing. It stayed on his fingers and tastes really nasty but its not toxic. It took about 2 weeks for his nails to heal with applying it twice a day. I would recommend this to anyone with a nail biter or thumb sucker! it works very well.</li>
    <li> If you have a problem with biting your cuticles, this is a great product and helped me stop my bad habit.  It&#x27;s much more expensive than nail-polish type aids, but it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that you can actually put on your skin. It works so well that you&#x27;ll even stop eating finger foods like fries without a fork or knife because you can taste the strong, bitter flavor of the cream.  Highly recommend, the product broke a habit I&#x27;d had for close to twenty years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say they did much for the nails but definitely helps with the habit.&lt;br /&gt;Ps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and a lifetime nail / cuticle biter.  I bought this product not because my hands looked nasty (although they did), but because I was told (twice) that my incessant nail biting was making me look incredibly unprofessional during meetings and actually impacting my career.  Yikes!     This product has cured what endless amounts of money spent on manicures couldn&#x27;t fix - it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and my hands don&#x27;t even go near my mouth.  I&#x27;m rating it 4-stars based on a few caveats:    1)  I didn&#x27;t read carefully and was surprised when the 3 containers arrived - they were tiny!  Each container holds 0.25 oz which is a lot less than what I imagined based on the product picture.  It&#x27;s no big deal, you don&#x27;t need any more.    2)  The horrendous taste lasts for a while, but they do wear off after washing your hands.  I found that the taste became \\&quot;manageable\\&quot; for an addicted biter after about 3 washes.  Be prepared to reapply throughout the day.    3)  The cream is quite sticky.  I&#x27;d apply and then have to wash my hands to remove the stickiness - which obviously counts towards your 3 washes mentioned above.    4)  It could actually impact your meal choices as finger foods become a non-option.    Side note: It did, however, help me stop eating my comfort food of choice - french fries (for now).      All in all, it&#x27;s been a really helpful product for me and should work well for anyone who has a nail biting habit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails and skin surrounding them for my entire life; even with tips, I&#x27;d bite around them.  So I didn&#x27;t have great expectations but after a few tastes of this stuff, I&#x27;m done.  It&#x27;s worked to curb my biting and I&#x27;ve seen less peeling, less chipping and definite growth.  It tastes bad, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
    <li> This product went well beyond my greatest expectations! I would highly recommend it to anyone! I have been biting my nails my entire life and I&#x27;m 45. It just took one time of sticking my finger in my mouth (by accident) and I haven&#x27;t made that mistake again since!!! It&#x27;s not only aversion therapy however, within weeks I could see real growth of \\&quot;real\\&quot; nails, not those thin and pasty things that just tear off. I am in utter awe...and thank the makers of this product from the bottom of my heart!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 24 years. I have tried everything! This is yet another product that failed. The lotion makes your hands feel weird, and whenever you wash them or get them wet, the lotion comes off. I wash my hands several times a day and don&#x27;t have time to keep reapplying this stuff. It also didn&#x27;t taste as bad as the nail polishes so it didn&#x27;t stop me. Def. not worth the money at all. Might work on a young kid who just needs to stop sucking their thumb, but if you&#x27;re a serious nail biter... I would try something else.</li>
    <li> My review isn&#x27;t a good one because I did NOT get what I purchased, 30 dollars later i  have nothing to show for it, not impressed. MY first and last time using amazon.</li>
    <li> This product was very  expensive and did not stop my 5 year old from biting his nails.  I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early thirties and I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried everything: bad tasting nail polish, manicures, band-aids on all my fingers, nail polish, and even some home-made remedies that I have had mediocre success with, at best. It&#x27;s been a little over three weeks and I&#x27;m still not biting my nails -- nor do I have desire to do so. The taste of this stuff is so bad (and it lingers on tongue for so long) that the thought of putting my fingers in my mouth disgusts me.   I highly recommend using a Q-Tip to apply the cream to your fingers, as this stuff gets everywhere. If you get it on your lips, you&#x27;ll be tasting it all day -- which has actually acted as a persistent reminder for me throughout the day not to bite. I highly recommend this product for anyone that has struggled with this habit. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
    <li> This creme is responsible for my 4 year old and myself being able to break our terrible nail biting habits. I don&#x27;t recommend applying it near a meal or snack time though as the taste easily transfers.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and does exactly what it should. I chew my cuticles and when I have the product on I do not chew. Not only does it taste disgusting and bitter it also is hard to get the taste out of your mouth when you do chew and makes it that much more effective.  Nail biting polish does nothing for us skin chewers!    I recommend applying the product with a q-tip, when I first got it I applied it with my fingers and when you eat and lick your fingers, the yucky taste is there! For cuticles this product will last you for months!! With the three jars you can always have it with you, I have one at work, one in my purse and one in my gym bag. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This advertises \\&quot;STRONGEST SUCCESS RATE\\&quot; which is totally wrong.  I used it on my 9yr son and on myself.  Neither of us had any problem biting our nails through the solution.  I even tried putting a heavier amount on my own nails, yet caught myself biting my nails within 20min of applying it.  I have attempted to contact the seller, but so far have not heard back from them about returning the product for a refund.  I am very dissappointed with this product and with the seller&#x27;s response back to me.</li>
    <li> I have chewed on my nails for all of my life.  Now that I&#x27;m 50, I just got tired of how bad my hands look.  I purchased this product and followed the directions and I am VERY pleased with the results.  My nails have never looked better.  I actually got a manicure last week!  The cream helped my nails grow a bit faster and not look so dried out.  When this product is on your nails, you WILL NOT like the way it tastes if you try to bit your nails....it tastes terrible!  My only warning is to make sure you wash your nails before eating as you may taste the product in your food (it warns you to do this in the directions, but I didn&#x27;t heed their warning!).  I highly recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t stop biting their nails.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this. It&#x27;s only plus is that it arrived earlier than expected.  I got this product for myself (nail biting) and my 8 year old son who cannot stop sucking his thumb.  It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything at all to me, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him much either.  The Hoof nail polish stuff from Walmart tastes worse than this. (The nail polish stuff is too easy to pick off and remove.) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Save your money, try something else...</li>
    <li> I was optimistic after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I was highly disappointed.  If you don&#x27;t apply the product several times in heavy coats you don&#x27;t taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily).  Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism.  And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves.  I started to use a similar nail polish product but did not like the shine and how frequently it needed to be applied but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well.  I suggest the nail polish over this product.</li>
    <li> My seven year old son traded thumb sucking for fingernail biting and still sucked his thumb at night so we decided we had to do something.  Many Mavala Stop reviews said it made the child throw up, so I opted for this one which didn&#x27;t have quite as many \\&quot;throw up\\&quot; reviews.  We have followed the directions to a T so far.  We got the product and talked about quiting for about a week.  Then we coated every fingernail at bed time and coated the entire thumb that he sucks.  The first night he tried to suck his thumb he almost threw up and tried sucking at least twice.  The second night he didn&#x27;t try at all.  He still reports that he tried to suck his thumb every 4-5 days or so.  The directions indicate using the product for 3 weeks.  We are 2 days away from 2 weeks of using the product.  He wants to quit and cooperates putting it on.  He also said that the product wears off about mid afternoon the next day, but we don&#x27;t reapply since he doesn&#x27;t seem to be biting.  He isn&#x27;t a big hand washer so I don&#x27;t know if that would wash it off.  Since we are using this product we are foregoing reminding of hand washing at the moment.  Will follow up with another review when we are convinced of the overall results.</li>
    <li> So far the product is adquate.   I don&#x27;t like the fact that it transfers to food if touched.........awful taste. But that is the reason for the product; that it tastes bad.  I try not to use it during the day and prefer the use at nighttime.......    Expensive, but if it works, it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I have had a habitfor the past 15 + years.  Control it has helped me kick the habit for the last 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Omega3 is a lotion that tastes terrible to help you stop biting your nails. It really works for me and anytime you use it, it strengthens your nails as well. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Taste is very bad.  My son hasn&#x27;t stop biting his nail, but is aware that if he put his finger in his mouth I will put the cream on his nails.</li>
    <li> It did not work for our daughter who is 3 and bites her nails because the product makes her throw up. The taste itself is not as bad as it could be (you barely taste anything at first), but then it kind of coats your mouth and makes my daughter throw up instead of deterring the nail biting habit.</li>
    <li> Look, here&#x27;s the situation: I have been biting my fingernails my whole life (39 years), give or take. I hate the way my fingernails look, I don&#x27;t like how chewing on my nails in front of people must look (although I avoid this for the most part), I don&#x27;t think it is very healthy (I get hangnails/infections fairly often), and I simply want &#x27;normal&#x27; looking hands. So, I purchased this 3-pack with the best of hopes. Here&#x27;s my experience thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you must put this stuff on your fingers several times throughout the day because normal washing will remove it. Keep one at work and one at home... maybe even in your car. No big deal, in my mind because in doing so, you will be reminding yourself that you DO NOT WANT to bite your fingernails anymore! Right?! It becomes contant affirmation for the person trying to break this nasty, embarassing habit. Put in the time and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I hear folks saying it&#x27;s annoying to constantly apply it; I have news for you, YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO CHANGE BAD ENOUGH! This is a habit-breaking effort, not a walk in the park... stop complaining and get back to breaking that habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it tastes nasty. Surprised?! You shouldn&#x27;t be. What did you expect, sour apple? Heck, if it tasted like sour apple, I&#x27;d be sucking my fingers all day! No, this tastes like lotion gone bad... AS IT SHOULD. Remember, you are trying to break a bad habit... stick to it and stop looking for miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you will occasionally taste this stuff inadvertantly while eating food with your hands... get over it! Again, this is a reminder that you have a nasty habit that you have intentionally decided to break and this is a small, albeit nasty, side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, people also complain that the 3 jars provided is not enough. Bah! I put mine on by way of a Q-Tip because I don&#x27;t want it on my fingers in case I eat something. By doing this, I also need very little product to cover my 10 fingernails. The 3 jars can GO A LONG WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, do not stop your path to success prematurely! The first time I tried this product, my fingernails grew out and you know what, I had to CLIP THEM! Yeah!! It was cool and my fingers looked good... so I stopped. Bad idea. I regressed like many others have, no doubt. Please stick with this for at least 6 straight weeks to give it the best chance of becoming a healthier habit. You will not be disappointed if you read the above AND you will be very happy to have fingernails again! I wish you all the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CJyour path to success prematurely!

    <li> This product does exactly what it advertises. It tastes horrible and definitely helps you keep your hands from getting anywhere near your face. I would only recommend this product to those who really need it as it is quite pricey.</li>
    <li> product tastes HORRIBLE!  But it kept me from biting!!  My nails started growing back quickly too!</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about amazon but i am disappointed because my order has not been delivered despite and the deadline for delivery has passed. I can only hope that they will deliver it as they have already charged my credit card.</li>
    <li> i noticed my son who is now 7, at age 5 started biting his nails off and on.  my wife and i gave him warnings at first to stop and he stopped for a short time and now after two years of warnings he&#x27;s nail biting habit is out of control.  i was very skeptical about the product but it is very effective. i&#x27;ve tasted the product and it tastes really bad. the bitterness just spreads in the mouth.  the cool thing is after a weeks use i havent seen his nails so long in two years.  we now tell him to bite his nails if he wants.... in disgust he says no!  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my fiance who&#x27;s always bitten his nails.  He definately says it works, taste HORRIBLE and lasts a long time even  after washing your hands. You just have to be consistant in it&#x27;s application.  &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will actually make him STOP bitting his nails since it&#x27;s a habit just like any other but it&#x27;s a good start.</li>
    <li> This product worked right away, he has stopped biting his nails almost completely and it has helped his hangnails alot as well.</li>
    <li> Tastes horrific. I&#x27;m growing my own nails! Wish I had bought this year&#x27;s ago</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for kids, it made mine throw up. So now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 jars of a product we can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> My son has had a very bad nail biting/picking habit. I tried several different store brand products that didn&#x27;t work. Frustrated that he continued to bite, I decided to go on line and try the Omega3 Extra Strength nail biting cream. He has been applying it regularly, and there is a definite improvement!! Each time he puts his hand into his mouth he gets this terrible taste which stops him from doing it. At this time I&#x27;m very happy with his progress.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with little hope as I&#x27;ve been biting my nails and cuticles for over 20 years.  After only one week of using it, I had already learned that it tasted so HORRIBLE that I didn&#x27;t dare chance even touching my lips with my hands!  After the first week, I&#x27;d miss a day here and there of applying the cream, but I was still so concious of touching my lips for fear of the horrible taste that I wasn&#x27;t biting my nails/cuticles even without the cream!  I still used the full supply in a little over a month b/c I wanted to be sure I really did kick the habbit.  My hands look like new hands now!  I have to say that I would completely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old. I have bitten my nails for at least 55 years and probably longer. I have tried everything to quit. I bought this product and applied it the first day I received it. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since. I showed my wife my hands the other day and said \\&quot;look,fingernails\\&quot;. She was amazed! I&#x27;m not all the way there BUT I don&#x27;t bite my nails and they are beginning to look pretty good. This product works! I would recommend it to anyone, especially to parents with children. If the kids are biting their nails this will stop them. You can&#x27;t even wash it off!!! It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for my nail biting and it does deter me. The only problem is that once it&#x27;s on you have to be careful about touching things like food or your eyes. You can get that bitterness on your food. That would be the only con. I also bought it for my daughter&#x27;s thumb sucking, but have not tried it on her yet. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Having bitten my nails for most of my life, this is turning out to be wonderful. After just two weeks my nails are looking good, are stronger than they have ever been, and I feel great about them.</li>
    <li> It definately makes me aware that I am biting my nails but I would prefer something stronger tasting to really deter me.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been biting her nails for a bout a year now.  After using this product I do see the start of promising results!</li>
    <li> Yikes, this stuff tastes TERRIBLE! It&#x27;s true, I applied a very small amount on my nails and went about my day. Later, I needed to eat lunch, so I consciously washed my hands with soap and water. I then had the unfortunate experience of tasting this stuff while I was eating - kudos for not being a wimpy product. I&#x27;m very impressed. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m going to have to use this stuff for a while. Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but the cream is a lot more effective than the nail polish products out there. It&#x27;s about time this 33 year old guy got his nail biting habit under control.</li>
    <li> My husband has been biting his nails since he had teeth so I was VERY hopeful this stuff would work.  But, he says he can&#x27;t taste anything.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known several years ago about this product! We tried Thums (didn&#x27;t faze) with our 5 yr. old daughter, an avid finger-sucker since before birth (caught on sonogram) and 8 yr. old nail biter, all kinds of  positive rewards, encouragement, etc., to no avail over several years&#x27; time.  At our wits end, I was going to order a vinyl glove to put over her fingers, when I saw the Control-It Cream, and I wondered if it was too good to be true. We thought we&#x27;d give it a try.  We purchased the OMEGA 3, the stronger acting Control-IT.      My husband taste-tested it and said it tasted bad,  but the taste just kept getting worse!  After 1 application on my nail-biting son, he quit, begging me not to put any more on (I did for a week.)   My daughter stopped her finger-sucking the day after we started, and only one time at night since then (now a month ago) have I found her at night with her fingers in her mouth. AMAZING!!!  Her whole personality has changed!!  She is waking up so refreshed and happy, and has a much more pleasant disposition throughout the day.  The finger sucking was interfering with her sleep!  But she sucked continuously during the day, as well, and that is gone, too. She puts the cream on herself, now, with a q-tip, and we&#x27;ll continue to for a little while longer at night only.  She is so proud of herself and her accomplishments, and both have received several rewards along the way.  Thank you for the Omega3 Control-It!!!!!    The book, A Bad Habit, (Berstain Bears) was a good addition to help break these bad habits!</li>
    <li> After more than 50 years of a disgusting habit of biting my nails, this product helped me break this habit. I now am not ashamed to display my nails rather than hiding my hands in public.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8-yr-old who started biting his nails.  Unfortunately, every time he washed his hands the cream came off and would need to be re-applied.  Since I am not with him during the day while he is at school, he can bite his nails all day!  There was no hope of him re-applying on his own at school.  I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.  I made another purchase of the nail polish-type product instead and hope that will work.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to curve the thumb sucking of my son. just put a little on and its good, multi-use product and would highly recommend for the patents trying to stop a thumb sucker.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, so I ordered it; I felt that the description was very vague though.  You get three jars but they are extremely small, about the size of most eye cream jars, so about 0.17 ounces.  It&#x27;s a white cream and seems to be odorless but tastes terrible, it&#x27;s extremely bitter with a lingering taste; it reminds me of going to the dentist.  It does withstand hand washings well and seems to last for the day, plus a little bit goes a long way.  The only trick is to ensure it&#x27;s always applied!</li>
    <li> This company was excellent in the prompt delivery of this product.  The product itself was not to my liking as I did not feel that it had much effect.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective! If you want to stop biting nails, skin or whatever this will work! 5 applications did the job!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It has such a bitter taste that I am starting to NOT bite my nails as much. Even when you wash your hands and try to bite your nails you still get a bitter taste. The only downfall is that you can&#x27;t eat finger foods because it will taste bitter from the cream. Other then that I love this stuff and highly suggest that those with nail biting problems try it. It&#x27;s all natural which is why I purchased it rather then the nail polish stuff that has toxins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and it is great, certainly does its job and very well.(I now use it on the kids) My only niggle is that the consistency of it has changed. It used to be really nice to use, not the taste haha, but now it seems very sticky after applied. It is now more opaque than before so I don&#x27;t know if they have changed something in it. I told the company and they thought I had a bad batch so sent me some more but it is the same. Their customer service is very good and I will still use it as it does beat anything out there.</li>
    <li> Put it on my daughter&#x27;s fingernails, telling her it was a healing cream instead of a solution to stop nail biting.  This way we wouldn&#x27;t have to struggle.  She was very willing.  Within ten minutes I saw her biting her nails.  I said, \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t the healing cream taste bad?\\&quot; and she said, \\&quot;No, not really... a little bit a first but then you get used to it really fast.\\&quot;  I continued putting it on for a week.  Didn&#x27;t make the slightest bit of difference!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son and when it arrived it was so small. It didn&#x27;t even last a month. It should be advertised as cost per ounce.</li>
    <li> You have to be very consistent. My daughter would stop biting as soon as this was on her nails, and then her attention would shift to other things. If you stay with it, this can be effective. Nail biting has been reduced, but not completely eradicated yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to stop biting my nails. I have bit my nails since I could remember so probably a good 27+years. They sent me three bottles, all I needed was one. Within a day I hated the taste and stopped putting my fingers in my mouth. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was doing it sometimes until I tasted it. This product not only helped be stop biting my nails, but it also helped them heal and grow properly.&lt;br /&gt;I started back biting my nails again due to stress, I went to use the other two bottles I had, but they were not good anymore. The taste and creamy texture was gone. I was going to order some new bottles, but I didn&#x27;t need three I only needed one bottle, maybe two so I can have one in my purse. They did sell them like that, so I FB message the company and explained the problem. They sent me two new bottles FREE of charge, no questions asked. The product should last for 2 years without an issue, mine did not. I was so grateful and again it has helped. This would be good for kids who bite their nails or even suck their thumbs or fingers. Adults who want beautiful nails again, it is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a deterrent: washes off and needs to be applied often.</li>
    <li> did not work on my kid</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff as the reviews were very promising.  The flavor is strong, it lasts, and the nutrients are excellent for your nails.  I stopped using it after about a week, though, because it&#x27;s very messy.  The cream never really absorbs in like a lotion and I couldn&#x27;t touch anything for at least 1/2 hour unless I wanted it covered in white dry paste.  I would leave marks on my steering wheel, keyboard, mouse, clothes, desk, etc.  It became so annoying I just gave up.</li>
    <li> Thanks very much, the product is doing its effect with accuracy and my nails are growing nice. what can i tell you a few misunderstandings with my mouth but everything working good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks again!!</li>
    <li> Yes the jars are small and at first I thought no way such small amounts would stop me from chewing my fingers (I don&#x27;t bite my nails, I bite the skin around the nail).  The product works, the taste is horrible.  The trick is a little goes a long way and you have to use it all the time.  Careful not to eat food with your hands because the taste does transfer.  I still chew, but only when I don&#x27;t apply the cream.  The 3 jars are actually a good thing too because I have one in my purse, another at work and the other at home...pretty much no excuse not to apply it!!!</li>
    <li> These jars are tiny, slightly bigger than a quarter in diameter, but they do last more than a week if you want it to - The taste is bitter, but I kinda got used to it and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on a product, but after reviewing all of the products online I felt this was the safest for my almost 4 yr old.  All natural product.  My husband and I both tasted it and it is awful bitter, but my son was never phased by it.  I thought it was a joke when it arrived in the mail.  There were three quarter sized little jars.  I do think that it would last if you use it sparingly, but not at all worth the price.  The taste washes off when you wash your hands so you need very frequent applications, so if you are at all a clean person try something else.  Because it has to be reapplied so frequently and I couldn&#x27;t have it done every few hours while my son was at daycare, he chewed all day long then stopped for about 5-10 minutes after applying the cream at home.</li>
    <li> Thanks!  The product leaves a bitter tastes, but works well.  I don&#x27;t bite my nails, but I clip and pick at them and this product helps heal the skin and cuticles.</li>
    <li> The Mavala Stop is way better, it lets you brush it on like nail polish and it tastes awful.  This stuff is weak sauce, I chew right through it.</li>
    <li> This product is useless and a total waste of money.  Let me just start with sharing that your 21-day supply comes with a coupon for $5 off your next order!  That pretty much says it all.  HELLO??  If the product worked, why would I need to order more?!!!  Yes - it&#x27;s all natural.  But it&#x27;s also all non-effective!  I put this on my 5 year old&#x27;s fingers.  He took a lick and said it tasted \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; but his reaction was mild at best, it didn&#x27;t seem to be very offensive to him.  Literally less than 5 minutes later, he was back to constantly chewing his nails as he always does!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE!!!</li>
    <li> Being a nail biter, have tried and tried to stop biting, but could not. I was so bad that I would bite until my nails and fingers would bleed and throb. Now I have long and pretty nails,  thanks to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I guess this might work for some kids, But my Son still bit his nails, even with this stuff caked on his names.</li>
    <li> My 3 1/2 year old has been chewing her nails for a year now and this lotion has dramatically decreased her chewing. She looks forward to me checking her nails at the end of the day and putting on her &amp;#34;icky lotion&amp;#34; so she won&#x27;t chew. It has a bad taste but not awful like the nail polish reviews that made the kids sick, this seems to be enough to deter her but not so bad that she&#x27;s getting sick.</li>
    <li> My son was always biting his nails and fingers.  I noticed a big difference right away.  After a week, I almost never see him with his fingers in his mouth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to moisturize and repair cuticles. The bitter taste will deter you from biting your nails. The only thing I disliked about this product is that it left a sticky residue on my fingers, but only when I used too much.</li>
    <li> Very ineffective. Has to be applied frequently because it washes off so easily. Application is a mess - have to clean up afterwards.  Even when it was on it had no noticeable effect. Compared to other nail biting polishes this hardly has any bad taste at all. For $30, I was very (extremely)  disappointed. Will be going back to Malvinia(spell?)</li>
    <li> I have been a lifelong, hardcore nail and cuticle biter and just knowing it was on my nails made me very conscious of keeping my hands away from my face. The taste is not that bad (got a taste while eating a sandwich) sort of tastes like antiperspirant, just unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the company changed about this product, but I know they changed something because it is not the same strength as it used to be. When I first purchased this product a years ago, putting your nails in your mouth resulted in a shocking bitter reaction, now I barely notice the flavor! The shocking taste is so necessary for nail biters because it is so often a unconscious activity that we need something really slap us in the face each time that we do it. That use to be this cream. With the old formula, after tasting this cream one or two times I was much more resilient to keep my nails out of my mouth, now I have to think about not doing it. I really hope the company will consider going back to the old strength of the cream! Especially because I won&#x27;t purchase it again until they do, it&#x27;s too expensive for a now marginal product that I know use to have better days.</li>
    <li> the product worked! In a week the nails had started growing again n my daughter is very happy she also doesnt bite or suck her thumb</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes AWFUL! It is seriously revolting and it doesn&#x27;t fade for ages! And I love it! It does exactly what is says on da tin! It&#x27;s smooth, nourishes the nail really well and lasts a long time. I got my 21 day order over 4 weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t even finished a single jar yet! I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone and their dog! After 18 years of chronically bitiing my nails, they are the longest I&#x27;ve ever seen them! I still have 1 dodgy nail, but the rest are doing really well. I&#x27;m even having trouble texting because my long thumb nails hit the wrong buttons! It does feel a little greasy once you apply it, but that fades as it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin and nail. Cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this product. It is a bit expensive, but it last a long time and I just got the jars because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t need the special packs and I was right! Spread the word...</li>
    <li> I have tried every single product you can imagine, nail polishes sprays anything. Finally (even though the price is very high) I decided to buy Control-it! And I was surprised. My first month my nails had grown so much. Unfortunately I only purchased the 3 containers for three months and when I ran out I returned to my old habits. I hear if you buy two sets that goes away! LOVE IT AND JUST BOUGHT MORE!!</li>
    <li> i like this product...it helped my daughter and i. but then i went off it and started clipping my nails off...got to start using it again!</li>
    <li> very good product. only cons is that when you touch food the unpleasant product taste will stay on the food and you will taste it in your month when eating.</li>
    <li> I am shocked by how awful this stuff tastes.  It comes in very small jars and you only need a tiny tiny bit on your hands.  It is absolutely working so far.  I have an OCD disorder called Dermatophagia where I bite the skin on my fingers and knuckles.  After trying for years to stop I found this stuff.  Its tastes so horrible and after 4 days I am finding that I&#x27;m not even attempting to bite.  If nothing else, it certainly serves as a reminder if you digress and accidentally put your fingers in your mouth.  I imagine it would work for thumb sucking or even pets.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because even after washing my hands - no SCRUBBING them - I can still taste it.  This is a problem when you want to eat a sandwich or anything else with your hands.  I&#x27;ve been avoiding those types of foods or choosing to eat them with a fork because you can absolutely taste it on the food.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like miracle stuff and it taste horrible. lol... i have been using it for 3 weeks and my progress is insane!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our daycare provider and it has worked. My toddler started chewing her nails and we started using this. Now she only has a tub at daycare and they put it on her when they notice her sticking her fingers in her mouth. Her nails are back to normal and I actually have to clip them weekly. I haven&#x27;t tasted it but they told me its pretty bad. Now I have to convince my husband to use it. lol</li>
