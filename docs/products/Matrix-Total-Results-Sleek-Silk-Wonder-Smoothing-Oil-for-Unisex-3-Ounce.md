<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> keeps my hair soft shiny and smelling wonderful</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair feeling like silk.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Just use a small dime amout (hair just past shoulders) when your hairs wet.  You put it on the ends and half way up the hair.  Comb through and style.  Then you can take just a dab more and smooth out the hair when your done with an iron or whatever you use for styling.  Smells nice and really leaves the hair feeling silky and very smooth.</li>
    <li> best product Matrix has ever made!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this smoothing oil! I have naturally curly hair that I sometimes wear curly and sometimes straighten with a flat iron. Regardless of which way I wear it, this oil really helps cut down on the frizz and make it very soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a very long way, and as long as you don&#x27;t overuse it, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It also doesn&#x27;t really weigh my hair down, so that is good.  And a side perk is that I LOVE the smell.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy hair...this will help!</li>
    <li> Finally something to tame and smooth my coarse, curley hair.  It just leaves hair silky and smooth without an oily feel.  It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s not my hair.  I have short hair and am able to have staight bangs.  I use a flat iron sparingly and it stays smooth until the next shampoo, even on rainy days.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my hair.  It does make it shine.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot just squeeze a few drops on your hands and rub it in your hair.  It has no odor which I like.  I would buy this again. It does make your hair feel oily.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Just enough to give your hair a little shine and control frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff, it makes my hair so nice and smooth that I don&#x27;t have to blow dry or flat iron at all. Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but a little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a once a year purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dry, frizzy, wavy hair. Yes, bad!! but finally something that works for me. I use a few drops on my wet hair, let it air-dry and then apply a little bit more for styling. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;If you do have oily hair, then use it only on your ends.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth order...my hair loves this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and shiny...wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Try it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for my curly hair. It tames hair and gives a great shine. I&#x27;ve been using for about two years and it&#x27;s well worth the price. You only have to use a small amount to do the job and so one bottle lasts a long time. Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> I have thick dark brown hair in which I color and this product actually frizzed up my hair more I have used other products such as the shampoo and conditioner and my hair responds positively so that&#x27;s my review and that&#x27;s all my YouTube is Marisa 271.</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I bought something so efficient as this. It really does what is supposed to do. At least with my man-short-hair it really worked. Soft, shine and silky hair.</li>
    <li> I came across Matrix Total Results Sleek Silk Wonder Smoothing Oil by chance.  It was recommended to me by the hairstylist who trimmed my hair.  I like this product so much that I am going to find her and give her a big hug and kiss. I still have abundant thick wavy hair (thank goodness), and for the first time in a long time, I am letting it grow long.  I did not want to let it grow before because it gets frizzy with the Florida humidity.  But now, with Matrix Total Results Sleek Silk Wonder Smoothing Oil, it feels so sleek, manageable, and shiny.  This leave-in conditioner is wonderful. It does NOT feel greasy at all, and it smells great.  All you have to do is apply a dime size amount to the palm of one hand, rub it against the other, and then run your hands through wet hair after shampooing.  You can also apply it to dry hair anytime. Work on ends first and then apply all over.  A 3 oz. bottle is supposed to last about 8 months.  I also have found that they sell this product in packages of 3 one-ounce bottles.  This would allow you to have a bottle  by your sink, one in your purse, and one in the car perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love running my fingers through my hair.  I recommend this product 100%, especially to those with dry hair from blow drying, pool chemicals, or frequent tinting.  I have recommended this products to friends, and they also have seen immediate results which they love.  The only thing I would change, if anything, is the name.  MTRSSWSO is a too long. Thank you Matrix! Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.  I can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> I love the product itself but don&#x27;t really like the application. I wish it came in a spray bottle for more even distribution. But it does make my hair shine and works well before using a flat iron</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used on my hair. my hair has some wave and it gets dry easily. Even on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I put a little spot of this in my hand rub it around, then run my fingers through my hair,  rub the palms down the back of it and brush it good. I have never had anything take away the dryness and flyways like this has. The seller was good, I got it sooner than I expected and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for making dry frizzy hair look sleek and smooth.  Also the most cost effective.  A quarter size amount takes care of my whole head I have very thick, shoulder length hair).  My hair resists humidity as well, so my bangs do not curle up after I have ironed them straight.</li>
    <li> I use this on my moustasche.  Works very well.  Took out a very difficult wave on one side.  Helps to smooth out overall.  It does NOT hold well enough to make handel bar ends and I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  Just want to make clear that this is not going to &amp;#34;Shape&amp;#34; your stasche, just help smooth out some of the waves and wild hairs.  It does do thay very well.  If you want to train it to pointy ends etc., you will need one of the other heavy putty or wax products.</li>
    <li> I found this larger version of my absolutely favorite hair product.  I have fine, thin hair that needs blowdrying so it doesn&#x27;t look dry and frizzy all day.  I found that using a small drop of this stuff rubbed into my hair works absolute wonders and leaves me not needing the hair dryer.  My hair looks so smooth and shiny as if I used a straight iron on my hair but I didn&#x27;t! (Note- I have naturally straight hair, this product will not straighten your hair).  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who deals with frizzy or dull hair that needs a shine and smoothing effect without feeling like you have product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;You will not feel any trace of this product in your hair after applying it.  IT does not feel greasy or heavy like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It has strong smell and dries hair, will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Not the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used.. It&#x27;s just ok. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone I know it needs to be more hydrating</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and described. Works great on curly frizzy hair. Only a little is needed (dime size).</li>
    <li> This hair product smells so good and makes my hair so soft. It also doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling in my hair like other products.</li>
    <li> excellent buy...I thought I prchaed the exact bottle..turns out is was smaller bottles but they gave me extra...so i actually got more for my money! cant beat that!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product really helps with frizz and curl definition! Using this product, in addition to my hair dryer and diffuser, I am able to dry my hair completely without having to let it partially air dry. This is a huge deal! Love it and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> overpriced oil - can basically use anything as a substitute.  there are tons of L&#x27;oreal products that do the same thing for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and this makes it shiny and more manageable.  It&#x27;s not just for straight hair styles either.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that works for my dry and frizzy hair. I used to have a hard time managing my hair and this helps a lot. I am able to use it even daily and doesnot give a oily or greasy feeling to the hair. Overall, best value for the money spent.</li>
    <li> This is used on Remy weave to soften the hair.  Good product, the wife saves money by buying this and using it at home.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been searching forever for something that will control the frizz and make my hair look healthy even after blow drying and straightening. I received a 1oz sample from my hair person and loved it so much I had to buy it for myself! The 1oz bottle lasted me almost a year! You don&#x27;t need much which makes this well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Met my expectations.  It was designed to be used with the matrix line of shampoo and conditioner, and to maintain the actual matrix hair treatment.  Together, all 3 products leave hair soft, smooth and silky - just as the name says.  Oh and there is no high unpleasant odor either so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> how did i get 4 samples?... the bottle is saying not for retail sale. But it works great for my hair</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of this stuff I&#x27;ve bought and just love it. As I&#x27;m getting older my hair seems to be getting more split and this stuff just takes care of it!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever !!!  Only found out about it by accident it was a free sample when I bought my shampoo and conditioner. The very first time I use it I was amazed, made my hair Siky and smooth. Keeps down the fly always I have from so much damage from the flat iron. No frizz. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product you will love it. Put a little in after you wash your hair while damp and then when you style &#x3D; smooth and shining hair.</li>
    <li> I am an African American and my hair is three different textures.  So imagine the difficulty I experience in finding a product that meets my needs. This matrix product fits the requirements.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  The Seller outdid themselves in replacing the one large bottle I had ordered with several small, handy sized ones (because the former was out of stock), giving me a plus amount for the money.  This product is an excellent help for hair like mine, keeping the little frizzies smoothed down without that greasy look.</li>
    <li> Replaced from the serum that was taken off the market and I don&#x27;t really care for this stuff. Can&#x27;t believe matrix would replace it with this stuff.</li>
    <li> There was no shine on my hair. It did feel silkier, though. This product is not for me. Thank you.</li>
    <li> not really what i thought.does seem to do job.havent used product that long.will keep looking. i think matrix has different kinds of smoothing oil. would like to try a different one.</li>
    <li> MY GIRLS ARE MIXED &amp; THEIR HAIR CAN BE A BEAR SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE FRIZZ! THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is a good product as the first step after washing the hair and towel drying it.  Put a small amount in the palm of your hand, rub the hands together, then run them through your hair.  It is very easy to see the transition from just washed to the beginning of styling.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair, with highlights, which tends to the dry side because I shampoo everyday and also swim laps a few times a week.  Have used numerous other products and Matrix&#x27;s Silk Wonder is the best because it never makes hair seem oily, only shiny and mangeable and definetly brings out the highlights.  Also has a nice, light fragnance.  Even if some gets in the bangs, won&#x27;t get that hair separation, too much product look.  Price wise, Matrix is about mid point re the competition.</li>
    <li> Very good for my curly hair</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair but I straighten it every day, and this product has really saved me from some bad hair days. Because I live in a really humid climate, my hair usually becomes a frizzy, curly nightmare midway through the day even though I straighten it. This product really reduces the frizz, though, and helps maintain my style in place. You only need a little bit of product, too, so it lasts a long time. I use about a nickel-sized dollop every day for thick hair that reaches mid-back. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky soft and smooth as promised!</li>
    <li> Smells good and looks good on my hair.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!,  I am a Black American female, with a very, very, very short hair (tired of the chemicals, relaxers, curls). This is so smooth and light and smells nice also. Very soft.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample of Matrix Total results to use on my new hair extensions. I loved it because it was not oily nor did it weigh the hair down like some smoothers or serums. You only need to use very little to take care of frizz and/or fly aways. It  definitely has become a permanent part of my hair regimen.</li>
