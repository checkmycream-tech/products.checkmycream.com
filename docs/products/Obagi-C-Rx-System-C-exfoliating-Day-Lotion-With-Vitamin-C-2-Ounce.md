<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! It helps in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles by retaining moisture in my skin ... does not leave my face feeling oily. I use this product daily, its a must have for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using OBAGI product. My skin is usually very dry. After applying this product, it feels very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I discovered Obagi products.  I&#x27;ve tried several different products and am now a big fan.  I love this cream because it&#x27;s really emollient, feels great and smells fresh and wonderful too.  While they call it exfoliating and I guess it is, you don&#x27;t feel the granules they are so fine.  But it has definitely made my skin less dry and smoother. I use it with Obagi Professional C Serum 20% and I love how my face feels and looks.  No miracles, but it does seem to do what they say and it really feels good.  I&#x27;m 61 and while not many wrinkles, my face is dry and it&#x27;s great for that.  I use them both on face and neck and the C Serum also on my hands and I really feel it&#x27;s made a difference in my hands and cuticles.  That was a nice surprise and bonus. I highly recommend both these products and do feel they work well together.  On the other hand, I tried the Obagi eye cream and feel it&#x27;s a bit too light for me although it may be a good cream.</li>
    <li> Lotion all over the bottle as though it had been opened before.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, and in good condition. I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and I love it. Really nice for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product does work as described and gently exfoliates my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this appears to work well for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for cell renewal however was a little harsh for my skin. Did a great job with exfoliating but a strong lotion recommend using every other day on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite skincare products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and years.  That comment alone should show anyone how good this product is.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with use of the other Obagi products, Its phenomenal. It keeps your face free from&lt;br /&gt;acne breakout, does not leave your face dry or tight and the bottle lasts a long long time.  I probably purchase&lt;br /&gt;a bottle every 4-5months.  Try this and you will see a difference in your complexion.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 10 years and it is great!</li>
    <li> For anyone looking for a gentle yet effective moisturizing lotion, look no further.  Obagi-C Rx is usually a very expensive product to use on a consistent basis, but through Amazon it can be found for reasonable prices, ships in a short period of time.  I recommend the entire kit for overall great results!</li>
    <li> Great as expected.  I have never had a problem with any Obagi product and this is not exception.  Helps keep my skin exfoliated and smooth.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great and it seems to fade some of the brown spots on my face.  Not super rich -- I have to supplement it when my skin gets super dry</li>
    <li> Great!  Smells nice and works really well.  I am already seeing a smoother and brighter complexion after using for one week.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s obagi, and the reviews. Love, love, love!!!! Just a tip I have to wait a bit before applying my makeup. Light creamy, perfect for normal skin!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this before. It is the most gentle, yet effective exfoliant I can find. I will continue to use it!!!</li>
    <li> I received it right on schedule. This is the first time that I have used Obagi, recommend by my Dermatologist, and I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased. It definitely makes the surface of my skin feel smoother. I like the fact that this lotion has a little bit of everything that is good for your skin in it. I&#x27;m 56 and really don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but my skin was not really feeling smooth and nice and I wasn&#x27;t using anything recommended by a dermatologist so I thought I&#x27;d try this and I would definitely buy it again. I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced too. I have pigmentation issues from sun exposure w/out sunscreen when I was young but I don&#x27;t expect the Obagi to correct it, I feel it&#x27;s a really nice product for the money and that it&#x27;s 2 ounces rather than the standard 1 ounce is great!</li>
    <li> My favorite product in my skin care regimen. Expect skin to appear glowing, radiant and dewey. A must have!!</li>
    <li> I worked with a plastic surgeon for 4+ years and sold this product to our customers.  It absolutely works wonders if you stick with it and follow directions.  I&#x27;m 40 years old and have been asked if my 12 year old son is my brother.  Try it and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Great price because I used to have to purchase through my doctor and I didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, love the product.  Best price and delivery</li>
    <li> Great product. And much cheaper than buying at a salon. Saved about 15.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I am a chemist and I am skeptical about marketing of skin care products. Also, I am allergic to most of them. This lotion is one of very few that give visible improvement in just few times of use. The skin gets this glow that people would notice and I was asked on more than one occasion which products I use after one week of applying this lotion. Unfortunately, I am getting break up from it and never use it more that two weeks in row, every other day and stop for a month or six weeks. I guess it would be five star product for someone who is not allergic to it</li>
    <li> A gentle exfoliant that maintains youthful skin.  I was introduced to Obagi products over ten years ago in the office of a cosmetic  surgeon where laser and other types of facials are available.  I&#x27;m hooked on Obagi now.</li>
    <li> The product description list hydroquinone, but when it arrived the box did not. I also thought there was a chance the box had been opened so for both of those reasons, I am returning it. I&#x27;ve used Obagi with the hydroquinone and it works great. I do wish I could find a safe substitute for hydroquinone though!</li>
    <li> Great product that I recommend anybody that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> I like the consistence, not greasy or too thin like a lotion, leaves the skin silky and smooth. I am also using it with a combination of Obagi clarifying product with peroxide available in MD office only. Definitively recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It gives my face a glow.  My skin is soft and wrinkle free! I am 64 and look 10 years younger...love this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this. It lasts about 4 months. It makes my face feel nourished. I only use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product.  I have been using the Obagi system for about 18 years.  I have tried several other products but always went back to Obagi.</li>
    <li> Just started using it everyday. It came highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was considering purchasing this, but realized that this company still uses ANIMAL TESTING. That is something that I cannot support. Too bad they don&#x27;t wake up and get with the times. My smooth skin is not worth the horrible suffering of innocent animals.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi for many years and I am always happy with my purchase of this particular product.</li>
    <li> I used to use the whole Obagi system and I got extremely dry and red, but I stuck with it for three months and yes, it did improve my skin, but it took THREE MONTHS!  This stuff, in conjunction with a nighttime serum, WOW!  I saw a dramatic improvement in my skin in just a few days...and all in one step, which is nice.  I used to do the whole six-step process with the Obagi system, which was a real hassle, but this is great, one step!  I like this product a lot because it helped with my skin discoloration but has not dried me out at all, and it&#x27;s the middle of winter, so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been usung Obagi products for years, and this particular item is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.  Blends in nicely, with no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I have acne prone skin and this lightweight lotion really hydrates my skin and exfoliates it at the same time giving my skin a more even toned complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend this product and purchasing it from Amazon also helps me save a few dollars!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and I LOVE it. worth the price</li>
    <li> 25 YRS AGO I STARTED WITH OBAGI IT WORKS GREAT!  I HAVE NO WRINKLES, SPOTS, THE SMOOTHEST SKIN I&#x27;M 65 AND MY FACE LOOKS LIKE 45 YRS OLD. IT IS AMAZING~</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Has a nice light scent and goes on light, no greasy feeling.  Using it along with the 20% C serum has made a noticeable difference in my skin.  It makes my face look smooth.  No foundation needed.  I used it daily for a couple weeks but since it has glycolic acid in it, I have decreased to maybe 1-2x a week.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi cleanser and toner.  This is the perfect lotion for use in their system.  Easy to travel with.  Just use a small amount, nice texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;m almost 60 and get frequent compliment about how great my skin looks. It&#x27;s a light and wonderful emulsion that tighten pores and gives a youthful glow to your skin. Try it - you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! I&#x27;ve used Obagi CRX products for a few years and absolutely love them. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent exfoliation moisturizer for glycation in older skin.  Use sparingly if you have sensitive skin.  I use the entire line of this product.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after I put it on.</li>
    <li> this is the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. I saw a change in less then a week</li>
    <li> I really like this product and all Obagi products. They seem to do the best on my skin. It blends in nice.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin nice and soft with no breakouts.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps my skin smooth and even.</li>
    <li> I love it my favorite</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel!!</li>
    <li> My face feels so hydrated and smooth after applying this. Love it.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff!</li>
    <li> I received the wrong item, which was $11 cheaper than the item I paid for.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Obagi products online before and the products have always arrived with protective/security wrapping.  This purchase came to me with no such wrapping.  This makes me wonder if it has been tampered with......of course wondering is not good!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Simply the best!</li>
    <li> this is my go to for years now, 62 year old face helps keep some of the rough patches down if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never totally sure all the things I do to keep my skin looking fresh really work.  I use other Obagi products and this was recommended to me recently.  I do like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it. See such a difference in my skin. Will continue to purchase. Make sure to wear sunscreen with this product.</li>
    <li> This is so similar if not exactly as their original item and I have used these for years.  Beginning to realize though that their products have some ingredients that are not a good thing!  I.e. Parabens, etc. hope they will get rid of these things!  Love the 4% hydraqonine...</li>
    <li> I love this day lotion.  It refreshes my skin and helps my makeup glide on!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and it works as promised. I had freckles as a kid and teenager and would probably have lots of blotches now if I hadn&#x27;t started using this. Good price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this under make up cause it makes my skin looks greasy.i don&#x27;t find any benefit in terms of skin improvement after a month of using this product. I currently use the vit c serum at night and that seems will suffice for my skins need</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;My face doesn&#x27;t get dry like it used to be when I used other brands.  Everyday I got compliments from coworkers how nice my skin was.  I will continue using this product as long as my face is accepting it.  I Just ordered two more bottles.  It will Last me a while.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used this line for the last couple of years and love it. Delivered timely.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about three years and love it. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is so smooth.  I have only used it a few days along with some other Obagi products and my skin feels much smoother and looks more supple. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a difference I guess.  I will continue my use until I run out.  I am an Obagi user and have been for years, so I thought I would try the vitamin C exfoliating day lotion...but after I finish this one I will stick to the regular Obagi exfoliating lotion.</li>
    <li> The box was damaged but the container was fine.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Skin appears smother and firm with a natural glow.</li>
    <li> It makes a lot of difference on my skin!i will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product faithfully.  It does keep my skin soft and smooth.  Thank you for making it available.  Jane</li>
    <li> When I opened the box I noticed yellow, glue-like substance all around the lid.  I opened it and it was like yellow jello everywhere.  Completely foul!  Clearly the product had been tampered with.  It was opened, leaking everywhere, a toxic yellow color, old, and smelly!  I would never buy from this seller again.  NOT TO BE TRUSTED!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly the the same product I have been buying from my dermatologist and much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Love the product - purchased first from a dermatologist and then for a bargain from Amazon.  I use the Vitamin C Serum &amp; the Exfoliating Day cream and my complexion is the best it has ever been.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday with Obagi eye cream and I love it. It does seem to extend the results of microlaser peel and does not clog pores. I am 41 and have oily skin and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Product last a long time, little goes a long way. I have oily skin, and wish you had the option to buy for oily skin. I have used Obagi before and will continue to use on and off. I have been told to use lightening products for 6mo and then take a break from using products.</li>
    <li> Obagi c rx system love this lotion.</li>
    <li> I had a dark patch on my right cheek as well as a large dark freckle at the tip of my nose.  After using this product they are completely gone! I use it on my hands and arms now too!</li>
