### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all sorts of practice skins and these are the best I found.</li>
      <li>best practice skin on the market</li>
      <li>still a good buy</li>
      <li>Its a great idea and beats practicing on a living being, but having said that, it takes a lot more effort</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to buy it in bulk if I could get a good price...</li>
      <li>It is good and you can practice on it easy.</li>
      <li>downside is that the ink doesn&#x27;t take very easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I found so far.</li>
      <li>These however have a very smooth and waxy surface.</li>
      <li>way cool product, without a doubt the best, thickest, most high quality practice &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; on the market.</li>
      <li>$8),</li>
      <li>and I am glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have the Sketch logo at the top like the picture shows.</li>
      <li>and I probably will be buying more</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get them to combine shipping.</li>
      <li>I guess this is ok to use for some practice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just starting out and this is great.</li>
      <li>In the end, they&#x27;re not as good as real human skin, but better than nothing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular product even though it more costly than the others is of better quality.</li>
      <li>This skin is better then the rubber ones good to practice on and thick cam in like 3 days</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t feel like it was beat up, I used skin candy ink on it and used a 9rs for everything and the color just flowed right into the skin ...</li>
      <li>Way better than most of the thinner, cheaper, and less versatile skins out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Chinese products with better success.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to know what&#x27;s the actual brand that makes these.</li>
      <li>more than enough skin to tattoo on both sides.</li>
      <li>Soon as I was done with my first practice I was on the net ordering more ...</li>
      <li>all round good experience.</li>
      <li>I have not tried yellow or flesh tones yet to see if they show up and wish I could get more for the money because there a little high priced but over all it is a good product.</li>
      <li>Very small but very nice quality.</li>
      <li>this product worked really well</li>
      <li>get a refund i soo would even tho it isnt much.</li>
      <li>It really helps with practicing shading</li>
      <li>Shipped out fast, arrived on time, and had no problems with the seller.....</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to do that with any other practice skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most skins have a rough and dry surface, which is really good for linework and for making sure your stencil sticks, but the problem with those is that the ink smears when you wipe it, and it&#x27;s impossible to clean from the surface.</li>
      <li>The Velcro feature really allows you to learn towork with simple contours of the skin which is better than just practicing on a flat surface.</li>
      <li>It basically means you end up paying more in shipping than the actual product, which ends up being $8 per item total (item price + shipping &#x3D;</li>
      <li>I rated this a 5 only because the numbers don&#x27;t go higher in which if it did I&#x27;d give it the highest.</li>
      <li>which very few skins are able to</li>
      <li>That means you can get it perfectly clean with just a bit of green soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re also quite thick, so it feels easier to work with, and you can easily flip them over and use the other side just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of practice skins and these are the best I found. Most skins have a rough and dry surface, which is really good for linework and for making sure your stencil sticks, but the problem with those is that the ink smears when you wipe it, and it&#x27;s impossible to clean from the surface. These however have a very smooth and waxy surface. So when you wipe, the ink doesn&#x27;t stick to the surface. That means you can get it perfectly clean with just a bit of green soap. I wasn&#x27;t able to do that with any other practice skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also quite thick, so it feels easier to work with, and you can easily flip them over and use the other side just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that the ink doesn&#x27;t take very easily. But that&#x27;s a problem with all practice skins I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t hold it against it. In the end, they&#x27;re not as good as real human skin, but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on these is a bit odd. The shipping charge is per-item and I wasn&#x27;t able to get them to combine shipping. It basically means you end up paying more in shipping than the actual product, which ends up being $8 per item total (item price + shipping &#x3D; $8), and really that&#x27;s not too bad a price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be brand-less. They don&#x27;t have the Sketch logo at the top like the picture shows. I&#x27;d love to know what&#x27;s the actual brand that makes these. There is absolutely no indication anywhere on the package.</li>
    <li> It is good and you can practice on it easy. The only thing is lighter color like white you can not see. I have not tried yellow or flesh tones yet to see if they show up and wish I could get more for the money because there a little high priced but over all it is a good product.</li>
    <li> this product worked really well and I am glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Ink comes of way easier than the other skin i bought, it is also at least 3 times thicker than the other skin i purchased. Very small but very nice quality.</li>
    <li> Piece of SHIT...very dissatisfied. ..if i could. get a refund i soo would even tho it isnt much. ..i rate it i big fat ZERO</li>
    <li> I guess this is ok to use for some practice.  It is stiff though which makes it difficult to practice shading.</li>
    <li> This particular product even though it more costly than the others is of better quality. The other skins after a medium practice had left black streaks across the skin, when I was done the skin felt and still feels beat up and flimsy thin... With this skin not only were there no streaks, it didn&#x27;t feel like it was beat up, I used skin candy ink on it and used a 9rs for everything and the color just flowed right into the skin ... I wish I could upload the pics to show the difference. The only problem I had with this skin was not every line transfered over from the stencil but that don&#x27;t happen all the time on humans n skin either.. I rated this a 5 only because the numbers don&#x27;t go higher in which if it did I&#x27;d give it the highest. I ordered this skin in the morning, 3 hours later I got a shipped message and a eta and it came 2 days before that.. Soon as I was done with my first practice I was on the net ordering more ... I&#x27;d love to buy it in bulk if I could get a good price...</li>
    <li> If you wipe the ink - its basically permanently smeared on the skin. This product is completely useless - I&#x27;ve used Chinese products with better success.</li>
    <li> way cool product, without a doubt the best, thickest, most high quality practice &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; on the market. more than enough skin to tattoo on both sides.</li>
    <li> They were to hard but they did the work</li>
    <li> Its a great idea and beats practicing on a living being, but having said that, it takes a lot more effort than it should to get the ink in, and after you get it there its very hard to remove the excess ink around the tattoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting out and this is great. Way better than most of the thinner, cheaper, and less versatile skins out there. The Velcro feature really allows you to learn towork with simple contours of the skin which is better than just practicing on a flat surface. Shipped out fast, arrived on time, and had no problems with the seller.....all round good experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I found so far. It really helps with practicing shading which very few skins are able to</li>
    <li> This skin is better then the rubber ones good to practice on and thick cam in like 3 days</li>
    <li> way smaller than what I thought but works and I probably will be buying more</li>
    <li> a little misled picture shows 2 skins thought i was getting a hell of a deal 2 of these for 10 bucks (shipping included) but only received one. best practice skin on the market still a good buy</li>
