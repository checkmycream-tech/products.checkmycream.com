      <li>My mother has a $300 Chi that is not as good as this product.  </li>
      <li>and I loved it.  </li>

      <li>My family is very pleased with this product and its performance.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This one is great, and cheap (cheaper on Costco&#x27;s website, though, where I bought it.)</li>
      <li>Now it takes me 20 minutes &amp; it looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>The temperature control is real, and the quality is excellent.</li>

      <li>(I don&#x27;t trust the power converters-had too many things fried).</li>
      <li>Amazon offered to give me 50% refund, which is better than nothing I guess.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with that and expect the same out of this one.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product that has a nice comfortable grip, heats up quickly to nice and hot and does not pull my hair</li>
      <li>I used it for only 4 months and took very good care of it.  </li>
      <li>But my spouse has fine curly hair.</li>

      <li>Makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
      <li>One day, I turned it on and the light was blinking.  </li>
      <li>When I finish it&#x27;s smooth and silky and NOT DAMAGED</li>
      <li>Item is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd Metropolis flatiron and it works great.</li>
      <li>Probably the best thing about it is that it has a ten year warranty, which is amazing as long as they keep their end of the deal up.</li>
      <li>This flat iron worked great for awhile.  </li>
      <li>It is a good hair straightened but this is the second one I got and it brakes too soon.</li>
      <li>Still, for the money, it is not bad.  </li>
      <li>heats quickly and works well...</li>
      <li>Many of my clients have extremely high texture, curly hair</li>
      <li>, it really worked great... just not for very long.</li>
      <li>I had actually bought a \\&quot;chi\\&quot; straightener before I purchased my own metropolis, but after reading reviews on it, I took it back and ordered by own metropolis.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Returned for full refund and bought a Brocato - much much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the first one I bought was in 2007.</li>
      <li>simply straight hair!    </li>
      <li>I purchased this product exactly 2 months ago.  </li>
      <li>My first lasted for 4 years (it has a 2 year warranty) using it 4 to 5 times a week.</li>
      <li>and they were willing to replace the product if I returned it with a check for $25 (shipping/handling/replacement fee).  </li>
      <li>First one I received was damaged.</li>
      <li>but when I went to use it today, the iron didn&#x27;t get hot - not even lukewarm.  </li>
      <li>It has a 2 year warranty, which is why I bought it in the first place-I assumed a 2-year warranty would be indicative of a reliable product.  </li>
      <li>I bought the same one and love this one too.</li>
      <li>However, the return process was very easy and replacement item worked as well as expected.</li>
      <li>A good flat iron makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I wish was different</li>
      <li>and they always come back for their flat iron hair styles because no other iron gets the hair as smooth, shiny and straight leaving the hair in strong, healthy condition.</li>
      <li>When I get a new one I&#x27;ll be sure to put it away PROPERLY</li>
      <li>I kind of wish that I had bought one that was a little wider.  </li>
      <li>The flat is easy to hold and style your hair.  </li>
      <li>I really wish these things had auto-shutoff.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Also, it has auto-off which I love because I&#x27;m forgetful</li>
      <li>It was fast and left my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing 2 more one for our younger daughter when she goes back to school and one for myself.</li>
      <li>so I needed a new one.</li>
      <li>It was a new product in a factory box just as advertised.</li>
      <li>My first flat iron was a Metropolis one and it lasted three years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine in some places, but a little on the course side near the crown, and this straightener can straighten it all.</li>
      <li>Nothing worked, just completely stopped heating one day.  </li>
      <li>Eventually, I couldn&#x27;t stand my old \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straightener, so I went ahead and order myself one.  </li>
      <li>After 8 months, it stopped heating up completely.  </li>
      <li>Chose this iron for my wife as an upgrade to the many irons that she&#x27;s had that burned out in the first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though highly rated on reviews, this one in particular had poor build quality, with the heating element not fitting well and a gap always present and catching and pulling the hair at the end of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Why would I invest more money into a product that failed the first time?</li>
      <li>This is a more expensive flat iron but worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Our older daughter asked for this for Christmas, her younger sister borrowed it raved about it and said she was going to take it with her back to school.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Hair Stylist and have my irons on 8-12 hours almost every single day and have had this particular iron on as well.</li>
      <li>It was a good flat iron while it worked, but it is quite expensive for a product that will only last a short while.</li>
      <li>The one I purchased a few weeks ago worked very well until it just stopped working!</li>
      <li>I have super thick asian hair.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I usually get CHI hair straighteners, but they are more expensive and always break (I think I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4). Because of this, I decided to try a different straightener. This one is great, and cheap (cheaper on Costco&#x27;s website, though, where I bought it.) You can adjust the temperature which is great and you can&#x27;t do on a CHI. Also, it has auto-off which I love because I&#x27;m forgetful (once again, chi doesn&#x27;t have). Probably the best thing about it is that it has a ten year warranty, which is amazing as long as they keep their end of the deal up. Really great product. Makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener about 2 months ago.  It is a decent little straightener.  I kind of wish that I had bought one that was a little wider.  My hair is rather difficult to work with and i think it would be easier if the iron was wider.  Still, for the money, it is not bad.  I really wish these things had auto-shutoff.  I almost always remember to unplug it, but I often second-guess myself.  It would be nice to have an auto-shutoff as a backup plan.</li>
    <li> I have super thick asian hair.    Usually with the CHI it would take me about 45 minutes to do layer by layer.  Now it takes me 20 minutes &amp; it looks amazing.  Shines, no frizz, simply straight hair!    Very comfortable to hold while using, and the cord swivels and makes it easy to not get all tangled!</li>
    <li> I love this iron. the first one I bought was in 2007. I&#x27;m a Hair Stylist and have my irons on 8-12 hours almost every single day and have had this particular iron on as well. It finally gave out on me in June of 2010. I bought the same one and love this one too. It does NOT damage my clients hair because of the tourmaline plates. Many of my clients have extremely high texture, curly hair and they always come back for their flat iron hair styles because no other iron gets the hair as smooth, shiny and straight leaving the hair in strong, healthy condition.</li>
    <li> heats quickly and works well... also the 1\\&quot; is good for getting close to roots and for shorter hairstyles.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Just stopped working after 11 months, only 1 person in the house used it.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered in one day. It was a new product in a factory box just as advertised. The price was unbeatable and there was no cost for shipping.  The product&#x27;s hair treatment is superb. My family is very pleased with this product and its performance.</li>
    <li> This item is still working, i purchased this last year and it works gr8.  Great brand and great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product exactly 2 months ago.  It worked just fine yesterday but when I went to use it today, the iron didn&#x27;t get hot - not even lukewarm.  There is a list of steps to take per the Instructions for Warranty Service including &amp;#34;insuring up to the replacement value&amp;#34; and enclosing $20 for shipping and handling.  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> I already owned this flat iron, I bought this one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  It works so well and she has such long hair, but with this iron, she is finished in half the time.  Also, you cant beat the price, best price that I found</li>
    <li> I purchased the metropolis iron 1\\&quot; for my daughter for her birthday almost a year ago (that is all she wanted for her 19th birthday)  I agreed because of the 10 year warranty.  After I used hers several times, I was hooked.  Unfortunately, she took hers back to college with her.  Eventually, I couldn&#x27;t stand my old \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straightener, so I went ahead and order myself one.  I love it!  I had actually bought a \\&quot;chi\\&quot; straightener before I purchased my own metropolis, but after reading reviews on it, I took it back and ordered by own metropolis.  Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful price and is very easy to use.  Does a great job! My daughter bought a more expensive one and said that she would buy this one if she needs to replace hers.    [[ASIN:B001G8WEJU Metropolis T-Ion Tourmaline Iron, 1\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for its ten year warranty. It took over a week to arrive to my East Coast address. It does a good job of smoothing frizzy or curly hair. But my spouse has fine curly hair. The plates seemed loose and would catch strands. Every stroke of the iron snagged painfully. I returned it for a refund and purchased another iron at a local retailer.</li>
    <li> My first flat iron was a Metropolis one and it lasted three years. Then I tried another brand (still about $150), and it overheated after a few months and burned off some of my hair. So I bought this one again, and it is great. I don&#x27;t know if I will every try another brand again. The temperature control is real, and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent straightener... while it lasts.  I used it for only 4 months and took very good care of it.  One day, I turned it on and the light was blinking.  It would not heat up, tried everything to fix it.  Nothing worked, just completely stopped heating one day.  For the price I paid, I would expect it to last longer than a few months.  The exchange policy ended after 2 months, so I am stuck with this thing.  Amazon offered to give me 50% refund, which is better than nothing I guess.  If not for it breaking so soon, I would have given this straightener 5 stars, it really worked great... just not for very long.</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked great for awhile.  After 8 months, it stopped heating up completely.  This was only used by 1 person, so it&#x27;s not like it was overused .  It has a 2 year warranty, which is why I bought it in the first place-I assumed a 2-year warranty would be indicative of a reliable product.  I e-mailed customer service and they were willing to replace the product if I returned it with a check for $25 (shipping/handling/replacement fee).  Why would I invest more money into a product that failed the first time? I would not recommend this product if you are expecting to use it long term.  It was a good flat iron while it worked, but it is quite expensive for a product that will only last a short while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd Metropolis flatiron and it works great. I had tried to purchase a cheaper one in between and it was just awful. This is a quality product that has a nice comfortable grip, heats up quickly to nice and hot and does not pull my hair (all things the other one I had purchased failed on). My first lasted for 4 years (it has a 2 year warranty) using it 4 to 5 times a week. I&#x27;m very happy with that and expect the same out of this one. Highly recommended! A good flat iron makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I wish was different was I wish it could accept 120-240V (it&#x27;s only 120V) so I could take it with me when I travel foreign (I don&#x27;t trust the power converters-had too many things fried).</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because my stylist used it on my hair and I loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair feels after using this iron.  My mother has a $300 Chi that is not as good as this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased the same model for 5 times. I love how the product performs but very unhappy with life span. For those 5 times - they were all replaced in a matter of 6 months period. I&#x27;m having second thoughts now If I ever want to own this product again. I&#x27;m getting tired of replacements.</li>
    <li> Not only is this Iron easy to use because of its great craftsmanship and texture, it seems to help my hair grow.</li>
    <li> Chose this iron for my wife as an upgrade to the many irons that she&#x27;s had that burned out in the first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though highly rated on reviews, this one in particular had poor build quality, with the heating element not fitting well and a gap always present and catching and pulling the hair at the end of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned for full refund and bought a Brocato - much much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Brocato-Vibrastrait-Oscillating-Straightener-plate/dp/B004L230HI</li>
    <li> Item is fantastic. First one I received was damaged. However, the return process was very easy and replacement item worked as well as expected.</li>
    <li> Our older daughter asked for this for Christmas, her younger sister borrowed it raved about it and said she was going to take it with her back to school. I then tried it and it was also sold. It was fast and left my hair soft and smooth.  I will be purchasing 2 more one for our younger daughter when she goes back to school and one for myself.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair straightened but this is the second one I got and it brakes too soon. This last one did not even last 5 months. The first one lasted 18 months and that&#x27;s sad because in really like it but I cannot afford buying one twice a year.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I am a mixed girl with very long, kinky/curly (3b type) hair. It&#x27;s fine in some places, but a little on the course side near the crown, and this straightener can straighten it all. When I finish it&#x27;s smooth and silky and NOT DAMAGED AT ALL no matter how often I use it, which is the best part. I tried switching flat irons, but the other one (which was even a bit more expensive) fried my hair even though I know how to straighten it properly. All I can say is that this brand is flawless. One of the only straighteners I will ever use on my hair! I only give it 4 stars out of 5 because after about two and a half years of owning it, it started having a problem turning off when I was in the middle of using it, but that could definitely be because of the careless way I store it. When I get a new one I&#x27;ll be sure to put it away PROPERLY so I don&#x27;t ruin it. Note to self (and everyone else): Don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the straightener before shoving it in your drawer. /:</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few weeks ago. I had another one for about a year and a half and then the wire wore out so I needed a new one. The one I purchased a few weeks ago worked very well until it just stopped working! Horrible. I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star. So of course I returned the item. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a more expensive flat iron but worth every penny.  The flat is easy to hold and style your hair.  It curls and flattens.</li>
