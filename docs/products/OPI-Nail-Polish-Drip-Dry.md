      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Great stuff makes your cuticles and nails look nice and healthy, I just bought a larger bottle!</li>
      <li>Does just what it claims to do; dries you nails very quickly.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m used to the awesome power of fast dry top coats like seche vite and out the door</li>
      <li>This  is the real deal, drop on top of your finished polish, including the top coat, and done, this dries the polish in seconds, won&#x27;t be without from now on</li>
      <li>helps reduce drying time significantly</li>
      <li>Works great to help dry the polish quickly.</li>
      <li>Okay, maybe not that much, or even at all,</li>
      <li>This stuff works really quick and really well!</li>
      <li>I did feel that my nails were dry after a good 15 minutes of doing absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>I liked that my nails did not bubble or dry with any funny lines.</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that this really does dry your nails fast, and you don&#x27;t have to wait forever.</li>
      <li>and now I save myself a dollar for quick dry at the nail place :)</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>Something that really, really works!</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product was looking online for something to speed the process</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Drip Dry and tell everyone that will listen about it.</li>
      <li>Works very well with OPI polisshes.</li>
      <li>I really do recommend it.</li>
      <li>It saves me so much time and aggravation.  </li>
      <li>This item really does what it says.  </li>
      <li>this stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>but this stuff dries my nails so fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even more amazing because I would hardly polish my nails strictly because of the dry time, and this product has solved my problem.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The Drip Dry made it possible to have a good looking manicure in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>40 seconds after last coat, drip one or two drops, if available under uv light or fan for a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>but I think this stuff kind of sucks.</li>
      <li>The nails are not completely dry but unless you are going to start cooking or playing outside you will be fine.  </li>
      <li>I bought it as an alternative to fast dry top coats to try out some of my other non fast dry top coats but my nails took FOREVER to dry with this stuff.</li>
      <li>First off I ordered it on the Feb 26th and it arrived on March 13th.</li>
      <li>Does a fantastic job I don&#x27;t have to sit a wait it dries in less than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Not greasy or sticky and works instantly to complete a manicure .</li>
      <li>I have a 1 year old</li>
      <li>Dry to light touch within a minute or so, fully dry in about 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>so this quick dry definitely helps.</li>
      <li>This works very well without any other drying accelerator such as the UV light/fan, etc...</li>

<li> This works very well without any other drying accelerator such as the UV light/fan, etc...</li>
<li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been waiting a long time for this product and when it finally arrived there was no dropper!!!</li>
<li> I just put a couple of drops on each nail and it seem to dry quickly enough.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;rapid-dry\\&quot; topcoats before but they take as long to dry as any regular nail polish.  </li>
<li> I needed to redo my nails before work one morning and had only 10 minutes to remove old polish, apply base coat, color, and top coat.</li>
<li> Try OPI Rapid Dry...</li>
<li> You can have virtually dry nails in 15 minutes, no need for led dryers or spray stuff.</li>
<li> Two drops and your polish is dry to the touch.</li>
<li> Waiting for polish to dry is a pain, unless you&#x27;re into to sitting and doing nothing for awhile.</li>
<li> I give it two stars because it does help speed up dry time</li>
<li> A must have if you cannot wait for your nails to dry.</li>
<li> If your pressed for time and can&#x27;t wait for your nails to dry, buy this!</li>
<li> My nails are dry to the touch in 60 seconds!</li>
<li> buying this product and being disappointed I have invested in a quality top coat that is rock solid in 5 minutes.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical on how well this Drip Dry would work, but it really does!</li>
<li> and then I would get smudges, indents and all other problems that come with not allowing your nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
<li> Dries nail polish in less than a minute</li>
<li> How to get out of the salon a little quicker?  </li>
<li> I take it to the nail salon with me and save a few dollars...</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> No more smudged nails.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m usually painting my nails at night.</li>
<li> Shockingly small bottle, but a miracle drying product.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this, especially if you pay to have nails done!</li>
<li> Also if your polish seems to have lost it&#x27;s luster, a small drop and rub and nails are shiny again.  </li>
<li> Works well, too small,</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical</li>
<li> No more waiting for my nails to dry or dealing with these annoying drops.  </li>
<li> No more smuding!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase this product sooner!</li>
<li> I do use a base coat as well</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed with this product!</li>
<li> Very disappointed, will not recommend.</li>

    <li> I was skeptical on how well this Drip Dry would work, but it really does! I would not hesitate to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> How to get out of the salon a little quicker?  Or how to do nails at home before going out without smudges?  Try OPI Rapid Dry... this stuff really works.  Wait approx. 40 seconds after last coat, drip one or two drops, if available under uv light or fan for a few minutes.  Dry to light touch within a minute or so, fully dry in about 5 minutes.  Also if your polish seems to have lost it&#x27;s luster, a small drop and rub and nails are shiny again.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this, especially if you pay to have nails done!</li>
    <li> Am I the only person who thinks this product is eh!? Maybe I&#x27;m used to the awesome power of fast dry top coats like seche vite and out the door but I think this stuff kind of sucks. I bought it as an alternative to fast dry top coats to try out some of my other non fast dry top coats but my nails took FOREVER to dry with this stuff. I give it two stars because it does help speed up dry time but It just doesn&#x27;t meet my standards.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product was looking online for something to speed the process and this did just that.  The nails are not completely dry but unless you are going to start cooking or playing outside you will be fine.  I liked that my nails did not bubble or dry with any funny lines. I just put a couple of drops on each nail and it seem to dry quickly enough. I will definitely order again.</li>

    <li> Works great...I take it to the nail salon with me and save a few dollars...I would not even dare to do my own nails without this product.  It saves me so much time and aggravation.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>

The Drip Dry made it possible to have a good looking manicure in a short amount of time. I recommend this for everyone. Waiting for polish to dry is a pain, unless you&#x27;re into to sitting and doing nothing for awhile.</li>
    <li> Works great and now I save myself a dollar for quick dry at the nail place :)</li>
    <li> Shockingly small bottle, but a miracle drying product.  It&#x27;s instantaneous!  I never get a manicure now without bringing this product along with me.</li>
    <li> Combo this with Seche Vite and you got an awesome combination. You can have virtually dry nails in 15 minutes, no need for led dryers or spray stuff.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical This has changed my life. Okay, maybe not that much, or even at all, but it&#x27;s still the best thing to happen to nail polish. My nails are dry to the touch in 60 seconds! It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s even more amazing because I would hardly polish my nails strictly because of the dry time, and this product has solved my problem. I absolutely love Drip Dry and tell everyone that will listen about it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Two drops and your polish is dry to the touch.</li>
    <li> A must have if you cannot wait for your nails to dry. Works very well with OPI polisshes.</li>
    <li> I bought this because  it was OPI. It really works! If your pressed for time and can&#x27;t wait for your nails to dry, buy this!</li>
    <li> ARRIVED AS DESCRIBED.  WOULD ORDER AGAIN, THANKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KISHA M.</li>
    <li> This product does not do as promised.  The drops do almost nothing in my eyes.  I did feel that my nails were dry after a good 15 minutes of doing absolutely nothing and then I would get smudges, indents and all other problems that come with not allowing your nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this product and being disappointed I have invested in a quality top coat that is rock solid in 5 minutes.  No more waiting for my nails to dry or dealing with these annoying drops.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. I personally paint my nails atleast twice in between salon visits so this quick dry definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase this product sooner! Arrived in a timely manner and dries the nails very quickly! No more smuding!!!</li>
    <li> Great customer service at this company! The product is great too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing!!! I have a 1 year old so I&#x27;m usually painting my nails at night. I do use a base coat as well but this stuff dries my nails so fast. I wait about 5 mins and can touch my nails.</li>
    <li> Something that really, really works!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is a must for everyone.  I have used this for years and it dries within 3-5 minutes.  No more smudged nails.</li>
    <li> helps reduce drying time significantly</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps you from ruining a manicure/pedicure.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Does exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product! First off I ordered it on the Feb 26th and it arrived on March 13th. I feel like I&#x27;ve been waiting a long time for this product and when it finally arrived there was no dropper!!! How am I suppose to use this on my nails??? Pour it in?! Very disappointed, will not recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Does just what it claims to do; dries you nails very quickly. I am not a patient person and this has me looking forward to polishing my nails. Awesome price toboot!</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that this really does dry your nails fast, and you don&#x27;t have to wait forever. I had to txt my friends and tell them about this product. I really do recommend it.</li>
