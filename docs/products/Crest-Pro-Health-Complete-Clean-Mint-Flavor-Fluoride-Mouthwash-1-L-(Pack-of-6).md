      <li>I also personally can&#x27;t stand mouthwash with alcohol; I cough it all up before The recommended minute is over, so this product is perfect for my requirements :)</li>
      <li>I love this mouthwash.</li>

      <li>, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices that wouldn&#x27;t hurt my teeth, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day.</li>
      <li>I love crest toothpaste, so I decided to give this mouthwash a shot.</li>
      <li>freaked out and searched what could have darken my teeth, and many people claimed that crest pro health mouth wash browned their teeth.</li>
      <li>It would take five more days (and five more uses) for me to figure out that it was the mouthwash that was causing it.  </li>
      <li>This is an Ok product.</li>
      <li>Just as many others have commented, I also saw clumps of stuff when I spit after using this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I said yes, and she brought up many complaints about this issue with Crest Pro Health.</li>
      <li>This product severely stained my teeth very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Strong mint flavors give me a headache and stomach ache, but this mint is not too strong or overly minty.</li>
      <li>and I was fine...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to see how much it&#x27;s helping your teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a fresh flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like that it is alcohol free.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying my fresh mouth and plan to continue using this product.</li>
      <li>It sounded like such a great option how it didn&#x27;t have alcohol it in</li>
      <li>I have always had a beautiful smile and very white teeth.</li>
      <li>nothing seemed out of the ordinary and my teeth felt great!</li>
      <li>Excited to brush my teeth for a change to get the taste out, I noticed I was spitting out purple globs with my toothpaste between mouth quadrants.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it immediately and made an appointment to clean the affected teeth.</li>
      <li>The taste of the mouthwash is not bad and my mouth does feel clean.  </li>
      <li>I used this mouthwash last night for the first time, happily swishing away for 1 min as instructed.</li>
      <li>My tounge lost its sense of taste and the inside of my cheeks burned and got full of sores.</li>
      <li>I can still taste everything just fine (except for the first hour after use, but that is true for any mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;After one use my mouth DID feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>and my teeth feel fresh and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I know mouthwash isn&#x27;t supposed to be the most pleasant of experiences with the usual burn or alcohol that feels like it&#x27;s setting your mouth tissues aflame (</li>
      <li>This year, I made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and</li>
      <li>Even if it&#x27;s only a placebo effect, which I don&#x27;t know that it is, it&#x27;s a nice one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t drink wine, tea or smoke, no crazy diet changes and when I drink coffee, I always use a straw.</li>
      <li>Fun times.</li>
      <li>But if Crest Pro-Health Complete is the answer, I&#x27;d happily swish lighter fluid instead.</li>
      <li>When  I use it at night, my breath still feels fresh in the morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to rate it downward on my own personal I-knew-this-going-into-it-taste).</li>
      <li>Crest needs to do the right thing and remove it.</li>
      <li>Within 3 weeks I was checking my teeth in the car mirror and noticed I had a brown halo on one of my eye teeth, right at the gumline.</li>
      <li>Took two weeks for me to regain full taste and a healthy mouth back after I stopped using it.</li>
      <li>Definitely noticed the mildly tingling sensation of a non-alcoholic mouthwash more then the mint flavor claim.</li>
      <li>Similarly, I can&#x27;t really smell my own perfume, which I know should be strong since I accidentally sprayed half my face instead of my neck.</li>
      <li>I have more hunks, but when I&#x27;m back into routine</li>
      <li>If I use it at night only, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I am not the only one who had issues with this product.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 3 years straight (other than right after I moved at the start of the year, where I grabbed the first Crest bottle I saw without looking at it and it was a different kind, sob).</li>
      <li>Really, it could taste like rotted fish for all I know because the fruits don&#x27;t even register to my taste buds.</li>
      <li>but I used the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>like I burned the whole thing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why everytime I rinse my mouth, then spit it out-purple clumps are in my sink (no matter how much I shake the bottle before using it).</li>
      <li>I literally have bumps, redness, swelling and blistering in my whole mouth, even under my tongue.</li>
      <li>Wonder how much this is going to cost me now!!!&lt;br /&gt;CB</li>
      <li>Numbs your tongue so much.</li>
      <li>We like this so much in my house</li>
      <li>My whole family uses this.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; tasting.  </li>
      <li>never used mouthwash, but recently started couponing and the crest pro-health products were practically free.</li>
      <li>I am in so much pain.</li>
      <li>I have been using this mouthwash for two weeks now and really like it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more comment on some of the other comments.  </li>
      <li>My gums were bleeding for the first time ever and my teeth were sensitive.</li>
      <li>a bit of a disclaimer, I&#x27;m not a big mouthwash connoisseur, so I&#x27;m not picky as to whether it has to be &#x27;fresh mint&#x27; or spearmint, alcohol or alcohol-free.  </li>
      <li>Obviously doing the right thing is not in their dictionary.</li>
      <li>Not sure why... also, when you spit, make sure that the water is on.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
      <li>I bought this mouthwash at my local supermarket because it was on sale and it appeared to do the same thing as the Listerine Complete clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never before used a mouthwash and was actually looking forward to the same clean, fresh feel I typically have after a cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is NOT a flaw in the product but rather a BENEFIT as you can clearly see that it loosens and washes out particles your toothbrush misses.</li>
      <li>They would shed off naturally anyway.</li>
      <li>It does make my teeth sensitive too, though.  </li>
      <li>but no statement that it might cause food to seem completely flavorless.</li>
      <li>Even brushing my tongue and the roof of my mouth didn&#x27;t get rid of the aftertaste completely.</li>
      <li>I spat, and then--following with the bottle&#x27;s instructions--resisted the natural urge to rinse again with water.  </li>
      <li>I had to spend an hour having these stains removed by a dental professional.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even drink my glass of water before bed as I usually do, like a good little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>From the very first time I noticed that there were little clumps in the mouthwash when I spit it out.</li>
      <li>The dentist saw my teeth and immediately asked if I recently started a new mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>there&#x27;s barely any.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink alcohol or coke or coffee, I am only 20 years old and despite this my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been smoking for YEARS.</li>
      <li>It felt different from the usual experience, but nothing significant to note.</li>
      <li>Boy did I get far more scary results than I would have ever imagined.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now. Morning and night daily basis. I&#x27;ve noticed that the between my teeth have browned!&lt;br /&gt;I freaked out and searched what could have darken my teeth, and many people claimed that crest pro health mouth wash browned their teeth. I can&#x27;t only think of any other reason other than that it is crest pro health mouth wash. I have same daily routine except using the pro health mouth wash for last 3 months. It sounded like such a great option how it didn&#x27;t have alcohol it in but it was the most horrible decision to buy one, also it always numb your taste after rinsing with this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 3 years straight (other than right after I moved at the start of the year, where I grabbed the first Crest bottle I saw without looking at it and it was a different kind, sob). I&#x27;ve had the best results from the dentist I&#x27;ve ever had. The taste isn&#x27;t terrible (I don&#x27;t like any mint flavor - be it peppermint, spearmint, or wintergreen, so I will never say it smells/tastes good, but that&#x27;s on me so...your mileage may vary - I&#x27;m not going to rate it downward on my own personal I-knew-this-going-into-it-taste). There&#x27;s no BURNING which is AWESOME. Listerine ALWAYS burned me and made it hurt. I hated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also have a weird obsession with the chunks that can happen. I read up and asked the Crest people, and there&#x27;s an enzyme in it that binds with bacteria and gross stuff, so when you spit it out you&#x27;ll sometimes notice hunks. I&#x27;ve always noticed that if I go a day or two without brushing - say I&#x27;m on vacation and I forget my tooth brush and because I&#x27;m an introvert loser I&#x27;m too nervous to call the front desk and ask for a courtesy tooth brush - I have more hunks, but when I&#x27;m back into routine there&#x27;s barely any. Anyway, don&#x27;t worry about that stuff. It&#x27;s nice to see how much it&#x27;s helping your teeth. Even if it&#x27;s only a placebo effect, which I don&#x27;t know that it is, it&#x27;s a nice one.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I am not the only one who had issues with this product.  I had loss of taste, and then an odd taste for hours, my teeth turned brown, and my gums and lip were stripped of the sensitive tissue they are lined with.  This product was awful!  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on until I realized I switched mouthwash and I switched because I was trying to heal a small cavity.  Boy did I get far more scary results than I would have ever imagined.  I am praying a hygienist can get these stains off my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for two weeks now and really like it. When  I use it at night, my breath still feels fresh in the morning. No more of that stale morning mouth! I also like the taste. Strong mint flavors give me a headache and stomach ache, but this mint is not too strong or overly minty. It&#x27;s more of a fresh flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any of the problems the other reviewers describe. No staining and I can still taste everything just fine (except for the first hour after use, but that is true for any mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;I do see a few purple pieces when I spit, but it&#x27;s just dead skin cells. They would shed off naturally anyway. It&#x27;s not like this mouthwash is eating a hole in your cheek. I am enjoying my fresh mouth and plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This stained my teeth horribly. Avoid it like the plague. I used it for a month and then I noticed my bottom teeth were brown with dark brown in between each. This is ridiculous. Google this product and &amp;#34;brown stains&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34;. Crest has had hundreds of complaints about this product but still does not remove it from the shelves. FDA won&#x27;t remove it because it&#x27;s not life threatening ... stained teeth won&#x27;t kill you but it will kill you&#x27;re confidence. Crest needs to do the right thing and remove it. Obviously doing the right thing is not in their dictionary. Because their is complaints on this product going back several years. Very Sad!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth! I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices that wouldn&#x27;t hurt my teeth, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day. This year, I made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine. I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store? Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine! I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating and cut back on coffee as another resolution, so I know that wasn&#x27;t the culprit. I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem! How Crest can continue to market this product is beyond me, and their PR response is a patronizing joke. &amp;#34;Dirty teeth means it&#x27;s working&amp;#34;, indeed! Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains. Shame on you, Crest/P&amp;G!</li>
    <li> We like this so much in my house I buy six at a time here on amazon.  This brand does the job and does not.burn or irritate gums.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 days, once in the morning, and once at night before bed.  Aside from the small purple flakes that materialize during the cleaning process, I also began to notice an odd, chemical/metallic taste to everything I was eating or drinking.  Water, almonds, coffee, breakfast shakes, and even sandwiches did not taste as they should. I would not reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon, but from Vons. I used it a few times and noticed my tongue feeling numb. I imagined it was just something else. I stupidly used it before going to sleep and I woke up in the middle of the night feeling as if I had repeatedly bitten into my tongue. Now moving it around is painful. I recommend not buying this product and throwing it away if you have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everytime I rinse my mouth, then spit it out-purple clumps are in my sink (no matter how much I shake the bottle before using it). For a couple of days I was doing fine then one night when I used the mouthwash I had this awful bitter aftertaste for the whole night. Then in the morning when I brushed my teeth, my tongue felt \\&quot;burnt\\&quot;. You know when you drink/eat something hot and your tongue feels rough and numb. Like that.</li>
    <li> I know mouthwash isn&#x27;t supposed to be the most pleasant of experiences with the usual burn or alcohol that feels like it&#x27;s setting your mouth tissues aflame (talking about you, amber antiseptic mouthwash.) But if Crest Pro-Health Complete is the answer, I&#x27;d happily swish lighter fluid instead. Actually, I&#x27;m not sure there is any difference--this might actually be lighter fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bit of a disclaimer, I&#x27;m not a big mouthwash connoisseur, so I&#x27;m not picky as to whether it has to be &#x27;fresh mint&#x27; or spearmint, alcohol or alcohol-free.  This unfortunately lead me to pick up this product which my cruel dentist had recommended. I used this mouthwash last night for the first time, happily swishing away for 1 min as instructed. It felt different from the usual experience, but nothing significant to note. Definitely noticed the mildly tingling sensation of a non-alcoholic mouthwash more then the mint flavor claim. I spat, and then--following with the bottle&#x27;s instructions--resisted the natural urge to rinse again with water.  I didn&#x27;t even drink my glass of water before bed as I usually do, like a good little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I noticed I woke up with a strange dryness and odd taste in my mouth. Almost like I was doing keg stands at the local frat house and my mouth was still recovering. Excited to brush my teeth for a change to get the taste out, I noticed I was spitting out purple globs with my toothpaste between mouth quadrants. So this mouthwash&#x27;s purple dye will hang out in your mouth for hours. Well, like a well-informed idiot, I grabbed for the stuff and swished again. Now I noticed even bigger globs of dark purple mucus/tissue/saliva now exiting my mouth and finally got concerned. It was probably brought on by the fact that my tongue also felt strangely coated and numb, times five now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is where I am now, eating my absolutely tasteless fruit salad. Really, it could taste like rotted fish for all I know because the fruits don&#x27;t even register to my taste buds. Similarly, I can&#x27;t really smell my own perfume, which I know should be strong since I accidentally sprayed half my face instead of my neck. But you know how that goes: diminished taste, diminished smell--and vice versa. This could be used for eating really healthy foods if you don&#x27;t like their taste, but when texture is all you&#x27;ve got, mealtime gets weird. Even drinking water tastes awful. In fact, everything tastes awful. My own saliva is constantly pooling in my mouth to expel the bad tast. It&#x27;s all JUST AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, even two usages can lead to all of the awful side effects that other reviewers here have claimed. I can&#x27;t imagine what Crest was thinking when they created this product. What do know is, as soon as I get home, it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Numbs your tongue so much. I only use this at night and can still feel the effects in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a bit over a year now and it is great.  I am not sure what all the complaints are about regarding after taste, it leave my mouth minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more comment on some of the other comments.  The &amp;#34;bits of whatever&amp;#34; you see when you spit out the mouth wash are food particles that get colored purple by this mouth wash.  I find that if I eat a pasta dinner, the next morning I see these dark purple tiny chucks in the after rinse.  This is NOT a flaw in the product but rather a BENEFIT as you can clearly see that it loosens and washes out particles your toothbrush misses.</li>
    <li> I purchased this upon the recommendation of my dentist who wanted me to use a fluoride rinse to provide additional protection against cavities. I&#x27;d never before used a mouthwash and was actually looking forward to the same clean, fresh feel I typically have after a cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use my mouth DID feel clean and fresh. It also felt as though I&#x27;d rinsed with gasoline, as my tongue, cheeks and gums felt NUMB! Worse, the next morning my breakfast had no flavor. My coffee had no flavor. Orange juice had no flavor. This continued, and got WORSE over the course of the next two weeks, all the while with my tongue feeling numb and  kind of \\&quot;metallic\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became concerned and questioned my dentist who said that others had had similar complaints, which I verified by searching online. I&#x27;ve since switched to a competing brand with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, though, is EVIL EVIL evil!!!!</li>
    <li> The taste of the mouthwash is not bad and my mouth does feel clean.  The bad part is I used it in the morning and the ENTIRE day my food and drink hardly had any flavor.  If I use it at night only, it&#x27;s okay.  It does make my teeth sensitive too, though.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to something different.</li>
    <li> I would give this line of mouthwash negative stars if possible.  I have always had a beautiful smile and very white teeth. I get complimented and asked what products I use all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I never used mouthwash, but recently started couponing and the crest pro-health products were practically free. I began using the toothpaste and moutwash, thinking I was doing something good for myself.  Within 3 weeks I was checking my teeth in the car mirror and noticed I had a brown halo on one of my eye teeth, right at the gumline. I also had a lower molar that looked as though it had been soaked in tobacco and coffee for years. I&#x27;ve never had stains like this. My tongue was sore, always felt burnt. My gums were bleeding for the first time ever and my teeth were sensitive. I didn&#x27;t put 2 and 2 together until I googled &amp;#34;stains at gumline&amp;#34;. Aside from finding lots of horrific articles about decaying teeth I stumbled upon all horror stories of crest pro health. I stopped using it immediately and made an appointment to clean the affected teeth. The hygienist noted the stannous fluoride and acknowledged it can indeed stain. After the most aggressive cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had, the stain is 95 percent removed. I can not believe a product meant to&lt;br /&gt;Improve oral health caused such a potentially damaging side effect.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I used a crest toothpaste with the plastic grains and one became imbedded in my gums. It looked like a blue spot.  Fun times.</li>
    <li> I began using this product after having it recommended to me by my dental hygienist. From the very first time I noticed that there were little clumps in the mouthwash when I spit it out. Later I began losing my sense of taste and realized that it was actually pieces of flesh coming out with the mouth wash. I also developed painful bumps on my tongue and gums and my whole mouth felt like it had been burned by a hot drink. After an internet search I discovered that this is a common problem with this product. If I could give it less than a 1 I would. Worst product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This product severely stained my teeth very quickly.  Purchased it by mistake due to the color (meant to buy a different product).  Had to make an appointment for a cleaning.  My hygienist and the folks in the dental office were shocked that my usually white teeth were so dingy.  My hygienist had not seen this type of issue before except with a prescription fluoride product needed by folks with servere periodontal disease. Total nightmare.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash i ever use love it</li>
    <li> Good value, great product. My whole family uses this.</li>
    <li> Just as many others have commented, I also saw clumps of stuff when I spit after using this mouthwash. I thought it was sort of odd- I never noticed any pain or sores in my mouth. The stuff was the consistency of nasal mucus and the color of the mouthwash. I did not buy again... but I used the whole bottle. Hindsight 20/20? It tastes awful and there are better- and cheaper options that are still non-alcohol and with fluoride such as [[ASIN:B001H54RB0 ACT Restoring Anti Cavity Fluoride Mouthwash Spearmint, 33.8 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]].</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, and I noticed my teeth started to stain brown.  I&#x27;ve never had such staining before and hadn&#x27;t changed my eating/drinking habits.  The dentist saw my teeth and immediately asked if I recently started a new mouthwash.  I said yes, and she brought up many complaints about this issue with Crest Pro Health.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  I purchased this product two weeks ago and now have brown stains on my teeth just like other users are reporting.  Crest needs to take this product off shelves until this issue is addressed.</li>
    <li> My teeth are horribly stained after the use of this product. I look like a smoker. My teeth are brown and look like they are rotting. I am appalled that this product is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know for a fact that this product caused the change in my teeth. I brush and floss daily and have never had any cavities. I have never had oversensitive gums go to the dentist about twice a year. My checkup this year was LAST MONTH and they were cleaned. I have never had any problems with my teeth. I have always had perfect teeth and cannot afford to go days without brushing- I&#x27;m uninsured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference in my diet or lifestyle has been introducing this mouthwash into my daily dental care routine. The first time I used it, I should have known that it was bad. My gums bled and I spit out strings of blue, afterwards my tongue was numb. It burned terribly. I attributed it to the killing of germs and effectiveness- days went by and the burning sensation went away but am still left with numbness. I continued to use it but now my teeth are BROWN AND I am so done with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink alcohol or coke or coffee, I am only 20 years old and despite this my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been smoking for YEARS. And this is after using this product for about 2-3 WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product. I will be uploading pictures of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Huh, I am surprised by all of the terrible reviews, to be honest. I like the taste, it does not burn my mouth, nor does it stain my teeth... I think it works well and my teeth feel fresh and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. A lot of the previous reviews complain about stains from the stannous fluoride that Crest used to use in it - they no longer do; it&#x27;s been replaced by sodium fluoride now, which doesn&#x27;t stain teeth. I&#x27;m happy about this, because I love the flavor &amp; need a fluoride rinse mouthwash for my cavity-prone teeth. I also personally can&#x27;t stand mouthwash with alcohol; I cough it all up before The recommended minute is over, so this product is perfect for my requirements :)</li>
    <li> IT IS THE ONLY MOUTHWASH I EVER USE!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely do I take the time to review a product, but this is the worst product I have ever purchased. THE WORST. The morning after I started using it, I lost all sense of taste. Took me two days to figure out what was causing it. There&#x27;s a disclaimer that it might cause brown teeth on the bottle (which I assumed was from the fluoride) but no statement that it might cause food to seem completely flavorless. I could go eat ghost peppers and wash them down with a bottle of Tabasco and would not notice a think. I am considering entering one of those spicy food contests on television, because I could win.  I only wish I had read these reviews before I purchased it. Not only will I never purchase this product again, I will never purchase anything from Crest again.</li>
    <li> STAINED MY TEETH IN TWO WEEKS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I started using and after two weeks noticed staining on my teeth, I quit using it about 3 weeks ago and the stains won&#x27;t go away, even after using Crest whitening rinse. Plus I have braces so now I&#x27;m sure my teeth are going to be two colors. I&#x27;m furious......... Wonder how much this is going to cost me now!!!&lt;br /&gt;CB</li>
    <li> For weeks, I could not figure out why everything tasted \\&quot;off\\&quot; and why my tongue constantly felt similar to being-- turns out, this mouthwash was the culprit. I had an ongoing metallic/bitter taste in my mouth. Great for losing weight-- nothing tasted good and I had no desire to even drink my coffee every morning! I was looking for an alcohol free mouthwash and this fit the bill, unfortunately, the awful side effects forced me to dump it down the drain. Took two weeks for me to regain full taste and a healthy mouth back after I stopped using it. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an Ok product. It seems to be healthy for your teeth, and the taste when you&#x27;re using it is good, but after you use  it,there seems to be this strong metallic after-taste. It is alcohol free, which is good, but sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don&#x27;t. Though it has some advantages over Listerine products, overall I would rank it below Listerine.</li>
    <li> This product is beyond belief TERRIBLE. Save yourself all the trouble and DO NOT BUY!  This product stained my teeth terribly, I should have noticed the warning on the back of the bottle that does in fact say it could stain your teeth (it says stains can only be removed by a dental hygenist).  I had to spend an hour having these stains removed by a dental professional.  Terrible, terrible  product. Crest should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash at my local supermarket because it was on sale and it appeared to do the same thing as the Listerine Complete clean.  I thought, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?&amp;#34;  Well I rinsed with it for a day and I was fine...nothing seemed out of the ordinary and my teeth felt great! But two days later, my tongue was burning (it still is), is discolored, and I have sores on my gums.  I have VERY good dental hygiene and I didn&#x27;t have sores or severe pain before this God forsaken mouthwash.  Moral of the story: DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to save your taste buds.  That&#x27;s the last time I even consider buying Crest products.</li>
    <li> I am extremely upset about the results of using this product. For several days, my taste has been off, my tongue has felt weird, raw, like I burned the whole thing. Next I noticed my gums were peeling in long strings. It didn&#x27;t hurt, it was just gross and looked awful. Now today after using this product for about a week, my gums are all red, raw, and blistered. I literally have bumps, redness, swelling and blistering in my whole mouth, even under my tongue. I will never use this product again and will be telling my friends and family not to either due to this horrific experience. I am in so much pain.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE! I used this product one time and it burned the inside of my mouth. My tounge lost its sense of taste and the inside of my cheeks burned and got full of sores. Pieces of flesh ripped off inside my mouth! I called poison control because the burning wouldn&#x27;t stop hours after use. Please save yourself the nightmare this product caused me. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to use! This product is a health hazzard!</li>
    <li> Hi..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good mouth wash.  It isn&#x27;t very \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; tasting.  I can use this twice a day with no side effects.  I do recommend to rinse mouth out with water (after brushing teeth) before using the product.  If you don&#x27;t, you may get bits of mouth wash clumps in your mouth.  Not sure why... also, when you spit, make sure that the water is on.  This is because the mouth wash can stain the inside of your sink.  Well, its really not a stain..but it can mark your sink puple...  to avoid this, run the water while spitting.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my teeth had Brown stains until I saw all the other reviews. I just went to the dentist today and my hygienist asked about my mouthwash...I would have never thought this could have been it. I don&#x27;t drink wine, tea or smoke, no crazy diet changes and when I drink coffee, I always use a straw. The bottle does warn about stains, but I never thought Brown! Maybe purple. Well, we couldn&#x27;t figure it out until now. Will definitely be staying away from this.</li>
    <li> I love crest toothpaste, so I decided to give this mouthwash a shot. I only used it once. It left a horrible aftertaste and my tongue tingled the entire evening. As I lie in bed trying to fall asleep, two hours after using it, the aftertaste still lingered. I had to get up and brush my teeth again. Even brushing my tongue and the roof of my mouth didn&#x27;t get rid of the aftertaste completely. I was thinking of giving it another chance, but I won&#x27;t after reading the other reviews about brown teeth. Come on Crest... Your products have been good quality until now. Don&#x27;t give up quality like every other company, please.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist has noticed an improvement since I started using this. I like that it is alcohol free. The bulk price was very nice.</li>
    <li> I too am someone who purchased this mouthwash and ended up with brown, discolored teeth.  I had only used the product about five days before I noticed something was wrong with my teeth.  It would take five more days (and five more uses) for me to figure out that it was the mouthwash that was causing it.  It didn&#x27;t even cross my mind that something designed to help teeth was making them look like they were rotten.  I even had a friend ask me what was wrong with my bottom teeth.  I was so embarrassed.  I will never recommend this product to anyone unless Crest addresses this problem and changes the ingredients.</li>
