### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>I was very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Even though I have fair/medium skin, I prefer the &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; color as it leaves a beautiful tint on my skin and even distracts from some of those spider veins.  </li>
      <li>Excellent &amp; easy to use!</li>
      <li>I would have to say &amp;#34;ditto&amp;#34; to all the good comments and just add that it has come off on my clothing</li>
      <li>It is a good product just wished it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>It was streak free and had a beautiful glow, enhancing the skin.</li>
      <li>Excellent Product - thanks!</li>
      <li>I have super fair skin and this product looks great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Love, Love,  Love!  </li>
      <li>Do I need to say more?  </li>
      <li>- FOR THE MONEY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER</li>
      <li>Love everything about this product</li>
      <li>My wife loves this product says it goes on easily</li>
      <li>It is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the effort</li>
      <li>She says it has a beautiful shimmer, covers minor imperfections &amp; really enhances her naturally olive skin.</li>
      <li>Also when held up against the light I noticed the tube was only 1/2 full.</li>
      <li>It covers skin discolorations pretty well.</li>
      <li>I have been waiting for this product my whole life - a tinted moisturizer for the BODY that has sunscreen but is not a self-tanner!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shown up on many of my clothes in the past</li>
      <li>And so far, it has not rubbed off on my clothing or the furniture.  </li>
      <li>I use it everywhere except my face and it looks so natural.</li>
      <li>Even with the little bit of residue it is well worth it!  </li>
      <li>Only giving 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t live up to its name - not a miracle and not a transformer.</li>
      <li>It covers minor flaws and gives a natural glow.  </li>

<li> so I start a little earlier now.</li>
<li> just wipe palms off with wet cloth, so as not to remove product from tops of hands.</li>
<li> Fairly thick lotion.  </li>
<li> Was disappointed, I thought once dry it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on clothes</li>
<li> I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT</li>
<li> Not one bit fake, either.  </li>
<li> and I hate the smell of self-tanning creams.</li>

    <li> It was streak free and had a beautiful glow, enhancing the skin.</li>
    <li> Love, Love,  Love!  Do I need to say more?  Only Con is the Price.  Bought a double pack of this at Costco the 1st time (gave one to my Sister who also loves it!-..Cant find anymore at any Costco I&#x27;ve looked at- so Amazon it is!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. I am not a tanner and I hate the smell of self-tanning creams. Miracle Body Transformer gave me a hint of color on my legs.  No stickiness,  no smearing. And it lasted all day.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this product my whole life - a tinted moisturizer for the BODY that has sunscreen but is not a self-tanner!  I have super fair skin and this product looks great.  Not one bit fake, either.  And so far, it has not rubbed off on my clothing or the furniture.  It is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product - thanks!</li>
    <li> I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT - FOR THE MONEY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE - WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp; easy to use!</li>
    <li> It is a good product just wished it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It instantly gives you a transformed look. I use it everywhere except my face and it looks so natural. Just give it ample time to set in and dry. It&#x27;s shown up on many of my clothes in the past so I start a little earlier now. Definitely worth the effort you will glow!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years.  It is wonderful!  I would have to say &amp;#34;ditto&amp;#34; to all the good comments and just add that it has come off on my clothing but I never thought about &amp;#34;buffing&amp;#34; it.....as one of the reviews mentioned.  I think that would just do the trick and I will do that next time.   Even with the little bit of residue it is well worth it!  It covers minor flaws and gives a natural glow.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands....just wipe palms off with wet cloth, so as not to remove product from tops of hands.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product</li>
    <li> Was hoping it was waterproof.</li>
    <li> This product leaves you skin glowing.  Even though I have fair/medium skin, I prefer the &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; color as it leaves a beautiful tint on my skin and even distracts from some of those spider veins.  Hope they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product says it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t come off on her clothes or bedding when she buffs it after it dries, it stays put until she showers. She says it has a beautiful shimmer, covers minor imperfections &amp; really enhances her naturally olive skin. She hates to wear nylons, none are necessary with this product.</li>
    <li> Next time I&#x27;ll order the darker shade.</li>
    <li> It covers skin discolorations pretty well. Fairly thick lotion.  It does have some glittery shimmer to it.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed, I thought once dry it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on clothes but it did when I wore shorts. However it does come out in the wash. If you can handle that, it does enhance the look of your legs.</li>
    <li> Only giving 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t live up to its name - not a miracle and not a transformer. This does not darken or conceal flaws so I still have to use self tanner and I use this just as a sunblock. Also when held up against the light I noticed the tube was only 1/2 full.</li>
