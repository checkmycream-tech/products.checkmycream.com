      <li>Makes my hand so soft</li>
      <li>Used to be able to get this product line at Target, then I could get it at Sephora, now I can order it only a few places online and</li>

    <li> OMG, what is this I ordered? I do believe the package I received was outdated and old. Smelled exactly like cooking oil! I&#x27;m pissed about it due to the price..... Paying 11.99 for a tube of vegetable oil</li>
    <li> AMAZING smell, feel and excellent moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of hand creams over the years looking for the best product, and this hand cream is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have severely dry hands and this works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, just a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I received a sample at a local beauty store and fell in love with this product...recommended!</li>
    <li> But the dang thing is over priced. I got it for my GF you didnt really like it. Then I talked to other women who were saying I paid way too much for it. I got GOT.</li>
    <li> VERY convenient size packaging.  Smells okay, but way too pricey.  I much prefer buying Bath &amp; Body Works hand and body creams.  Better scents (and a variety of them), works great on dry hands and so much cheaper.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had extremely chapped, dry, flaking, peeling skin on my fingers. My hands used to be so dry they would bleed. I was in tremendous pain. I tried Hand Food and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in just a few days of use. I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand and type of lotion on the market, even special ointments geared for men who work with their hands and get calluses. I&#x27;ve even tried prescription creams. Nothing works as good as Hand Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every skin type is the same, and I&#x27;m not saying this lotion will work as good for you as it has for me, however, the minute is hits my skin it soaks in and my skin feels hydrated. As long as I don&#x27;t wash my hands, this hydration lasts a long time. If I use it regularly (during the day and before bed) I actually see it repairing my skin and helping form new, moisturized skin. The beautiful fragrance is a bonus. It smells SO good! It&#x27;s like a perfume, but light and it smells soap clean. This lotion is non-greasy and soaks in fast (the more you rub it in the faster it soaks in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my miracle hand lotion. I hope and pray the company never changes or reformulate it. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This lotion is my absolute favorite. I was devastated when they stopped selling this at Sephora, so glad Amazon had it! Makes your hands feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, the handcream is great, not greasy, smells awesome and it&#x27;s nice to have a small size tube of the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; scent in my purse if I want to dab a little behind my ears (which I do.) I sometimes rub a little in my palms then run my hands through my ponytail...great little trick.This line of products it getting harder and harder to find/buy. I love the pink scent, it&#x27;s a classic. I use Philosophy Grace products, too. If you like them, you&#x27;ll probably like this. Both are pretty scents that get warmer as you wear them, quality oils and they fade nicely. I alternate between products. Used to be able to get this product line at Target, then I could get it at Sephora, now I can order it only a few places online and the shipping times can be a bit long. I wanted to buy the large tub of body butter and the delivery date was about 3 weeks out! I had to pass. I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I really like this product. I used it while working on a three week construction project. My hands maintained their softness and flexibility during the process. My husband uses it too after. His maintainable projects!</li>
    <li> I work in the service industry and struggle every winter keeping my hands from cracking, and this winter has been worse than ever- my hands have basically shredded around my knuckles and down the side of my hands.

I plan on keeping this item well in stock over the next few months, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with how it turned out! Well worth the price, especially compared to the other 5+ products I&#x27;ve been using these past few weeks.</li>
    <li> Nice travel size hand lotion.  Very softening and smells clean! I have one on my desk and one in my purse!</li>
    <li> Best hand cream EVER.  Keeps my dry hands moisturized (without greasiness) and smells divine.</li>
    <li> Makes my hand so soft</li>
    <li> I will have to say it is a good hand lotion but I just can not get past the scent.I have a hard time using it because I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.so if smells are not an issue for you you will like this</li>
    <li> Love this - wish they still sold it at Target</li>
    <li> I live in a city where the wind and cold air does horrible damage to the hands, so with that being said i began to go on a hunt for a good hand moisturizer and stumbled upon soap and glory&#x27;s hand food. I have seen youtube videos about it and decided to go sample some at my local sephora. clearly a great decision as to i purchased two of them and have been recommending to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M 66 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE THE DRIEST SKIN ON THE PLANET, NEXT TO ANIMALS, LOL....SO JUST IMAGINE HOW MANY LOTIONS..POTIONS..CREAMS AND HOME MADE REMEDIES I HAVE TRIED OVER THE YEARS.... FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL GET ME SOME AND&lt;br /&gt;SAY THEY KNOW THIS WILL WORK..I ALWAYS TRY, I WISH OVER MY LIFE TIME  I WOULD HAVE KEPT TRACK OF REMEDIES COSTING 99 CENTS.....&lt;br /&gt;TO 30.00 AND 40.00 DOLLARS A JAR.........  JUST 2 DAYS AGO ANOTHER FRIEND GAVE ME A TUBE OF THIS PRODUCT, SEEING THE CRACKED  CORNERS ON SOME FINGERS...AND YES, I&#x27;VE GONE TO BED WITH DIFFERENT PRDUCTS ON MY HANDS IN GLOVES...VERY TEMPORARY RESULTS..&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE REALLY HELP MORE IF I WORE THE GLOVES 24/7....BUT COME ON NOW, LOL...............&lt;br /&gt;  BOTTOM LINE.................IT WORKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Smooth and we&#x27;ll scented. I need some more body sugar scrub and lotion</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever had! It moisturizes perfectly, leaving my hands soft and silky. And it leaves behind a wonderful floral scent!</li>
    <li> This is a rip off! It&#x27;s not the same lotion and WAY overpriced. You can get it for $7 at Sephora! I smells like cheap, gross lotion and is definitely not Hand Food. Do not buy!</li>
