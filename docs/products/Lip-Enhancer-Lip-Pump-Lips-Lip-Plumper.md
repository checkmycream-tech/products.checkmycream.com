      <li>You must use lotion on the seal ring and be sure to have chapstick on before you attempt to suction.</li>
      <li>Broke after first use!!!</li>
      <li>Although the seller is super nice &amp; helpful</li>
      <li>Get the original Luscious Lips instead,  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>and I get full lips and more volum ..</li>
      <li>I opted to get this in an effort to save money, but I made a huge error in doing so.  </li>
      <li>Cheap flimsy product.</li>
      <li>I suggest the seller include detailed instructions for use, otherwise I could not recommend the product.</li>
      <li>no way my lips could even possibly fit in it to plump.  </li>
      <li>So far is good for the price and your lips do get plump</li>
      <li>I had the original which got lost.  </li>
      <li>ORIGINAL</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to use!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice and gives a natural look!  </li>
      <li>I really like the easy use of this device</li>
      <li>She tried hot water to swell the seal</li>
      <li>I would recommend watching a tutorial first before purchasing it.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>also I think my face is a bit small, I have to really make sure no air is getting in between my cheeks to be able to get the right plump.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought from a diffrent more expensive seller and it worked magic, this one is just cheap and doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
      <li>this one not so much.</li>
      <li>and I have all of the legal designations to prove it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.  </li>
      <li>I liked this Lip enhancer, you have to do reapplied a few time if you want your lip plump the whole day</li>
      <li>It might have been this one particular item that was faulty.</li>
      <li>First off the product is HUGE and covers half of my face...</li>
      <li>I use several strategies to seal the suction and improve results but w/o success.  </li>
      <li>but you have to get it in the right position, figure out how to create suction and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>yet it did not create ANY suction what so ever:(&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
      <li>The seal that goes around lips is to large an shaped wrong so it doesnt provide a good seal for plumbing &amp; gives poor results...wish i could find the company that made my first one...</li>
      <li>Good sellet but bad product&lt;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does not even out BOTH lips. And its massive try carrying that in your purse. I would recommend watching a tutorial first before purchasing it. And the box came unsealed and no instructions, I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service!!! A+++</li>
    <li> Broke within two days. Does not create a good suction.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!no suction no nothing!</li>
    <li> I liked this Lip enhancer, you have to do reapplied a few time if you want your lip plump the whole day also I think my face is a bit small, I have to really make sure no air is getting in between my cheeks to be able to get the right plump.On the 2nd day I notice some bruising on my lips but it went away the next day. So far is good for the price and your lips do get plump is a good option for people that dont want any permanent change.</li>
    <li> ITS NICE BUT NOT AS ADVERTISED</li>
    <li> to big for face could not get sucktion at all</li>
    <li> it doesnt work, dont waste your money. i didnt like this product at all.</li>
    <li> sucked doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and gives a natural look!  ;)</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these lip plumpers &amp; itworked great...this one not so much. The seal that goes around lips is to large an shaped wrong so it doesnt provide a good seal for plumbing &amp; gives poor results...wish i could find the company that made my first one...it was great...this one was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Sorry, no stars! The Lip Enhancer did NOT enhance. It might have been this one particular item that was faulty. I am, however, very happy with your service. Thanks.  Belle</li>
    <li> Does not work! Waste of money</li>
    <li> being a trans lady of extreem for my life and shows, this product works great, i&#x27;ll recommend it to all my lady friends.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this device does not do as advertised.  The tolerances are such that there is NO suction created for plumping lips.  I had the original which got lost.  I opted to get this in an effort to save money, but I made a huge error in doing so.  Don&#x27;t get this.  Get the original Luscious Lips instead,  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s broken or it just fake lip pump it works not really u can&#x27;t let is stay for 2sec because it looks like it&#x27;s broken</li>
    <li> You will have to go to youtube to get directions!! But I haven&#x27;t found one bad review there than people who didn&#x27;t know how to use it properly. I searched youtube until my product arrived &amp;#60;3 Finally its here after I tracked it everyday until it arrived!! Fast and easy to use! Can&#x27;t wait till 2 weeks when full results take effect!!</li>
    <li> There is no change in my lips at all. I just can&#x27;t seem to get it to enhance my lips.</li>
    <li> Device arrived with no instructions and I was unable to detect any results with its use.  I use several strategies to seal the suction and improve results but w/o success.  I suggest the seller include detailed instructions for use, otherwise I could not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This works well but you have to get it in the right position, figure out how to create suction and use it daily.  It is amazing how it plumps my lips.</li>
    <li> Another copyright violation of my product. The photo is mine and this company is using it to sell you a product made in China. I want this infringement stopped. Luscious Lips Lip Pump is my red lip device and I have all of the legal designations to prove it.</li>
    <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing, this product DOES work!!!  You must use lotion on the seal ring and be sure to have chapstick on before you attempt to suction.</li>
    <li> This is a TOTAL rip off.  First off the product is HUGE and covers half of my face...no way my lips could even possibly fit in it to plump.  But, secondly, the photo, which totally misrepresents the size of the product you actually get,  is a copy write of Cynthia Rowland&#x27;s Luscious Lips.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i received my stuff on time and loved it</li>
    <li> The title sums it all..</li>
    <li> Although the seller is super nice &amp; helpful this product just wanant good. I&#x27;ve bought from a diffrent more expensive seller and it worked magic, this one is just cheap and doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> It different and left me with a purple lips ( mouth)</li>
    <li> It truly does plum your lips up. I was hoping it&#x27;d bring the end parts of my lips out since i feel that my lips aren&#x27;t small they r just... Uhm inward? (Hope that makes sense) and it achieved what I wanted it to by plumping the ends of my lips</li>
    <li> These are ok, not so great but I&#x27;ll keep using them!</li>
    <li> product doe not work. no suction</li>
    <li> Cheap flimsy product. The suction stopper is plastic and should be rubber so all the air escapes creating 0 suction. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> My wife said it did not work. Did not draw any suction. She tried hot water to swell the seal but instead it came apart.</li>
    <li> I just received this lip plumper and i did everything the instructions said to, yet it did not create ANY suction what so ever:(&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I did not work for me, maybe my lips are to small sad:(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s CRAPPPP BUYER BEWARE WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> You need to try other product intead of this, doesn&#x27;t wiorks</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all, it did not do anything, no results at all.</li>
    <li> It just like a 15 mins plump and it hurts ur lips !</li>
    <li> Useless.&lt;br /&gt;It inflate the lips for several minutes also I felt it change the shape of the teeth and drag out</li>
    <li> Just a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it .. It&#x27;s just for tow hours</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with My (Unpracticle) Purchase. I&#x27;ve bought other &amp;#34;Lip Enhancer/Plumpers&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;they are simple (pop on &amp; off) &amp; gives same results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m embarrassed that I did purchase this product.</li>
    <li> its very very very nice and its perfect</li>
    <li> Was broken and s***y.</li>
    <li> Makes you look like a clown for about 15 min. Then your lips look shriveled and gross.</li>
    <li> IF your face is slender, it is difficult to get a suction for this device to work.</li>
    <li> I really like the easy use of this device and I get full lips and more volum .. but there is a bit side effect  .. this device cause hickey marks around my lips .. another thing it lasts just one hour and half .. but may be if i do it reguallarly it will work better</li>
    <li> Broke after first use!!! Extremely disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> The inside ring didn&#x27;t make it to the 2nd day. And the pressure isn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I had to glue it together. It didn&#x27;t exceed nor meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I did not buy this device on this site but want to warn every potential buyer it is dangerous, causing two major and atleast three minor broken veins in my lower lip. I look like I was punched in the mouth. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Good sellet but bad product&lt;br /&gt;NOT ORIGINAL</li>
