    <li> My mother has dementia and does not walk. We use this on the times she refuses to get out of bed . This ointment is fantastic. When she came to stay with us from the nursing home two years ago, she had bed sores since using this product she has not had any. thank you. I would recommend this for anyone whether it is infant to elderly who has to stay in bed for a while.</li>
    <li> If you want smooth hands &amp; feet this is a great product. S jones</li>

    <li> Best diaper cream ever.  Have tried the ones from the company that rhymes with &amp;#34;Aveno&amp;#34; and this is much better.  I use as preventative and for when the bottom has a heat rash.  No smell and applies easily.  Used to have it special ordered from a local pharmacy but amazon is cheaper; so happy!</li>

    <li> Protects skin as it should. Not to light and not to thick. Foes the job every time and lasts.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful product !  Used it for my mom and dad when they were sick and bed ridden. Then I started using it for myself. I have to keep a few tubes on hand because it works so well for use on dry skin and keeping wetness out.</li>

    <li> This cream is great for healing pressure sores!  I started using it for that, and if I use it regularly, it can prevent the sores from forming. Nice consistency cream, and no strong perfume odor!  I was glad to find it available on Amazon!  The price for the large tubes is a huge help!</li>
    <li> We have used this cream for almost five years,  It&#x27;s thick and provides a protective layer on areas that could turn into bedsores but haven&#x27;t. Plus it seems to have healing properties on areas that are red.  It&#x27;s gone up in price again.  It has worked so well that we have been reluctant to change to something else cheaper.  We will just have to evaluate the cost as we go.</li>
