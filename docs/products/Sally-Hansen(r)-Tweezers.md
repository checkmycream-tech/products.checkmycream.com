      <li>very good product.</li>
      <li>Very good for the price.  </li>
      <li>incredibly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not that great.</li>
      <li>I have these tweezers and love them!  </li>
      <li>It is amazing and gets every hair.</li>
      <li>Absolute best ingrown hair remover!!!</li>
      <li>Does a great job at an economical price.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love these tweezers.  </li>
      <li>My favorite tweezer I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Just what i hoped for and SO very useful!</li>
      <li>Best tweezer ever for getting very short or fine hairs.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a general pair of tweezers that are great for eyebrows, I reccomend [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The tips are not that fine</li>
      <li>\\&quot;newer model\\&quot; of this item is nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>Easy to grab and the right amount of sharpness.</li>
      <li>When I first purchased these tweezers, they were my absolute favorite go-to tweezers!</li>
      <li>I have 3 pairs of these I love them so much</li>
      <li>but they are still a whole lot better than these Sally Hansen pointed tip tweezer -</li>
      <li>The old pointed tips were amazing - much sharper than other brands and could easily tackle even the smallest or more stubborn hairs.</li>
      <li>Has a tiny tube to stick on top when storing, so you don&#x27;t stab yourself.</li>
      <li>but this one is not letting me pluck a hair like the first ones I have.</li>
      <li>he didn&#x27;t like the sharp tips, but that&#x27;s what I really liked about it.</li>
      <li>Its very sharp and precise so its easy to get stray hairs.</li>
      <li>B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze]] for removing the shortest hairs, but the ends of the Tweezerman tweezers are very fragile and can be easily ruined.  </li>
      <li>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t pick the Sally Hansen Stray Hair tweezer for short hair and fine hair removal.  </li>
      <li>While the new version still has pointed tips, the tips are much more dull and cannot grab hairs easily.</li>
      <li>Not sure why there are good reviews for this product although it sounds like earlier models may have been better than the current one.</li>
      <li>I am in love with it and cannot go back to any other tweezer.</li>
      <li>I bought these to replace my old Revlon pointed tip tweezers because I thought they&#x27;d lost their ability to tweeze ---</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering another for my 14 year old daughter that uses mine all the time because she doesn&#x27;t like the slanted one&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve bought her.  </li>
      <li>The new ones were not precise enough to easily pull out stubborn hairs.</li>
      <li>The tweezers have trouble grasping a coarse hair, and have no chance at a fine one.</li>
      <li>It seems they have changed manufacturers or something, because the new ones I got had the same packaging and name, but the tip was waaay less sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>I feel extremely let down, seeing as how nothing on the packaging communicated the fact that they had changed characteristics of the item in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to sharpen them slightly myself using the edge of a pair of scissors, and I found that helped quite a bit.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are fantastic for getting tiny tough hairs.</li>

<li> Too long to hold it</li>
<li> These tweezers are too sharp (they&#x27;ve caused two puncture wounds where I tried to remove tiny hairs), and now they&#x27;ve started clipping the hair off at the point where I grasp it with them.</li>
<li> I have several other tweezers that I&#x27;ve bought</li>
<li> I do like the fact that the tweezers come with a small clear plastic tip that you can place over the tweezers when not in use.</li>
<li> Sharp,  but not needle points.  </li>
<li> I must warn you that these are very sharp</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
<li> They are very sharp and precision point on the end for getting just the thing you want!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> as long as I remember it is a needlepoint I can get to the smallest splinters. very good product.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.  Well-made tweezers. Has a tiny tube to stick on top when storing, so you don&#x27;t stab yourself.</li>
    <li> Sorry! Sharp,  but not needle points.  The tips are thick and rounded.  I actually ordered 2 pairs.  Neither pair meets expectations.</li>
    <li> Absolute best ingrown hair remover!!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fantastic for getting tiny tough hairs. I already have a pair, I came back to buy a second pair for our camper. I must warn you that these are very sharp</li>
    <li> Not that great. Too long to hold it and it doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair well.</li>
    <li> Where did they have these made, some dirt alley in Pakistan? These tweezers are too sharp (they&#x27;ve caused two puncture wounds where I tried to remove tiny hairs), and now they&#x27;ve started clipping the hair off at the point where I grasp it with them. IRRITATING.</li>
    <li> Best tweezer ever for getting very short or fine hairs.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.  These are the only ones that I will use.  They are very sharp and precision point on the end for getting just the thing you want!  I have 3 pairs of these I love them so much</li>
    <li> I already have the same tweezers and wanted a second on...but this one is not letting me pluck a hair like the first ones I have.</li>
    <li> Its very sharp and precise so its easy to get stray hairs. Its definitely a woman&#x27;s necessity. You should have one, maybe two.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at an economical price.</li>
    <li> I’m going to be blunt. There is no reason to buy these. The tips are dull. The tweezers have trouble grasping a coarse hair, and have no chance at a fine one. Sorry Sally, you should stick to nails. Not sure why there are good reviews for this product although it sounds like earlier models may have been better than the current one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  The tips are not that fine and I found that there was a lot of folicle breakage with these - that, of course, leads to irritations. I like [[ASIN:B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze]] for removing the shortest hairs, but the ends of the Tweezerman tweezers are very fragile and can be easily ruined.  Whatever you do, don&#x27;t pick the Sally Hansen Stray Hair tweezer for short hair and fine hair removal.  If you are looking for a general pair of tweezers that are great for eyebrows, I reccomend [[ASIN:B003WRRONE Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip # 1046-47 (Lifetime Guarantee), 1 Pack]].</li>
    <li> Just what i hoped for and SO very useful! Easy to grab and the right amount of sharpness. I keep it in my purse!</li>
    <li> When I first purchased these tweezers, they were my absolute favorite go-to tweezers! The old pointed tips were amazing - much sharper than other brands and could easily tackle even the smallest or more stubborn hairs. When I recently went and purchased another pair, I got home and opened them up only to be left incredibly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;newer model\\&quot; of this item is nothing like the original. While the new version still has pointed tips, the tips are much more dull and cannot grab hairs easily. I feel extremely let down, seeing as how nothing on the packaging communicated the fact that they had changed characteristics of the item in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to sharpen them slightly myself using the edge of a pair of scissors, and I found that helped quite a bit. I do like the fact that the tweezers come with a small clear plastic tip that you can place over the tweezers when not in use.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace my old Revlon pointed tip tweezers because I thought they&#x27;d lost their ability to tweeze --- but they are still a whole lot better than these Sally Hansen pointed tip tweezer - don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> My favorite tweezer I have ever owned. It is amazing and gets every hair. I am in love with it and cannot go back to any other tweezer.</li>
    <li> I have these tweezers and love them!  I&#x27;m ordering another for my 14 year old daughter that uses mine all the time because she doesn&#x27;t like the slanted one&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve bought her.  They are the only one&#x27;s I have found that will get those stubborn hairs. I have several other tweezers that I&#x27;ve bought and they can&#x27;t compare to \\&quot;The Stray Hair Beware\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my tweezers here, I got a bunch of them on clearance at a store. they are the BEST tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used in my life! However, I recently was on a trip without them and I went to walgreens to buy them again. It seems they have changed manufacturers or something, because the new ones I got had the same packaging and name, but the tip was waaay less sharp and precise. Another reviewer said she/he didn&#x27;t like the sharp tips, but that&#x27;s what I really liked about it. The new ones were not precise enough to easily pull out stubborn hairs. So the different \\&quot;generations\\&quot; of these tweezers is the reason why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
