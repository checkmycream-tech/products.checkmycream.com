      <li>Liked this as lot ink on very much</li>
      <li>It is non sticky and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Nothing like this fabulous scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, non-greasy lotion</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful, my husband has very dry skin due to prescription medication and this product has helped greatly.</li>
      <li>so light, clean, fresh and lovely.</li>
      <li>I love the scent - it smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>this is vey nice lotion, high quality and</li>
      <li>-but what makes it unique is the scent.  </li>
      <li>had originally bought it in 2003 at Disney World, Orlando, Fl.  </li>
      <li>I know we are all different, but how anyone thinks this is a clean and pleasant scent is beyond me.</li>
      <li>I stumbled across this gem of a company just by reading so many positive Amazon reviews and basing purchases on that.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;fragrance, so fresh and light, the lotion makes by arms and legs soooooo</li>
      <li>It is a nice non perfumey smell that gets complimented frequently.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and thus lotion absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>I love this smell so much.</li>
      <li>I always hear how fresh and clean it smells.</li>
      <li>She liked it so much, I order more this year, which obviously suited her quite well.  </li>
      <li>It leaves such a nice clean smell on your skin.  </li>
      <li>this lotion smells good but did nothing for my very dry skin</li>
      <li>Worth the money and the Amazon price</li>

      <li>Love this not only smells good, works on entire body.</li>
      <li>The olive leaf fragrance is not too green, but pleasant and does not interfere with your perfume.</li>
      <li>Olive Leaf is a very unusual scent.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got a beautiful subtle smell....</li>
      <li>really!</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I love the earthy smell for daily use.</li>
      <li>The lotion is rich and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>To date Goldleaf is still my favorite, but who wants to wear the same fragrance every day?  </li>
      <li>Goldleaf has a softer, very feminine smell and aura to it, wheras Olive Leaf is a more bold, but certainly not over-powering fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Every Thymes product I&#x27;ve bought online has been a positive experience.  </li>
      <li>I  have used this cream for a couple of years,love the smell and it makes my skin feel very soft,great product</li>
      <li>I love using either one and plan on trying other Thymes lotions as time goes on.  </li>
      <li>Hands down my favorite lotion....</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling like silk, especially if used right after the shower.  </li>
      <li>I also live the shower gel and the hand soap.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and texture of this lotion, I treat myself to it when I have a little extra money to spend.</li>
      <li>Subtle fragrance, fine quality!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on the exact ingredient that gives this lotion such a unique smell, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has an unusual scent that lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It feels and smells exactly the same for less money.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion last year, and gave it to a dear friend who likes clean, subtle but lasting fragrance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Liked this as lot ink on very much</li>
    <li> Thymes products are not sold locally in my rural area.  I stumbled across this gem of a company just by reading so many positive Amazon reviews and basing purchases on that.  Every Thymes product I&#x27;ve bought online has been a positive experience.  Olive Leaf body lotion is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing fragranced body cremes and lotions.  They aren&#x27;t as overpowering as cologne.  Olive Leaf is a very unusual scent.  It smells very clean, but there&#x27;s an unidentifiable overtone that adds some sharpness and sophistication.  It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on the exact ingredient that gives this lotion such a unique smell, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wear [[ASIN:B001LF4CYS Thymes Goldleaf Body Cream - 9.25 fl oz]].  To date Goldleaf is still my favorite, but who wants to wear the same fragrance every day?  Goldleaf has a softer, very feminine smell and aura to it, wheras Olive Leaf is a more bold, but certainly not over-powering fragrance.  Both lotions are thick and moisturizing and their scents have all-day staying power.  I love using either one and plan on trying other Thymes lotions as time goes on.  The outer packaging on Thymes products is always tasteful and I&#x27;ve found they are perfect for gift-giving too.</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion about 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s a light, non-greasy lotion -but what makes it unique is the scent.  It&#x27;s unique and lovely.</li>
    <li> Love this not only smells good, works on entire body.</li>
    <li> I just love this scent!...And my Hubby does too. I have finally changed from Estee Lauder to this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My Thymes Body Lotion arrived as promised.  I have been using this product for several years and was happy to be able to get it online.</li>
    <li> Not only does this lotion have an incredible, sophistocated scent, but it lasts throughout the day.  It leaves skin feeling like silk, especially if used right after the shower.  Worth the money and the Amazon price is better than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  I&#x27;ve paid $28 for it in stores.  I also love the Goldleaf scent and the Lavender.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I get very nice compliment&#x27;s about the scent not being over powering and very clean smelling. It also leaves my skin feeling very smooth for hours.</li>
    <li> Nothing like this fabulous scent.</li>
    <li> First-class body lotion with good moisturizing capability.</li>
    <li> YOu can&#x27;t beat this pleasantly fragranced lotion.  It is non sticky and goes on smoothly.  For an indulgence, treat yourself sometimes.  The olive leaf fragrance is not too green, but pleasant and does not interfere with your perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a fine, effective body lotion, but I love it most for its exotic&lt;br /&gt;scent: subtle, unobtrusive, but long-lasting. A wonderful, head-&lt;br /&gt;clearing aroma.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this lotion!</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite lotion....it&#x27;s got a beautiful subtle smell....not overpowering or coying at all. I use it daily</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion last year, and gave it to a dear friend who likes clean, subtle but lasting fragrance. She liked it so much, I order more this year, which obviously suited her quite well.  (I like it, too.)</li>
    <li> Subtle fragrance, fine quality!  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Much better deal buying the hand lotion though.  It feels and smells exactly the same for less money.</li>
    <li> My mom sent me this lotion while I am on deployment. It smells wonderful...clean and fresh and absorbs nicely into your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Delivered in two days!</li>

Tried finding it locally for a couple years.

    <li> Absolutely wonderful, my husband has very dry skin due to prescription medication and this product has helped greatly. Will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> Every time I put this on, some asks &amp;#34;what smells so good&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s the best scent and really does help with moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described. I love the fragrance.  It has an unusual scent that lasts a long time. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The smell is Devine. My skin is so soft and thus lotion absorbs nicely. I did not get that greasy feeling when using it. I get compliments on how nice I smell almost on a daily basis. I will buy this again and again. I also live the shower gel and the hand soap. I love this smell so much.</li>
    <li> THE most amazing lotion and scent. I&#x27;m all in with this one.</li>
