      <li>But, I wanted to show this is use, so you could see what it looks like, which is why I&#x27;m using it, even though it&#x27;s meant for someone who takes better care of their skin than I</li>
      <li>Although the product did not have directions with it, I was able to find how to use the product on the Amazon product page.</li>
      <li>I thought she meant vitamin pills:&#x3D;).  </li>

      <li>/&gt;+High quality applicator that gives you great control over how much you squeeze out&lt;br</li>

      <li>This has a very nice, clean, mild smell.</li>
      <li>have very fair, very sensitive skin, and am 41, so have fine lines...</li>
      <li>So I think this 1 ounces goes farther than most 1 ounces - I&#x27;ve used some face creams that don&#x27;t go on that smooth</li>
      <li>This SK-II sinks in, leaves your skin feeling basically perfect, and keeps it moisturizer</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that my skin is in even better condition, and many fine lines (especially around the eye area) are completely gone and others are greatly diminished.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no rubbing in, skin absorbs it easy and feels plump and moist immediately after applying.  </li>
      <li>It dries very quickly and does not leave the face feeling greasy or oily.</li>

      <li>the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being over fifty, I have my share of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>my face felt nice for about 10 minutes after I applied it, but it did nothing else POSITIVE for me.</li>
      <li>I think I would have to use it for a longer time to tell if it really gets rid of wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t have that many to begin with...yet!  </li>
      <li>I anticipate that continued use will bring a huge improvement to my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;#1 think I like about this SK-II is it goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is a soothing, light serum made up of Hyaluronic acid and</li>
      <li>bottom line: If you have the disposable income and enjoy putting in every effort to improve your appearance, go for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And, in my video, I forgot to mention how this smells, which is important for me.</li>
      <li>The serum is odorless and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>When the chance to review this product for free came along, it was irresistible.</li>
      <li>The packaging for something with this kind of price tag is also very pedestrian.</li>

      <li>This is a fantastic skin product that makes you feel like you had a spa treatment every day.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would say that SK-II is a good product that does make the skin feel better and smoother, but it does cost quite a bit</li>

      <li>started using SK-II when I was back in Asia, where SK-II was very popular.</li>
      <li>The serum is silky smooth, and the moisturizing effects are long-lasting,  The reddish tones in my skin are greatly diminished, and minor defects have begun to disappear.  </li>
      <li>This product is truly unique.</li>
      <li>I apply it to clean skin in the morning and evening.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Going on, it&#x27;s a light to medium thickness gel that perhaps dispenses a bit too quickly.</li>
      <li>In fact, it felt cool and soothing when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A lady who gave me a facial told me vitamin C is good for the skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this SK-II for about 1 month now and I do like it but I&#x27;m not sure I $170 like it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 think I like about this SK-II is it goes on smooth.  The smoothest of any face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Squirt just a little and it glides effortlessly across your face and then dries non-greasy.  So I think this 1 ounces goes farther than most 1 ounces - I&#x27;ve used some face creams that don&#x27;t go on that smooth and I end up using multiple pumps to get full  coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No scent that I can detect which is what I prefer.  Actual skin results are good for me - my skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using this - less blotchy, less oily, overall healthier (manly) glow about me ;p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, I like this SK-II face cream - it works well for me.  My dilemma will be when I run out - do I pop the $170 or not?  I think that depends if between now and then I find an inexpensive face cream that I like better (please lord).  Overall 4-STAR rating from me in consideration of price/value.</li>
    <li> This SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C is amazing...I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be as impressed as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, very sensitive skin, and am 41, so have fine lines...but my bigger issue is the roughness and unevenness of my skin texture.  Also, every product seems to irritate my skin, or if it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, it isn&#x27;t effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is incredible...my skin is very dry (especially now in the winter), and the moisture I get from it is amazing.  It is not greasy at all, either...greasy wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily bother me at this point if a product worked, but I find that greasy usually translates into the product coming off your skin easily.  This SK-II sinks in, leaves your skin feeling basically perfect, and keeps it moisturizer the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light -- it&#x27;s an almost sheer white serum or light liquid gel (hard to describe!), with no evident fragrance or needless color added.  It soaks into your skin immediately, but my skin (which again is very dry) doesn&#x27;t feel like it is still &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; for more product.  I definitely think it reduces the appearance of fine lines, because of the way it restores a balanced, moisturizer texture to the skin...nothing makes skin look older than dryness, I think.  It really smooths my skin out, too...which is really saying something, since I have rosacea and smooth skin was something I didn&#x27;t think would be possible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so I am an instant fan!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey...but it just may be worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel of my skin using SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C. First I noticed that my skin &#x27;plumped out&#x27; so that it looks healthier and fine lines weren&#x27;t as visible. Then, I noticed the color and tone were improved. My skin looks smooth and natural without makeup. I don&#x27;t have the nerve to actually go without makeup, but I could, with no shame. A minute or so after applying the Facial Treatment, my face feels soft and fine lines are less visible. That&#x27;s a short-term benefit, but using SK-II products over the longer term, at least 12 weeks, produces more lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without SK-II products. This one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using SK-II products when I was introduced to them by samples when I bought other cosmetics. I think they are amazing. The SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C goes on as a lightweight serum, the better to transport the excellent ingredients to where they need to be so they can reconstruct damaged skin and build collagen. That takes time, of course. It contains pitera and hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing beats hyaluronic acid for hydrating skin, which keeps it supple and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the pitera is that workers in a sake brewery in Japan had beautiful, non-wrinkled skin while their faces were wrinkled with age. It turns out that they had their hands in this &#x27;pitera&#x27; all day. The idea was then to see if it worked to prevent and/or reduce wrinkles on faces as well. It appears to do that beautifully!  I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
    <li> I was prepared to be skeptical about the effectiveness of this skin repair serum from SK-II, mainly because of the hefty price. However, I was very pleasantly surprised at its almost immediate positive effect on my skin. After only a week of use, my face is perfectly hydrated, and my skin actually glows. It is also extremely soft. No other product I have used has ever yielded these stunning results. Upon use, the serum is quickly absorbed into the skin, so there is no oily or greasy residue. The pump dispenser on the bottle makes it easy to use just the amount you need, with no waste. And, most importantly, there is no scent to irritate sensitive skin. This is a fantastic skin product that makes you feel like you had a spa treatment every day. I highly recommend it. UPDATE: Have been using the product daily for several months now. I am happy to report that my skin is in even better condition, and many fine lines (especially around the eye area) are completely gone and others are greatly diminished. If you can afford just one bottle of this wonderful serum, then give yourself a gift and purchase it for yourself. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, multi-purpose product.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating and smooth, but not heavy&lt;br /&gt;Good content of acids, but not irritating&lt;br /&gt;High quality packaging&lt;br /&gt;Pump dispenser allows you to get just the amount you need with no waste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the price. If you want a simple C serum in a more affordable price range, Mychelle Perfect C is my go-to. But you&#x27;d still need an excellent hydrating serum. I haven&#x27;t found a serum that hydrates as well as this one. The multi-purpose function of this product makes the price a bit more worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a major skincare regimen nut, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of stuff at all price points. This product is truly unique.</li>
    <li> I like the SK-II Facial Treatment Repair well enough that it&#x27;s earned a place in my daily routine. I&#x27;m not sure &amp;#34;Facial Treatment Repair&amp;#34; really does it justice...it&#x27;s more like a moisturizing primer - goes on silky-smooth and softens while filling in the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going on, it&#x27;s a light to medium thickness gel that perhaps dispenses a bit too quickly. In the winter&#x27;s dry air, it absorbs quickly into your skin, leaving it moisturized, smooth and silky. The effect lasts a long time, without leaving your face oily at the end of the day the way some other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite expensive, but the good news is that a very small amount goes a long way. Really no more than a few drops is enough, so a single ounce will last quite a while. Definitely worth a try if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> Using this product is a really pleasant experience.  The serum is silky smooth, and the moisturizing effects are long-lasting,  The reddish tones in my skin are greatly diminished, and minor defects have begun to disappear.  Flakiness  is gone completely.  I anticipate that continued use will bring a huge improvement to my skin tone.  The treatment is costly, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  It may be worth it for the results.</li>
    <li> I tried the SK-II Facial Treatment Repair for almost a month.  The first thing I noticed after just a few days of use was some of my redness went away.  It also did make my skin feels very smooth when I used it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any reduction in wrinkles, though.  I have always used Cetaphil to soften my skin and I would say that my skin felt at least as soft using this.  And, the skin redness is still gone.  I think I would have to use it for a longer time to tell if it really gets rid of wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t have that many to begin with...yet!  I do find it to be a little sticky on my hands so I have to wash my hands after I use it.  Overall, I would say that SK-II is a good product that does make the skin feel better and smoother, but it does cost quite a bit and you do have to keep using it.  If it works well for your wrinkles, though, the price value overall may be a good deal.  Way cheaper than plastic surgery for sure!</li>
    <li> UPDATE after 2 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve upgraded my review to 4 stars, because I&#x27;ve found that yes, SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C DOES actually reduce the appearance of FINE lines. It took over a week of generous application (two pumps&#x27; worth for the whole face) to see a difference, but the effect was pretty clear (if I was peering from a distance of 10\\&quot; in a well-lighted room), especially since I was only applying it to half my face and used the other half for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to say that it IS a superb moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out (and I&#x27;m fairly prone to break-outs with many face lotions), and I&#x27;m slowly overcoming the lack of instructions (one reason for downgrading my rating) through personal experience. But it didn&#x27;t help anything that could remotely be construed as an actual wrinkle on my skin, and I remain dubious about whether a casual acquaintance would ever notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: If you have the disposable income and enjoy putting in every effort to improve your appearance, go for it. You will see small results on the finest of lines and you will have dewy soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL review:&lt;br /&gt;This is an early review after 3 days&#x27; use. Expect an update after 2 weeks, and perhaps again at 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test subject, I figure I&#x27;m pretty ideal: early 50&#x27;s with fine lines rampant all over my caucasian fair-skinned face. I have never used expensive products, but since I have sensitive skin I feel like I&#x27;m going all out with my Olay for Sensitive Skin lotion at $10 for 6 ounces. When the chance to review this product for free came along, it was irresistible. At last, I could run with the big dogs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so we know I&#x27;m a newbie. I get the precious box (pretty packaging, yes) and open it up to look for the instructions. Uh, instructions, where are you? Nada. Okay, I pop over to Google and find the \\&quot;how to use\\&quot; link. This is what we get: \\&quot;Pump 1-2 times on palms and massage onto face and eye area in an outward motion, concentrating on dry and rough areas. Lightly tap around your face for complete absorption. Use morning and night after your beauty essence.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um, \\&quot;beauty essence\\&quot;? What the heck is that? Does that mean I go ahead and do my usual routine (wash face with cleanser, apply home-made \\&quot;toner\\&quot; of 70% water, a dollop of glycerine and 30% witch hazel) and then apply this? Is beauty essence my usual lotion, and this goes on top? Should I apply this to my super-sensitive eyelids? A little more help here would have been, well, helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;ve been washing, toning, and then applying one pump&#x27;s worth of SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C on one half of my face (eyelids included), and my usual lotion on the other half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the SK-II page describes, this product is a gel. It&#x27;s actually a clear odorless gel that feels slippery and slightly tacky, and smooths on easily. It takes a few minutes longer than my regular lotion to dry on my face. So far (3 days&#x27; worth of application, twice a day) it has not irritated my skin, so it appears to pass the sensitive test (at least for me). It&#x27;s winter, and the skin on the SK-II side of my face has not felt stiff or dry. As a moisturizer, I give it high marks. (Although I do have to wonder, if \\&quot;skin is deeply moisturized for 24 hours\\&quot; as their website says, why do I have to apply it twice a day?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has a pleasant sheen to it, which might not be desirable for those who don&#x27;t like a shiny look. I try to think of it as \\&quot;moist and dewy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A question I&#x27;m left with is, how long does it take for this stuff to minimize my fine lines? I would prefer a product that supplies instant results, and with a lack of instructions saying \\&quot;use for a minimum of x weeks to see visible effects\\&quot; I&#x27;d have to guess that this stuff fits in the instant category. Yay. I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now we get to the big question: how are my fine lines doing? Are they minimized? I asked an impartial (although cautious) husband to look carefully (and only at the fine lines, not the big obvious wrinkles) on each side of my face to see if he could see a difference. After a 40-second-long careful comparison in good lighting, he woefully shook his head. \\&quot;I can&#x27;t tell the difference.\\&quot; Hmm. Stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Mrs. Js)vious wrinkles) on each side of my face to see if he could see a difference. After a 40-second-long careful comparison in good lighting, he woefully shook his head. \\&quot;I can&#x27;t tell the difference.\\&quot; Hmm. Stay tuned!    (Mrs. Js)</li>
    <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewers are thinking -- this product is one of the worst facial products I&#x27;ve ever used. Perhaps they are experiencing the placebo affect due to how expensive this treatment is. I used it for an entire month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Your face feels nice for about 10 minutes after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The product doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use it. It doesn&#x27;t even come with claims on the packaging about what it will do for you. What does it repair? At what point in my beauty routine should I apply it -- before moisturizer? After moisturizer? Instead of moisturizer? Do I pat it on? Keep it away from my eyes? ONLY use it on my eyes? Is it for oily skin? Dry skin? What exactly does it \\&quot;repair\\&quot;? I searched online to find the company&#x27;s website but it has no help in English. In fact, the only guidance I found was a few Youtube videos but they were in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have rosacea, dry skin, and large pores. This treatment did nothing for my pores, didn&#x27;t moisturize my dry skin any better than Olay, and worst of all, IT AGGRAVATED MY ROSACEA HORRIBLY! Not only have I had small rosacea bumps 2-3 times per week, but I&#x27;ve been getting these large, painful super-bumps that at first seem like pimples but behave like rosacea. These super-bumps take TWO WEEKS to heal and in the meantime nothing helps to cover them. It&#x27;s been awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The price of this product is outrageous. If you think by paying more you&#x27;re going to \\&quot;pamper\\&quot; yourself, you are wrong. Just put that money in the shredder -- it&#x27;ll be better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;Made my rosacea much worse, no instructions for use, and outrageously expensive. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because, yeah, my face felt nice for about 10 minutes after I applied it, but it did nothing else POSITIVE for me.</li>
    <li> WOW! I feel spoiled people! It started with a search for a substance that&#x27;s good for the skin in 1970; but in Japan in 1980, a product was developed.  In 2014 it evolved, resulting in a great product that is good for your face.  SK-II Facial Treatment Repair C is spoiling me fast.  I put it on hours ago, and my skin is moist!  No moisturizer today.  A lady who gave me a facial told me vitamin C is good for the skin.  I thought she meant vitamin pills:&#x3D;).  1.0 FL OZ, I&#x27;m being careful not to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful product contains&lt;br /&gt;1. Pitera (vitamins, amino acids, organic acids that synergies to beef up the skin&#x27;s natural surface.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Amino acids to moisturize&lt;br /&gt;3. Minerals for skin texture&lt;br /&gt;4. Organic acids (alleviates dead skin cells for bright, translucent, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels and smells clean and clear, and is a thick liquid rendered with a spray spout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being 60 now, I am just starting to move into skin products that people recommend.  I am at the point where my eyes are puffy, dark circles, and some wrinkles around eyes, cheek, and around lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last for awhile.  I still intend to moisturize over it when it sinks into my skin.Now my dry facial skin has humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Stunningly luxiourious pampering! What a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using SK-II when I was back in Asia, where SK-II was very popular. They are famous for fulfilling Asian women&#x27;s needs for silky, youthful looking skin aside from their premium price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as how I remembered it, this serum delivers exactly what it says it would. Like any serum, it goes onto my skin very smoothly. After about ten seconds for absorption, the skin immediately feels silky and so pampered. And, it It does not feel uncomfortable, greasy or heavy at all. The next day after I wake up, my skin feels and looks so alive. It has only been three days since I started, and I have not changed anything else in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in the northeast with the harsh winter air outside and dry heat inside, keeping the skin hydrated is truly a challenge. After only a few days, I already noticed a difference on my skin texture. My skin looks more hydrated and more &amp;#34;awake.&amp;#34; If the budget allows, this would be an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I have never used anything on my face that has left it as silky smooth and soft as the SK-II does. I use it under my makeup and I find that I don&#x27;t have to apply a primer before my make up. My sensitive, acne prone skin loves it. I just hit my 40&#x27;s and I am starting to see fine lines on my face. The years of sun and harsh acne chemicals have been a disservice to me but I feel that even a splurge such as this is exactly what it needs and has been begging for. I will continue to use this morning and night and put off Botox for as long as possible!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the SK-ll Facial Treatment Repair now for about a month.  It is a non-greasy gel that practically glides on.  There&#x27;s no rubbing in, skin absorbs it easy and feels plump and moist immediately after applying.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference in my skin tone (I have melasma) or fine lines but maybe it takes more than a month.  What I have noticed is that my skin feels a little softer and smoother.  And, my skin is much less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was surprised that I was able to use this with no reaction.  In fact, it felt cool and soothing when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is expensive,  a little goes a long way.  I use two pumps, and that is enough for my face and neck.  If you can afford it, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely worth every penny. Through the course of 3/4 of one standard-sized bottle, I have eliminated the need to wear foundation; blemishes have disappeared; the appearance of all lines has reduced drastically; my complexion is far more even; and my skin is much healthier and dewier. A little goes a very long way. I use it daily. I&#x27;ve had the bottle for almost three months, and expect to get another month&#x27;s use out of it with no trouble.  This is absolutely worth the price - I have genuinely eliminated foundation, primer, and all but one moisturizer where before I had to have several. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Splurge. Your skin will thank you and you&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
    <li> SK-II Facial Treatment Repair is a Japanese product. It is a soothing, light serum made up of Hyaluronic acid and Pitera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharid found naturally in the human body. It not only helps cushion and lubricate joints, but is also a major component of skin tissue. The skin holds almost fifty percent of your body’s hyaluronic acid in the skin. Hyaluronic Acid Serums not only plump and moisturizing skin, they also help heal and comfort skin. &#x27; wiki&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; Pitera is derived from yeast that is created during the fermentation process of sake. It was first discovered after researchers noticed that Japanese Sake producers&#x27; hands are abnormally soft. It refines texture and evens out skin tone for a brighter-looking complexion. Case in point: Cate Blanchett&#x27;s skin. She&#x27;s used Pitera for more than 10 years, and she&#x27;s the celebrity spokesperson for SK-II.&#x27; SK-II&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is light with no evident scent. I apply it to clean skin in the morning and evening. I then apply my moisturizer and any other make-up I might need that day. My skin is left feeling soft and silky. I cannot with any certainty say that my wrinkles are decreased. It may be that if you start using this serum at a young age, this will aid in the reduction of wrinkles and lines. At my age, the most I expect is soft,silky skin. I apply it to my face and neck, and then whatever is left I rub into my hands. This is a serum that feels good, and I like the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.prisrob 02-04-15</li>
    <li> This is a serum like application that smooths the skin. I have some &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; type texture on my forehead that bothers me. This product definitely makes it look less rough. I am puzzled by the lack of instructions with the product. Do you use this after or before a moisturizer? Alone? The product comes with zero helpful hints for usage. The packaging for something with this kind of price tag is also very pedestrian. It looks like something you&#x27;d buy at Target for 9$.&lt;br /&gt;I experimented and found that I could cleanse, moisturizer and then apply this and still get the benefits. For a product of this price category, the buyer is likely reluctant to do to much testing; there is only an ounce so you want to use it wisely. I use it on my forehead and neck and am pleased with the results. I am not sure I&#x27;d buy it because of price.</li>
    <li> This product, SK-II Facial Treatment Repair gets five stars for effectiveness, but zero stars for price.  I was absolutely delighted to receive this through Amazon Vine as it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. and, my skin does look better.  But, to be perfectly honest, for $175.00, which is the price of the product at retail, I know I&#x27;d never purchase it.,again as I could never justify spending that kind of money on a beauty product.  I am buying a new Cuisinart from Amazon which costs $178.00 and to me, that&#x27;s money better spent.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my wife to use. Here is her review: I received the SK-II Facial Treatment Repair and have been using it for over a week. Although the product did not have directions with it, I was able to find how to use the product on the Amazon product page. I used 1-2 pumps of the clear serum twice a day morning and evening. The product is packaged nicely and although there is 1 oz in total, this product will last a while since you do not use much when applying. The serum is odorless and goes on smoothly. It dries very quickly and does not leave the face feeling greasy or oily. It is an excellent moisturizer and I have noticed a decrease in roughness caused by drier skin. This product leaves your face feeling silky and smooth. I tend to breakout with many products, and this product did not cause any problems, rashes, or breakouts. This product burns the eyes a little so be careful to stay away from the eyes when applying. Being over fifty, I have my share of fine lines and wrinkles. I cannot say that I have noticed a reduction of wrinkles and lines, but I do see subtle changes most likely do to the excellent moisturizing this product provides. It is pretty pricey at $170.00 an ounce. I will continue to use this product and update this review if in the next few weeks I notice improvements.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a8bd3aa7ea75b2e2d117eed18083b6a9]] My disclaimer for this video is that almost 100% of my opinions expressed in my video are based on my girlfriend&#x27;s comments after using this product. But, I wanted to show this is use, so you could see what it looks like, which is why I&#x27;m using it, even though it&#x27;s meant for someone who takes better care of their skin than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, she got mad at me for using so much in the video, because this is pretty valuable stuff and she usually only uses about half what I show in the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now for the product review. I really like this facial treatment. At first, it&#x27;s a little tacky on my hands, but it dries very cleanly after applying it to my face, and my hands don&#x27;t feel gooey at all, like they do with cheap lotion. The applicator is awesome for being able to only squeeze out a very tiny bit, and a small drop of this can cover my entire face. This has the immediate effect of moisturizing and making skin feel smooth and soft. And, it has the long term effect of helping to rebuild damaged skin and preserve youthfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, in my video, I forgot to mention how this smells, which is important for me. This has a very nice, clean, mild smell. I liked how it wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all, but it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (and my girlfriend) highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely high quality&lt;br /&gt;+Immediately makes skin smoother and softer&lt;br /&gt;+Long term repairs, rebuilds, and protects&lt;br /&gt;+Smells good&lt;br /&gt;+Applies without being sticky&lt;br /&gt;+High quality applicator that gives you great control over how much you squeeze out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a few uses for the long-term effects of rejuvenation</li>
