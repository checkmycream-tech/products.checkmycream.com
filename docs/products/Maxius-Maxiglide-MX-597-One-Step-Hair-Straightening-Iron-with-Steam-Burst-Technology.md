      <li>I bought the Maxiglide straightening iron for my wife for Christmas this year, because my sister-in-law has one and my wife loved it and wanted it more than chocolate and shoes, so I figured it must have been something to write home about.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY!!</li>
      <li>the product is excellent for my hair which is natural.</li>
      <li>The MaxiGlide has turned out to be a wonderful product so far.</li>
      <li>Her hair is absolutely straight and beautiful after we are finished using it.</li>
      <li>This works great, quick and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>And you shouldn&#x27;t see any more hair in this than you do in your hairbrush.</li>
      <li>It is wider than most</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>Make sure and use some type of styling product in your hair or else you can forget having any volume.</li>
      <li>in all, this is an outstanding product</li>
      <li>and it costs a lot more.</li>
      <li>For the cost of 2-3 trips to the salon, I am able to straighten my hair when it is convenient for me.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is 11 and has been able to use it herself with some ease.</li>
      <li>I bought the Maxiglide and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>the teeth or pins on the iron help to separate the hair to do a more efficient job without just flattening the bends in your hair.</li>
      <li>IT JUST WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING</li>
      <li>It does work and it does straighten your hair, but keep in mind that there are better irons out there.</li>
      <li>I love this tool.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughters and they love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this straightener.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s how to make sure of that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I suggest this product to anyone looking for a top-notch flat iron that will get the job done! -Moni</li>
      <li>My stylist still does a better job than me of straightening my hair, but it is nice to be able to quickly do my hair when I can not get in to see her.    </li>
      <li>First,  must say I loved this iron when I received it over a year ago.</li>
      <li>One caution to take however, is to make sure your hair is tangle free before using.</li>
      <li>Thanks to my talented hair stylist, to good styling products that condition and protect hair from high heat styling tools, and</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re hair, especially if you&#x27;r good to it!</li>
      <li>I agree with the other folks who&#x27;ve found this to be the BEST hair straightener ever!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Before my hair straightened very quick &amp; every time afterwards, it took longer to straigten.</li>
      <li>Its so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Just as easy to use as on the infomercial.</li>
      <li>Hands down this is the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge time saver and has easy handling and care.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad to see Amazon carrying it now and at a more reasonable price!</li>
      <li>It worked great at first, my hair got really straight</li>
      <li>(yeah, I paid $150 for it from the Maxius Web Site; but I got the smaller one for free, which is great for straightening bangs).</li>
      <li>originally bought it for my own use as I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>it was still straight!!!  </li>
      <li>You just need to be sure you have combed through the majority of the tangles first as they say.  </li>
      <li>Okay well first off don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon...</li>
      <li>The teeth or comb like straightening system is great for my wavy/frizzy hair where I don&#x27;t have to blow dry it with a brush.  </li>
      <li>Clean it, use it, don&#x27;t abuse it.</li>
      <li>Also, use smaller sections, comb your hair good if you find you can&#x27;t run it smoothly through your hair.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews before I bought this item and although many people said it pulled out much of your hair</li>
      <li>The Maxiglide just makes things partially straight, and my hair is straight for the most part!  </li>
      <li>The best part is that I only have to wash my hair every four or five days and only use maxiglide for touch-ups.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair straight, soft, and healthy using a straightening iron, until I got my maxiglide.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair straight and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the $$$ (at the time, it cost over $100).</li>
      <li>Yes, you read right.</li>
      <li>My hair is the most curly at the top of my head, right as it starts to fall down towards my neck.  </li>
      <li>Pretty durable too, I have dropped this thing on the floor countless times and its as good as new.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the maxiglide, I did my whole head of hair in 10 minutes!  </li>
      <li>they go and argue over it when one of them spends the night at a friends house and wants to take it with them!  </li>
      <li>It works as well as the hot comb</li>
      <li>I have never been able to staighten my hair properly by myself.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I read the reviews before I bought this item and although many people said it pulled out much of your hair I found that it actually took out far less than the constant pulling and tugging that I have endured with many other flat irons. You just need to be sure you have combed through the majority of the tangles first as they say.  This product absolutely delivered what it said. I have extremely curly, thick hair. In one pass my hair was straight. The day after I straightened my hair it rained....I was livid....but amazingly it didn&#x27;t curl up after I ran through the rain...it was still straight!!!  I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So yea it is heavy and yea it doesn&#x27;t have a swivel cord, but this is the only straigther that does the job on my hair. I am black with very think coarse hair. So unless I use the hot comb that goes on the stove...nothing else is making this hair straight. It does the job. I love it I would recommend it. I would buy it again and again. If it worked for my hair, YEA it could work for ne one.</li>
    <li> I bought my MaxiGlilde in 2007. I love it! I am an African-American female with long, kinky hair. After deciding to go natural, I decided to purchase a maxiglide. After 3yrs., it finally cracked because of ware-and-tare, but I can certainly say I got my monies worth out of it. I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair straight, soft, and healthy using a straightening iron, until I got my maxiglide. I suggest this product to anyone looking for a top-notch flat iron that will get the job done! -Moni</li>
    <li> i bought mine last year because of the intense infomercials on TV. I have been using flat irons for the past 7 years, this one is nothing special. the comb pulls my hair often, i am buying a chi.</li>
    <li> The MaxiGlide has turned out to be a wonderful product so far. Just as easy to use as on the infomercial. One caution to take however, is to make sure your hair is tangle free before using. This lessens the hairs pulled out by the teeth/comb section of the MaxiGlide. My daughter is 11 and has been able to use it herself with some ease. Her hair is absolutely straight and beautiful after we are finished using it. If you want truly FLAT hair then this is the product for you. Make sure and use some type of styling product in your hair or else you can forget having any volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago and have used it about 5 times. It works as advertised and does straighten very well. However, it is not as handy a tool as I hoped for because I find it somewhat on the heavy and clumsy side, which makes it a bit difficult to use. I would not recommend unsupervised use of this product by someone under 15.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product over a year and ordered the antihumidity product from maxius direct. If you take the time to watch the DVD that comes with the glide and follow directions you&#x27;ll have a product that does what it says. I&#x27;ve tried it on every hair type slight frizz, relaxed and extremely tight curled coarse hair. Even on my curly, thick frizzy mane it works, if you follow directions when you work it. Clean it, use it, don&#x27;t abuse it. It&#x27;ll be good to you and you&#x27;re hair, especially if you&#x27;r good to it!</li>
    <li> I have had the maxi glide for about 3 years now and it is great. I used to use this on my natural extra thick African American hair. It works as well as the hot comb but without all that heat and waiting. I relaxed my hair about a month ago and using this gives me a sleek straight look. I highly recommend that you use it only on the first setting if you have ethnic hair, it is hot enough, any hotter and it is likely to burn your hair. Believe me I have the most thick, course hair you can imagine. Pretty durable too, I have dropped this thing on the floor countless times and its as good as new.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have never been able to staighten my hair properly by myself.  The first time I used the maxiglide, I did my whole head of hair in 10 minutes!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried other straighteners &amp; relaxers, but nothing really did the job.  I almost gave up until I saw an infommercial for the Maxiglide.  I gave it a try and it worked wonders on my hair!  If you&#x27;ve ever seen the infommercial....it does exactly what they show on tv.  This is the best straightener out there!</li>
    <li> I bought the Maxiglide and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. You see these infomercials on TV, then you go buy them, and they don&#x27;t do what they say. When I finally received my Maxiglide, I was blown away. Usually it takes me about an hour to do my hair, sometimes longer. When I used the Maxiglide, it only took me 10 minutes!! No joke!! My husband was really impressed too!! He said, \\&quot;Now if you could find something to wear in less time than that!\\&quot; I would and have recommended this product to my friends and family. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this tool.  It paid for itself in a single use.  It is easy to use.  I can save money instead on going to get my hair done all the time.  I no longer fear getting my hair messy because I can wash and take care of it myself now.  Thanks so much Maxius.</li>
    <li> The MaxiGlide is great!  The Chi flat iron did not get my hair as straight as the MaxiGlide, and that&#x27;s with my hair stylist using the Chi!  I can not use cheap flat irons and curling irons from Wal-Mart or Target because they do not get hot enough for my hair.  The MaxiGlide gets my hair as straight as a straw, so I did have to purchase a professional grade curling iron to give it a little bit of a bump after it is straightened.    I am half black, half Filipino with very wavy/curly hair and I no longer have chemicals in my hair.  I am able to wash, dry, straighten and curl my hair in under two hours.    It saves so much money and time from not having to go to the salon every week.  For the cost of 2-3 trips to the salon, I am able to straighten my hair when it is convenient for me.  My stylist still does a better job than me of straightening my hair, but it is nice to be able to quickly do my hair when I can not get in to see her.    Some of my favorite features are: the temperature control and the interchangeable plates with the teeth or the flat surface.  My hair is the most curly at the top of my head, right as it starts to fall down towards my neck.  The steam option is great for this section of my hair.      I also tried the MaxiGlide on my husband&#x27;s niece who is half black/half white and it got her straight as well.    I had given up hope on finding a salon quality product to use at home without spending a fortune, but the MaxiGlide is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Well, I had bought the maxiglide after I viewed the infomercial for it at my local beauty supply store.  It was awesome, it was great, and I loved it.- But after a while, the plates started to melt to the point where it would not close properly.  I mean the plates actually melted almost all the way around the plate where it became sealed to the actual straightner and could not be removed or closed properly.  I could not believe it.  Maybe I got a defected one, I had used it everyday for about 4 months and this happened.</li>
    <li> I have used the Maxiglide for several years now. I am a hair professional and recommend this product to my customers that have curly hair (naturally or permed) and want to go straight occasionally or always.  &lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it for my own use as I have very curly hair and I was frustrated with the performance of other irons on the market. This tool is a godsend.  &lt;br /&gt;After several years of pretty heavy use on myself and others I am looking to buy my second unit as my original has just started heating on only one side - probably because of the many times it has been dropped but who knows, it&#x27;s definitely survived a lot!  &lt;br /&gt;Just a few tips; &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend proper care of any hair appliance to insure consistent performance and long life of the appliance, especially if you are using styling products on your hair before you used a heated appliance like a curling iron or straightener. These products can also affect the way the appliance works with your hair.  &lt;br /&gt;As with any appliance, follow the instructions and be careful of the temperature you set. Use the lowest you can to get the results you want. &lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you can damage/melt the cortex of your hair due to heat abuse from any hair appliance that uses heat. If this happens you will really know what unmanageable, unstylable hair is. &lt;br /&gt;To gently curl the ends of your hair when you straighten using the maxiglide, this iron has convenient rounded sides they put in for visibility but it works very well for curling the ends by twisting the wrist as you run it through the last few inches of the sections where you want curl - if you want gentle curl with none of the lines you get from many other straighteners. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I gave my old maxiglide to my friend, because I thought I&#x27;d thought it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. We had a girls night in at her house and she used the maxiglide on my hair, and I loved it. I was using it wrong, by squeezing the teeth too tight. Now my hair looks as great as hers and theis will help me stretch my relaxers.</li>
    <li> Okay well first off don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon... I bought mine from Linens &amp; Things and had a 20% off coupon, so the total was $64.  (Their list price was $80)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is nothing special.  It does nothing for the static, and it doesn&#x27;t straighten perfectly either.  I&#x27;ve used the CHI and wow that thing straightens my baby hairs!  The Maxiglide just makes things partially straight, and my hair is straight for the most part!  It does little for my wavy bangs.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this iron, especially for the price.  It does work and it does straighten your hair, but keep in mind that there are better irons out there.</li>
    <li> This works great, quick and easy to use.  It is wider than most so you can do \\&quot;bigger\\&quot; groups of hair at a time.  Love this product, in fact this is my second one purchase.  The first one lasted less than 6 months, which shocked me, but I am hoping that was a fluke.  The wiring started to short out.  I use it on average 5 days a week on medium setting.  I  have had much cheaper ones last for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever used. I cannot believe that I finally found something that works on my hair. Not only does it straighten it but It leaves my hair so soft with a lot of movement. I get a lot of compliments on my hair and the best part is that it is not frizzy anymore. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Maxiglide is an excellent product. Perfect for hair straightning. I was very please with my purchase.I would recommend this product to anyone out there looking for a good hair straightning devise! Satisfaction guaranted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for over 4 years now... and it&#x27;s well worth the $$$ (at the time, it cost over $100). I have naturally curly, medium-textured hair that falls to the middle of my back; I use it 1-2 times a week when I want to wear my hair straight w/ a flip at the ends... and it only takes approx 15 minutes to do it.  Thanks to my talented hair stylist, to good styling products that condition and protect hair from high heat styling tools, and to Maxiglide&#x27;s steam burst technology, my hair looks shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> i didnt likethis product at all it doesnt worth that much of money , dont waste ur money on something like this .  i brefer my (( conair__ flat iron )) 25 $ i just got the same results</li>
    <li> Works great, however when using the steam feature the water just pours out.  Not much steam.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other folks who&#x27;ve found this to be the BEST hair straightener ever! It does pull on the hair, but so does my hairbrush - And you shouldn&#x27;t see any more hair in this than you do in your hairbrush. Here&#x27;s how to make sure of that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First of all, the smaller the section of hair, the quicker the unit glides thru the hair without any breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Like everyone else here has said (except those who returned theirs), don&#x27;t squeeze the unit as you go down the hair. Hold it gently, and move it slowly and evenly - Don&#x27;t stop on the way down or you&#x27;ll get a crimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. MOST IMPORTANTLY!! - Go in the SAME DIRECTION that you combed/brushed your hair (I use a comb because it gets out the most tangles)! This is critical! For example, if you combed/brushed your hair straight out from your head (as I do on the top to get fullness), then you MUST glide the unit in the EXACT SAME direction. ANY deviation from that direction causes it to break hairs...Makes sense, tho, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps those of you on the fence about this thing. As for it not lasting, I&#x27;ve had mine over 2 years now (yeah, I paid $150 for it from the Maxius Web Site; but I got the smaller one for free, which is great for straightening bangs). I&#x27;m SO glad to see Amazon carrying it now and at a more reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Well for starters, my hair is curly, frizzy, your reagular African American girl hair.  It worked great at first, my hair got really straight and it was nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any products while using this because i think that is half the reason why it does not work any more.  Now when i use it gets my hair straight but not unfrizzy.  I have had the product for over 2 years now.  It&#x27;s okay, but if I had a choice i don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again.?</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and I have used every product/contraption on the market over the past 25 years.  This is the best yet!!!  I have bought them for my nieces and my sisters also.  They all agree that this is the best straightening product ever!!!  If you can&#x27;t get your hair straight AND BEAUTIFUL with this, you&#x27;re an idiot.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Maxiglide straightening iron for my wife for Christmas this year, because my sister-in-law has one and my wife loved it and wanted it more than chocolate and shoes, so I figured it must have been something to write home about.  My review comes from my wife, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It gets hotter than other straightening irons she&#x27;s had, so it does the job better.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It has variable temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It not only irons your hair, it steams it as well, which maintains the straightening longer.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It comes not only with the standard metal ironing plates, but with plates with teeth to comb your hair as it straightens it.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Not only can you use it to straighten your hair, but you can use it to curl or flip up the ends of your hair, which you can&#x27;t do with other straightening irons.&lt;br /&gt;6.  IT JUST WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE my wife has tried.  She has very curly hair by nature and has had difficulty for years keeping it straight all day.  With the Maxiglide, she can straighten it this morning and wake up with it straight tomorrow morning.  Her hair keeps its form all day, whereas with previous irons, her hair would begin unraveling in the evening.  I have long, naturally curly hair, and she&#x27;s even used it on mine, with outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;Price.  $79.99 is a bit steep.  However, my wife believes the cost is justified, because it is one of the few products out there that actually does everything it advertises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an outstanding product and I/we recommend it to anyone who has had little or no success with other straighteners.</li>
    <li> I saw the informercials, but this product doesn&#x27;t really do what it does on their. I&#x27;m kind of dissapointed. It straightens your hair, but I think this straightener is for people with REALLY REALLY REALLY frizzy hair, like an afro. But if you have slightly frizzy hair, like me, it won&#x27;t make THAT much of a difference. But don&#x27;t get me wrong- I use this product all the time because it straightens my hair, just not to the extent that I thought. The infomercials dramatize it alot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters and they love it. Although we&#x27;ve only had it for a month, they use it all the time, take it everywhere they go and argue over it when one of them spends the night at a friends house and wants to take it with them!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and works usually with just one pass.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> This is the only straightener i will ever use.  I have had it for several years now.  i have naturally curly hair and it is also thin and fragile.  This straightener does cause some breakage, but what straightener doesn&#x27;t?!  It leaves my hair straight and frizz free.  no need to pre- blow dry which causes more heat damage.  It takes me 4- 6 minutes to do and I&#x27;m done.  I love it!  i don&#x27;t use it everyday, but i seriously couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Maxius Maxiglide MX-597 in January of this year and I can&#x27;t say that I can recommend this product. Not because it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. In fact, it did an execellent job at straightening my hair. And I&#x27;m African American so that&#x27;s saying alot. However, the long term consequences of using this iron is not worth it because it did take a lot of my hair out. The instructional DVD tells you not to squeeze the iron and to \\&quot;let the MaxiGlide do the work\\&quot;. I followed those directions and didn&#x27;t squeeze the iron, but the ceramic detangling pins still took too much of my hair out. I even brushed and combed all the kinks out of my hair before using the iron, but my hair still kept getting caught in the detangling pins. After using the iron once, I thought that it would be in my best interest to discontinue using it. Yes, my hair was bone straight, but at what cost? After six months of using the Maxiglide I probably wouldn&#x27;t have any hair left to straighten.</li>
    <li> This straightner is perfect for my hair.  The first day I used it I was amazed.  I have thin wavey hair with a  little bit friz to it, the steam calmed the friz and the heat straightened the curl.    I would highly recommend this product highly</li>
    <li> If I was stranded on a desert island... This would be my one product I&#x27;d take with me. I have long, very thick, crazy frizzy hair that is high maintenance. The maxiglide gives it shine and smoothness. The best part is that I only have to wash my hair every four or five days and only use maxiglide for touch-ups. Since my hair is so dry anyway, it helps that I don&#x27;t have to wash it often.     Keep in mind that it does take a while to get use to the bulkiness of it. Also, use smaller sections, comb your hair good if you find you can&#x27;t run it smoothly through your hair. Start at the nape of of your neck and work your way up.  I&#x27;ve only had mine for several months so I don&#x27;t know the longevity of it but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going back to the salon to get my hair done. Its so easy to use. Once I got the hang of it for my hair type (which is dry and very curly) I can straighten my hair very quickly. The best product I ever bought for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned my straightener for over 10 years now and it is still working great.  I recently dropped it and broke the handle near the hinge so I&#x27;m looking to buy another.  But even with the crack it is still working great.  I absolutely love this straightener.</li>
    <li> the product is excellent for my hair which is natural. I was not sure it would work for me as I am African American and the texture of my hair is thicker, but it is amazing. Like my Amex Card, I will not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> this iron works great! as said in other reviews, comb hair first with a wide tooth comb to detangle. use the lowest heat setting that gives the results you&#x27;re looking for. any heat generating tool is going to stress your hair, just don&#x27;t leave it in one place too long. the teeth or pins on the iron help to separate the hair to do a more efficient job without just flattening the bends in your hair. with any product just use some common sense, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought the maxi glide based on recommendations. I have extremely thick wavy/curly frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t do much more than other straighteners I have tried and it costs a lot more. It seems to have damaged my ends after three uses. I also had to use a curling iron on the ends because this product left my hair like straw, ends sticking out straight, only bent when I used the steam. I am not going to return it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> First,  must say I loved this iron when I received it over a year ago. Before my hair straightened very quick &amp; every time afterwards, it took longer to straigten. AND eventually the iron stops heating all together! Yes, you read right. This is not just my personal review, after hearing other personal friends experience &amp; reading reviews online, this happens to ALL Maxius. IT&#x27;s sad that the product is so good but the warranty on this is only one year. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have been using for a few years and I love it.  I gave my old one to my sister so I ordered a new one for myself.  The teeth or comb like straightening system is great for my wavy/frizzy hair where I don&#x27;t have to blow dry it with a brush.  It&#x27;s a huge time saver and has easy handling and care. I have used it on many types of hair and it worked great! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was sitting here thinking about my Maxiglide I purchased back in 2008 and I had to come on here and write a review mainly because I can use it everyday and it does absolutely no damage to my hair after all these years i have been using this product. My hair is still thick, full, and looks lively. Hands down this is the best straightener I have ever used. It gets the job done without the damage. I do keep it on the 5 setting and it still straightens very well.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought the Iron, so sorry this item was discontinued.  But it works great on straightening my natural black hair.  Love.</li>
