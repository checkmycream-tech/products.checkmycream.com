      <li>The clarity of my skintone has improved greatly, pores have tightened considerably &amp; overall the texture is more refined!</li>
      <li>says it&#x27;s great for mature skin to protect against environmental damage and aging.</li>
      <li>My facialist told that vitamin C was the most important thing a 30-something can put on her skin.</li>
      <li>Now with the passing of time, I figured that 15 AOX would be a better fit, and so it is.  </li>
      <li>So, far so good.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny, and would def recommend it!  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Thankfully Amazon stood by their A to Z Guarantee and granted me a full refund the the purchase price.  </li>
      <li>Time will tell if the product effectively fades my brown spots, but so far the tingle I feel when I apply the product indicates to  me that the product is working.  </li>
      <li>A bit costly, but worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered this same product from a true authorized on-line dealer called Lovely Skin.com.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but pretty much worth it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need the 20 strength now, but I can feel the tightening of pores and sagging skin with AOX 15 which is exactly what I need.  </li>
      <li>Still effective but have never had my serum get this dark as I used it.</li>
      <li>Aa great product for facial dark spots</li>
      <li>I think it really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I really like.</li>
      <li>The color of the serum is clear and the lot numbers are where they are suppose to be thus proving that the product is fresh and not expired.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t see much difference for skin tone,&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really think it smooths and brightens my over-sixty skin.</li>
      <li>I purchases this serum as it has Ferulic Acids which was highly recommended for skin.</li>
      <li>As a 30 something mother of 4 I highly recommend it for its ease and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>I first used this product when I got a facial at a spa, and they talked me into buying it...</li>
      <li>I first had this applied during a facial.</li>
      <li>When I presented these concerns to the seller they couldn&#x27;t explain to me why the lot numbers had been removed and were willing to only refund me 25% of the purchase price because the product had been opened.</li>
      <li>Time will tell how effective the AOX 15  will be, but from past experience and the active sensation on application, I feel that the product will be very beneficial.</li>
      <li>Years ago my plastic surgeon advised me to use the 20 AOX, which helped clear my skin of oiliness and breakouts.  </li>
      <li>So I hopped online and bought my old fav.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time based on several friend recommendations that have been using it for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old female with fairish skin and adult acne, combination skin.</li>

<li> I have been buying a bunch of suff in malls expensive ones, cheap ones.....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pricey, but goes a very long way.</li>
<li> I have used this product before and this product has &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; consistency - very strange for a serum!</li>
<li> I have ordered Skinceutical serum in the past from other stores and the serum is fairly clear.  </li>
<li> The two bottles I received had very dark yellow serum.  </li>
<li> Arrived on time &amp; product was as expected</li>
<li> This product was expired and its color was a dark amber not clear.  </li>
<li> I little goes a long way and one bottle lasts me almost 4 months.</li>
<li> That could be the other products I&#x27;m using in conjunction with this (Eminence cleanser and moisturizer), but as I said, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
<li> I took a break from this product fir a few years.</li>
<li> and....within a couple of days ivy was dried up and gone.  </li>
<li> so maybe that&#x27;s the reason I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference but can&#x27;t be bad.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what difference I&#x27;m supposed to see, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it as everything I&#x27;ve read about it</li>
<li> After using the clarasoinc to wash my face every 2 days I put this product on and let it soak in before putting on my usual face cream.</li>
<li> I will mention that when I sweat under usual conditions, the serum (citrus) will sting my eyes if sweat drips and has a citrus taste to it.  </li>
<li> I have used this product since late 2005 to correct the &#x27;fatty pockets&#x27; under my eyes (recommended by an aesthetician).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a month, and notice no change in my skin.</li>
<li> Its expensive product but did not take but just a few drops to help.</li>
<li> I also discovered added benefit-came down with bad case of poison ivy that nothing helped.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A plastic surgeon recommended this product about a year ago and I&#x27;ve ben using ever since.  I have good skin so maybe that&#x27;s the reason I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference but can&#x27;t be bad.  :)</li>
    <li> I took a break from this product fir a few years. My facialist told that vitamin C was the most important thing a 30-something can put on her skin. So I hopped online and bought my old fav. So glad I did. My skin is glowing!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since late 2005 to correct the &#x27;fatty pockets&#x27; under my eyes (recommended by an aesthetician). It worked miracles. When I stopped using it, they returned. I&#x27;ll never stop using it again.</li>
    <li> This product was expired and its color was a dark amber not clear.  The lot number on the bottle had been removed and the lot number on the bottom of the box had been cut out and a makeshift sticker had been put in its place to hide its removal.  When I called the manufacturer Skinceuticals about these concerns they informed me that all of their products have a lot number on the bottom of the bottles and the boxes which identifies the expiration date.  They also informed me that this seller, Beauty Connections One, is NOT an authorized online dealer.  When I presented these concerns to the seller they couldn&#x27;t explain to me why the lot numbers had been removed and were willing to only refund me 25% of the purchase price because the product had been opened. Thankfully Amazon stood by their A to Z Guarantee and granted me a full refund the the purchase price.  I have since ordered this same product from a true authorized on-line dealer called Lovely Skin.com. The color of the serum is clear and the lot numbers are where they are suppose to be thus proving that the product is fresh and not expired.</li>
    <li> Good pricing - excellent delivery time</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time based on several friend recommendations that have been using it for a long time.  So, far so good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Skinceutical serum in the past from other stores and the serum is fairly clear.  The two bottles I received had very dark yellow serum.  I checked with Skinceuticals and found out that happens when the serum ages.  Still effective but have never had my serum get this dark as I used it.</li>
    <li> Only a week into it but I can see it&#x27;s working so far.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be clearing my stubborn pimples and congested skin pronto.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doing nothing for the pore size and I can&#x27;t see much difference for skin tone,&lt;br /&gt;however I&#x27;m optimistic.</li>
    <li> From a male user.  This serum used with Skinceuticals Skin Firming Cream Treatment, it feels great on my face.  I am not a moisturizer type guy but have wanted something to help preserve and improve my weathered face.  I am outdoor enthusiast and needed to do more.  I see and feel an improvement and dont thnk there is anything better than this line of products.  This combination is not greasy, doesnt make me sweat like moisturizer, dries nice, no fragrance or odor.  It is tingly.  I will mention that when I sweat under usual conditions, the serum (citrus) will sting my eyes if sweat drips and has a citrus taste to it.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> Loved everything about this transaction. Fabulous product, fantastic price &amp; great efficient delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchases this serum as it has Ferulic Acids which was highly recommended for skin. I really like. I use it after cleansing and before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist. I could see continuous results within 3mos of continual AM use. Going to revisit treatment with my dermatologist tomorrow morning t see if he want to change anything..</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Years ago my plastic surgeon advised me to use the 20 AOX, which helped clear my skin of oiliness and breakouts.  Now with the passing of time, I figured that 15 AOX would be a better fit, and so it is.  I don&#x27;t need the 20 strength now, but I can feel the tightening of pores and sagging skin with AOX 15 which is exactly what I need.  Time will tell if the product effectively fades my brown spots, but so far the tingle I feel when I apply the product indicates to  me that the product is working.  Time will tell how effective the AOX 15  will be, but from past experience and the active sensation on application, I feel that the product will be very beneficial.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a while and love it!!  It is worth every penny, and would def recommend it!  Great price and fast delivery makes it even better :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a month, and notice no change in my skin. The consistency is like water. I would not buy again nor recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for reducing fine lines-and rejuvenating skin. A bit costly, but worth the price. It lasts for several months.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; product was as expected</li>
    <li> I got this at the suggestion of an esthetician and a friend. I really think it smooths and brightens my over-sixty skin. I use a couple of other products as well but put this on first. It is pricey but pretty much worth it. I think it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been buying a bunch of suff in malls expensive ones, cheap ones.....this one is the best. I getting everything from now on with this brand.</li>
    <li> This serum was recommended by my aesthetician to help even out my complexion &amp; this serum does just that! The clarity of my skintone has improved greatly, pores have tightened considerably &amp; overall the texture is more refined! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I got a facial at a spa, and they talked me into buying it...of course! I ended up loving it and it has become part of my weekly face treatments. After using the clarasoinc to wash my face every 2 days I put this product on and let it soak in before putting on my usual face cream. I little goes a long way and one bottle lasts me almost 4 months. It has made my skin look fresher and helped reduce my redness and puffiness. As a 30 something mother of 4 I highly recommend it for its ease and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old female with fairish skin and adult acne, combination skin. I first had this applied during a facial. My esthetician said to use this three times a week after cleansing, before moisturizing. I&#x27;m not sure what difference I&#x27;m supposed to see, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it as everything I&#x27;ve read about it says it&#x27;s great for mature skin to protect against environmental damage and aging. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s just a great barrier and protector. It&#x27;s pricey, but goes a very long way. When I went in for my second facial last week, she could see a big difference in my skin and I will say that my skin IS looking brighter. That could be the other products I&#x27;m using in conjunction with this (Eminence cleanser and moisturizer), but as I said, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and this product has &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; consistency - very strange for a serum! I&#x27;ll definitively contact Amazon to return this item.</li>
    <li> My skin dr put me on this and it did help my facial skin. I&#x27;m 61 and starting to show spots that disappeared with daily treatment of this product.  I also discovered added benefit-came down with bad case of poison ivy that nothing helped.  Started putting this on and....within a couple of days ivy was dried up and gone.  Its expensive product but did not take but just a few drops to help.</li>
    <li> Aa great product for facial dark spots</li>
    <li> Love this serum and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
