<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like I said,doesnt hold, looks greasy.If u want something to set ur hair in a style,This is not it!  Cat in Pa.</li>
    <li> I like the old formula better</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use, much less, review \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, I typically review and use clay/paste/wax, etc., but I made an exception and got this for half price after purchasing The B For Men Matte Wax. I used this on damp hair, BEFORE blowdrying. When I squeezed it into my palm I noticed it didn&#x27;t look or feel like a typical gel, I believe that is because of the lack of alcohol. After blowdrying my hair looked the way it always does after blowdrying a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; into my hair, lots of hold and dry, but this time there was some texture in it, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;I followed it up with the wax and was on my way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re a user of \\&quot;gel\\&quot;, invest in this product. If you don&#x27;t normally use gels, don&#x27;t buy this. It is, however, the most impressive gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I do not usually write reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using American Crew for years, and decided to try other gels, I tried the following:&lt;br /&gt;- Treceme: Does not have a strong hold for wavy/curly hair&lt;br /&gt;- American crew: good gel, doesn&#x27;t last the whole day&lt;br /&gt;- Sexy Hair: very goopy, leaves hair nasty after a day&#x27;s use&lt;br /&gt;- I have tried others that I don&#x27;t recall right now.&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head is great, it has great hold, it is shiney, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair completely crunchy, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, i do not understand the praise for this product. So you get an idea, i&#x27;m 24 years old, my hair is about 3-4 inches long, thick, straight, and i&#x27;ve been styling it with different gels for years, different styles, now i just slick it back. This is the first time i use this gel, and i got it because of the high praise, I&#x27;ve never rated anything this low, and I mean anything. I&#x27;ve used 1/4th of the gel and i finally just gave up on it yesterday, I&#x27;m going to give it away or tossing it. It has so many bad chemicals and it really does not smell that great, not bad, but not great, my shampoo smells better. Want great smelling gel? give \\&quot;Johny B Fuddy\\&quot; a whiff, that&#x27;s good smelling gel. What i disliked most was well, it dried my hair after every use and i could still feel the guck from the gel even after showering; even after putting it on, my hands had all the gel guck after using soap to wash the gel off. Honestly, i&#x27;ve never used a worse gel, ever, i have no idea where these high reviews are coming from, you&#x27;re better off using wood glue.</li>
    <li> I love it. It has a great smell. It does not flake much like other brands. Great and simple. Clear-whiteish gel. has a shiny look after applied.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after having sooo many fail on me. this is the best gel ever.It is strong enough with a decent amount of shine(not too much shine though) and does not flake. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> NICE REPLACEMENT FOR TIGI BEDHEAD POWER GEL THAT I USED FOR YEARS.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my husband loves to use. It is a bit pricey but worth it. He gets the spiked look he wants without being sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> well it holds a long time with a good smell</li>
    <li> This will hold your hair in place even in 40 mph wind. It might be a little stiff and heavy for some men. If you have a spiked hairdo, its great for that also.</li>
    <li> The gel does the job well. It holds hair for a long time. It is easy to wash off not only hair, but also hands without any soap. Other gels including Loreal brand gels are really hard to wash off even with soap. Hands just dont feel clean.</li>
    <li> Does not have a good natural hold and leaves me hair feel disgusting afterwards.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Though it seems silly, the proper hair gel does matter. You want something that goes on easily without leaving residue or making your hair feel like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet. After trying numerous different brands, from Target to Salon quality, this is far and away my favorite one. It makes my hair stay in place without feeling like I can&#x27;t mess with it. It&#x27;s just the right balance of strength and flexibility. So I bought 3 right off the bat to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out before Amazon sold out or something. And thankfully, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle - the stuff lasts a pretty long time. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product did not smell or hold like the Bed Head Power Play I buy in the stores.  My wife who has a great sense of smell also told me it smells different than what we are used to.  I wonder if it is counterfeit.</li>
    <li> This product is crap . The formula is changed and not the same , I even thought it may be counterfeit ..&lt;br /&gt;I had been using this product for over 5 years . Beyond disappointed ....Do not order .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  For some reason this product is hard to find in stores in my area, but Amazon has it for a good price so I&#x27;ll just order from then as needed.  It&#x27;s a decent gel and better than some of the gets your find at Ultra, Walmart and Target.</li>
    <li> After years and years of dealing with flaky, weak, sticky and slimy hair gel I finally have found the clear winner.   No alcohol, no flakes, smells great, strong.  I will put this on in the morning and after work and the gym my hair is still perfect.  Not to mention it conditions your hair.  Overall its the best product I have ever used.   I&#x27;ve tried almost every hair gel from $2.00 - $20.00.  Thank you Bed Head.</li>
    <li> Gave to a 52 year-old with receding hairline. He has fine hair and he said this gel is great and does the job without too much stiffness.</li>
    <li> This is not the same Power Play that you&#x27;re used to.  They completely changed the formula and the new version stinks.  It doesn&#x27;t hold and it smells very odd.  After speaking to several beauty supply houses I finally contacted Bed Head and they confirmed they changed the formula.  You will notice all new tubes say \\&quot;Tenue Forte\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Tenue Maximale.\\&quot; The hold is much less and it STINKS. If you were a fan of the old Power Play you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use this product for his hair. It is not sticky and holds his thin hair firmly</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Been trying to find a good gel for my hair at a good price. Bed head works well on my fine hair and lm happy with the price. It cost about $20 retail so l did save $$$$$$$</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> I agree with previous comments. This IS NOT the same product as before. After reading all your comments I still decided to purchase it and find out if it worked on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I can say that the old product was a way better. The new one may work OK on very short hair but you still need to double or triple the amount to get anywhere close to desired look. I come back home from work and I have to reapply, I never used to do that with the old gel.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why TIGI is using the same name on a product that is so different to the old one. That&#x27;s called cheating!&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 3 stars because like I said it may work on very short hair and it&#x27;s alcohol free. Still better than most gels on the market.</li>
    <li> It holds great and it has a great scent.</li>
    <li> If you expect a firm hold go elsewhere. Also packaging is different. Comes in a black tube.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite hair gel! He is very picky in regards to his hair and what he uses on it. He has a messy spiked style and this gel works perfectly for him. We usually buy three at a time when we see it so he doesn&#x27;t run out! It gets a bit stiff but he looks great from start to the finish of an evening. He is an entertainer so longevity of a product is what he needs. Being under the lights and for long periods of time make for a long night sometimes!  He wholeheartedly endorses this product and so do I!</li>
    <li> Although it is a little costly and hard to find in stores, this is hands down the best hair gel I have ever used.  The best features of this gel are 1) doesn&#x27;t feel sticky either in the hair or on hands, 2) easily washes off the hands after application, and 3) DOES NOT flake when dry (unlike 99% of other gels - even the ones that claim not to flake).  Quality product. I wish I was able to buy a bigger bottle of it so it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> The product was fine and just as advertised. It took longer than I expected to get it, about two weeks, and no real explanation but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry and it was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Great!</li>
    <li> This is really good gel, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;crust\\&quot; your hair up too bad and actually smells good, which is uncommon for most gels.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gel!!! It is alcohol free and doesnt dry out his hair and always keeps him looking great!</li>
    <li> Great holding power. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Does what I want it to do, hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I was one of those TIGI customers who used the Power Trip product.  Once TIGI took it out of the market, I tried several other brand looking for a substitute with no success.  I recently tried this Power Play and my search is over.  Great smell and great fix with a small qty applied that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and works well for gray hair.  Nice smell and leaves hair in place all day.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years, good and fair price !</li>
    <li> Really great product for active men. My hair is coarse and hard to keep in place. Bed Head Power Play really does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Gel for years.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis. A little bit goes a long way and my hair is thick. It took me a while to find gel that I liked and this is it.</li>
    <li> I need to keep my hair in place at all times, this product does the jod. It keeps your hair in place with no strong smells or stickiness, will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> TIGI is a very reliable brand. Exactly what you would expect. This product has very good gel hold and a pleasing manly fragrance.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son who likes to spike his hair up in the front ... after using several products that &#x27;flake&#x27; when they dry we finally found a winner!  This does not flake, even when touched.  It offers a high shine look that looks really good.  My son has thicker curly coarse hair and this still provides enough strength to spike the hair up and leaves it up all day.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Works great on the little ones.</li>
    <li> I used to use a different TIGI gel (I think it was Head Shrink - it was green). I loved it. But that seems to be gone. So I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a gel that can replace it. This is really good. I only give it 4 stars because I know what I had before and I liked it better.</li>
    <li> This works great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crusty as many gels go. It holds for the whole day and I only use a very little at a time. This bottle has lasted me a long time. Worth the price. Delivered fast</li>
    <li> Its hair gel that works really well and has a nice scent. Don&#x27;t need to use much at a time, a little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This has been my gel of choice for years now. They recently changed the formula which is now less harsh and smells better, yet holds exactly the same. My only complaint has been that the price ( i used to purchase from Ulta ) was expensive. Hence why I now purchase Bed Head from here. Please keep that supply coming! Thanks.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel available in this price range. Stays put all day, no flaking, and looks great.</li>
    <li> This gel works great! I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t flake. This is it. It has good natural hold, not all crusty and hard. It smells great and does not linger very long. There have been some complaints about the strong smell, but I noticed it only smells when you first apply the product and then it doesn&#x27;t last long. But it does smell good.</li>
    <li> Great product that is light, non greasy, and hols my hair perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> As with all the previous comments, this is not the same Bedhead firm gel that I have used for many years.  The formula has been changed and the gel now feels watered-down with an awful smell.  It does not provide nearly the same hold as before.  Very disappointed and will be looking for a new product.</li>
    <li> Well, you&#x27;re probably here because you realized TIGI no longer makes their fabulous Power Trip hair gel and you just ran out. That was dark day for me. Like most health and beauty products, when you find something that works great for you then you just want to keep getting that same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, for whatever reason, they don&#x27;t make it anymore. My guess is change in regulations, something to do with the ingredients, etc. Anyhow, I tried a few different gels on the market and nothing came close to Power Trip. I decided to give this Power Play a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hold and stylability, I think it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to Power Trip so far. It actually feels a bit &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; than Power Trip when styling, but I&#x27;m able to get the look I want without fussing with it too much. So, this part I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the part I don&#x27;t like is the strong odor, it smells like strong aftershave or cologne. While I don&#x27;t hate the smell, it makes me feel like some high school kid wearing too much cologne. I think the folks at TIGI could tone this odor down, A LOT. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s necessary to have your hair smell like that and if I did actually wear cologne, I wouldn&#x27;t want my hair&#x27;s smell conflicting with it. TIGI, if you&#x27;re going to force an odor onto your consumers, go with something more pleasing like Crew&#x27;s Forming Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good for a styling and hold perspective, at least for my needs. RIP Power Trip!</li>
    <li> I like this gel, has nice texture and smell good&lt;br /&gt;but if you have thick hair this gel doesn&#x27;t hold very strong but still work</li>
    <li> Again, another 5 STAR experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product performs very well to claim and I was very pleased with the rapidity with which is was dispatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all.  After a few hours after applying it to my hair, it flakes badly and it appears as though I have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this same product at a Salon near my home and it is the exact same product but does not flake like the product that I received from your Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again from your site and will have to go back to the Salon in which I originally purchased it from.</li>
    <li> Not nearly strong enough.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband when power trip (his go-to) was out of stock. It was OKAY - not great.</li>
    <li> On time at right price and packed properly.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The product i receved was not what was pictured or ordered.  I returned the product but have not received my credit.</li>
    <li> One tube seems it will last about 3 years. it does do a good job on cowlicks. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my sons hair for a long time and after running out and unable to find it in the salons, I decided to buy on Amazon.  This is not the same product!  The reason I buy this product normally is because it doesn&#x27;t leave flakes and residue!  Well this product I bought from Amazon doesn&#x27;t smell the same and left so much residue and also left my sons scalp very itchy!  I am very dissapointed, and would like my money back!</li>
