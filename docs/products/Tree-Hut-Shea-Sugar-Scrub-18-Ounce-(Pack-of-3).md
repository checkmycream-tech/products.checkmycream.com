      <li>if I manage to utilize the sugar crystals by rubbing them into my problem skin areas before the water slides them off, most crystals dissolve too quickly to use leaving my feeling around on my arm for one or two crystals to work with at times.</li>

<li> This body scrub took my dry skin and made it soft and supple.  </li>
<li> I have read other reviews, but using a scrub on a daily or frequent basis isn&#x27;t recommended I think.</li>
<li> Now I have a whole bunch of dry, dark spots on my stomach, arms and legs!</li>
<li> Then after about a week I started to notice these small dry spots on my arm, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
<li> Now I&#x27;m trying my hardest to fade these dry spots before summer, because I still want to look good in my bikini:(</li>
<li> use everyday to keep my skin soft</li>
<li> I cancelled the other order of three that I placed, I don&#x27;t want anymore of this and will look into sending it back.</li>
<li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
<li> Then I use Aveeno lotion after I towel dry.  </li>
<li> With regular use, especially during the winter months, I&#x27;ve had no more dry itchy skin.</li>
<li> Also, all of my little bumps came back.</li>
<li> I will continue to search for something a little cheaper that actually works.</li>
<li> Since my skin is so rough, I can use it every day.</li>
<li> The texture is thicker than the other brand I was using and feels like I am rubbing a glob of tub margarine on my body with chunky crystals in it, but then when the shower water hits my skin it all just slides off immediately.</li>
<li> I purchased this product from Walmart instead of Amazon, and in the begining I agreed with some of the other reviews.</li>
<li> The slight oil gives moisture too.  </li>
<li> Anyway, I use this every few days in the shower on my neck and decollete area.  </li>
<li> but they can be very, very expensive for daily use.</li>
<li> Needless to say I stopped using this product it immediately.</li>
<li> Too bad I ordered the multipack.</li>
<li> :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have loved this scrub since I found it years ago and am always satisfied with the wonderful smells and the smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I actually caught this on sale at Wal-Mart for like $5...It was a great deal smelled nice. I have had the scrub for atleast 5months. I did not use it daily, maybe atleast once every week or once every 2 weeks. I didnt have any issues with the scrub. I have read other reviews, but using a scrub on a daily or frequent basis isn&#x27;t recommended I think. The scrub is scented, but it&#x27;s not overbearing and after use my skin feels really smooth. I mostly used the scrub on my back (right below the neck), the scrub definitely cleared the area. It is a wonderful scrub and would highly recommend it if you want to try something new &amp; inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive sugar scrub before trying this one that cleared up tiny red bumps all over the backs of my arms and thighs. I saw these and liked the price so decided to try them, and I have not liked them. I am actually on the third jar just trying to put them to use and do not plan on purchasing again. The texture is thicker than the other brand I was using and feels like I am rubbing a glob of tub margarine on my body with chunky crystals in it, but then when the shower water hits my skin it all just slides off immediately. I feel like I&#x27;m not getting any of the shea butter from the product into my skin and if I manage to utilize the sugar crystals by rubbing them into my problem skin areas before the water slides them off, most crystals dissolve too quickly to use leaving my feeling around on my arm for one or two crystals to work with at times. Also, all of my little bumps came back. :( I will continue to search for something a little cheaper that actually works.</li>
    <li> This body scrub took my dry skin and made it soft and supple.  With regular use, especially during the winter months, I&#x27;ve had no more dry itchy skin. I love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that because of the mention of \\&quot;shea\\&quot; that this was like the &#x27;Shea Moisture&#x27; line of body scrubs that places essential oils on the skin in the shower.  I didn&#x27;t find this to be true at all.  It&#x27;s rather a soapy scrub that doesn&#x27;t leave that moisturizing oil and wonderful smell of the shea line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cancelled the other order of three that I placed, I don&#x27;t want anymore of this and will look into sending it back.</li>
    <li> I just bought this at Ulta using a 20% off coupon since I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with 3 jars at one time if I didn&#x27;t like it.  Anyway, I use this every few days in the shower on my neck and decollete area.  These areas are too sensitive and the skin is fragile to use a body brush.  The size of the sugar crystals is just right with the right amount of exfoliating (not too rough or gentle).  The slight oil gives moisture too.  Of course, I still follow up with my cream moisturizer and sun block-everyday ladies!  I tried using Alba salt scrub but the salt crystals were huge and rough and the oil separated way too much and made a mess.</li>
    <li> I just love using this product especially when I go to the gym and put it on when in the sauna room it helps my skin feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it and it keeps my skin so soft. I want to use it every day, but I try to save it for once a week.</li>
    <li> I like using this product, as it does make your skin smooth.  I keep it in the shower, and it is easy to dip into the jar because of the wide opening.  I would have preferred to have been able to order it in three different varieties of aromas.  Good value for the price and as long as it is free shipping, I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. I have used body scrubs from the Body Shop. I really like them but they can be very, very expensive for daily use. So, I decided to give this a try and I really like it. Since my skin is so rough, I can use it every day. And, I like having a subscription so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> Not as good a scrub as I was expecting. Thought it would have more salt in it to make it more effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,leave your skin feeling soft and looking younger.I love this scrub and highly recommend it.I even use it in the Steam Room.Not to mention,the price is very affordable. I give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! Love this product, it&#x27;s a great body scrub, I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Walmart instead of Amazon, and in the begining I agreed with some of the other reviews. It made my skin feel smooth and smelled great. Then after about a week I started to notice these small dry spots on my arm, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it. Now I have a whole bunch of dry, dark spots on my stomach, arms and legs! Needless to say I stopped using this product it immediately. Now I&#x27;m trying my hardest to fade these dry spots before summer, because I still want to look good in my bikini:(</li>
    <li> I like this sugar scrub it really exfoliate it leave your skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I love this scrub.</li>
    <li> use everyday to keep my skin soft</li>
    <li> Good scrub but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I&#x27;ve had Shea products before but this smells different.</li>
    <li> Smelled amazing, did a really nice job of exfoliating without leaving my skin feeling raw, and a little goes a long way. Would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. It&#x27;s just rough enough to thoroughly exfoliate without being too much. Smells great too. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Got this to please my lady.  She noticed the next day and complimented my smooth skin.  I just rub it around with my hands until the sugar dissolves.  Then I use Aveeno lotion after I towel dry.  I use it 2-3 times a week and she can&#x27;t keep her hands off of me.  Nice  :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body scrub. The texture is just right, stays on your skin when exfoliating, so you get a good scrub. Unlike many other scrubs that melts quickly. The scent is amazing (the brazilian nut and original shea are my favorites). Overall this product is a must have.</li>
    <li> The product left so much film around the rub, that I slipped.  Too bad I ordered the multipack.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Enough granules to feel it working but also enough moisture to feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice, I don&#x27;t care for perfumes or strong scents. This is a natural scent.</li>
