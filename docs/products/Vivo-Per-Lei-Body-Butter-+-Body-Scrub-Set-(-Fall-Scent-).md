      <li>They are all great and same as mall products.</li>
      <li>Nothing compared to original version.</li>

      <li>I love Vivo products generally, and since I like the the light scent of the products, this scrub is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Very good at removing dead skin.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The body butter is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>My face broke out more than normal</li>
      <li>love this stuff leaves my skin very soft</li>
      <li>Vivo is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ximico 20 pcs of extenders,is unknown as, I have not used it yet and don&#x27;t know how it will hold up</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Only those who has used the original will be able to tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, good product experience with Amazon, as usual.</li>
      <li>On the drive home I noticed just how soft my hands were and the subtle wonderful smell.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I have also enjoyed the facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>A better texture would have made the scrub easier to actually scrub!</li>
      <li>I first saw this in the mall was approached by a woman she was showing me the products</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my legs &amp;#34;literally&amp;#34; sucked it in</li>
      <li>The scrub consists of very large salt crystals, that are too large to stay on the skin</li>
      <li>And I particularly like the light, whipped texture of the cream, with the same lovely soft scent.  </li>
      <li>I did the demo on my hands but refused to pay their very high prices.  </li>
      <li>and now I don&#x27;t need to use as much as my skin is well hydrated.</li>
      <li>hahaha).</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t really paid attention to the name of this product, so my research began.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel so fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>Please tell me where to buy the original, because it&#x27;s the only thing that works for my skin</li>
      <li>It was interesting to find the identical products for less on line.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these products previously at a convention and love them.  </li>
      <li>I was in a mall and stopped by a very persistent young man selling this product.</li>
      <li>My incredibly dry itchy skin looks and feels so much better after only a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>I can only hope the results continue to improve my dry skin, but for now I am well pleased.</li>
      <li>We live in the desert</li>
      <li>The body scrub gently exfoliates that winter dried skin and leaves your skin flake free.</li>
      <li>Soft circles and salts will do the rest!</li>
      <li>I did question the idea the back of the jar said \\&quot;made in japan\\&quot; as I had heard the real Vivo says Israel but</li>
      <li>Ive used several different body butters from places like bath-and-body-works, but those feel like mostly scent, and less therapeutic.</li>
      <li>The cleanser was dry it didn&#x27;t really peal of the skin it just balled up.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on products including prescription ointments and creams.  </li>
      <li>and I was starting to have skin like an old prospector,</li>
      <li>and I was amazed at how these actually do keep your skin soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>So buy the original if you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money</li>

<li> Positive reviews about how this product made dry skin a thing of the past.  </li>
<li> A little of the oil in the scrub leaked out through the seal on the jar during shipping, but no big deal - jar was just a touch oily on the outside as a result.  </li>
<li> I have VERY DRY SKIN.  </li>
<li> The body scrub removes dead skin cells that make the skin appear dull and flaky, and the body butter leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft for several days.</li>
<li> I always apply the Body Butter while still wet and the Shea Butter fragrance is one of my favorites.</li>
<li> This has happened with other jar packaging.</li>
<li> It works so well on my son&#x27;s extremely dry skin and WAY CHEAPER than in the mall!!!</li>
<li> The jar is so large, however, that I&#x27;m afraid the product will dry out before its gone.</li>

    <li> good product.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Purchase arrived 5 days after anticipated.  Even though the scrub was wrapped in bubble wrap it leaked and there was an oily film all over the rest of the items.  The scrub was then dried out because of that.  Works OK, but would probsbly be better if scrub had been intact.</li>
    <li> Vivo is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ximico 20 pcs of extenders,is unknown as, I have not used it yet and don&#x27;t know how it will hold up</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion especially great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> i LOVEEEEEEE this product! I got it for my mom for valentines day (since my stepdad attempted to get her this but is a guy and ordered the face product instead! hahaha). Anyways, she LOVES it! And I got the face stuff and its my holy grail! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff and smells good too!!</li>
    <li> The body scrub gently exfoliates that winter dried skin and leaves your skin flake free. The body butter is not greasy and absorbs quickly. The first time I used it my legs &amp;#34;literally&amp;#34; sucked it in and now I don&#x27;t need to use as much as my skin is well hydrated. My legs feel like silk after I apply it. A must have for all skin types. This line of products is the best I have ever found. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> love this stuff leaves my skin very soft</li>
    <li> I was in a mall and stopped by a very persistent young man selling this product. I did the demo on my hands but refused to pay their very high prices.  On the drive home I noticed just how soft my hands were and the subtle wonderful smell.  I hadn&#x27;t really paid attention to the name of this product, so my research began. I read so many reviews.  Positive reviews about how this product made dry skin a thing of the past.  I also read reviews saying don&#x27;t buy its a fake.  Decided for the price I would try it.  Im so glad I did.  Its wonderful. I have VERY DRY SKIN.  I have spent so much money on products including prescription ointments and creams.  Yes the scrub leaked a little in transport but not that bad.  Yes it does say on a TINY sticker made in Japan not Israel but this works!!! My incredibly dry itchy skin looks and feels so much better after only a couple of days.  So buy the original if you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money but Im happy with this products results!! The smell is divine!!! I can only hope the results continue to improve my dry skin, but for now I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> The Body Butter is very moisturing and scrub is a great exfoliater!</li>

    <li> I would like this safe way more than I already do, If the sounds could be turned off. 3/5</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vivo products for years and still find them amazing. We live in the desert and I was starting to have skin like an old prospector, but with the Vivo scrubs to exfoliate and both products to smooth and rehydrate, my skin feels better than it has since I was a child.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all Vivo Per Lei products!  They are all great quality and make a noticeable difference when I use them.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful combination!  The body scrub removes dead skin cells that make the skin appear dull and flaky, and the body butter leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft for several days.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. The lotion was great, but the body scrub was more liquid than anything which is what happens when this kind of item is old. Was given refund, but could not order again as the price was raised on it and I would have had to also pay shipping on it. Would not order from this place again, would get it elsewhere</li>
    <li> I purchased these products previously at a convention and love them.  It was interesting to find the identical products for less on line.  the Body Scrub helps to make me feel cleaner after my shower.  I always apply the Body Butter while still wet and the Shea Butter fragrance is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> These are great! After I tried mine I had to get get some for my mom, she loves them too.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the body scrub can be a little harsh if you scrub too hard. Soft circles and salts will do the rest!</li>
    <li> This scent is very nice. The set was packed nicely with the original seals still intact. Ive used several different body butters from places like bath-and-body-works, but those feel like mostly scent, and less therapeutic. This product absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Vivo products to my friends.  Fantastic Body Scrub and Body Butter. After scrubbing with body scrub your skin feels exhilarated and smooth and well hydrated. Body Butter Fragrance is Wonderful. I have also enjoyed the facial moisturizer. I will be trying the facial peel next  ...... Kathi</li>
    <li> My face broke out more than normal the creams are oily.  The cleanser was dry it didn&#x27;t really peal of the skin it just balled up. I had a guy at the Mall tell me I looked like s*** because I wasn&#x27;t using this. 95 dollars at the mall I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy it there.</li>
    <li> Great value-they were selling it in Columbus Circle fair in Manhattan for 4-5 times this price!</li>
    <li> When the product arrived, the box was greasy and the scrub had leaked oil but product is great.</li>
    <li> I like the Body butter a lot, but the body scrub was delivered to me in a slightly opened jar.&lt;br /&gt;The oil in the scrub had leaked out all over the box.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is a  good product and smells wonderful.  Makes me feel so fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my skin looks radiant and soft, I am just using it, but I expect to have an even better review later.</li>
    <li> The body butter has a nice texture. The jar is so large, however, that I&#x27;m afraid the product will dry out before its gone. This has happened with other jar packaging. The scrub consists of very large salt crystals, that are too large to stay on the skin -they fall off everywhere. A better texture would have made the scrub easier to actually scrub!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> NICE BODY SCRUB AND BODY BUTTER MIXES.  GREAT TO USE AFTER A BATH OR SHOWER.  KEEPS THE SKIN CLEAN AND SUPPLE.  EASY TO USE AND HAS A NICE LIGHT SCENT.</li>
    <li> this product makes my skin feel moist and smooth.  I would buy this product again as soon as a need arrises</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer and scent is clean.</li>
    <li> just the mask was awfull</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have used this product before.&lt;br /&gt; My husband is  homebound, so shopping outside the house is very difficult.</li>
    <li> Fake, knock off! Nothing compared to original version. Only those who has used the original will be able to tell the difference. Please tell me where to buy the original, because it&#x27;s the only thing that works for my skin and I need it.</li>
    <li> I love Vivo products generally, and since I like the the light scent of the products, this scrub is my favorite.
