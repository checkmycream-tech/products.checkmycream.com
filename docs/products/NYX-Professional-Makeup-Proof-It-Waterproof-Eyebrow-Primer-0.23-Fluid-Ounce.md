      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>I adore all NYX products, this keeps my eye brows perfect all day long!</li>
      <li>While the product has good staying power, it applies very gummy.</li>
      <li>Light and easy.</li>
      <li>Way too light pigment.</li>
      <li>This product works fabulous.</li>
      <li>It applies very easily but I don&#x27;t think it really waterproofs colored eyebrow gels as claimed.</li>
      <li>I love NYX products because they are not expensive and don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you put your brows on the right way the first time</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really define my eyebrows and balls up and falls off if you rub or apply certain products on top.</li>
      <li>Worth your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m taking off one star because it seems to run out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>If you fill in your brows, prep with this first.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works~!</li>
      <li>Stays pretty well.</li>
      <li>Yesterday I wore it for the first time</li>
      <li>You dont need much either!</li>
      <li>I use to have a problem keeping my eyebrow from coming off due to sweating, but since I have been using nyx proof primer, it has been amazing; through sweating and the shower.</li>
      <li>It really freaking works, it actually makes my eyebrows look more real.</li>
      <li>I was sent old product), appeared to not be full when it arrived.</li>
      <li>Works really well with powder.</li>
      <li>If you can see it, then you&#x27;ve applied too much.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>I draw on my eyebrows every day and really needed a product that would make them stay allllll day.</li>
      <li>It really help to keep powder on.</li>
      <li>Works very waterproof after 6 hours of being at waterpark but if apply to much the substance will start to appear on brows</li>
      <li>This stuff really holds on to my eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>even when it&#x27;s raining and shipping is fast</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>so you have to move fast.</li>
      <li>I really wish I would&#x27;ve know about this sooner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>by hour 6..not so much.</li>
      <li>However it does dry very quickly</li>
      <li>I highly recommended and will continue to buy it</li>
      <li>I recommend using a brow powder instead of a pencil or gel with this product because it seems to go on a little more evenly.</li>
      <li>Finally after buying thousands of products to keep my brow powder on when its hot and humid (I dont like to MELT)... I have found the product I will never be without again!</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely waterproof but who really wears makeup in the shower??</li>
      <li>Apply your brow Shadow right before the product is almost dry...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really waterproof last all day until u take it off with your cleansing.</li>
      <li>The tube, (which did not appear to be old stock</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy a few more of these.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no actually black</li>
      <li>A lil goes a long way, dries fast, will keep brows in place all day.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would suggest is putting it on sparingly; you don&#x27;t need too much or it will turn white.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on powder and gels for my brows.</li>
      <li>I was little unsure at first, but I use it every time now.</li>
      <li>However, if you use too much your eye brow starts to look a little grayish, play-doh looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this it keeps my eyebrows in place even when it&#x27;s raining and shipping is fast</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on with me.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I bought it to put under my brow shadow, and it makes it last all day!</li>
    <li> Hi ladies! Let&#x27;s just say, since I was 13 I&#x27;ve tried perfecting the perfect eyebrow. I&#x27;m 32 now...now I&#x27;ve finally found the miracle in a bottle. I have immensely oily skin. Once washed, my brows and skin looked flawless..by hour 6..not so much. :-(  Well this stuff works! No more disappearing eyebrows by 3pm. I really wish I would&#x27;ve know about this sooner. Hint:  The only thing I would suggest is putting it on sparingly; you don&#x27;t need too much or it will turn white. Also, make sure you put your brows on the right way the first time bc it&#x27;s difficult to remove if you make a mistake. Hence, the reason this product works, those brows are going anywhere until you work vigorously to remove them.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday for my sparse eyebrows. One tube lasts me 5-6 months. I&#x27;m still amazed at how well this stuff works and the staying power is incredible. I can even take a shower and wash my face and it will last through that, but of course if you need to get it off you can. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Same as eye shadow...not I pressed w/product performance...leaves a &amp;#34;track&amp;#34; when it drys.  Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> Omg this stuff works even with powder eyebrow product.. Yesterday I wore it for the first time and I sweat a lot and my powder eyebrow stayed, and when I got home, tried to remove with water, nope I had to use make up wipes and had to go over it a couple times..</li>
    <li> I adore all NYX products, this keeps my eye brows perfect all day long!</li>
    <li> Stays on for about 12 hours (or a little longer if you don&#x27;t fall asleep) i recommend it if you are on a budget. This stuff really holds on to my eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this product. I was little unsure at first, but I use it every time now. This product works fabulous.</li>
    <li> This is not the ideal eyebrow primer if you want quality. It gets flaky and leaves white residue on your brows. Also, it dries almost instantly leaving you with no choice but to fill in your eyebrows at a rapid pace and if you mess up there is no going back! Do not buy this is you are a beginner to filling in your brows or like quality or if you like to take your time with your brows.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews are correct. A lil goes a long way, dries fast, will keep brows in place all day. I apply, brush my brows up &amp; over, let dry, then fill in my brows. As stated, it can be difficult to redo the brow after it sets. I just dampen a paper towel with a lil warm water and a dab of coconut oil &amp; wipe it off. I think it will be great for summer.</li>
    <li> It applies very easily but I don&#x27;t think it really waterproofs colored eyebrow gels as claimed. Maybe makes it more water or sweat resistant but not shower resistant</li>
    <li> I received the product on yesterday and it seems to work ok. I will update again after I have used it for a few days. I have spent so much money on powder and gels for my brows. Hopefully this will be the product I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it will buy again</li>
    <li> Works very waterproof after 6 hours of being at waterpark but if apply to much the substance will start to appear on brows</li>
    <li> Love it, I put this on and my eyebrows don&#x27;t move! Works well with the waterproof brow gel, used this on a cruise and my eyebrows were on fleek even after I went snorkeling in the ocean</li>
    <li> You need less than you may expect - dab on a dot or two and blend with your fingertip - not the sponge applicator. Even doing it this way, I still think there should be more product in the tube.</li>
    <li> Good product it&#x27;s no actually black it&#x27;s very dark brown but it can be mixed with black pencil or powder and would appear black. However it does dry very quickly so you have to move fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. It does what it says it does. If you fill in your brows, prep with this first. You will never worry about your brows melting off.Stood up to North Carolina Summer sun and WON.</li>
    <li> So far so good, works perfectly</li>
    <li> This product definitely kept me from sweating my eyebrows off but it does leave them a little sticky. I recommend using a brow powder instead of a pencil or gel with this product because it seems to go on a little more evenly.</li>
    <li> On the days when I actually feel like doing something with my eyebrows, this little item works wonders. Slap it on, wait a minute, do your brows, done until bedtime. I&#x27;m taking off one star because it seems to run out pretty quickly. I love NYX products because they are not expensive and don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
    <li> gums up all the brow, making it very hard, and looks greyish on application.</li>
    <li> Great! I draw on my eyebrows every day and really needed a product that would make them stay allllll day. This stuff really works~!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... A little goes a long way and even stays on when i sleep. Apply your brow Shadow right before the product is almost dry... last during swimming and just about everything LOL</li>
    <li> Works great! All u need is a little. It&#x27;s only gummy if u use a lot, which is not required. If you can see it, then you&#x27;ve applied too much. Don&#x27;t be heavy handed like ur painting ur bedroom wall. Light and easy. Great stuff but not so much in the tube.</li>
    <li> WOW!! Finally something completely waterproof for those of us who are not born with thick eyebrows! I used it once and even wearing my fedora all day my eyebrows didn&#x27;t smudge or get ruined!!! The inside brim didn&#x27;t rub all the makeup on it! My eyebrows were in tack for 12 hours! LOve this product!! I&#x27;ve been waiting forever for a product like this that actually does what it promises! granted i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely waterproof but who really wears makeup in the shower?? I&#x27;m sure if I got caught in the rain it would stay .... I hope!</li>
    <li> Sold to someone else lol</li>
    <li> I use to have a problem keeping my eyebrow from coming off due to sweating, but since I have been using nyx proof primer, it has been amazing; through sweating and the shower. This one is a keeper! I love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> FINALLY! I no longer need to carry my eyebrow pencil around with me in my purse for secret touch ups throughout the day!!! I apply this product before I shape and fill in my eyebrows with a pencil (it says to use a powder but a pencil works great too!!) and it stays so well! Literally, I&#x27;m so thankful I found this product! Great price too!!</li>
    <li> I really like this. It really help to keep powder on. You don&#x27;t need alot. A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> My eyebrow pencil lasts all day.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at Ulta. To the people with low ratings, you should try using very little. It really freaking works, it actually makes my eyebrows look more real. I have tricotillomania so this is a life saver for those hair pullers. So keep in mind to put minimal on, not gobs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, for the price. Will buy again. :)</li>
    <li> Stays pretty well. However, if you use too much your eye brow starts to look a little grayish, play-doh looking. I will definitely buy a few more of these. Finally, I found something to keep these eye brows on my face instead of my pillow, boyfriends shirt or anywhere else they run to. Lol</li>
    <li> I use it before ABH Dipbrow Pomade and I love it. It holds and holds....</li>
    <li> I love it. Works great. Don&#x27;t have to worry to retouch.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would</li>
    <li> I used the NYX waterproof eyebrow base and it worked!!!!! I followed the directions listed on the box and I applied the eyebrow base and it stayed on all day. I am very pleased with all NYX products and I highly recommend you try the waterproof eyebrow base!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really define my eyebrows and balls up and falls off if you rub or apply certain products on top. Way too light pigment. The brush isn&#x27;t really effective. I plan on spending more money and getting Dipbrow.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product  It&#x27;s really waterproof last all day until u take it off with your cleansing. I go to the beach and still on. Makes my brows beautiful and fuller. I highly recommended and will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> While the product has good staying power, it applies very gummy. The tube, (which did not appear to be old stock so I did not feel concern I was sent old product), appeared to not be full when it arrived. I feel like I&#x27;m digging out product with the applicator. Yet what I manage to use seems to be good, after I clean up the gummy bits.</li>
    <li> Worth your money. Really like this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS! Finally after buying thousands of products to keep my brow powder on when its hot and humid (I dont like to MELT)... I have found the product I will never be without again! I am amazed!!! If you want something to keep your powder on, you need this! You dont need much either!</li>
    <li> Works really well with powder. Wish it worked for gel too.</li>
    <li> Very effective at priming the eyebrow for makeup. A little goes a long way, too much causes the eyebrow to look white</li>
    <li> Was not the quality I had wanted.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and brows stay in place all day! &amp; it truly is waterproof</li>
</ol>
