<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product smells heavenly.  The serum does come out of the dropper really fast, so I have learned to have only a drop in the dropper and use the serum that is on the side of the dropper.  My skin feels smoother and more radiant.</li>
    <li> Love this - better than other vitamin C I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift so wont be using it for myself. Serum looks great with top quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because this bottle it smells like burnt orange. The first bottle smelled very nice. Not this last bottle</li>
    <li> Ok, this product Is amazing! I tried this about three weeks ago and the first time I used it I saw an improvement in the texture of my skin! The box says use and see immediate results, we&#x27;ll they weren&#x27;t kidding!  My skin is more supple and fine lines are less noticeable! Liked so much I bought another bottle. Thanks Amazon for making this product affordable for us otherwise would not know how great this is!</li>
    <li> Great silky serum, improved the texture of my skin and reduced the wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a little of a month.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it a review and until I really had time to see if it work and I love it!  The silky soft feeling when you apply it is great but how it has decrease my wrinkles on my forehead and under the eyes (this is the area I concentrated on) was really impressive. I will be ordering this product again when I run out.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my wife to test and compare to the other product see was using, and she love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am on a hunt for a Vitamin C serum.  The product is different from two other similar products I have tried from different companies.  It is silicon-y.  It didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.  I hate that fake smoothness on my face.  I finished the product but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it, leaves my fine lines less visible. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product , smells great. My skin feels so soft and smooth. Arrived on time ,good customer service.</li>
    <li> I loved the product, it worked great. I saw a difference in the softness of my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! I saw a difference in my skin the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to treat dull complexion and dark spots, way more cost effective compare to Obagi Professional C. The serum texture is clear and does not turn gooey over time like Obagi. I can see my skin glows with this one!</li>
    <li> Bought this on husbands Amazon so forgot to review...that said, I don&#x27;t see miracles but didn&#x27;t expect any. I do love this stuff! Makes my skin smooth and soft w/o break outs. Buying again.</li>
    <li> Love this Synergy serum!  I Love the slight scent-it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or nose-I don&#x27;t even wear perfume because I can&#x27;t stand any scent.  The FIRST time I put this on-I knew it was a winner.  It makes your skin feel so soft &amp; silky.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying different vitamin face serums &amp; this is my FAVORITE!  Try this serum out &amp; you will love it too.  Thanks for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Have only used this serum for a few days but am already in love with it and have ordered another bottle.  Your skin feels like silk when you apply it and it absorbs quicker than any other that I have used.  Can&#x27;t comment on the long term effects yet but will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product smells like an orange dreamcicle!!! Not only does my skin feel very smooth, like after a facial, but I smell nice as well! I am excited to see the results of some old scarring from teenage years. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend. I think it looks wonderful and will be perfect in a little beauty basket.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the my face.  Very smooth going on!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel softer. I can&#x27;t tell yet if helps with wrinkles but I like the way it makes my skin feel so I will keep on using it! I&#x27;m pretty susceptible to break outs and it didn&#x27;t cause any!</li>
    <li> Wow, I can see why people love this Vitamin C serum.  I can see a difference already.  If you are getting older and have a few wrinkles, try this serum.  Spectacular results!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and has a nice subtle smell to it!</li>
    <li> it shows the result really fast and makes me feel great every time I used (and really quick absorbed by skin)</li>
    <li> Good , but i will not order again,&lt;br /&gt;It is not magic buty&lt;br /&gt;I do not seeo any difference on my skin</li>
    <li> This product is true to its description! Saw results in the first use. Significant improvement in forehead and brow lines. I love how soft my skin feels!</li>
    <li> This oil was great..I really enjoyed this products. I used it every morning and night. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! It&#x27;s got vitamin c, which you can pay a fortune for alone. Then it also includes vitamin a and vitamin e, along with other ingredients beneficial to skin. I detect no scent in this serum, and am using it on my face and around my eyes with no irritation. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin with rosacea and recommend this product without reservations. It comes in a liquid form and goes on smoothly and soaks right in. No tacky or greasy feeling leftover. I layer products and this product layers well with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting to use vitamin c I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the brightness of my skin and a more even tone. I think it looks like I&#x27;m wearing powder when I&#x27;m wearing nothing. Vitamin c is the only product that has ever had this type of impact on my skin. I&#x27;m amazed! I&#x27;ve also noticed lightening of old acne scars along my jaw. I thought I&#x27;d always have to live with them, and now they are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulation is shelf stable, which is so important for these volatile anti-oxidants. It&#x27;s easy for a product to say it has a percentage of something when it was manufactured, but it takes a lot of effort to make sure it retains those percentages over time and with use. This serum is in a dark bottle and you use a dropper. These combined make sure the product stays intact and sanitary. This is also the only product I&#x27;ve seen that lists a manufacturing date on the bottle, along with an expiration time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum does everything right. Great formulation, packaging, and dating! Thank you so much! And at a wonderful price for such a quality product. Give it a try. I think your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;m always on the look out for new skin care products and I just love this one. Did not cause breakouts and definitely helps to brighten the skin!</li>
    <li> I have just began using this product.  Have not noticed any change.  Has a nice scent.  Plan to update if results change.</li>
