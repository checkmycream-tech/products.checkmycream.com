<li> , we cannot be responsible for the incident due to mishandling in keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also... the white is kind of weird... if you don&#x27;t put a gloss over it, it just looks like you dipped your wet nails in flour.  </li>
<li> I have two other colors of this same brand and have had the same issue with all three.</li>
<li> , I think it&#x27;s just the white one because I also bought the black one</li>
<li> This nail polish is not good at all, I tried it over various colors and it didn&#x27;t look white enough, it was to transparent</li>
<li> A few months later I go to use another nail polish</li>
<li> I tried to untwist it and try to figure out what is going on, but the polish has glued it shut, is dried all over the outside</li>
<li> I bought this without reading several of the previous reviews written and after I read them I panicked!</li>
<li> and I notice this polish has exploded all over the other ones!</li>
<li> Less than a week.  </li>
<li> Even though I let my pink polish undercoat dry thouroughly, the Mia&#x27;s secret pulled it around and melted into the pink.</li>
<li> The black handle/cap is warped and feels squishy.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not as in your face as the black version.</li>
<li> Did not look as crackled as the black did.  </li>
<li> I also feel tho that it can look a little murky without a gloss finish...</li>
<li> not pleased at all.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order any of the other Mia&#x27;s secret polishes.</li>
<li> It does run a little thin but</li>
<li> So I used my polish one time, and it was a weird texture and watery unlike what I expected.  </li>
<li> The White, not so crazy about, it sort of stood out on my nails.</li>
<li> It showed up late and when I used it.</li>
<li> I found my Mia Secret Crakle for a fraction of the cost in a nail salon.</li>
<li> Sucks, doesnt crackle unless you scrap it, doesnt even look like nail polish its a weird texture.</li>
<li> Looks sloppy when finished.  </li>
<li> but when i actually tried it, i was very disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;We are sorry to hear that incident.&lt;br</li>
<li> This must have some weird chemicals in it that makes the polish expand over time.</li>
<li> The nails with the product are so long and fake and the colors effect is awful.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
<li> I was equally disappointed when I tried Mia&#x27;s Secret and found that it did not work well at all.    </li>
<li> Sorry, but chubby fingers with stump nails and a bad polishing job has influenced me to NOT purchase the product.</li>
<li> The finish of the Mia&#x27;s secret was a very ugly matte, which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
<li> Not too bad.</li>
<li> This crackle polish is ugly.</li>
<li> Disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
<li> I hate paying retail price</li>
<li> Looks awful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking at the new nail crackle products and came across this one. I would not purchase it based upon ALL of the hideous pictures shown. The nails with the product are so long and fake and the colors effect is awful. The woman who sent her own pictures  is not appealing either. Sorry, but chubby fingers with stump nails and a bad polishing job has influenced me to NOT purchase the product.</li>
    <li> I hate paying retail price so I go to Amazon &amp; do a look-see. I found my Mia Secret Crakle for a fraction of the cost in a nail salon. I received my package within days of placing my order. All the other nail polishes were in perfect condition! I will continue to order from Nail Beauty 4U!</li>
    <li> It showed up late and when I used it. it seem like it was watery not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> Sucks, doesnt crackle unless you scrap it, doesnt even look like nail polish its a weird texture. not pleased at all. do not buy</li>
    <li> This product I have in two colors. Sky and white. It crackles fairly well for being $4. I also feel tho that it can look a little murky without a gloss finish... but the gloss also made it slop up the crackle affect. So it would be best without it in my opinion. I would recommend a bold color underneath however. But for the price my answer is settle for it. Not too bad. On a 1 - 10.... is say 7.</li>
    <li> I found this one sometimes moved the nail polish underneath and I would end up with bald spots instead of color under the crackle.  Also... the white is kind of weird... if you don&#x27;t put a gloss over it, it just looks like you dipped your wet nails in flour.  Otherwise though, I&#x27;ve gotten some really cute looks and it&#x27;s not as in your face as the black version.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to order white crackle polish, as I love OPI&#x27;s black Shatter crackle.    I was equally disappointed when I tried Mia&#x27;s Secret and found that it did not work well at all.    Even though I let my pink polish undercoat dry thouroughly, the Mia&#x27;s secret pulled it around and melted into the pink. The finish of the Mia&#x27;s secret was a very ugly matte, which I didn&#x27;t expect. Also it didn&#x27;t crackle horizontally at all, only vertically.    So when i looked at my nails it looked like something out of a hideous horror movie. I had to remove it right away. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order any of the other Mia&#x27;s secret polishes.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is not good at all, I tried it over various colors and it didn&#x27;t look white enough, it was to transparent, I think it&#x27;s just the white one because I also bought the black one and I love that one.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as nicely as the pictures would have you believe. We&#x27;ve since purchased another brand and it works much better. Disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I was very please with the response from when the order took place until it was done.  Less than a week.  I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this polish it is just a good as OPI crackle. it actually lasted onmy nails for quite sometime which is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have used the Crackle Nail Polish in the Black and LOVE IT....The White, not so crazy about, it sort of stood out on my nails. Did not look as crackled as the black did.  Thinking it is for the young lol.</li>
    <li> this item didnt give me the crackle effect i was looking for. I eventually ended up purchasing the OPI shattered polish anyway</li>
    <li> I was really excited to see this white polish at such a low price with it being the &#x27;in&#x27; thing right now. but when i actually tried it, i was very disappointed. it&#x27;s very thin. and i dont think you cant keep coating it because then the crackle won&#x27;t work. so if i had to do it again, i wouldn&#x27;t buy this. not even at that price.</li>
    <li> I bought this without reading several of the previous reviews written and after I read them I panicked! So I decided to go ahead and give it a try anyways. I did not apply this to my bare nail but to my sally hansen nail polish and it looks great! It does run a little thin but nothing I can not solve on my own. It cracks perfect as well. I topped it off with a coat of Seche Vite and the look fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and was anxious to give it to her for Christmas, she and her friends talk about \\&quot;crackle\\&quot; and I as interested to see what it did. It is so cool to watch it work. I was impressed by the price! Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> Dried up fast in the bottle, color seperated in the bottle.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crackle&amp;#34; very well.  Looks sloppy when finished.  I have two other colors of this same brand and have had the same issue with all three.</li>
    <li> This crackle polish is ugly. Looks awful! Tried with different colors still isn&#x27;t working for me. Gave it away! Will not buy no crackle nail polish ever again!</li>
    <li> wanted to buy it to see if they tasted like milk duds they did so I will buy them again</li>
    <li> So I used my polish one time, and it was a weird texture and watery unlike what I expected.  I thought it would be too much of a bother to return it since I hadn&#x27;t paid much, so I just put it in my bathroom cupboard with my other polishes. A few months later I go to use another nail polish and I notice this polish has exploded all over the other ones! The black handle/cap is warped and feels squishy. I tried to untwist it and try to figure out what is going on, but the polish has glued it shut, is dried all over the outside and this is going in the garbage since they won&#x27;t take the return! This must have some weird chemicals in it that makes the polish expand over time. BEWARE! LOL Here is how they responded when I told them their product exploded:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sorry to hear that incident.&lt;br /&gt;It, however, has been more than five months since the delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The return request should be filed within 30 days from delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Also, we cannot be responsible for the incident due to mishandling in keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE41 BEAUTY</li>
