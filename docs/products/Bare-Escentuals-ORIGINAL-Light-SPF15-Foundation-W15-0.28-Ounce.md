      <li>Easy as that!  </li>
      <li>If you do not read the very fine print ...</li>
      <li>I love the Bare Escentuals Veil the best.  </li>
      <li>well, read the fine print!  :)</li>
      <li>and I love the product</li>
      <li>I know and love this product and was so happy to see it selling for such a good price.  </li>
      <li>I should have been paying more attention.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this makeup.  </li>
      <li>My fault for not looking better.</li>
      <li>Glad I stocked up</li>
      <li>I use that one the most.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure these sellers have a lot of one-time customers--</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years, and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I thought I would be getting more for what I paid than the sample size that you get when you buy the kit.  </li>
      <li>but I missed the sizing on this like many of the reviewers.  </li>
      <li>However, love the product</li>
      <li>If you need a smaller travel size, this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply with a beauty brush and very quick.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and the best part is the spf in it, too.</li>
      <li>It gives a great soft airbrushed look that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This product is great, i love Bare Escentuals products.</li>
      <li>Travel sizes always cost more than full size of any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is hands down the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>Size deceiving, ordered light w15 got 1g light....</li>
      <li>In the seller&#x27;s defense, it&#x27;s a free country and you can sell anything you want</li>
      <li>Tap the brush lightly to shake off any excess.</li>
      <li>This was misleading as it comes up with all the 8 gram requested products so it was assumed that this fit the criterion and the price was comparable to all the 8 gram make up containers.</li>
      <li>so when I see &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; i need light.</li>
      <li>I thought \\&quot;wow what a good deal!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still very worth the money.</li>
      <li>3) Sell product for what appears to be a good price but is actually three times more than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>This is not the original product.  </li>
      <li>Returned product and will purchase from the original manufacturer.</li>
      <li>What can I say, I love Bare Escentuals Light SPF15 Foundation W15!</li>
      <li>a picture that makes the product appear to be full size.</li>
      <li>You can go back, with the same brush, and lightly buff your face for a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>I somehow missed that this was the smaller size so the price for the product is not as good as I thought.  </li>
      <li>Thought it was the full size container - not the sample size.</li>
      <li>But I honestly think that is because of the foundation primer I use, by Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>I love this make-up, the product was shipped fast and exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I got this at Sephora for $25 and it was worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It feels great on your face and covers any redness or spots with a natural finish without feeling oily or heavy on your skin like so many liquid foundations can feel.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is all natural with no chemicals to harm my face.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it here for so much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Love bare minerals.  </li>
      <li>but the product is great, as usual.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals and this met my expectations for product and shipping .</li>
      <li>I love bare escentuals.  </li>
      <li>I do like it very much.  </li>
      <li>If you intend on getting less than 1/4 of the full size for the same price as the full size, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this rip off.</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>so I spilled powder everywhere the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love this makeup and have been using it for a long time.</li>
      <li>but they certainly didn&#x27;t point out the fact that they are selling this product for $10 a gram.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was the large container</li>
      <li>So although it&#x27;s great, you can definitely find it for less online than this.</li>
      <li>However, I want this smaller size for travel, so buying a couple of them for that purpose suits me just fine.  </li>
      <li>Arrived safe in a padded box and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>The seller didn&#x27;t really hide the fact that this is a two gram package</li>
      <li>It came really fast in the mail</li>
      <li>Also even though this is the light, it has a bit of a red tint to it.</li>
      <li>Great product at not a great value.</li>
      <li>I DID read the description of this product, I did not read the reviews though and really should have.  </li>
      <li>I feel I paid to much for the size i got.</li>
      <li>Am familiar with this product, but local store moved so bought as online.</li>
      <li>I have to clean off my white countertops every time I use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The size was a lot smaller than I normally get. My fault for not looking better. Price for size was outrageous!</li>
    <li> I love bare escentuals.  This shipped on time.  It was exactly as described.  The problem?  ME.  I didn&#x27;t read that it is .07 ounce, which is less than 1/3 the size of the bare escentuals foundation I buy at my local beauty store.  I thought \\&quot;wow what a good deal!\\&quot;  Is my face red.  I paid almost double what I would have for a small little container of this.  My fault.  Caveat emptor.  If you need a smaller travel size, this is perfect.  If not...well, read the fine print!  :)&lt;br /&gt;so, OOPS!</li>
    <li> Good product, but I didn&#x27;t read the size carefully and was surprised by the size.  Much smaller than I expected given the price and my prior purchasing experience.  I believe I got a bigger one for less money at Sephora the last time I purchased this.</li>
    <li> This is an attempted copy cat.  This is not the original product.  Very disappointed that Amazon would do business this way.  Returned product and will purchase from the original manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for a bout 2 years now.  Before I sort of flipp flopped between several different cheaper brands.  I got this at Sephora for $25 and it was worth every penny.  I was so excited to find it here for so much cheaper.  This stuff goes on so great and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t crease or get greasy like liquid foundation can do.  It gives a great soft airbrushed look that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great foundation and coverage! I love the fact that it is all natural with no chemicals to harm my face. It lasts all day too.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I should have looked closer - this container is 1/4 of the size I purchased at the Bare Escentuals store, hence the price being $10 less. I thought I was getting quite a bargain, but really just a much smaller size, higher per ounce price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this makeup.  It is hands down the best on the market.  I wish they would give coupons due to it being pricy but it&#x27;s still very worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job covering flaws in my skin. The only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; one might have is that it&#x27;s messy. I have to clean off my white countertops every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I DID read the description of this product, I did not read the reviews though and really should have.  The product is only 2 grams, instead of typical 8 or 9 from the store.  It seems like it is a good price, but it is not!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on amazon.  I don&#x27;t make a great deal of money and I was thrilled to find this seller.  I love the product and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I love Bare Escentuals Light SPF15 Foundation W15! I purchased this for someone else and it came wrapped in a plastic bag. It tasted metallic and had a neutral odor. I&#x27;d recommend serving it with a red wine and chocolate.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was the smaller size for the larger size price. I should have been paying more attention. Great product at not a great value.</li>
    <li> I know the product and use it well.  Was disappointed that the size was sample size, not regular size.</li>
    <li> I knew the size was smaller than what I typically purchase at Ulta.  However, I want this smaller size for travel, so buying a couple of them for that purpose suits me just fine.  Travel sizes always cost more than full size of any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a concealer/foundation, this product can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> They sent the wrong product altogether. It&#x27;s not even worth it to return as it is such a small size.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews people. This is a teeny tiny size of powder….and again I didn&#x27;t even get what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it to go through the hassle of returning. Buyer beware. Sucks to get scammed on size of product … sucks more to not even get the product I ordered.</li>
    <li> Good price, love the way it looks on my skin</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Escentuals foundation for about 5 years. I started using it because I did not like the artifical look of the cream foundations, plus they were clogging my pores. This foundation is so flawless. You can see people looking at you as they are admiring your beautiful skin and the glow that it gives you. It is very easy to apply with a beauty brush and very quick. I use a medium bristle brush. Just shake some foundation into the cap of the container. Dab your brush in the foundation in the cap. Tap the brush lightly to shake off any excess. Brush your face with the foundation. You can go back, with the same brush, and lightly buff your face for a flawless finish. Very natural looking. I would highly recommend. There is no scent to this product. Blush and other cosmetics apply easily over the foundation. A little bit goes a long way. You do not need to apply it but once per day. The container last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like it, it does seem to go on a little smoother than the other brands of mineral makeup. But I honestly think that is because of the foundation primer I use, by Bare Minerals. Also even though this is the light, it has a bit of a red tint to it.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup and have been using it for a long time. When I ordered this one I did not realize that it was trial size so I don&#x27;t think the value was great</li>
    <li> Great makeup - reasonably priced, seems to last forever and a little goes a long way.  Great light coverage with SPF.  I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years, and I still love it.</li>
    <li> Size deceiving, ordered light w15 got 1g light.... Bad deal all around. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> It came really fast in the mail and I love the product but I didnt read it well and didnt realize it was only 2 grams rather than 8 g</li>
    <li> This product was so well priced because it is not full-sized. Don&#x27;t be fooled by this seller! Read their product descriptions carefully.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the reviews which expose this scam because I didn&#x27;t think I had to.  I know and love this product and was so happy to see it selling for such a good price.  Well, imagine my surprise when I open the box to find what appears to be a sample size product.  I thought there was a mistake so I looked at the information again.  The seller didn&#x27;t really hide the fact that this is a two gram package but they certainly didn&#x27;t point out the fact that they are selling this product for $10 a gram.  You can buy this anywhere else for $3 a gram.  This is a scam!! Here&#x27;s how it works:  1) take a well known product with a following that people won&#x27;t have to see the reviews to make a decision.  2)Show a picture that makes the product appear to be full size. 3) Sell product for what appears to be a good price but is actually three times more than it&#x27;s worth.  Easy as that!  In the seller&#x27;s defense, it&#x27;s a free country and you can sell anything you want for whatever price you want if you can find someone stupid enough to buy it.  I&#x27;m sure these sellers have a lot of one-time customers--I know I&#x27;m one...</li>
    <li> Small &amp; clumped together not sure if that was a shipping problem or manufacturing but I was not satisfied for the money.</li>
    <li> Years ago i had used bare minerals foundation, and decided after not using it for 2 years i would purchase this foundation again. Wow! It really is an amazing product! It feels great on your face and covers any redness or spots with a natural finish without feeling oily or heavy on your skin like so many liquid foundations can feel. It lasts a long time and the best part is the spf in it, too. If you are looking for a natural looking mineral foundation for your skin, this is it!</li>
    <li> I somehow missed that this was the smaller size so the price for the product is not as good as I thought.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  Otherwise product is the same bare essentials you&#x27;d get in the standard size.</li>
    <li> Truth is, it&#x27;s my responsibility to closely examine a listing before deciding to purchase. However, I didn&#x27;t notice this was only 2 g. I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years &amp; I love it. It&#x27;s a great product. I would give this product 5 stars if I was just rating the foundation. If you intend on getting less than 1/4 of the full size for the same price as the full size, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this rip off.</li>
    <li> Very upset I spent my money on this, its very small could have got a bigger one for about the same price, not worth it :(</li>
    <li> Much smaller container than the one I usually buy - take note of this smaller size - that is why it is cheaper than others listed. My fault for not looking closer at the size.</li>
    <li> I love the Bare Escentuals Veil the best.  I use that one the most.  I do like it very much.  I would recommend that product to anyone who is applying make up.</li>
    <li> I thought I would be getting more for what I paid than the sample size that you get when you buy the kit.  Also, the container does not have a closure mechanism so I spilled powder everywhere the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a good deal  But was told no savings on the size of product.  Glad I stocked up</li>
    <li> As other posters had mentioned, this is the small size which is not clear from the product description.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated . I love bare minerals and this met my expectations for product and shipping .</li>
    <li> Great item. My girlfriend loves this product. I should have her write this review..</li>
    <li> Title of product did not say that size was only 2g, you had to notice that in the photo. Well, I did not so this product was a terrible price and actually cost more than buying from the B.E. website (where typical size is 9g not 2g). I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love this make-up, the product was shipped fast and exactly as described.  I did want a smaller size for traveling.  However, I just purchased the MUCH larger size for less than this on eBay!  So although it&#x27;s great, you can definitely find it for less online than this.</li>
    <li> Title doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s only 2g. Way smaller than I thought it was and the actual container doesn&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
    <li> Only use Bare Escentials. Am familiar with this product, but local store moved so bought as online. As expected.</li>
    <li> Misleading. Thought it was the full size container - not the sample size.</li>
    <li> Love bare minerals.  It covers great and does not break out my face.</li>
    <li> This product is great, i love Bare Escentuals products. I wish, however, I paid attention to the size of what I ordered. I thought it was the large container and is was the small sample one. I feel I paid to much for the size i got.</li>
    <li> This make up is great! It helps even my skin tone out and it is very easy to apply. I&#x27;ve been  using it for a couple years now.You do need a good brush for it. I would recommend the starter kit by Bare Minerals if you&#x27;re new to this.</li>
    <li> I have tricky skin - oily in some places, dry in others, sensitive, acne prone, rosacea, and eczema.  Bare Minerals is the only makeup that I can layer for the exact amount of coverage I want.  It doesn&#x27;t get gunky or gummy, I can use matte or regular, and it looks so natural.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Arrived safe in a padded box and arrived sooner than expected. Very happy with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife but I missed the sizing on this like many of the reviewers.  I&#x27;m not happy with the size I got for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention, but this is a very small container.  I think the intention is to sell this to people who dont realize that because I have often found the 8g container for this price.  This ended up being very expensive, coulda saved money by going to the high end cosmetics store at this rate.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the size for the price. This is not the standard size, but appears to come out of the starter kits. I thought I had looked closely, but next time I&#x27;ll use another seller, or go to the boutique I couldn&#x27;t get to this time.</li>
    <li> Smaller package than expected</li>
    <li> I must say I got snookered by this product! I am not happy about it, but if I can warn someone else then that makes it much better! This product is only 2 g! I bought it not realizing that it was 6g less than the normal container.  It is a shame that I didn&#x27;t catch it until I ran out of it only after a month of using.  In my opinion don&#x27;t buy this product, not a good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a classic scam .. If you do not read the very fine print ... You do not realize this is a small 2gram ,, not full size 8 gram product. .. So for $19 for 2 g ... A full size one would cost  $80 !!! .. And it costs only 28 ! ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor wrote a nasty letter back to me telling me i should have read the fine print .. And that  why was i wasting my time complaining .. And that I was a pretty stupid person for doing so ..  nice !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the vendor knows ...and the other reviews show that most people were angry that they had been fooled by this ..,and sending it back is a pain  .. So you keep it and they keep their money ! .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy !!! .. Find a full size one !!</li>
    <li> This offer is for a small contaner (00.7oz compared to the.28oz sold at Ulta and other stores. Once that is factored in, the price is not at all a good deal. On the other hand, the container can be used completely since it doesn&#x27;t have the same dispenser system the larger one has. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have read the reviews..I too made the mistake of not checking the size, however I do feel it should be mentioned in the title. Great product but terrible price for amount you get.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased with the understanding that it was the standard 8g container. This was misleading as it comes up with all the 8 gram requested products so it was assumed that this fit the criterion and the price was comparable to all the 8 gram make up containers. Upon receipt this container was only 2 grams. Because it is a PINA to send it back I gave it to my  very impatient daughter but in the future I will be very weary of this buyer and any future buyer who conveniently leaves off pertinent information.</li>
    <li> very small container!</li>
    <li> The amount was smaller than expected and the color was darker than I wanted. I am a pale gal so when I see &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; i need light. Not quite what I was expecting. However, love the product so I will still use it.</li>
    <li> I like this make up good price and looks great</li>
    <li> Smaller container than I was expecting but the product is great, as usual.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years!</li>
    <li> this is a sample size product - instead of 6g its 2g.  i didnt realize they sold the sample size alone, so i didnt double check size.  that&#x27;s my fault, but this is 1/3 the normal size at 2/3 the price - its a rip-off.  buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Great powder and good coverage</li>
