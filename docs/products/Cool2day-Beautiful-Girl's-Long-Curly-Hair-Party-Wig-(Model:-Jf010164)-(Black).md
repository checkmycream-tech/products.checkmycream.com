      <li>The wig looks great out of the package, but as soon as you put it one the hair goes everywhere and will not work with you.</li>
      <li>Great material...</li>
      <li>, The wig is very nice</li>

      <li>The wig looks great and feels good on.</li>
      <li>I love it, the style is so great fits me great</li>
      <li>so for all the others wanting to cosplay her i say this is a good choice</li>
      <li>and came with a good quality wig cap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still an excellent buy but be aware that this is a costume wig and not a hair replacement.</li>
      <li>an telling me my hair looks nice</li>
      <li>I emailed the seller, and they were very nice and attentive.</li>
      <li>The packaging was amazing and very secure.</li>
      <li>it was a lovely wig, framed my face nicely.</li>
      <li>was better than described , bouncy , luscious , just prefect , really to be honest</li>
      <li>it was soft, the perfect length and color.</li>
      <li>Although the look was beautiful, the hair was very unmanageable.</li>
      <li>I love the length, however, it did lose quite a bit of hair.</li>
      <li>Now mind you I have been wearing wigs for the better part of 16 years now  </li>
      <li>top part</li>
      <li>so it fit like a charm and didn&#x27;t fall of at all!</li>
      <li>love it just wish it looked better upon arrival.</li>
      <li>and I should have know better going by the price.</li>
      <li>Better then most Cosplay wigs I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
      <li>over all I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Kanekalon hair.</li>
      <li>The wig was okay.</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash and comb out.</li>
      <li>it tangled easily and shed a lot though.</li>
      <li>The bangs are a bit shorter and the curls are a bit tighter than pictured but the curl relaxed fine with finger styling.</li>
      <li>I got it in less time than they said it is so wonderful</li>
      <li>My wig was fine because I sprayed it with a lotion and water mixture before I used it which prevented tangling.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I love Cosplay wigs for (in the bedroom for fun), going out and about for Cosplay conventions or even going out to the bar.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this wig is I am pleased with quality of hair used.</li>
      <li>loved the texture and how soft it was.</li>
      <li>Good wig for a starter that doesn&#x27;t wanna spend $30 upward but DON&#x27;T use it if you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of moving and be very careful taking it off and handling it because it tangles easily.</li>
      <li>the package came on time and quick.</li>
      <li>the curls were still their and not as frizzy like it had been thrown around .. other than that it fit percect and the quality was exceptional ..</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get the hair to lay right.</li>
      <li>It kinked up almost right away and even with wig spray</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure a little water in a spray bottle might hopefully be able to help me with that without messing it up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then i thought it would be as well which its kinda rare to find wigs that are so long and in such good quality for such a cheap price, ok</li>
      <li>over all I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty tangled and</li>
      <li>It feels like it&#x27;s gonna fall off, and the strap broke the first time I put it on.</li>
      <li>But the style was so pretty</li>
      <li>This hair is beautiful when it comes out the package, but this is NOT for everyday use, this is a COSTUME wig, good for one or two uses , unless you don&#x27;t mine serious tangles , too much brushing leaves this thing bald, its pretty, but not for continuous wear.</li>
      <li>simply amazing compared to some other wigs i have used.</li>
      <li>The wig was super soft!</li>
      <li>Beautiful, but slightly thin at the bottom.</li>
      <li>so now it wont go with my normal hair as it shows right through</li>
      <li>This hair falls out, it&#x27;s cute only on the first day, the hair easily comes out and the image provided in the example is not very accurate.</li>
      <li>it always feels so real and</li>
      <li>You can change your look up every day since you can&#x27;t do that to your real hair.</li>
      <li>very quick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ago.it got here fast.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re extremely gentle with it</li>
      <li>and I was very upset because the bangs didn&#x27;t look like the picture</li>
      <li>i got it three days before the expected delivery , packaged well and guess what even got a free wig cap !</li>
      <li>I have a couple of friends who wants one</li>
      <li>, it stays quite nice for a few uses.</li>
      <li>made the top way to fluffy looks funny.</li>
      <li>This wig is really pretty, and the fiber is soft and high-quality.</li>
      <li>so it looks a little more real then parted all over the place.</li>
      <li>The cap is a HUGE net with no elastic to fit firm to the head.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great quality don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I fell so in love with this wig that I started wearing it as my everyday hair.</li>
      <li>an looks natural</li>
      <li>so thanks again amazon and cool2day i will be coming back to you !!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The top part is thick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than other kanekalon wigs I have, it&#x27;s very manageable.</li>
      <li>it was way too long all frizzy and tangled and over all I just didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>Not sure I would pay this much for a product that requires such high maintenance.</li>
      <li>Not a good fit.</li>
      <li>There was a little shedding so be gentle with it, but</li>

<li> Not sure I would pay this much for a product that requires such high maintenance.</li>
<li> Not a good fit.</li>
<li> There was a little shedding so be gentle with it, but</li>
<li> Tangles easily and difficult to comb out.</li>
<li> I had to wait a long time for this wig.</li>
<li> It seriously feels and looks like real hair.</li>
<li> so it was kinda a mess and has lots of knots up all the time and such</li>
<li> My friends wig on the other hand was a tangled mess wherever it rubbed against her back.</li>
<li> but there is always a down side to reviews aww, but its not that bad it was kinda messy and VERY curly</li>
<li> It may be due to</li>
<li> I tried brushing it with my wig brush and it&#x27;s extremely tangled.</li>
<li> and you spray it with a bit of watered down lotion before use</li>
<li> and my friend paid for the black not brown</li>
<li> Sadly it&#x27;s a mess now.</li>
<li> but as you get to the ends its a little thinner</li>
<li> amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a little longer then i thought (to wear I can&#x27;t see)</li>
<li> I would recommend it for a cosplay or costume, not for everyday wear.</li>
<li> But sadly its losing hair and after just wearing it 2 times, its starting to look worse for its wear.</li>
<li> i was a little doubtful about ordering another wig from here since my last wig never arrived and i had to file a claim , but soon i learned not to order from just any one so with all that being said thank you cool2day and  </li>
<li> o lived this wig just seriously wish when i got it</li>
<li> Not a good color.</li>
<li> almost next day the wig is all frizz and worthless</li>
<li> so I feel we were both ripped off, not impressed my order was screwed up</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m kinda not impressed about it</li>
<li> but you sent me the wrong color</li>
<li> To me it looks fake and you can tell it</li>
<li> Awful.</li>

    <li> To me it looks fake and you can tell it I asked my sisters and they said it does I hope this helps but it looks beautiful though</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great quality don&#x27;t get me wrong but you sent me the wrong color so now it wont go with my normal hair as it shows right through you sent me a brown wig, I&#x27;m kinda not impressed about it and my friend paid for the black not brown so I feel we were both ripped off, not impressed my order was screwed up</li>
    <li> Great material...!!&lt;br /&gt;But not volume at all.!</li>
    <li> This wig is really pretty, and the fiber is soft and high-quality. It&#x27;s much nicer than other kanekalon wigs I have, it&#x27;s very manageable. The bangs are a bit shorter and the curls are a bit tighter than pictured but the curl relaxed fine with finger styling. There was a little shedding so be gentle with it, but over all I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I fell so in love with this wig that I started wearing it as my everyday hair. After about two weeks it was a disaster area. I wear wigs or extensions every day for work so I have experience caring for/detangling hairpieces but this was a lost cause. It&#x27;s still an excellent buy but be aware that this is a costume wig and not a hair replacement.</li>
    <li> The packaging was amazing and very secure. Better then most Cosplay wigs I&#x27;ve ordered. As well being deployed the package got here very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE WIG ITSELF:&lt;br /&gt;The hair I love Kanekalon hair. it always feels so real and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a little longer then i thought (to wear I can&#x27;t see) but nothing scissors can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top part I am working on how to part it so it looks a little more real then parted all over the place. I&#x27;m sure a little water in a spray bottle might hopefully be able to help me with that without messing it up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top part is thick but as you get to the ends its a little thinner then it seems like in the picture. It may be due to it being Kanekalon hair but as well a lil fluffing might help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But over all I will be back for more. I love Cosplay wigs for (in the bedroom for fun), going out and about for Cosplay conventions or even going out to the bar. You can change your look up every day since you can&#x27;t do that to your real hair.</li>
    <li> The wig was okay. Tangles easily and difficult to comb out. Not sure I would pay this much for a product that requires such high maintenance.</li>
    <li> Although the look was beautiful, the hair was very unmanageable. It kinked up almost right away and even with wig spray I just couldn&#x27;t get the hair to lay right. Now mind you I have been wearing wigs for the better part of 16 years now  so I know my hair and I should have know better going by the price. But the style was so pretty I had to try it out. Eventually it just frizzed up on the ends and simply was not wearable. It was simply made from the cheapest Kamekalon known to man so I guess I got what I paid for. A four day wig.</li>
    <li> I got this wig 5 days ago.it got here fast. I fell inlove with it instantly. it was soft, the perfect length and color. Sadly it&#x27;s a mess now. I tried brushing it with my wig brush and it&#x27;s extremely tangled. This wig is not meant for daily use.</li>
    <li> Awful. Just awful. Tangled from the start. Not a good fit. Not a good color. Cheaply made. Now it just sits in a bin waiting to be used for Halloween or pranks.</li>
    <li> it was a lovely wig, framed my face nicely. it tangled easily and shed a lot though. I would recommend it for a cosplay or costume, not for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I had to wait a long time for this wig. When I finally received it I was so upset when I put it on the cut of the wig made the top way to fluffy looks funny. The cap is a HUGE net with no elastic to fit firm to the head. It feels like it&#x27;s gonna fall off, and the strap broke the first time I put it on. The only good thing about this wig is I am pleased with quality of hair used.</li>
    <li> The wig looks great and feels good on. But sadly its losing hair and after just wearing it 2 times, its starting to look worse for its wear. Also after paying extra for it to be here in 2 - 3 days, it came way after. I emailed the seller, and they were very nice and attentive. So i would buy from them again, i would just not pay extra to have it shipped faster.</li>
    <li> The wig looks great out of the package, but as soon as you put it one the hair goes everywhere and will not work with you. almost next day the wig is all frizz and worthless</li>
    <li> I got the wig this friday. Was packaged very nicely. The wig was super soft! loved the texture and how soft it was. It seriously feels and looks like real hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these wigs for myself and a friend. I went to redo makeup in the bathroom at the con and got a surprise. My wig was fine because I sprayed it with a lotion and water mixture before I used it which prevented tangling. My friends wig on the other hand was a tangled mess wherever it rubbed against her back. Good wig for a starter that doesn&#x27;t wanna spend $30 upward but DON&#x27;T use it if you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of moving and be very careful taking it off and handling it because it tangles easily. I tried every detangling method out there and it&#x27;s still pretty tangled and when combed out it lost a lot of it&#x27;s curl and just got frizzy but if you&#x27;re extremely gentle with it and you spray it with a bit of watered down lotion before use, it stays quite nice for a few uses.</li>
    <li> o lived this wig just seriously wish when i got it the curls were still their and not as frizzy like it had been thrown around .. other than that it fit percect and the quality was exceptional .. love it just wish it looked better upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing wigs for years. I love the length, however, it did lose quite a bit of hair. It is easy to wash and comb out.</li>
    <li> This hair is beautiful when it comes out the package, but this is NOT for everyday use, this is a COSTUME wig, good for one or two uses , unless you don&#x27;t mine serious tangles , too much brushing leaves this thing bald, its pretty, but not for continuous wear. the package came on time and quick. and came with a good quality wig cap.</li>
    <li> was better than described , bouncy , luscious , just prefect , really to be honest i was a little doubtful about ordering another wig from here since my last wig never arrived and i had to file a claim , but soon i learned not to order from just any one so with all that being said thank you cool2day and  thank you amazon i got it three days before the expected delivery , packaged well and guess what even got a free wig cap ! so thanks again amazon and cool2day i will be coming back to you !!!!</li>
    <li> so i used this wig for my Aradia cosplay for homestuck, The wig is very nice it was a big size so it fit like a charm and didn&#x27;t fall of at all! simply amazing compared to some other wigs i have used. it was longer then i thought it would be as well which its kinda rare to find wigs that are so long and in such good quality for such a cheap price, ok but there is always a down side to reviews aww, but its not that bad it was kinda messy and VERY curly so it was kinda a mess and has lots of knots up all the time and such but hey its kinda a head canon for Aradia so for all the others wanting to cosplay her i say this is a good choice</li>
    <li> This hair falls out, it&#x27;s cute only on the first day, the hair easily comes out and the image provided in the example is not very accurate.</li>
    <li> I love it, the style is so great fits me great an looks natural an no one knows it&#x27;s a wig a lot of guys have been firlting with me an telling me my hair looks nice thank you I got it in less time than they said it is so wonderful I have a couple of friends who wants one</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but slightly thin at the bottom.</li>
    <li> I got my wig today and I was very upset because the bangs didn&#x27;t look like the picture it was way too long all frizzy and tangled and over all I just didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
