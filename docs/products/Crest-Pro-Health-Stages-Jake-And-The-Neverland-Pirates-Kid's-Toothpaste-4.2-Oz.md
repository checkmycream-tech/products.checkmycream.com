    <li> The girls love it but it but i think for the wrong reason. the Jake and the never land pirate pictures. This toothpaste did not lather much ant all. The taste was not that good either. I did not think it brushed their teeth much.</li>
    <li> My two year old loves Jake and the Neverland pirates. He saw the toothbrush at Target one day and begged for it. Having an interest in hygiene is great so I got it. But then he saw the picture of the toothpaste on the pack and refused to buy any other kind. They were out of the toothpaste. When we got home he really wanted to use his new buzzing toothbrush but he was still sad about not having the toothpaste to match. Since we got it, he&#x27;s been asking to brush his teeth 3+ times a day</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter loves this stuff. She&#x27;s a big Jake and Neverland Pirate&#x27;s fan and is excited to brush her teeth with \\&quot;Jake toothpaste\\&quot;. I have tasted it and isn&#x27;t bad, although in my opinion most kids toothpastes sort of taste the same.</li>
    <li> Crest makes almost all of their toothpaste products in China today. Check the labels!  Nowhere is the country of origin shown on any of their dental products.  All the state is Distributed by Proctor and Gamble.  Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good toothpaste, kids like it; 3 year-old enjoys the fact that it has Jake on it and the 5 year-old likes the taste, I tried it once and it has pretty good flavor.</li>
    <li> My 4-year old son wants to brush his teeth 10 times a day.  I&#x27;m not kidding!  He is so excited to have Jake and the Neverland Pirates on his toothpaste I have to slow him down.  Not only was the price right, but the packaging was a no-brainer.  The toothpaste is a blue gel and is berry flavored.  It makes the grade as far as we parents are concerned (meaning the toothpaste will keep your child&#x27;s teeth in great condition) and it certainly makes my son smile...pun intended.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Verdict is still out regarding this product.  My son enjoys it but as a parent I will have to see if the dentist agrees.</li>
    <li> The first toothpaste my little girl didn&#x27;t complain about how it tasted. Great bargain as well. When the kid is happy, we are all happy!</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old&#x27;s dentist has recommended that we move from fluoride free toothpaste to ones containing fluoride. My son  enjoys brushing his teeth because this toothpaste tastes yummy</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste with Jake on the label because it matches the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages Jake power kids toothbrush. I&#x27;ve bought this same toothpaste in the store, but never saw Jake on the outside before. My 4-year-old is going to be very excited! I wish I could have used a coupon, like I can in the store. But it&#x27;s supply and demand... I haven&#x27;t seen this in the store, but I found it on Amazon.</li>

    <li> My mom bought it for me. I am 10. The cap is very difficult to open. Every time would use it, I would have to try many times until I can open it. Sometime I have to ask my mom for help, but she is getting annoyed now.</li>
    <li> Only bought this because we use it for our young sons and did not have time to get to the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste. It does a great job of keeping y sons teeth clean and because Jake and his friends are on the tube he loves to do himself.</li>
    <li> Yucky taste and not my favorite ingredients. We ended up throwing this in the trash can. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> When buying kids toothpaste it&#x27;s really about who is on the bottle.  We are a crest family but my son loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates so buying this was a no brainier.  The fact that I could get it with the subscribe and save program and use a coupon was a bonus!  My son loves the toothpaste and it goes great with his Jake toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My children had a very hard time pumping the toothpaste out of this tube. I ended up having to do it for them each time, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Our children especially love this product. Great flavor and the cartoon characters are a real hit. Well done to Crest.</li>
    <li> my kids like it. we try different brands and this one seems to get the kids going to brush their teeth faster.</li>
    <li> Great price and large sized tooth paste. It was a good purchase and a good price. The tube is large and my grand daughter likes the taste</li>
    <li> We usually buy Colgate toothpaste...but just wanted to give this a shot seeing the good reviews. My 6 and 3 yr olds love it! Yummy was the word used :)</li>
    <li> My daughter was very excited to have &amp;#34;Jake toothpaste&amp;#34; and I was happy that it made her more excited to brush. She enjoys the flavor and it rinses easily. It also speaks to the quality that the manufacturer has been responding personally to any complaints.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why, but this is the only toothpaste my son likes.  Partly the neverland theme?  Probably.  Taste or flavor? Maybe.</li>
    <li> Yummy berry scented breath... that&#x27;s my favorite part of bedtime now. When my daughter gives me a kiss goodnight, her breath smells like berries, thanks to this toothpaste! Jake and the Neverland Pirates is a hit in our house, so the toothpaste is also a hit. Anything to help motivate kids to brush, right?</li>
    <li> My grandson still uses this toothpaste and its mild tasting and pleasing to his taste. He also likes the idea of the characters on it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much sugar as some of the other kids toothpaste that I have seen. My boys love Jake which makes this the perfect marriage of tooth and paste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is good for kids. This is not strong like an adult product.</li>
    <li> Wish this was easier to find - my five year old loves this flavor and I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere local. Great taste, even for a girl!</li>
    <li> My son LOVES this toothpaste. Every night he says, &amp;#34;Are you sure that&#x27;s enough paste?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item I just placed another order. Great value and fast easy delivery. Would recommend it to anyone with small children.</li>
    <li> My kiddos love Jake and the Neverland Pirates so when they needed toothpaste, I knew I had to get this for them. They tell me it tastes great and it&#x27;s easy for them to put on their toothbrushes themselves (they&#x27;re 3 &amp; 4). Good stuff, awesome price!</li>
    <li> Never heard of this toothpaste until a deal came along. DD said the kids like and use it and it is an enticement to get them to brush! Can&#x27;t beat that and the price was right too. Now we and they are all happy!</li>
    <li> The Kid&#x27;s toothpaste was in low price, and I bought one for my litter sister. She will like the cartoon design.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste, it is gooey and falls off the toothbrush, but I love crest products &amp; my 4yr old seems to enjoy brushing his teeth. It maybe the Jake &amp; the neverland pirates too ..  Haha..</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grand, but she is to young, so I used it instead. It tastes good, and is effective.</li>
    <li> My children like the stages toothpaste.  The flavor is good and both of them like Jake and his band of pirates</li>
    <li> My son loves to brush his teeth with his Jake toothbrush and toothpaste, he calls it &amp;#34;his paste&amp;#34;, which makes us both very happy.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a 3.5 year-old son who doesn&#x27;t watch anything other than Mr. Roger&#x27;s Neighborhood, so he doesn&#x27;t know these characters. But he was excited to see pirates on his toothpaste. I like the flip lid for less mess and storage in the medicine cabinet (can stand it up). He seems to like the flavor.</li>
    <li> My son loves this. He begs to brush his teeth now. If your child is a fan of Jack and the Neverland Pirates, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the same toothpaste at the grocery store and it was darker in color and even the consistency seemed a bit different.  My son is using it but I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy something like this online again.</li>
    <li> Son loves to use it so I am happy ;) plus Jake is there on the cover .. so as long as some cartoon character is on the tube kids would be ok to brush their teeth.. even though most of the toothpaste have the same ocmposition :)</li>
    <li> My 2 year old loves this toothpaste. It has a good flavor to him, and a fun design on the tube.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Leaves a weird smell in toddler&#x27;s mouth.</li>
    <li> I like to have &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; toothpaste in the kitchen.  Yes, I know!  But sometimes I just need to brush my teeth, so I have a tooth brush in the kitchen and I like to have &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; toothpaste.  I thought I&#x27;d try this ... and YIKES the flavor is really not pleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if I would like it if I had a child&#x27;s taste buds but I know I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I miss the vanilla expressions!  I think I was the only one who bought that. thanks</li>
    <li> Our daughter never complains about brushing with this toothpaste.  She likes the taste, and I like that she uses it.  I accidentally used grown up toothpaste on her brush once, and she acted like I tried to poison her!</li>
    <li> 5 yr old uses it with his electric tooth brush.  He seems to like the flavor.  I got him bubble gum flavored paste last time and he didn&#x27;t like it.  I liked the bubble gum flavor, but my wife thinks they have to develop into the flavors.  This doesn&#x27;t seem as sweet and he likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always worried when I buy a new toothpaste for my son. I think he won&#x27;t like the flavor and that will turn him off to brushing his teeth altogether (mommies and daddies will know what I mean about one bad instance ruining a kids outlook on something they once loved). My son likes this toothpaste and his new Crest Spin Brush and ASKS to brush his teeth! I couldn&#x27;t be happier - except of course if this toothpaste were all natural (which is why it gets only 4 stars).</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Better than I expected. High quality.</li>
