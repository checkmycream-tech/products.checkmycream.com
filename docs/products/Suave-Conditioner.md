      <li>Both my girls need conditioner to smooth their locks, so this was a great value.  </li>
      <li>nice fragrance to conditioner, not too overpowering</li>
      <li>The smell is awesome and the price is much cheaper then anywhere else</li>
      <li>Gentle to the baby&#x27;s skin &amp; eyes, cleans and detangles my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, and leaves an awesome scent!</li>
      <li>if you want a super value and a great tear free product,  get the Suave Kids!</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This is really good for kids with super frizzy curls.</li>
      <li>We love this product for the kids.</li>
      <li>The detangler spray works in a pinch but the conditioner is leagues better.  </li>
      <li>It does make the hair more manageable though.</li>
      <li>Works great on very knotty toddler hair.</li>
      <li>My favorite kids conditioner ...</li>
      <li>My kids love this conditioner</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Was happy to find this on Amazon for a decent price.</li>
      <li>She has very fine hair that will get tangled after we wash it, this helps to keep it silky and smooth without tangles.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome and it works great on all types of hair, and I mean all !</li>
      <li>I just wish it was more available in the stores.</li>
      <li>My daughter has my texture hair (lots of it and easily tangles).  </li>
      <li>My fault for not reading the fine print.</li>
      <li>Also a great deal as we paid $12 for a 6 pack, so only $2 per bottle.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is not tear free despite the labeling.</li>
      <li>I use to only use the 2 in 1 shampoo, and strawberry was my favorite scent for my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
      <li>I have tried many tear free shampoos and conditioners and moat of them make my squirmy toddlers eyes red and itchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying the six-pack here because the price is comparable to the store.</li>
      <li>Everytime I turn around I hear more news about how anything labeled with &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredient list most likely contains toxic phthalates, unless the product specifically states that the fragrance is from essential oils.</li>
      <li>It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft that I can run my fingers throught it right out of the bath, plus when you use it with the strawberry shampoo, the smell lingers for hours!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the different packaging, then this should be fine for you</li>
      <li>Her hair started to get thicker and REALLY curly</li>
      <li>Makes combing and brushing hair so much easier after a bath.</li>
      <li>It is also very inexpensive for the result it gives.</li>
      <li>Is much easier to comb</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It leaves her super thick hair soft and easy to brush, which we both really appreciate.</li>
      <li>She has very sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>It smooths the hair better then the two in one shampoos we usually use.  </li>
      <li>so we naturally have the battle of combing hair.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves her curly thick hair nice and soft and no left over residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When you got a little girl with long curly hair they go through this stuff pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>just a little is enough and work thru hair; gets rid of tangles quick.</li>

    <li> This product is awesome and it works great on all types of hair, and I mean all ! It is also very inexpensive for the result it gives.</li>
    <li> I have twin girls so we naturally have the battle of combing hair.  This has made it a 100 times easier.  The detangler spray works in a pinch but the conditioner is leagues better.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best, best, best, best, best, BEST kids conditioner on the market. I can&#x27;t believe its so hard to find on stores.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it is not tear free despite the labeling. It does make the hair more manageable though. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a Suave Conditioner. It&#x27;s always been a combo. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected and now I have a pack of 6. My fault for not reading the fine print.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a GREAT kids conditioner. Gentle to the baby&#x27;s skin &amp; eyes, cleans and detangles my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, and leaves an awesome scent! I use to only use the 2 in 1 shampoo, and strawberry was my favorite scent for my daughter&#x27;s hair! Her hair started to get thicker and REALLY curly and I knew it was time for a conditioner, so when I went to the store and saw they came out with a strawberry conditioner I was so HAPPY! It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft that I can run my fingers throught it right out of the bath, plus when you use it with the strawberry shampoo, the smell lingers for hours! I can still smell it in the morning when she wakes up! Again, very pleased with another Suave kids product. I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this conditioner, She has used it for over 3 years now, and doesn&#x27;t ask for something different.  Great job Suave!</li>
    <li> My favorite kids conditioner ...</li>
    <li> We use this for our daughter&#x27;s hair every few days to get out the tangles and keep it healthly.  She has very fine hair that will get tangled after we wash it, this helps to keep it silky and smooth without tangles.  Just apply after shampoo, rinse and comb out.  Is much easier to comb and she doesn&#x27;t complain when we comb it out after using this.  Also a great deal as we paid $12 for a 6 pack, so only $2 per bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It leaves her super thick hair soft and easy to brush, which we both really appreciate.</li>
    <li> When you got a little girl with long curly hair they go through this stuff pretty quickly. Buy a case.</li>
    <li> Works great on very knotty toddler hair. And I love the smell!</li>
    <li> My kids love this conditioner</li>
    <li> A word of caution - This is NOT Fairy Berry shampoo - it is Dora shampoo.  That may not seem like a big deal since they are both strawberry, but if you have a \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; who thinks she is now too big for Dora, it is!  If you don&#x27;t mind the different packaging, then this should be fine for you and overall I give the product itself 4-5 stars.</li>
    <li> We love this product for the kids. Makes combing and brushing hair so much easier after a bath. I just wish it was more available in the stores. It is hard to find just the conditioner in stores near us. Was happy to find this on Amazon for a decent price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter has my texture hair (lots of it and easily tangles).  They stopped selling this in the store, and it is the only tear-free conditioner I can find that actually works.  It&#x27;s worth buying the six-pack here because the price is comparable to the store.</li>
    <li> This is really good for kids with super frizzy curls. It smooths the hair better then the two in one shampoos we usually use.  The smell is awesome and the price is much cheaper then anywhere else</li>
    <li> just a little is enough and work thru hair; gets rid of tangles quick. nice fragrance to conditioner, not too overpowering</li>
    <li> Very good value for the conditioner.  Both my girls need conditioner to smooth their locks, so this was a great value.  It is difficult to find conditioner for the girls, and it works well on their hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many tear free shampoos and conditioners and moat of them make my squirmy toddlers eyes red and itchy. She has very sensitive eyes.  Out of all of these expensive organic and specially formulated conditioners,  I keep coming back to Suave Kids line. It can get all sudsy in her eyes and it still does not bother them. It also leaves her curly thick hair nice and soft and no left over residue.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a super value and a great tear free product,  get the Suave Kids!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Everytime I turn around I hear more news about how anything labeled with &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredient list most likely contains toxic phthalates, unless the product specifically states that the fragrance is from essential oils. Yet, here is another product specifically for kids that contains toxic ingredients. Google phthalates if you haven&#x27;t heard about them yet. BOO Suave!</li>
    <li> My children use this product daily and it is getting difficult to find a store that regularly carries this product. The price per bottle is cheaper than what I pay when I can manage to find it at a store.</li>
