      <li>Love this toothbrush!  </li>
      <li>I really liked this.</li>
      <li>This one fits nicely.</li>
      <li>This one is good, as are many others.  </li>
      <li>The bristles make kind of a squeaky feeling on my teeth.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the toothbrush has been great for people who don&#x27;t like the feeling of sanding their teeth!</li>
      <li>Some are cheaply made but this one appears well constructed with good bristles.  </li>
      <li>you want a soft toothbrush, though, this is an excellent pick!</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Love the bristles, tongue scrubber, and shape.</li>
      <li>However, the rest of the brush is ideal for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>but I really enjoyed this one.</li>
      <li>It has tapered bristles and a cleaning tip to help remove more plaque and stains.</li>
      <li>(flossing is better but a lot of people don’t do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that this is the ideal brush for those without sensitivity as it&#x27;s so soft.  </li>
      <li>I read many reviews before ordering this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK...</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to do the side to side to prevent more receding gums.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with how gentle and yet effective this brush really was.</li>
      <li>My teeth get nice and clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  </li>
      <li>yet - it&#x27;s even more comfortable, and you should keep an eye out for that as well.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it is great for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a great little brush for a good price.</li>
      <li>Very gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>Nice brush,  the bristle layout scrubs very well!  </li>
      <li>The size of the brush is not too big…and works for me just fine.  </li>
      <li>The brush head is a nice large size, so</li>
      <li>it works very well for that!! :-)</li>
      <li>This toothbrush has held up well for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>They are more gimicky than apparently useful.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, they weren&#x27;t that much softer than those of the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles on Target brand</li>
      <li>Also the handle of the brush has rubber textured areas on it for a comfortable grip while using it.</li>
      <li>I recently tried another Colgate toothbrush, the gliding tip one, and I think I prefer that one for ultra gentle cleaning, but the 360 pro-relief one is excellent too.</li>
      <li>This is best for people with small mouths.</li>
      <li>very satisfied with this toothbrush for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>The most comfortable toothbrush I have ever used, thanks to the ultra-soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I like the clean sensation</li>
      <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
      <li>so they clean well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt my teeth were just as clean as when using pricier toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for me - a basic toothbrush with super soft bristles.</li>
      <li>The tongue cleaner on the back of the head is another good feature.</li>
      <li>This brush is really very soft - so soft that I would imagine this would work best for people with very sensitive gums.  </li>
      <li>I tried lots of different toothbrushes and this one is by far the most comfortable, easiest to get back teeth, and best cleaning I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Super, super soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like a solid toothbrush, with a good grip, but also with really soft bristles – good for those with sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>Regardless it is my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
      <li>We are enjoying our new toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
      <li>They work nicely, although I miss the truly scrubbed clean feeling I get from the normal soft bristled brushes.</li>
      <li>In any case, this is worth trying if you have sensitivity issues.</li>
      <li>Much better for sensitive gums</li>
      <li>, I use the bristles to keep that minty fresh.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is very easy to hold, with comfortable gel-like sticky grips where your thumb and index finger go, and has very soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>But you actually get a much better clean with the softest est bristles because they can get further.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really good toothbrush especially for very sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>The compact head is also great for (what dentist tell me is) a small mouth.  </li>
      <li>The 360 has staggered bristles that are good at getting at everything from inside the crevices of teeth to down around the gum line.</li>
      <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  </li>
      <li>I use with the COLGATE TOTAL® ADVANCED WHITENING TOOTHPASTE the combination removes surface stains, dual-silica technology helps prevent new stains from forming plus fights germs for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>Can easily reach into the back of the mouth to get the molar clean.</li>
      <li>This brush was SUPER gentle on my gums (I selected this &amp;#34;extra-soft-bristled&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Regardless this sucker feels great its perfect for what I require no matter how hard I brush its soft as a feather and quite durable.</li>
      <li>Where once my teeth never felt clean without my Sonicare, now I can see how these Colgate toothbrushes are a fine second place!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>This brush was very gentle.</li>
      <li>It seems like a harder toothbrush would clean better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a soft tooth brush and these fit the bill</li>
      <li>The extra soft bristles didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive gums and the price point is great.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  </li>
      <li>However, now that I am brushing more often, several times/day, I find that I am putting a little more pressure, and extra soft brushes just feel better (and I am still training myself to lighten up more).</li>
      <li>The polishing cup holds toothpaste against tooth surfaces to help maximize the paste&#x27;s performance, helping to remove plaque and stains from tooth surfaces, with the Colgate® Sensitive Enamel Protect(tm) to protect tooth enamel from acid attacks or COLGATE TOTAL® CLEAN MINT TOOTHPASTE.</li>
      <li>I thought this toothbrush was fantastic - the bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t irritate the gums or teeth, but they&#x27;re still capable of deep-cleaning the mouth.  </li>
      <li>Noticeably softer than the regular kind of soft toothbrush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the toothbrush is so fit to tooth,and have the clean piece to the tough</li>
    <li> The most comfortable toothbrush I have ever used, thanks to the ultra-soft bristles. There is a charcoal infused bristle version I found overseas that hasn&#x27;t made it Stateside yet - it&#x27;s even more comfortable, and you should keep an eye out for that as well. Remember, softer bristles mean less gum irritation and eventual retraction - you don&#x27;t need much firmness or a hard stroke to break up plaque before the 24 hours it takes to harden.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I like to use -- even &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is too rough for my teeth and gums. Even then, within the &amp;#34;Extra Soft&amp;#34; realm, prefer Colgate&#x27;s brand over any others...especially over store brands (i.e. Walgreens brand, Rite Aid brand, etc). A lot of drugstores I&#x27;ve been to lately aren&#x27;t carrying the Colgate brand for some reason, and I made the mistake of trying the Sensodyne brand brush and it&#x27;s way too tiny, doesn&#x27;t cover hardly enough area, and doesn&#x27;t even feel softer than &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. I love Colgate&#x27;s broad brush as well as the rubbery parts that massage the teeth and gums, leaving everything squeaky clean without a rough, scratchy brushing. I&#x27;m sold for life on this one, and thankfully with Amazon I can stock up and never have to worry about a store not carrying it!</li>
    <li> This is as described, very soft bristles! If you do not like soft bristles do not buy! Shipping was fast and the toothbrush has been great for people who don&#x27;t like the feeling of sanding their teeth!</li>
    <li> A true extra soft toothbrush. Very nice.  Took a solid week to arrive.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush!  Very gentle and don&#x27;t have to press hard for bristles to clean gums.</li>
    <li> I agree with &amp;#34;C. Borchert&amp;#34; - there is just way too much going on with the brush.  The handle is too thick, it has an odd curve it it, and the rubber parts in the middle of the brush head are strange.  I would have liked the cheek and tongue scraper, if the brush head wasn&#x27;t so large that it made it difficult to use.  Maybe I have a small mouth, but I found it difficult to brush comfortably with how large the brush head is.  This resulted in the bristles pressing on my to hard teeth and gums, which defeats the purpose of a toothbrush meant for sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t even find the bristles particularly soft.  Honestly, they weren&#x27;t that much softer than those of the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles on Target brand toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Sonicare toothbrush that I use regularly (sensitive brush head on sensitive setting), but like to use a manual toothbrush sometimes.  I think I used the Colgate brush about a dozen times before getting rid of it.  I also tossed a second brush without even using it.  I replaced it with a Sensodyne Extra Soft toothbrush that I found in my local Rite Aid (unfortunately, it is difficult to find online).  It is perfect for me - a basic toothbrush with super soft bristles.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before ordering this toothbrush. The bristles were not very soft and the handle was very difficult to hold.</li>
    <li> Soft--truly soft and didn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Cleans as well or better than the harder brushes.  Holds up well. not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Since I was going on vacation, I packed this instead of my Sonicare. (I have a problem with mold collecting in the area of the metal pin if I travel with it still damp). Now, I have not used a manual toothbrush in a few years and was concerned that this might abrade my gums. No such thing! This brush was SUPER gentle on my gums (I selected this &amp;#34;extra-soft-bristled&amp;#34; brush since it was the style my dentist recommended). I was really impressed with how gentle and yet effective this brush really was. Manual brushes have truly evolved in the last ten years! Where once my teeth never felt clean without my Sonicare, now I can see how these Colgate toothbrushes are a fine second place! Recommended!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re one of those folks who suffers with super-sensitive teeth &amp; gums, this Extra-Soft [[ASIN:B005OFT14C Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro-Relief Compact Head Toothbrush]] is just the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection.  Germs can hide in those bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> This is an good toothbrush for those with sensitivity issues. Though the compact head helps with to alleviate the issues with bristles that are replaced by the three circles of polishing flaps in the middle of the brush, it would benefit by at least the middle circle having bristles instead. This is still a decent toothbrush, but too much of a gimmick in lieu of practicality.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is very easy to hold, with comfortable gel-like sticky grips where your thumb and index finger go, and has very soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth. The tongue cleaner on the back of the head is another good feature.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to keep my new engagement ring clean... it works very well for that!! :-)</li>
    <li> I use the toothbrush not only to clean my teeth but to brush and stimulate my gums to prevent gum disease.</li>
    <li> I use this on travel - long air travel and different foods/air makes my gums and teeth a bit sensitive.  This works well for that situation for me.</li>
    <li> I like a solid toothbrush, with a good grip, but also with really soft bristles – good for those with sensitive teeth and gums.  It definitely delivers a good cleaning while not wearing down your gums.  In addition, it is a great value here on Amazon.  The size of the brush is not too big…and works for me just fine.  At the very least, it is worth a try.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice brush,  the bristle layout scrubs very well!  Not tough on my sensitive gums, Thanks</li>
    <li> Noticeably softer than the regular kind of soft toothbrush. Does not remove tartar well but good for after dental or gum work.</li>
    <li> I used this product one day when I could not find my son&#x27;s toothbrush. Because the head is small, I was able to get it into his mouth and brush pretty well. However, the bristles were extra soft, so they did not hurt his tender gums.</li>
    <li> My gums are sensitive.  This does a great job of cleaning my teeth and getting along the gum line.  The compact head is also great for (what dentist tell me is) a small mouth.  Can easily reach into the back of the mouth to get the molar clean.</li>
    <li> My one issue with this brush is that I&#x27;m just not getting the little circles in the middle.  They are more gimicky than apparently useful.  However, the rest of the brush is ideal for sensitive teeth.  The bristles are wonderfully soft and the head lends itself to less pressure on the teeth.</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t everybody be using an extra soft toothbrush?  Yes.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Ask your dentist.  Haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in a while?  Stay away from me!  If you don&#x27;t care for your teeth, I don&#x27;t want to have to look at them, much less smell your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you care about dental hygiene, you really need to use a toothbrush like this one.  If the bristles are any firmer, you&#x27;ll wear enamel away and flail your gums, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, extra soft brushes are close to being a commodity.  This one is good, as are many others.  Some are cheaply made but this one appears well constructed with good bristles.  I generally prefer the larger head rather than the compact one, but this gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;ll last.  But that&#x27;s not really a concern.  You should get rid of a brush every few months anyway, or even after a bad cold.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Ask your dentist.</li>
    <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  Perhaps it is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  Tongue cleaning reportedly reduces bad breath and reduces bacteria known to contribute to periodontal problems, tooth decay, gum infection, gum recession, and tooth loss (Wikipedia). I have now added it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the four designs from this line that I tried, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate has made big jump forward in brush design with this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is softer than the others but not too soft.  I have sensitive teeth and I might choose this 360 version if it was the only brush I used.  But I prefer a larger head and I like the extra length of the bristles on the 360 Advanced soft.  Because I have been using the Advanced for awhile, I didn&#x27;t have problems with abrasion on the sides of my cheeks as a few others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these 360s will go into everyone’s Christmas stocking this year.t to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is softer than the others but not too soft.  I have sensitive teeth and I might choose this 360 version if it was the only brush I used.  But I prefer a larger head and I like the extra length of the bristles on the 360 Advanced soft.

    <li> This is the Swiss army knife of toothbrushes. It is unbelievable how much is packed into it. But for me it’s just too much. The tongue scrapper is a neat idea but its irritating on your gums while you brush your teeth. The extremely curved handle looks neat but is difficult for me to hold when wet. The inside of the head isn’t bristles but plastic, I’m guessing to polish your teeth. It’s simply too much. It isn’t a simple, comfortable toothbrush to use.</li>
    <li> To start, it&#x27;s possible that the colors of these toothbrushes may vary. The product image shows a brush with purple accents, but the one I received it a light blue color. So if you&#x27;re picking this up because you are specifically trying to get a bush for yourself or someone in a certain color, it&#x27;s possible the color you receive may vary from the product image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Colgate extra soft brush has all the great features of their other 360 brushes, but with very soft bristles for those with more sensitive gums and teeth. The 360 has staggered bristles that are good at getting at everything from inside the crevices of teeth to down around the gum line. Also on the back of the brush head it is textured so that it cleans the inside of cheeks and can even be used to help clean the tongue. The brush head is a nice large size, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m brushing with a child&#x27;s size brush (a pet peeve of mine). Also the handle of the brush has rubber textured areas on it for a comfortable grip while using it. It&#x27;s an all around awesome tooth brush that cleans in every way you could want it to, and comes in this hard to find extra soft bristle version.</li>
    <li> This is a really, really soft toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive teeth, but this felt very nice in my mouth, and I can see that it would be good for those with sensitivity problems.  I don&#x27;t think that this is the ideal brush for those without sensitivity as it&#x27;s so soft.  I feel like my mouth gets cleaner with a soft brush.  This may just be perception.  In any case, this is worth trying if you have sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> Colgate like Crest has to offer something different to sell toothbrushes. So let’s look at what’s new for Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra soft is for those with painful gums or sensitive teeth. If you have an abscess or are headed for a root canal, this brush could get you by in the interim. Colgate also recommends that you use their Sensitive Pro-Relief toothpaste. I haven’t needed to do that so I can’t comment. What I use this toothbrush for is to brush the entire inside of my mouth every couple of weeks. I like the clean sensation afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer bristles on the end and sides. This will get in those crevices and where the gum meets the tooth. It will also help get out particles between teeth (flossing is better but a lot of people don’t do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact head refers to a shorter and narrower head. This is best for people with small mouths. I do use it to get to the back of my last molars without the gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;360 refers to brushing your tongue while brushing your teeth with the rubber bumps on the backside of the head. When you brush the sides of your teeth you will also brush the inside of your cheek them. This will help with bad breath. I do brush my tongue and found these nubs to be rather rough.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this toothbrush for my husband and myself for a few years now. It really is noticeably more gentle than any other toothbrush I had tried. The bristles make kind of a squeaky feeling on my teeth. My teeth get nice and clean. I recently tried another Colgate toothbrush, the gliding tip one, and I think I prefer that one for ultra gentle cleaning, but the 360 pro-relief one is excellent too.</li>
    <li> As soft and functional as my wife prefers her brushes. Got sensitive gums/teeth? This IS the droid you&#x27;re looking for. (waves hand)</li>
    <li> The only toothbrush I use. I purchase them regularly.</li>
    <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but my gums are.  So I worsened the problem by not brushing my gums as well as I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very noticeably softer than a typical soft toothbrush.  It&#x27;s an excellent way to take care of your gums.  It&#x27;s still firm enough to clear your teeth well. I love it.</li>
    <li> The extra soft bristles didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive gums and the price point is great. I felt my teeth were just as clean as when using pricier toothbrushes. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Colgate toothbrushes over the years.  There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  This 360 Sensitive Pro-Relief Compact Head Extra Soft toothbrush has multi-height bristles and rubber cups/blades to help remove odorous bacteria and plaque.  There is also a useful textured cheek and tongue cleaner on the back of the bristle head.  We let grandpa and grandma try it (several samples) for a week a found the multi-height extra soft bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive, less sensitivity for their teeth and gums,  and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  Works well along with Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Toothpaste.  Tongue Freshener scraper helps remove smelly plaque and buildup from tongue and cheeks.  We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush IS extra soft!!! I have sensitive gums, so I have to be careful or they&#x27;ll be bleeding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for this toothbrush to cause bleeding! Super, super soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you would expect, sometimes it does seem to take a little longer brushing with this toothbrush for my teeth to feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a soft toothbrush, though, this is an excellent pick!</li>
    <li> Having a unique situation of radiation to my head and neck, I need to be VERY careful with my teeth (and gums). My dentist always steered me away from medium and firm brushes (as well as brushing too hard) for fear of eroding my enamel and getting gum recession. However, now that I am brushing more often, several times/day, I find that I am putting a little more pressure, and extra soft brushes just feel better (and I am still training myself to lighten up more). This is a comfortable toothbrush that cleans well enough. Looking at the description at the time of this writing, it appears that the price is for one toothbrush. If that is the case, I would pass. There are others just as good, if not slightly better, for much less. I brush in combination with a special prescription toothgel from Colgate and my teeth are not sensitive, and I don&#x27;t feel that I am wearing them down.</li>
    <li> Sooooo soft and the silicone teeth in the middle are also nice and gentle. My only concern is that because it&#x27;s so soft it won&#x27;t last as long as regular brushes... at least it&#x27;s more gentle on my gums :)</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush.  I like the small head size as it enables me to reach everywhere in my mouth to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> I like a soft toothbrush. Soft but cleans</li>
    <li> Good product good price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a extra soft toothbrush because I can be a bit rough I&#x27;m told or just not brushing correctly with tiny circles. I&#x27;ve been trying to do the side to side to prevent more receding gums. Regardless this sucker feels great its perfect for what I require no matter how hard I brush its soft as a feather and quite durable. I will be purchasing it again and highly suggest it for those looking for extra soft.</li>
    <li> This Colgate toothbrush is for sensitive teeth. It is super soft while at the same time managing to clean your teeth really well. I had not seen or tried an extra soft toothbrush in the past but I really enjoyed this one.</li>
    <li> I love the extra soft bristles.  It is a wonderful toothbrush.  Too bad it is no longer offered as a subscription.  Wish there was a way to get all one color, i.e. blue.  Regardless it is my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Hoping that they would be more softer like the ones my Hygienist gave me because of my gums, but I feel they are still too stiff for what I need.</li>
    <li> Much better for sensitive gums</li>
    <li> Extra Soft toothbrushes are hard to find in stores. This is a great product and great price!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this toothbrush for my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with wearing down my enamel because I brush too hard. Even using a soft brush, I was still damaging my teeth. With the extra-soft brush, I’m saving my teeth. It great for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...It is soft but becomes misshapened quickly. High price too.</li>
    <li> I am 21 years old and had gum repair surgery on seven different teeth. I&#x27;m always looking for a soft tooth brush and these fit the bill</li>
    <li> good price and service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone from Medium to this softer head.  It is softer as advertized.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums, and as a result I can only use soft or extra soft brushes.  I thought this toothbrush was fantastic - the bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t irritate the gums or teeth, but they&#x27;re still capable of deep-cleaning the mouth.  Since the head of the toothbrush is relatively small, it can even reach into those hard to reach places behind the molars to get every last bit of food or plaque.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of soft toothbrushes over the years, since my dentist said most people should use soft brushes. I expected the Colgate Sensitive toothbrush to feel gentle in my mouth, especially since it&#x27;s labeled as extra soft. However, it didn&#x27;t feel all that soft to me. I&#x27;ve had much softer toothbrushes from other brands that were not described as extra soft or for sensitive mouths. Still, this toothbrush did not irritate my gums or sensitive teeth, so it worked very well at getting my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Great. I love the extra soft toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Terrific toothbrushes for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. The enamel on my front teeth is very thin, so they can be sensitive. I like that this toothbrush has extra soft bristles, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my teeth at all. I also like the compact head as it makes it easier to reach all of my teeth and gums. The tongue scraper is also an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has extra soft bristles for sensitive teeth and gums.  It also has a tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like using it after I have dental work and my teeth and gums are especially sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a toothbrush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it is great for sensitive teeth.  I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Really good toothbrush especially for very sensitive teeth. Was recommended by my dental hygenist.</li>
    <li> I always buy Soft toothbrushes and this is the first time I use extra soft. I really liked this. It helped with my gum sensitivity. Very gentle but effective. I experienced no bleeding in my gums. I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I mostly use the EXTRA SOFT the first week after I see my dentist or if my gums bleed. It&#x27;s very gentle. The polishing cup holds toothpaste against tooth surfaces to help maximize the paste&#x27;s performance, helping to remove plaque and stains from tooth surfaces, with the Colgate® Sensitive Enamel Protect(tm) to protect tooth enamel from acid attacks or COLGATE TOTAL® CLEAN MINT TOOTHPASTE. I use the MEDIUM bristle for my initial clean for teeth and gums. It has tapered bristles and a cleaning tip to help remove more plaque and stains. I use with the COLGATE TOTAL® ADVANCED WHITENING TOOTHPASTE the combination removes surface stains, dual-silica technology helps prevent new stains from forming plus fights germs for 12 hours. I use this when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate® 360°® has a unique tongue cleaner located on the back of the brush head that helps remove up to 96% more bad breath bacteria than brushing teeth alone with an ordinary manual toothbrush. I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use the reverse side on my tongue, I use the bristles to keep that minty fresh.</li>
    <li> I normally like soft toothbrushes, and was surprised to find there are &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes out there.  This brush is really very soft - so soft that I would imagine this would work best for people with very sensitive gums.  I found the brush to be a little too soft, but it still worked quite well when it came to getting my teeth clean.  If you have sensitive or receding gums, this would be a good option if you find that soft bristles are too irritating.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of toothbrushes lately. This is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the extra soft bristles are truly soft. I have over brushed my poor little gums to the point of recession. I have to be really careful. This brush was very gentle. It seems like a harder toothbrush would clean better. But you actually get a much better clean with the softest est bristles because they can get further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact head was great. I didn&#x27;t know how tiny my mouth was until I tried all these brushes. This one fits nicely.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has held up well for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and comfortable.  The head is compact and the bristles are well inserted so they don&#x27;t come out, and it&#x27;s very soft.&lt;br /&gt;They do have a bit of variable length so they clean well.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is easy to grip and it is slightly angled.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly simple basic design toothbrush that seems well made and of good quality.  It should hold up for a while.  After a week, it&#x27;s not really showing scrunched up bristles and I brush pretty hard.</li>
    <li> feels a little big but i like it</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and is as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular toothbrush for several years now. I have a habit of pressing too hard when brushing and have done so for years. That coupled with using more firm bristles have worn down my gum line a bit over time. These extra soft bristles coupled with Sensodyne toothpaste have helped minimize discomfort for me and ensure that I&#x27;m not causing further damage to my gums. Also important to note that my experience has been that the softer bristles are no less effective at cleaning teeth or preventing cavities than firmer options I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Rubber grips are well placed and the smaller brush head makes it easy to get everywhere that you need to.</li>
    <li> Love the bristles, tongue scrubber, and shape. Only issue I have is the handle is so round that you cant maneuver the brush around because it slips out of grip.</li>
    <li> Best.toothbrush.ever!!!  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums but I&#x27;m not a big fan of hard crusty toothbrushes scraping them raw.  I tried lots of different toothbrushes and this one is by far the most comfortable, easiest to get back teeth, and best cleaning I&#x27;ve ever used.  My gums felt like they just had a massage.  Just ordered four more in the off chance that Colgate does something amazingly stupid and discontinues it eventually. Every time I&#x27;ve had a favorite toothbrush in the past, that has happened. Colgate, this message is for you - Don&#x27;t be stupid! Keep this toothbrush in stock forever!</li>
    <li> We are enjoying our new toothbrushes.  They are working out great!  We have been happy with the product and the service we received.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothbrush because I was not able to find extra-soft toothbrushes at any local store. The bristles do not feel similar to the extra-soft toothbrush my dentist gave me to try. In fact, the bristles feel soft to medium.  I would not buy this product if you have sensitive teeth and want a truly extra-soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> At 23 I&#x27;ve got receding gums because I apparently can&#x27;t contain my enthusiasm when it comes to oral hygiene.  The dentist recommended extra soft bristles and, being unable to find them in stores, I came to trusty Amazon.  They work nicely, although I miss the truly scrubbed clean feeling I get from the normal soft bristled brushes.</li>
    <li> I was warned by my dentist about a receding gum line, and he recommended a softer brush. This toothbrush is exactly what I needed. The bristles are very soft; maybe some of these other reviewers have had softer, but this is by far the gentlest brush I&#x27;ve ever used. The pattern of the bristles also feels very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact size of the head is also a plus. Reading some of the reviews had me a bit worried about it, but the small size allows it to reach anywhere in your mouth comfortably, even the far back corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the tongue scrubber; I used one with my old brush, and the fact that this Colgate had one as well was a deciding factor. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I tend to accumulate a lot of buildup on my tongue, and the scrubber cleans it off well. If you&#x27;ve never tried, I would recommend giving your tongue a scrub and seeing what comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great little brush for a good price.</li>
