      <li>BEST THING I HAVE DONE FOR MY HAIR, maybe EVER!!!!</li>
      <li>i tried to find a \\&quot;best by\\&quot; date but couldnt.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I had some crispy crunchy ends from bleaching and this stuff really impressed me.</li>
      <li>BUT i am soooo happy it helped with the fallout.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>It arrived today, and since my girls were napping I decided to be brave and go for it.</li>
      <li>Seller was Great and the product was great too.  </li>
      <li>Just used it and loved the feeling of my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first part is done best with heat.</li>
      <li>I aimed the blow dryer at it and it got amazingly plasticky feeling.</li>
      <li>It arrived extremely fast, and nit works wonderfully</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t comb through it after a shower, because it was kind of mushy.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was terrified of doing more harm.</li>
      <li>She said it helped to imagine Dolly Parton doing your hair in the shop from Steel Magnolias, which I found hilariously accurate!</li>
      <li>I know many of us have been told to cut off the damaged hair or damaged ends.  </li>
      <li>I was able to finger</li>
      <li>It felt more like hair.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I made sure to review this product because I was looking for reviews all over online when purchasing.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do anything  more than conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I thought for SURE</li>
      <li>When I rinsed it off, the results were like magic.</li>
      <li>I love that my hair feels strong again.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by some chick that works at Sally&#x27;s, she saw the condition my fried orange over bleached hair and said this product for sure would make my hair good as new.</li>
      <li>Worked in some fructose xl body mousse, and styled it with my blowdryer, did a little dance around my bathroom and ran to grab my iPad to order 4 more packets of this wonderful stuff!</li>
      <li>I was nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out well, but it rinsed super easily!</li>
      <li>Then, when you wash it out, also make sure to rinse it all out very thoroughly in warm water.</li>
      <li>This product did exactly what it said it would, and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>hi light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Loreal 9.5nb to keep my roots at bay for the last 10 yrs, and have always been really happy with that.</li>
      <li>The first step, the Two-Step Protein Treatment does have a strong smell, but smells more like hair chemicals than rotten eggs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll use this product again, but as for the vender and price that was the best part in all of this.</li>
      <li>This is a great treatment for damaged, dry hair.  </li>
      <li>:) :) I conditioned with the step 2 (which someone had described as smelling old ladyish.</li>
      <li>It didnt work magic, i have naturally curly hair, and it didnt fix frizz or anything special.</li>
      <li>As for the vendor I had a 5 star experience, packaging was secure and shipped fast and on time.  </li>
      <li>I basically had to put everything aside and do the treatment right away, since it was dripping all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As soon as the water hit it, it softened right up</li>
      <li>why, oh why didn&#x27;t I order it right then??</li>
      <li>I did find upon rinsing, that my hair was very much strengthened.</li>
      <li>this is my first protein treatment ever.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I cried many times at my bathroom sink over the last couple of months.</li>
      <li>The second part of the treatment, the Balanced Moisturizer smells a lot better</li>
      <li>My first wash after the treatment, my hair felt almost exactly as it had when it was still virgin hair.</li>
      <li>You really, really want to let it harden!</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>Every time they recommend a product to me i get no freaking results at all, i&#x27;m starting to suspect they&#x27;re all messing with me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, i made sure to follow the directions EXACTLY- step by step, exactly how the directions said to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Dry, it feels smooth and healthy, and the paler parts that were the most damaged don&#x27;t even look or feel rough anymore.  </li>
      <li>Not so fast, give this treatment a try first.  </li>
      <li>I was bummed, though, because I had also bought a spray bottle for the first step, since it&#x27;s very liquidy, but I couldn&#x27;t get it in time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Applying the product didn&#x27;t go great, some of it ran down my back.  </li>
      <li>I have fine blonde hair, just below my shoulders.</li>
      <li>Your hair is fine, and the last traces of product will wash out.</li>
      <li>I was going to have to cut it off, but they look pretty decent now, not frizzy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buy it, follow the directions to an absolute T, and you will be ultra-satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>It felt comparable to using any type of straight protien treatment.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the real thing.</li>
      <li>Aphogee is that ish for real.</li>
      <li>gently.</li>
      <li>She wants her length</li>
      <li>Try this before getting the haircut that you really don&#x27;t want.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to incorporate this product into my monthly hair care schedule and likely splurge on the bigger bottles because I honestly don&#x27;t see this product going anywhere for me.</li>
      <li>I think its a good idea if it would work but for my course thick hair, it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Provided you did everything exactly as instructed, your hair will feel stronger and softer, and you will really notice the difference after you give it a few days and a couple more washes.</li>
      <li>And I sure didn&#x27;t want to comb it wet with this shellac stuff on it!</li>
      <li>I waited a full 2 weeks before writing this review so that I could tell how much the product had actually helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily, I&#x27;d bought extra.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this last year it worked really well!</li>
      <li>As for the conditioner, I guess it softened my hair a little more</li>
      <li>I seriously can&#x27;t stop touching my hair right now.</li>
      <li>My hair feels normal again and isn&#x27;t shedding anymore at all.  </li>
      <li>but, it is not hard.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d bleached my hair from a medium brown to practically white for my pink hair, and I kept up that color for months, always touching it up.</li>
      <li>Firstly, if you&#x27;re worried about the amount of product, It&#x27;s enough for shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>It was drying in frizzy, rough feeling patches on the ends and top of my hair, with the healthier hair at my neck and scalp taking hours to truly dry.  </li>
      <li>For some reason I decided to treat myself to a professional color/</li>
      <li>and my hair was soft and shiny afterwards.</li>
      <li>I finally decided I needed something to really get me on my feet again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My big, rewarding moment came just a few days ago at a party when my friend was absently stroking my hair and said he wished his hair were as soft as mine.</li>
      <li>I actually didn&#x27;t mind it all that much.</li>
      <li>Imagine if honey and milk were mixed together and left in a hot car.</li>
      <li>packaging was mostly fine, except that the box containing the packets was too tight, so when I tried to open it with a knife, I accidentally pierced one of the packets and it immediately started dripping out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Who cares if it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, it&#x27;s doing major surgery on your hair!</li>
      <li>When I touched it while it was wet, it didn&#x27;t exactly feel like hair -- it felt almost like a mushy plastic.</li>
      <li>Calm down.</li>
      <li>When I applied to my freshly washed hair, I found it to be very sticky and hard to distribute through the hair evenly.</li>
      <li>it didnt really do anything to my hair except for make it really dry.</li>
      <li>Then I had to dye it back to a natural color for my job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not that much effort</li>
      <li>Again, because I had to do it right away, I didn&#x27;t manage to get my hair dryer in time (at another house) and I instead waited approximately 2 hours until it was pretty crispy</li>
      <li>, your hair will feel kind of weird, and you will probably doubt that the product actually worked.</li>
      <li>but not as much when I combed my hair out previous wash/co-washes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I know many of us have been told to cut off the damaged hair or damaged ends.  Not so fast, give this treatment a try first.  My daughter&#x27;s damaged relaxed hair was breaking uncontrollably.  A girl at the beauty supply suggested we give this a try.  What a Blessing this stuff is.  Her hair slowly stopped breaking after using this product along with two weeks of deep conditioning (using heat under the dryer).   She wants her length so I am willing to exhaust all options before cutting.  This is the real thing. PLEASE follow the instructions to the letter. Add a deep conditioning treatment for extra care since this will add dryness to the hair. I hope this works for you the way it did for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with aphogee products and it still stinks! lol. When I applied to my freshly washed hair, I found it to be very sticky and hard to distribute through the hair evenly. I did find upon rinsing, that my hair was very much strengthened. I felt that the balancing moisturizer was not moisturizing AT ALL. Afterwards, I deep conditioned and my hair was still hard. I would only purchase again if the moisturizer was deeply moisturizing. Im looking to try the Palmers Coconut protein treatment.</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair, just below my shoulders. I&#x27;ve used Loreal 9.5nb to keep my roots at bay for the last 10 yrs, and have always been really happy with that. For some reason I decided to treat myself to a professional color/hi light. Worst mistake ever! My hair was destroyed! I hated to wash it because it felt like mushy cotton candy when wet,  and even using top of the line conditioners, it took forever to comb out, ever. so. gently. And then I would still end up with HANDFULS of broken hair. It was devastating. I won&#x27;t lie, I cried many times at my bathroom sink over the last couple of months. I prayed for something that could strengthen my hair and make it stop breaking. It took me 2 years to get to this length and i didnt want to have to cut it off. I would stay up late into the night reading everything I could find online. I kept hearing about this stinky 2 step protein treatment....why, oh why didn&#x27;t I order it right then?? I guess I was a bit intimidated by the whole \\&quot;rock hard hair\\&quot; thing, and still shell- shocked over the damage to my hair. Honestly, I was terrified of doing more harm. I ended up noticing it in my \\&quot;save for later\\&quot; cart here on amazon and went ahead and ordered it earlier this week. It arrived today, and since my girls were napping I decided to be brave and go for it. BEST THING I HAVE DONE FOR MY HAIR, maybe EVER!!!! I used a spray bottle to apply it evenly, didn&#x27;t comb it thru, because, well, I&#x27;m so scared of combing my hair nowadays. And I sure didn&#x27;t want to comb it wet with this shellac stuff on it! I aimed the blow dryer at it and it got amazingly plasticky feeling. I was nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out well, but it rinsed super easily! As soon as the water hit it, it softened right up and I could tell my hair was different! :) :) I conditioned with the step 2 (which someone had described as smelling old ladyish. And it does. She said it helped to imagine Dolly Parton doing your hair in the shop from Steel Magnolias, which I found hilariously accurate! :) and let me tell you, when I took that towel off my head, I could run my fingers thru my damp hair!! I used a spritz of my regular leave in (aveeno nourish + condition) out of habit, but I don&#x27;t think I even needed it. Worked in some fructose xl body mousse, and styled it with my blowdryer, did a little dance around my bathroom and ran to grab my iPad to order 4 more packets of this wonderful stuff! And to leave this review. Hoping it helps someone else not be a chicken like I was. I seriously can&#x27;t stop touching my hair right now.</li>
    <li> I love this. Aphogee is that ish for real. If you are having issues with shedding or breaking use this while you figure out how to correct what&#x27;s causing the problem. You will find that you hair will stop shedding nearly instantly.</li>
    <li> I had some crispy crunchy ends from bleaching and this stuff really impressed me. I thought for SURE I was going to have to cut it off, but they look pretty decent now, not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who cares if it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, it&#x27;s doing major surgery on your hair!</li>
    <li> Seller was Great and the product was great too.  Just used it and loved the feeling of my hair.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at sallys after my hair stylist suggest i do a protein treatment. I dye my hair a few times a year, and i straighten a few times a week. My hair is damaged and its been coming out like crazy, more than usual. SO i was hoping this would help with the hair fallout.&lt;br /&gt;First, my protein treatment smelt HORRIBLE, and maybe its because sallys let it sit too long on the shelf, but it was sickening.and i tried to find a \\&quot;best by\\&quot; date but couldnt.&lt;br /&gt;But it DID help, i combed my hair and it was about half the hair that usually falls out. It didnt work magic, i have naturally curly hair, and it didnt fix frizz or anything special. BUT i am soooo happy it helped with the fallout. this is my first protein treatment ever. so i believe with occasional use my hair will be healthier.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work but it doesn&#x27;t do anything  more than conditioner.  I think its a good idea if it would work but for my course thick hair, it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time tonight. The first step, the Two-Step Protein Treatment does have a strong smell, but smells more like hair chemicals than rotten eggs. I followed the directions and sat under a bonnet dryer until my hair was completely dry. Your hair will be hard, but follow the directions and do not move or try to separate it. The second part of the treatment, the Balanced Moisturizer smells a lot better and after you wet your hair, rinse out the protein treatment and apply this product, your hair will seem healthier and softer - at least mine did. I wish I would&#x27;ve used this product weeks ago before my hair started to break off and got extra dry. My hair feels normal again and isn&#x27;t shedding anymore at all.  I&#x27;m going to incorporate this product into my monthly hair care schedule and likely splurge on the bigger bottles because I honestly don&#x27;t see this product going anywhere for me.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this last year it worked really well! But when i re- bought it this year it didnt really do anything to my hair except for make it really dry. It didnt work at all like it had the year before. Maybe I just got a bad batch :)</li>
    <li> It was stinky but did the job. I wasn&#x27;t experiencing any shedding or breakage--just trying it out as part of my hair care routine. I followed the instructions exactly and my hair was soft and shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by some chick that works at Sally&#x27;s, she saw the condition my fried orange over bleached hair and said this product for sure would make my hair good as new. I am never trusting anyone that works at Sally&#x27;s ever again. Every time they recommend a product to me i get no freaking results at all, i&#x27;m starting to suspect they&#x27;re all messing with me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, i made sure to follow the directions EXACTLY- step by step, exactly how the directions said to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;It was the stickiest substance i have ever felt and it stank horribly. After i washed out step 2, my hair was impossible to comb out and felt hard, like wet doll hair, it was gross. I almost feel like this product made my hair worse. i was at least able to comb it before i used it, and my hair still snapped off at the ends just as badly as it did before! I wish i could give this stuff no stars. one star is way too much.&lt;br /&gt;instead of using this product, go out into your yard, find some dog crap, and rub it into your hair. you will get the same results, it won&#x27;t smell as bad, and you&#x27;ll save money.</li>
    <li> ...and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was severely sun damaged this past summer and I&#x27;ve been cutting it and stretching relaxers.  It&#x27;s very dry and I decided to try this based on a review from a friend.  I love that my hair feels strong again.</li>
    <li> Note: I waited a full 2 weeks before writing this review so that I could tell how much the product had actually helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d bleached my hair from a medium brown to practically white for my pink hair, and I kept up that color for months, always touching it up. Then I had to dye it back to a natural color for my job. Damage was inevitable, and I knew that, but it never seemed too bad until after the natural-brown dye job, which was my first dye job in a salon. After that, my hair was just tired. I couldn&#x27;t comb through it after a shower, because it was kind of mushy. When I touched it while it was wet, it didn&#x27;t exactly feel like hair -- it felt almost like a mushy plastic. There was a lot, lot, lot of dryness, and little pieces of my hair would break off. There were little white dots of breakage, and I had only to tug at the piece of hair for it to detach at that spot. When I pulled my hands through my hair, strands would get caught in my fingers. I finally decided I needed something to really get me on my feet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was mostly fine, except that the box containing the packets was too tight, so when I tried to open it with a knife, I accidentally pierced one of the packets and it immediately started dripping out. Luckily, I&#x27;d bought extra. I was bummed, though, because I had also bought a spray bottle for the first step, since it&#x27;s very liquidy, but I couldn&#x27;t get it in time. I basically had to put everything aside and do the treatment right away, since it was dripping all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone will talk about how bad it smells, so I expected the worst. I actually didn&#x27;t mind it all that much. Then again, I have olfactory damage, so it could smell like ass and I wouldn&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part is done best with heat. After putting it through your (carefully brushed!) hair, use a blow dryer to help it harden. Again, because I had to do it right away, I didn&#x27;t manage to get my hair dryer in time (at another house) and I instead waited approximately 2 hours until it was pretty crispy and I was pretty tired. Don&#x27;t worry about leaving this stuff in your hair too long. If you feel like it&#x27;s as hard as it can be, wait another 5 minutes before washing it out. You really, really want to let it harden! Then, when you wash it out, also make sure to rinse it all out very thoroughly in warm water. Just rinsing it, I could immediately tell that my hair was stronger. It felt more like hair. YOU MUST follow up with the second step! It&#x27;s really not that much effort and it makes a difference. I left it in for about half an hour and it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: For the next few days, or however long you like to wait for your next wash day (which should be several days!), your hair will feel kind of weird, and you will probably doubt that the product actually worked. If it feels weird, or you think it&#x27;s gunkier than it was before, IT&#x27;S ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS STILL RESIDUE FROM THE PRODUCT IN YOUR HAIR. Calm down. It&#x27;s not the end of the world. Your hair is fine, and the last traces of product will wash out. Provided you did everything exactly as instructed, your hair will feel stronger and softer, and you will really notice the difference after you give it a few days and a couple more washes. My first wash after the treatment, my hair felt almost exactly as it had when it was still virgin hair. My big, rewarding moment came just a few days ago at a party when my friend was absently stroking my hair and said he wished his hair were as soft as mine.</li>
    <li> I made sure to review this product because I was looking for reviews all over online when purchasing.  As for the vendor I had a 5 star experience, packaging was secure and shipped fast and on time.  As for the product I have mixed feelings.Firstly, if you&#x27;re worried about the amount of product, It&#x27;s enough for shoulder length hair.  I have very thick hair and the packet saturated my hair thoroughly.  As for the smell....OMG. Imagine if honey and milk were mixed together and left in a hot car. It smelled sooo sour! I couldn&#x27;t wait until it dried and i could rinse it out.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair hard like others are saying. It felt comparable to using any type of straight protien treatment. As for the conditioner, I guess it softened my hair a little more but I couldnt feel any diff. IDK if it&#x27;s because my hair was in desperate need of a treatment but i followed up with a deep conditioner and then styled as usual. After styling my hair felt the same, still some shedding. but not as much when I combed my hair out previous wash/co-washes. I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll use this product again, but as for the vender and price that was the best part in all of this.</li>
    <li> I am a serial hair abuser.  Recently, I went from black hair, to platinum blonde, to pink, to black, and then just bleached it BACK to blonde.  Understandably, my hair was fried.  It was drying in frizzy, rough feeling patches on the ends and top of my hair, with the healthier hair at my neck and scalp taking hours to truly dry.  I couldn&#x27;t even comb/brush it wet without it stretching and snapping like plastic.  I thought, I will try this stuff, and if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll have to just get a pixie cut and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the product didn&#x27;t go great, some of it ran down my back.  I was able to finger comb it through my hair, and hoo boy was it sticky and itchy on my skin.I suffered through for a couple of hours until it hardened, though, then rinsed it out and used the balancing moisturizer as instructed.  After two minutes of that, I rinsed it as well, then applied a Matrix deep, deep conditioner and kept that on my hair for about 40 minutes.  When I rinsed it off, the results were like magic. My hair felt like HAIR. I could brush it, and run my fingers through it, and it dried evenly.  Dry, it feels smooth and healthy, and the paler parts that were the most damaged don&#x27;t even look or feel rough anymore.  This product did exactly what it said it would, and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> It arrived extremely fast, and nit works wonderfully</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that friends tell friends about. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen it advertised on TV, but your hairdresser probably already knows about it. Buy it, follow the directions to an absolute T, and you will be ultra-satisfied with the results. Try this before getting the haircut that you really don&#x27;t want. This stuff can save your hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great treatment for damaged, dry hair.  Specifically for breakage.  You must follow the directions carefully but, it is not hard.</li>
