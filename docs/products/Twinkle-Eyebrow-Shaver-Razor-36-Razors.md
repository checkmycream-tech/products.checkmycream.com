      <li>I saw these Twinkle Razors on more than a few make up tutorials I&#x27;ve watched on you tube - all being from professional makeup artists.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Order arrived early!</li>
      <li>Still a good buy if you use often, but the sharp ones for brows a very few in the box.</li>
      <li>The blades are sharp and effective without irritating skin.</li>

<li> This works well, but the blades don&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Wont have to buy them again for a long while.</li>
<li> They are sharp enough to use on the toughest hair and they razor eyebrows to perfection!!</li>
<li> Also, they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut you!</li>
<li> Remain sharp for several uses.</li>
<li> Simply put, these are so cheaply made that they are dangerous with little bits of wire sticking out around the razor.  </li>
<li> takes a couple tries to get it</li>
<li> The razors work well, some were a little rough like as if they had been used or old, past date.</li>
<li> I hoped they&#x27;d be as sharp as tinkle...</li>
<li> He has had no complaints, but the are definitely too dull for accuracy in brows.</li>
<li> I expected something with small razor blade on it.</li>
<li> I personally have peach fuzz all over and very thick hair on the sides of my face - plus it&#x27;s dark.</li>
<li> No more running out of a sharp razor for a while.</li>
<li> These little razors are a bargain by the boxful.  </li>
<li> DON&#x27;T waste your money on this set.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used one yet but have given a few away.</li>
<li> They work wonders on brows, peach fuzz, and any other nuisance hairs in delicate areas.  </li>
<li> Just after a few uses the blades turn dull.</li>
<li> ugh....most are dull.</li>
<li> on the box but &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; when you order, seems to be quite dull.</li>
<li> I tried to use the razors on my face and they are so dull and rough that they are useless.</li>
<li> I am all for a less expensive alternative it works.  </li>
<li> Your boyfriend is secretly pissed off you have a mustache.</li>
<li> I have ordered these on three packs, and they&#x27;re called &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; (which is just weird, but whatever)</li>
<li> So sad...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use these for removing the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; on my face. This pack of 36 is a great price. Seller shipped promptly and product arrived with no problems. The blades are sharp and effective without irritating skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The blades work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see the plastic handle a little thicker but they work great for what they are intended for.</li>
    <li> These little razors are a bargain by the boxful.  They work wonders on brows, peach fuzz, and any other nuisance hairs in delicate areas.  I have given them as gifts and people horde them and treat them like gold.</li>
    <li> I tried to use the razors on my face and they are so dull and rough that they are useless. I attempted to return them but the seller will not accept returns if the product has been used and then they would charge a 15% restocking fee plus the buyer must pay the return postage. Most sellers on Amazon accept returns no matter what the issue but that is not the case with Maya Beauty. DON&#x27;T waste your money on this set. Do yourself a favor and buy a small package first to ensure you like them. I agree with one of the reviewers; I think this set may be  a knock off.</li>
    <li> This works well, but the blades don&#x27;t last long. They start very sharp, which is good, but you must be very careful not to nick your skin. Just after a few uses the blades turn dull.</li>

    <li> The razors work well, some were a little rough like as if they had been used or old, past date. I had to end up throwing some away. Perfect for eyebrow shaping which is what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I use for facial hair and they are quick and  easy to use.  The right angle is important but I have used them for over a month and am please with the results.</li>
    <li> These arrived as promised and seem to be as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t used one yet but have given a few away.</li>
    <li> Great product. Order arrived early!</li>

    <li> I use these razors to shave the peach fuzz off my face.  It makes makeup application so much better.  Love them!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work well. They also can cut you easily.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped fast! Great price.</li>

    <li> So sad...these are a RIP OFF of the great &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; razor.  I should have looked more closely at the copycat packaging to see these are &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34; razors.  I am all for a less expensive alternative it works.  Simply put, these are so cheaply made that they are dangerous with little bits of wire sticking out around the razor.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I use these around my eyebrows and for peach fuzz.  These are not only great, but are an excellent value!</li>
    <li> I love these! I have peach fuzz on face that this takes off perfectly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was the best price for quantity. Wont have to buy them again for a long while. Used one for the first time.. takes a couple tries to get it just right but its great. It can still cut you though. The very end is sharp but as long as you figure it out before scratching yourself, then you are good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these on three packs, and they&#x27;re called &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; (which is just weird, but whatever) and they&#x27;ve been great, but for some reason this larger pack, called &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34; on the box but &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; when you order, seems to be quite dull. I won&#x27;t order them like this again. I suspect that they are knock-offs.</li>
    <li> These little razors are great for getting rid of any facial hair. I personally have peach fuzz all over and very thick hair on the sides of my face - plus it&#x27;s dark. This gets rid of it right away. I hold it and face against the grain of hair at a 45 degree angle. Also, they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut you! I scraped it straight across my finger, and no damage. Great value and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> ugh....most are dull. I bought these because me and my husband both use them; me for brows, him for beard. He has had no complaints, but the are definitely too dull for accuracy in brows. I hoped they&#x27;d be as sharp as tinkle...Still a good buy if you use often, but the sharp ones for brows a very few in the box.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to shape the eyebrows</li>
    <li> These are amazing. Your boyfriend is secretly pissed off you have a mustache. Just buy these.</li>
