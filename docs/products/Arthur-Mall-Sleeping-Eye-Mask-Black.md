      <li>Now, armed with THE BEST MASK EVER, and my heros ear plugs</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this eye mask.</li>

      <li>the cheapies I have from CVS works better.</li>

      <li>I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I found that I had to loosen it around the head to be more comfortable but that meant that it slips more around the eyes.</li>
      <li>Great eye mask, comfy and soft!</li>
      <li>I like my one from Xpress spa at the airport way better, this one feels and acts cheap.</li>
      <li>One of the most comfortable sleep masks I have ever had.</li>
      <li>but I might be if it fit better.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of blocking out light almost completely.</li>
      <li>Wonderfully light without letting &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; through.</li>
      <li>It is light</li>
      <li>Blocks all the light</li>
      <li>I sleep soundly.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if others fit this way also so take this review with a grain of salt.</li>
      <li>Fantastic light blockage.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable and exclude almost all the light.  </li>
      <li>For one, a lot of light leaked in.</li>
      <li>We liked it so much, I bought one for myself.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t block out 100% of the light on my face.</li>
      <li>It is light weight but keeps the sunlight from interfering with sleep.  </li>
      <li>But it does work &amp; it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
      <li>Not as comfortable as I hoped.</li>
      <li>Light weight, comfortable and keeps your eyes cool.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought one for my daughter who works nights and sleeps days, and needed to block out the daylight.  </li>
      <li>Could be slightly larger height wise to keep the light out when it slips.</li>
      <li>even most women&#x27;s hats are too large.</li>
      <li>never getting a full rest.  </li>
      <li>However, upon alerting the company of this flaw they promptly apologized, assured me that it must be a defect, and reimbursed me for the full value.</li>
      <li>This mask is very comfortable, and completely blocks out all light.  </li>
      <li>Does the job of blocking out light pretty well</li>
      <li>Comfortable, adjustable, keeps everything nice and dark, perfect solution when closed curtains really don&#x27;t keep out the daylight.  </li>
      <li>It is good but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my wife&#x27;s head long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The light blocking ability is OK, but not great, there is a fair amount of light that comes in from underneath</li>
      <li>Too hot!</li>
      <li>I am new to third shift and had great difficulty sleeping during the day.  </li>
      <li>This mask works very well at blocking out light and staying put over the course of the night.</li>
      <li>and I rarely ever break out.  </li>
      <li>Thank you Arthur Mall for being such a courteous seller ;-)</li>
      <li>comfortable and super soft</li>
      <li>Really nice eye mask, comfortable and stays on your face without having the strap so tight as to cut off the circulation to your brain.</li>
      <li>Does what it promises at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I like this mask very much.</li>
      <li>just came back from a trip and my family couldn&#x27;t believe I slept through the noisy neighbors as most times</li>
      <li>Met my needs and is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Also the shape of the mask allowed considerable light entry at the bottom.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps out the light, which is good for this night shifter!!</li>
    <li> Falsely advertised.  Flat, with no space for eyes to move.  I had to buy a different style at a local travel store.</li>
    <li> These work great and I love the place for the ear foam plugs in the band.  When I travel, this is a good feature so that you have a place to keep your ear plugs too.  They block out all light and are comfortable to wear for a good price!</li>
    <li> Great  product and fast  shipping</li>
    <li> Soft, comfortable, and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described.  Comfortable, adjustable, keeps everything nice and dark, perfect solution when closed curtains really don&#x27;t keep out the daylight.  A very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone seems to be raving about this product.  It&#x27;s not comfortable, light still comes through the nose area, I cannot open my eyes while wearing this, and it made me actually break out... and I rarely ever break out.  On top of that, the valcro tangled in my hair.  I actually had to take it off because it kept making me wake up.  I absolutely hate this product.  During the night, all I could think about is that I need to make sure I actually put in a review for this item in the morning because it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    <li> Great service and works great. I can sleep past 5am.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and keeps me in the dark!! I like this mask very much.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Wonderfully light without letting &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; through.</li>
    <li> This mask works very well at blocking out light and staying put over the course of the night. I was not entirely satisfied with mine because it bled color onto my pillowcases, so now there are black stains that won&#x27;t come out. However, upon alerting the company of this flaw they promptly apologized, assured me that it must be a defect, and reimbursed me for the full value. I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the masks in general since I have only used the one, but based on the other reviews I am inclined to say that they are usually very good and mine was simply defective. A good product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Sleep mask is top rate.  I found the ear plugs a bit harder to get to fit than some others I have, but that were adequate.  The loops for holding the plugs is a clever idea.</li>
    <li> It block the world....  but it has a plastic smell even though I washed it.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never had a face mask. But it does work &amp; it&#x27;s comfortable. The added ear plugs are nice! Good for travel as well as it comes with it&#x27;s own little pouch...</li>
    <li> comfortable and super soft</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Many successful naps since its arrival.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I found this mask both uncomfortable and hard to keep on.  It has a single wide strap that fits right over the ears, making for discomfort over a long period.  Even with the strap loosened it still hurt.  Also the shape of the mask allowed considerable light entry at the bottom.  The cheap airlines masks with dual thin straps and softer mask are much more comfortable.  We returned the masks.</li>
    <li> Too hot! Sending it back.</li>
    <li> Best sleeping mask ever! Light weight, comfortable and keeps your eyes cool.  Excellent on keeping light out.</li>
    <li> In some ways I like this product (well made, soft, etc.).  But I have a rather large head (size 7 3/8) and I find the attaching strap is not long enough to fit without pulling the mask somewhat tight.  This causes the mask to touch my eyes, which is uncomfortable.  A little more strap length would probably fix that.  So if you have a larger head or wear other items (like a CPAP mask) that add girth to your head&#x27;s diameter, consider another option.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this mask, especially after reading such great reviews. The straps are too think and extremely uncomfortable behind my ears. It actually hurts and cuts into ear. Going straight to the garbage and complete waste of money for me. I do have a pretty small head and even most women&#x27;s hats are too large.</li>
    <li> I bought this so my husband who works nights can sleep through the day.</li>
    <li> If this sleeping mask had a better headband (I&#x27;ve used it for about two months), it would be 4+ stars. It is already stretched out (and I&#x27;m not THAT much of a fathead), so I will have to either buy a new one or find another headband solution.</li>
    <li> I lost my last mask, so I bought this one. My previous one had recessed eye holes. This one doesn&#x27;t have that. So there is some slight pressure on your eyelid. It also doesn&#x27;t block out 100% of the light on my face. It&#x27;s helpful, but not as good the other one I purchased. I&#x27;ll probably need to re-buy that one.</li>
    <li> I wear this mask every single night and have enjoyed increased quality sleep as a result.  Bought one for a friend, too.  It is light (some masks are too hot/heavy), the design fits my face well.  Cannot beat this price either.  My friend bought one for $40 and likes this one much better.</li>
    <li> fits snugly using velcro strap.  Let in a little light down by the nose but that can be minimized somewhat by adjusting the position. Comfortable.</li>
    <li> I like my one from Xpress spa at the airport way better, this one feels and acts cheap.</li>
    <li> My son works nights and loves this mask. He says it keeps 100% of the light out and is cool enough to wear in California heat. I only wish it was washable.</li>
    <li> Really nice eye mask, comfortable and stays on your face without having the strap so tight as to cut off the circulation to your brain.</li>
    <li> One of the most comfortable sleep masks I have ever had.</li>
    <li> As mentioned before, the mask is soft and effective.&lt;br /&gt;The fabric around the nose area isn&#x27;t generous enough to block out all light, but I do have a pretty flat nose.&lt;br /&gt;Also, not a huge fan of the earplug holder sewn into the side.</li>
    <li> It was small and light leaked in the area where the nose hits it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. I have been using it for about a week. It does a good job of blocking out light almost completely. I find that there is some light shining in through the bottom of the mask but that may be because I can&#x27;t pull it down lower. If I pull down further on the nose I start to feel like it is obstructing my breathing. I have always easily felt claustrophobic. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The eye mask works well.  It is light weight but keeps the sunlight from interfering with sleep.  I appreciate the earplugs attached to the mask so they aren&#x27;t misplaced, although I haven&#x27;t used them yet.  Having everything in a convenient pouch makes taking them on trips very convenient.  All in all a product I can recommend and will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product was terrible, but the customer service was amazing.</li>
    <li> Does the job of blocking out light pretty well and it&#x27;s comfortable enough that I can sleep with it on.  Stays on throughout the night.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, keeps the light out very comfortable, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are the exact same as any sleeping shades you can find any where.</li>
    <li> This is a great item - but have found I had to cut the tabs for the ear plugs off in order for it not to bug me. Could be slightly larger height wise to keep the light out when it slips.</li>
    <li> Comfy, soft, keeps all, if not most light out. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am new to third shift and had great difficulty sleeping during the day.  These really did help.  They are comfortable and exclude almost all the light.  A little light comes in around the nose area.  I would recommend them.  They stay on well.</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. Thank you Arthur Mall for being such a courteous seller ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a side sleeper and this mask, due to its&#x27; contours, would become smashed inward.  Incomf</li>
    <li> It is good but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my wife&#x27;s head long. Keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> I like the mask overall, but even after following the instructions both the mask and earplugs come out several times a night. Wearing it tighter hurts my ears and wearing it looser makes it come off. Part of why it hurts my ears is the section for holding the earplugs. After sharing these thoughts with the seller, I was thanked for my feedback and told they are always trying to improve. They also offered to send a new pair of earplugs.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE this Sleep Mask!! It is VERY comfortable and it gives me a GREAT night&#x27;s sleep! If you have ANY sensitivity to light before falling asleep, Get this Sleep Mask and you&#x27;ll enjoy Great sleep I the future!!&lt;br /&gt;This mask had helped me Immensely!</li>
    <li> Mask is not heavy duty so it doesnt wear so heavy on your face. Yet it does let a little bit of light through just because it is not heavy. My husband hates sleeping with stuff on his face but loves this mask and steals it from me all the time.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable, and completely blocks out all light.  I originally bought one for my daughter who works nights and sleeps days, and needed to block out the daylight.  We liked it so much, I bought one for myself.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great sleeping mask.  I appreciate the wide band.  It is more comfortable than the sleep masks I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say?  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Very comfortable and light-proof.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye mask. I won&#x27;t go on vacation without it.</li>
    <li> Blocks all the light but it does press against your eyes and the straps are not that comfotable either.</li>
    <li> I started off loving this eye mask. Very good at blocking the light out. However. After a couple months use, the mask became very flimsy and no longer stayed on my face at night. Also, the straps are not very comfortable.  Earplugs are nice though.</li>
    <li> I had a sleep mask from an airline and liked it a lot. But when the bands eventually stretched out, I ordered this eye mask, based primarily on the reviews. What a mistake. Half the time, the thing slips off my eyes during the night, but if I were to tighten the strap enough to keep it in place, my eyes would probably suffocate (a little humor there). It shows why the airline&#x27;s two-strap design is superior.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises at a very reasonable price. The sleep mask&#x27;s strap has &amp;#34;holsters&amp;#34; for ear plugs, which is a nice touch. The ear plugs themselves are nothing special -- the basic $0.20 each foam plugs. Very good product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to use this mask, by pushing the nose piece up a bit, it is the best mask ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is both very comfortable and incredibly effective at keeping the light out.</li>
    <li> Slept 4 hours during the day. Fantastic light blockage. Both two, one for home&lt;br /&gt;Second for travel. Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Met my needs and is exactly as described.  Deliverey was prompt and on time as advertised..</li>
    <li> The Velcro strap is an improvement over the dual elastic straps I&#x27;ve used on other sleep masks.  This is a good sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Not as comfortable as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I found this mask uncomfortable and don&#x27;t recommend it. For one, a lot of light leaked in. Also, your eye lids rub against the fabric, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the mask is a slip of paper that says the mask comes with a 90 day money back guarantee. Great! I thought. I&#x27;ll get my money back. It says to e-mail them at cs@arthurmall.com. Except as of the time of this review (June 28, 2015) that e-mail doesn&#x27;t work! It&#x27;s not a valid e-mail address. Okay so then I tried the website on the piece of paper: www.arthurmall.com. And again, on June 28, 2015 this website is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How in the world this sleep mask got so many five star ratings is beyond me. I&#x27;m guessing a lot of those are fake!</li>
    <li> Great eye mask, comfy and soft!</li>
    <li> Super disappointed in these...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable velcro strap slides down the back of my head at night and becomes extremely uncomfortable behind the ears, consistently waking me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light blocking ability is OK, but not great, there is a fair amount of light that comes in from underneath the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;memory foam ear plugs&amp;#34; are subpar... the cheapies I have from CVS works better.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Sturdy Velcro closure,</li>
    <li> Wow!  Customer Service is TOP notch!  I was initially disappointed with my purchase with all the rave reviews.  Then I received my mask with a heavy chemical smell.  I attempted to wash it and then soak it.  Don&#x27;t soak or place it in the washing machine.  The satin silky finish faded and it was functional but fell apart and I was left with a beaten up product.  A few days later, they must have saw my review and I wasn&#x27;t complaining for a refund or anything.  They promptly sent another replacement mask and this one has no chemical smell!  Maybe they suggested wherever Amazon stored it picked up something, but its wrapped in plastic so I&#x27;m not sure how that would work.  Anyhow I can&#x27;t be more pleased with this type of CS!  I would buy this mask any time knowing that they truly want to see customers become raving fans of this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just came back from a trip and my family couldn&#x27;t believe I slept through the noisy neighbors as most times I complain when I wake up.  I never felt more rested now that I&#x27;ve been using the mask and ear plugs.  Most nights I would wake up and toss and turn until morning never getting a full rest.  Now, armed with THE BEST MASK EVER, and my heros ear plugs I sleep soundly.  Arthur Mall truly stands behind their products.  I wished they&#x27;d do a premium and put heros ear plugs as that would be an awesome package!</li>
    <li> I love this! I work night shift so I needed a mask to be able to sleep during the day. This is very comfortable and adjustable, and the ear plugs are a nice plus.</li>
    <li> Worked well on long flight to Japan.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I was very satisfied</li>
    <li> Never used a mask before but thought I&#x27;d try one for better sleep. I&#x27;m not a fan of it but I might be if it fit better. I found that I had to loosen it around the head to be more comfortable but that meant that it slips more around the eyes. Don&#x27;t know if others fit this way also so take this review with a grain of salt.</li>
