<li> WOW!</li>
<li> and my face feels soft</li>
<li> Kinda surprised when I got the product</li>
<li> and this really helps with the dry skin!  </li>
<li> I was not sure what to expect, but my face seems to be very moisturized after I have had it on.  </li>
<li> Bought this product a long time ago and put in my fridge.  </li>
<li> but she didn&#x27;t use it that night, and the next day it had lost its form, turned to gel, and the gold separatedU from the other material.</li>
<li> and afterwards my skin was soft but only for a few hours and then felt extremely tight.</li>
<li> i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my skin, but i used it only once.so not sure!!!</li>
<li> Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be extremely moisturizing but based on what everyone is saying the mask is drying, I didn&#x27;t experience</li>
<li> but it would be something extremely helpful in summer after being in sun all day.</li>
<li> but has gone way down...</li>
<li> Unable to keep in place long enough to know what it was to do.</li>
<li> but for the price bought a few..</li>
<li> WHICH IS A WASTE.</li>
<li> /&gt;Total waste of money - immediately returned.</li>
<li> After few time of use, skin was looked smoother and gloving.</li>
<li> Not very effective at all.</li>
<li> Looks like an expensive facial when you take it off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the material is, not the sturdiest mask I guess.</li>
<li> i am not sure if it helped my skin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to adjust it to cover all the areas you want.</li>
<li> oly problem I have is that it is that because it is so soft-it is hard to handle</li>
<li> The mask was a little difficult to use, but proformed</li>
<li> To thin and watery.</li>
<li> I was skeptical, read reviews..</li>
<li> directions are nearly impossible to understand, but basically you apply the mask let sit for 30 minutes and then moisturize.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LIKE THE EFFECTS BUT WILL NOT STAY ON MY FACE WHICH IS A WASTE. THEY NEED TO PUT THESE INGREDIENTS AND A JAR AND KEEP IT SIMPLE.</li>
    <li> Beautiful collagen mask. After few time of use, skin was looked smoother and gloving. I used different products before, but not any of them came close to this results.</li>
    <li> i am not sure if it helped my skin but it definitely help me go to sleep. i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my skin, but i used it only once.so not sure!!! but it would be something extremely helpful in summer after being in sun all day. It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
    <li> Not very effective at all. Did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my face&#x27;s shape. It&#x27;s hard to adjust it to cover all the areas you want. Use scissors)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, read reviews..but for the price bought a few.. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother skin, my cheeks were congested??? maybe??...they look clear smooth now, I was amazed, my face looks healthy and refreshed i also have a puffy spot under 1 eye, its still there but has gone way down... I&#x27;ve tried everything from Macy&#x27;s to Sephora&#x27;s..nothing really helped..I&#x27;ve use Lancome and Estee Lauder, clarins, etc.. philosophy all those products, for years..nothing compared to this mask.. will def be buying more  I will say I am over 45ish....[...]</li>
    <li> Kinda surprised when I got the product, I thought it was a cream or like a liquid toner- instead it&#x27;s a full flagged gel mask... I&#x27;m not sure what the material is, not the sturdiest mask I guess. The liquid the gel sits in contains a bevy of different chemicals to sooth, whiten etc... I found that it mostly smelled of rose water- and I feel as though it is mostly rose &amp;#34;water&amp;#34;. Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be extremely moisturizing but based on what everyone is saying the mask is drying, I didn&#x27;t experience that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are nearly impossible to understand, but basically you apply the mask let sit for 30 minutes and then moisturize. Simple as that.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. It got here fast and looked great...but she didn&#x27;t use it that night, and the next day it had lost its form, turned to gel, and the gold separatedU from the other material. Gross.</li>
    <li> Unable to keep in place long enough to know what it was to do.</li>
    <li> nope. will never buy again. just rose water.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect, but my face seems to be very moisturized after I have had it on.  Would highly recommend this to men and women that want to take care of their skin.  : )</li>
    <li> Love this mask, my face is amazing after. Smells like roses</li>
    <li> One star.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but if it&#x27;s anything like the eye masks here, no thank you.  To thin and watery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nano Golden Mask for over three month and Is the best way to refresh your face and see the fine wrinkles fade away .&lt;br /&gt;Tumbles Up :)</li>
    <li> Feels great, would buy again.</li>
    <li> only used once-seemed to improve my skin after only one time--oly problem I have is that it is that because it is so soft-it is hard to handle</li>
    <li> its a beatiful, my daugther think the color and confecction is espectacular, is pleasure buy, thanks you is very very excellent o</li>
    <li> Bought this product a long time ago and put in my fridge.  Finally used it today and I love it... It was refreshing and made my skin feel smooth.  I have large pores and I can honestly say they were almost non detectable after using mask!  A must have!</li>
    <li> I received this product early which was great. However I didn&#x27;t like the application of the mask. It didn&#x27;t fit my face correctly, it kept sliding all over the place and afterwards my skin was soft but only for a few hours and then felt extremely tight.</li>
    <li> Looks/feels marvelous, but results disappear within hours.</li>
    <li> I was told I looked fabulous and I appear 15 years younger! WOW!</li>
    <li> Nothing but a rubber mask with a bunch of liquid thrown in a gold colored pouch.  When I opened it up most of the liquid came pouring out on my hands leaving the mask just laying there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money - immediately returned.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this type of product and I was really quite surprised at how well it works!  Better than an expensive facial!  I love it and recommend it.  I am not a paid shill here. Just a woman who lives in the desert and this really helps with the dry skin!  I&#x27;m glowing!  It plumped and smooths and gives a nice glow to your skin. Looks like an expensive facial when you take it off. Plus it&#x27;s fun walking around the house with a gold mask on. My dog and husband seem to enjoy the look. Lol</li>
    <li> 24 K Nano makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I can&#x27;t be more happy with this face mask and highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I tried it once -- feel soothing and my face feels soft</li>
    <li> The mask was a little difficult to use, but proformed well, I will continue to use this product.  great deal for the price</li>
    <li> Loved it! It felt so great on my face &amp; I was really refreshed after. Will definitely be buying more</li>
