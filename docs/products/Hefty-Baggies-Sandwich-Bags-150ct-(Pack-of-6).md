    <li> Nice to be able to find these bags somewhere.  They are not in any local store that I could find.  Zipper bags have too much space and I like to be able to mold these to the contents.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find these Baggies online.  My son is having a medical problem and these bags work perfect.  I looked all over for them at stores but never found any.  I was very happy with my purchase.  It was great doing business with the seller.  I was pleased with how quickly they arrived.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these forever and can no longer find them in this very large city. Really glad to have them again. Purchase was simple and quick.</li>
    <li> Use these bags for poop fick up. just the dight size and no zip lock.  Very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> These baggies are exactly what I need for individual items (cookies-popcorn-meat) when a Ziploc bag does not work.  You can&#x27;t get the air out of Ziploc easily.</li>
    <li> Blast from the past, but my mother loves them!  This is the 2nd time I bought them!</li>
    <li> I store peeled onions in these - they last for weeks.  Zip-locks do not work for that - spoils in a few days.  It might have to do with the type of plastic used.  They are not available in the stores around here anymore - it&#x27;s a shame.  Thank God for Amazon!</li>
    <li> these are great bags to have around to save on the costly zip type bags. the store no longer carry them. a twist tie has become prehistoric. i use them to double wrap itmes for the freezer, and whenever non liquid items need to be stored.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described</li>
    <li> they are a little thinner than they used to be but still very economical and convenient. I will continue to buy them as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> These are the only one&#x27;s my Husband will use.  He get&#x27;s upset when I buy the one&#x27;s in the store.  These are really hard to find.  You can&#x27;t get in the stores anymore, at least not around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> cant find these anywhere anymore.  Very useful to me. for some reason stores have stopped carrying these handy little bags.</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find in stores in our area.  We like the simplicity of them.</li>
    <li> These are priceless. For little snacks (when regular quart size baggies are too big/ bulky/fancy), for sandwiches, for grapes, for animal crackers - you name it. I use and discard them with no guilt and they are the easiest for kids to deal with.</li>
    <li> Baggies are Baggies and not much can go wrong with the actual product, however the boxes are all smashed up and I am unable to store them neatly.&lt;br /&gt;When one orders a quantity of a product it is essential the packaging is in good order for storage until used. That is of course unless stated otherwise in the description, which was not stated.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in an envelope with out any attempt to preserve the individual boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissatisfied with this seller&#x27;s disrespect for my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these bags anymore, So I was pleased to obtain them. I like the style of the twist tie for many things, and the self seal for others.</li>
    <li> Another good old fashioned product that is hard to find these days locally or otherwise. Much better than the more modern zipper bags.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore and I use these daily. Hate to change brands and not have what I am used to. I know, change is good but I like these and the newer brands are more expensive. This wasn&#x27;t a price bargain so the more you order the better. I think I&#x27;m stocked up now for a good long time. No &#x27;zipper&#x27; feature or &#x27;fold over&#x27; feature, just a plain clear baggie - simple!!</li>
    <li> Very nice for preparing meal portions and freezing plus organizing just about any small items.</li>
