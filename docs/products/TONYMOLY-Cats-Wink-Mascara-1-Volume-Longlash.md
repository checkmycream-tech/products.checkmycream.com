      <li>(Huge bonus for blondes with very light eyelash roots!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>cute packaging but for more oily lids, it wouldnt be worth the purchase.</li>

      <li>It has a more fluid consistency than most mascaras I have used, which I love!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous and I would buy again even if was twice the price.</li>
      <li>It was in a sealed heavy plastic mailer, and wrapped in about 5 feet of bubble wrap so my product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>If you want a great Japanese mascara...go with Kiss Me Heroine.</li>
      <li>But so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>It also let you build up / layer more without gunking up if you use the brush right for</li>
      <li>Takes about 3 applications to get the full look I wanted.</li>
      <li>super quick.</li>
      <li>This product came very fast since it came from Korea, the packaging is a cute cat, but it&#x27;s very functional.</li>
      <li>I decided to try something new and bought this for the cute bottle and the rave reviews.</li>
      <li>This mascara makes it look like your lashes are just that pretty!</li>
      <li>Their shipment arrived quicker than scheduled, and the packaging was very well done with free samples that I may be looking intopurchasing now as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>This mascara is totally worth every penny you spend.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth the wait.</li>
      <li>but it really was just as good as a generic pharmacy mascara.</li>
      <li>First of all, it comes in such an adorable package!</li>
      <li>This mascara is super good however it dried out on me</li>
      <li>After a good curl, my lashes look super long and this stuff holds a curl like no other.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>i got this in like two weeks they ship pretty fast!</li>
      <li>I love Korean cosmetics and was on my 3rd bottle of Étude house&#x27;s 3 step volumecara when I went to order my 4th.</li>
      <li>It really makes my eyes stand out!</li>
      <li>The only plus is the cute bottle.</li>
      <li>My eye lashes aren&#x27;t long so most mascaras I use don&#x27;t work as well, but this one does and it even enlongates my lashes as well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going for a quick, lightweight application that will still give you super defined long lashes, try this one out!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>always use 2 coats of this for a super long voluminous effect, but if you like a more natural look, one coat goes very far.</li>
      <li>hahahaha</li>
      <li>: I forgot to add that the seller packaged this item very well.</li>
      <li>smears a whole ton.</li>
      <li>It works great for Asian eyes because it defines our small lashes.</li>
      <li>The only con for this mascara is that it does not come off easily, which is actually a tribute to the amazing quality, and more like a con for the makeup remover I was using (fyi, the effects of every makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried pale in comparison to the effectiveness and gentleness of regular old coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get much volume, but the brush is small and you can get the inner corners more easily.</li>
      <li>The brush is slim, which prevents smearing during application and results in long, clump free lashes.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done, but it&#x27;s a bit of a trade off to have a cute look with an average application brush.</li>
      <li>Removes decently with babyoil eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Wish it came in a larger size,since I seem to run out of it quickly.</li>
      <li>As for the mascara itself, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
      <li>It is not difficult to take off, (I use a gentle eye-makeup remover and it takes only a couple seconds) but do NOT step into the shower with this still on your lashes unless your planning to remove it while you&#x27;re in there!</li>
      <li>It really is able to coat each lash with rich dark black pigment.</li>
      <li>I believe this is going to be my new go to mascara.</li>
      <li>so it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>This mascara coats my lashes well, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump so far.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lashes glossy, yet soft.</li>
      <li>so I could actually use it without getting too much.</li>
      <li>Pretty clumpy during the first few times</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a few more of these for when I run</li>
      <li>The wand is thinner than most American brand mascaras with lots of tiny bristles which are great for getting all the tiny lashes at the corners of your eyes and close to the base of your lashes.</li>
      <li>It comes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump, and the small bristles and reach the smallest of lashes that I have.</li>
      <li>I bought this when going on a cute-asian-cosmetics-shopping-spree, so I didn&#x27;t really care about how the product actually performed, just about how cute the little black cat was.</li>
      <li>I recently used up all of this product and in the interest of trying new things, I bought a mascara at Sally&#x27;s, which sucked compared to Cats Wink.</li>
      <li>The fine small brush lets you get every lash and actually makes mine look thicker!</li>
      <li>The lashes I get from it are thick and long depending how many coats I put on, Again, it doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
      <li>I want to stock up on this because it is an easy to remove, true black that makes my big fluffy eyelashes look like magazine quality false eyelashes.</li>

<li> It stays on very long without flaking off, and when you wash it off it doesn&#x27;t run, it sort of like those fiber mascaras but not a thousand fibers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I initially bought this mascara solely because I wanted the packaging. My sometimes childish sensibilities took over and I needed the cuteness with every fiber of my being. I was surprised and delighted to find that it is THE VERY BEST mascara that I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried designer mascaras and a plethora of drug store brands, yet nothing has ever come close to the quality that this mascara has. I recently used up all of this product and in the interest of trying new things, I bought a mascara at Sally&#x27;s, which sucked compared to Cats Wink. Needless to say, I need more of this; it&#x27;s the only beauty product with which I have ever been obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very black, and it plumps and lengthens my lashes. It does not clump off or smudge under my eyes even though I sweat profusely during the summer. The only con for this mascara is that it does not come off easily, which is actually a tribute to the amazing quality, and more like a con for the makeup remover I was using (fyi, the effects of every makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried pale in comparison to the effectiveness and gentleness of regular old coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply mascara, I put the wand as close to the base of my eyelashes as I can get, and kind of wiggle it back and forth to gather up the lashes, and then sweep it out away from the eye. I do this a couple of times for each eye, and I think I get the best coverage using this technique.</li>
    <li> The wand is a little too long and too straight. When I&#x27;m not getting mascara on my eyelids, I&#x27;m poking myself in the eye. The length and volume it gives my eye lashes is so so. I love Korean cosmetics and was on my 3rd bottle of Étude house&#x27;s 3 step volumecara when I went to order my 4th. I decided to try something new and bought this for the cute bottle and the rave reviews. I&#x27;ll be buying the Étude house mascara again.</li>
    <li> I wear mascara everyday, tried different brands from $5 to $30. The Tonymoly Cats Wink mascara goes on and washes off easily, lengthens lashes, and won&#x27;t smear. Will stock up!</li>
    <li> I bought this when going on a cute-asian-cosmetics-shopping-spree, so I didn&#x27;t really care about how the product actually performed, just about how cute the little black cat was. As for the mascara itself, it&#x27;s decent. Pretty clumpy during the first few times I used it, had to wipe a lot of product onto the sides of the tube before deciding to wipe the brush off onto a kleenex so I could actually use it without getting too much. Makes lashes look definitely volumized, not so much extra length. It&#x27;s very dark black, and doesn&#x27;t seem to fade throughout the day. Removes decently with babyoil eye makeup remover. Overall, alright for the price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cutesy container fool you. This is great quality mascara. It coats and without clumping. It makes my lashes glossy, yet soft. It lengthens without giving tarantula lashes. It doesn&#x27;t smear, even on my oily lids.  It doesn&#x27;t run when my eyes water. It doesn&#x27;t flake off. It comes off easily with makeup remover. It&#x27;s fabulous and I would buy again even if was twice the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried for a natural look. Most of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried make my lashes look clumped and fake. This mascara makes it look like your lashes are just that pretty! You can also wipe your eyes and have no fear of raccoon eyes, which I love. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a few more of these for when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I forgot to add that the seller packaged this item very well. It was in a sealed heavy plastic mailer, and wrapped in about 5 feet of bubble wrap so my product arrived in perfect condition. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This mascara coats my lashes well, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump so far.  I&#x27;ve only used it  a few times, so I&#x27;ll give it more of a chance.  But so far, so good.  Cute packaging too!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorites mascara for years, id recommend it anyone. The brush is slim, which prevents smearing during application and results in long, clump free lashes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! First of all, it comes in such an adorable package! The mascara itself is very nice, and does not clump at all. Since this mascara is the same price as what I would pay at the store, I might as well get this one! Also came with extra sample packets of other products. Very much worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best quality mascaras I have tried. Don&#x27;t let the packaging fool you, what&#x27;s inside is a top notch product! The wand is thinner than most American brand mascaras with lots of tiny bristles which are great for getting all the tiny lashes at the corners of your eyes and close to the base of your lashes. (Huge bonus for blondes with very light eyelash roots!)&lt;br /&gt;The Cat&#x27;s Wink Mascara goes on VERY smooth. It has a more fluid consistency than most mascaras I have used, which I love! It really is able to coat each lash with rich dark black pigment. I did not experience any clumping or \\&quot;spider\\&quot; lashes at all. Instead, this mascara elongates your lashes individually and gives them almost a luscious feathery appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I always use 2 coats of this for a super long voluminous effect, but if you like a more natural look, one coat goes very far. This is not a mascara you are going to have to paint on your lashes for five minutes trying to get the look you want. If you&#x27;re going for a quick, lightweight application that will still give you super defined long lashes, try this one out!&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution with this product is the removal. It is not difficult to take off, (I use a gentle eye-makeup remover and it takes only a couple seconds) but do NOT step into the shower with this still on your lashes unless your planning to remove it while you&#x27;re in there! The pigments in this mascara are such a dark rich black, that it will leave dark blue dye stains on your cheeks if you do not remove it.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, just stick to removing your make-up beforehand and you will not have any problems! This mascara is totally worth every penny you spend. (which is not much at all to begin with)&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait for this to arrive from South Korea every time I buy it, but I will continue to repurchase from A-Poly. Their shipment arrived quicker than scheduled, and the packaging was very well done with free samples that I may be looking intopurchasing now as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Tonymoly for another amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great for Asian eyes because it defines our small lashes. I can see my eye lashes!</li>
    <li> I LALALALALALALALALA LOOOOOVE this mascara! it&#x27;s truly magic in a cute kitty tube! My lashes are always dull and plain no volume they jsut sit there. so i decided to give this a try and BAM! my lashes instanlty grew in lenth and volume they look like a model&#x27;s eyes on a magazine advertisement hahahaha i love it, it&#x27;s totally worth the wait. actually even though this was shipped from Korea and my eta date said about 1 month..i got this in like two weeks they ship pretty fast! im extremly happy and I am going order another tube!</li>
    <li> I have rather sparse and short lashes. Few swipes of the wand makes builds volume and length, THEN I curl my lashes with lash curler when the mascara is halfway (not completely) dry to make my lashes...wow! It did not cake up on my lash curler (maybe a just a little, but can&#x27;t complain!). It also let you build up / layer more without gunking up if you use the brush right for that false lash look which I wore to a friend&#x27;s wedding as a bridesmaid, it lasted all days through sweating and crying with intact CURLS and NO SMUDGE and NO FLAKES. Buying more to stock &#x27;em up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and a great size for my eyes^.^</li>
    <li> it clumps on my lashes that are thick, it doesn&#x27;t separate them like I want, probably better for someone with thin lashes</li>
    <li> If you want a great Japanese mascara...go with Kiss Me Heroine. TONYMOLY is the worst...drugstore mascara is better than this .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get much volume, but the brush is small and you can get the inner corners more easily. The cat cap is a cute touch.</li>
    <li> and I have to be very careful of the products I use around my eyes. Sometimes eyeliner&#x27;s and mascara&#x27;s burn but I am soo thankful this wasn&#x27;t one of them! It made my eyelashes look very long and I love the packaging it comes it. Will definitely keep reordering!</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing! I love the brush shape, it makes my lashes long and separates them perfectly. It does not hurt that the packaging is so completely adorable! I am looking forward to trying more of TonyMoly&#x27;s products now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this mascara for a while, so I caved and bought it maybe a little over a week ago. The spooly is so thin, unlike other spoolies that are just massive and get mascara all over your face. After a good curl, my lashes look super long and this stuff holds a curl like no other.</li>
    <li> This product came very fast since it came from Korea, the packaging is a cute cat, but it&#x27;s very functional. The brush is small so you can get all of your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t clump or burn. It stays on very long without flaking off, and when you wash it off it doesn&#x27;t run, it sort of like those fiber mascaras but not a thousand fibers. The lashes I get from it are thick and long depending how many coats I put on, Again, it doesn&#x27;t clump so it looks very natural. I love this mascara!</li>
    <li> smears a whole ton. that being said, i have quite oily lids but this will show under my eyes half day. cute packaging but for more oily lids, it wouldnt be worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really nice smooth formula that makes eyelashes look fabulous! The packaging is adorable, sturdy, feels good in hand and comes with a brush that is perfect for coating even the teeniest tiniest eyelash. I want to stock up on this because it is an easy to remove, true black that makes my big fluffy eyelashes look like magazine quality false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Is Awesome! This mascara is super good however it dried out on me super quick. Takes about 3 applications to get the full look I wanted. I liked the brush wand too.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, but it&#x27;s a bit of a trade off to have a cute look with an average application brush.</li>
    <li> I heard that this mascara was supposed to make your lashes longer, fuller, etc. but it really was just as good as a generic pharmacy mascara. The only plus is the cute bottle.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara I was sure hoping that this would be a favorite! It also is soo cute!</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome! It really makes my eyes stand out! The fine small brush lets you get every lash and actually makes mine look thicker! Wish it came in a larger size,since I seem to run out of it quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I feel as though it works perfectly for my lashes. It comes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump, and the small bristles and reach the smallest of lashes that I have. My eye lashes aren&#x27;t long so most mascaras I use don&#x27;t work as well, but this one does and it even enlongates my lashes as well. With past mascaras I was unable to get my bottom lashes because they were so tiny, but this mascara can do the job. I believe this is going to be my new go to mascara.</li>
