      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>It is quickly absorbed and non-greasy, with a pleasant light scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews-which were surprising for a Dove product to be honest, it’s a good brand but not really known for their hard-core skin rejuvenation, and</li>
      <li>/&gt;The serum; is like a gel lotion smells good and felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Very grateful to be able to purchase online.</li>
      <li>I got this as a replacement for an Avon product that has been discontinued and now knowing how much I like this, it&#x27;s better than the Avon product.</li>
      <li>So, the package says that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not a quick fix&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It does not leave an oily feel and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY perfumey and quite strong.</li>
      <li>it’s that lovely space right above your cleavage and what should be a pretty, sexy spot</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried anything other than good lotions and creams, hasn&#x27;t done a thing to help.</li>
      <li>It dries right in.</li>
      <li>I especially ordered this serum as the reviews were good, but so far i have seen no changes at all.</li>
      <li>because it got stellar reviews as well.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The serum keeps my skin smooth and clear without being greasy.</li>
      <li>and this one isn’t made for the face…However, if that product doesn’t live up to my now huge expectations; I will absolutely continue to use this one these areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The good thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>with the cost being so great-especially for 2 large bottles-I went for it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Full disclosure; I&#x27;m also using Philosophy Miracle Worker retinoid pads, so there may be a cumulative effect here, but the skin on my neck is softer now than the skin on my face, so I really think the Dove Pro Age is the major factor</li>
      <li>but...i am beginning to feel like I wasted my time and money unless something amazing will occur in week 3...which i doubt.</li>
      <li>It was real.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my neck and chest are.</li>
      <li>I have really noticed its effect on my chest.</li>
      <li>The deep wrinkles have significantly reduced, and the skin on my neck is much tighter.</li>
      <li>But I thought I would look into something designed for this issue and quickly found this after specifically searching for 4 stars and above and under $30.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for women.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I’m not rich and most creams don’t work…</li>
      <li>/&gt;Years ago I bought a great body moisturizer from Dove and have since been unable to find any evidence of it.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, thin, dry skin, and now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, dullness and wrinkles are taking their toll.</li>
      <li>lotion is thick and goes on very easily, dries quickly, and a little goes</li>
      <li>(47 year old)</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, the scent is not too perfumey and your skin is left super moisturized and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have a neck that has seen better days thanks to a sunburn from the underworld back when I was in highschool (seriously, wear your sunscreen young people of the world!).</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re talking bumpy and turkey-like and about a decade older than my actual age.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My neck was dry and wrinkly and starting to turn dark since using dove the difference is amazing in this short time.</li>
      <li>This serum will last you forever; I have been using it consistently for the past several months and am still on my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I have DEEP wrinkles, loss of soft, hydrated skin on my neck and chest-especially my chest, you know-that lovely-old-lady-leather-chest</li>
      <li>Not a single store in my town carries any type of Dove lotion</li>
      <li>I use it all year round but appreciate it particularly in summer, when temperatures rise, and my skin cannot stand thick, heavy creams,  I recommend it highly, especially for &#x27;chronologically gifted&#x27; ladies!</li>
      <li>We produce apples, blueberries, peaches, cut flowers, herbs and salad mixes, so I am busy with various chores around and outside all year long.</li>
      <li>(I spend a TON of time reading reviews on several different products and weighing cost/size before deciding on ANYTHING) and just as with my chest, there was a HUGE difference with my “WTF” wrinkles between my eyes and with my upper lip there was more plumping and those little lines were definitely less noticeable</li>

<li> (I spend a TON of time reading reviews on several different products and weighing cost/size before deciding on ANYTHING) and just as with my chest, there was a HUGE difference with my “WTF” wrinkles between my eyes and with my upper lip there was more plumping and those little lines were definitely less noticeable</li>
<li> , I exercised, walked, changed eating habits and got my AIC down to a normal range but will keep an eye on my health and skin.  </li>
<li> I decided to do everything I could without becoming obsessed.  </li>
<li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
<li> Been using it for a long time.</li>
<li> I call my “WTF” marks and also right above my upper lip where I have begun to see those wrinkles you see from people who have smoked, which I do...</li>
<li> but it was getting dry.  </li>
<li> my skin in the neck area was beginning to look a bit dry, not a lot</li>
<li> I guess tanning beds, and sun bathing in my early years seriously came back to haunt me.</li>
<li> I am twenty years old and bought this to moisturize that delicate area (not remove any wrinkles, as I have none), and it does just that.</li>
<li> I have only been using it a few days</li>
<li> don’t plan on continuing to use THIS product on my face because I bought the other product</li>
<li> My neck was getting a little dry</li>
<li> The problem is that my face lotion is pretty expensive, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste it on my neck, either.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit dark, like tanned and usually don&#x27;t get dry skin.  </li>
<li> I saw the reviews for this, and since it&#x27;s inexpensive, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow!</li>
<li> Within a few minutes the odor is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a few expensive creams, but it just seems so silly to spend extra money for moisturizer for your neck.</li>
<li> Talk about a serious nightmare and blow to my self-esteem</li>
<li> the texture of the serum is rather thin</li>
<li> those nasty deep wrinkles on my chest were less visible by about 70%!!!</li>
<li> Was so sorry to see it leave the shelves.</li>
<li> (my “WTF” marks are way, way worse-I guess thinking “WTF” for 40 years will eventually make its mark)</li>
<li> -they aren’t bad to begin with</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is effective in skin care. The serum keeps my skin smooth and clear without being greasy. It dries right in.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and neck. It does not leave an oily feel and absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t have oily skin but a lot of products for the face make my face feel oily or sticky. This one goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I especially ordered this serum as the reviews were good, but so far i have seen no changes at all. (it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks) the texture of the serum is rather thin so it is easy to apply (and no allergic reactions) and the smell is nice but...i am beginning to feel like I wasted my time and money unless something amazing will occur in week 3...which i doubt.</li>
    <li> This product works great, my skin looks better and smoother. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My neck was dry and wrinkly and starting to turn dark since using dove the difference is amazing in this short time. I highly recommend this product for women.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, thin, dry skin, and now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, dullness and wrinkles are taking their toll. Plus, there&#x27;s some sun damage and sagging that looks awful. I&#x27;ve tried a few expensive creams, but it just seems so silly to spend extra money for moisturizer for your neck. The problem is that my face lotion is pretty expensive, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste it on my neck, either. I saw the reviews for this, and since it&#x27;s inexpensive, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow! This stuff is AMAZING. I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my neck and chest are. The deep wrinkles have significantly reduced, and the skin on my neck is much tighter. (Full disclosure; I&#x27;m also using Philosophy Miracle Worker retinoid pads, so there may be a cumulative effect here, but the skin on my neck is softer now than the skin on my face, so I really think the Dove Pro Age is the major factor here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is thick and goes on very easily, dries quickly, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. It&#x27;s VERY perfumey and quite strong. The good thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. Within a few minutes the odor is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is easily one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it.</li>
    <li> So, the package says that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not a quick fix&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be...I&#x27;m expecting gradual results. I have DEEP wrinkles, loss of soft, hydrated skin on my neck and chest-especially my chest, you know-that lovely-old-lady-leather-chest every woman looks oh-so forward to-NOT. Every morning I wake up and there they are, deeper than when I went to sleep because I sleep on my side with my chest squished-it’s that lovely space right above your cleavage and what should be a pretty, sexy spot IS NOT. I&#x27;m nearly (only) 41 and about a year ago I woke up one day and that&#x27;s what I saw. I was horrified. I guess tanning beds, and sun bathing in my early years seriously came back to haunt me. Thank GOD it hasn&#x27;t happened on my face. I don&#x27;t even look 30, but my chest looks 50! Talk about a serious nightmare and blow to my self-esteem…I used to wear tanks out all of the time (maybe didn’t help in creating this problem to begin with) but I have stopped because of the way my chest looks. So depressing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been at a loss...I haven&#x27;t tried anything other than good lotions and creams, hasn&#x27;t done a thing to help. I began thinking that I would need to see a plastic surgeon or dermatologist for how I might reverse some of this damage. But I thought I would look into something designed for this issue and quickly found this after specifically searching for 4 stars and above and under $30. I’m not rich and most creams don’t work…So, I wasn’t about to invest a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews-which were surprising for a Dove product to be honest, it’s a good brand but not really known for their hard-core skin rejuvenation, and with the cost being so great-especially for 2 large bottles-I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum; is like a gel lotion smells good and felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About an hour after applying it, I went into the bathroom and was SHOCKED AT WHAT I SAW (or didn’t see) those nasty deep wrinkles on my chest were less visible by about 70%!!! OMG!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I thought I was seeing things, but NOPE. It was real. Magic in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I was so amazed by the IMMEDIATE changes that I put some on the area between my eyebrows where I have 2 deep-ish wrinkles I call my “WTF” marks and also right above my upper lip where I have begun to see those wrinkles you see from people who have smoked, which I do...Along with buying this product I bought: L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Collagen Wrinkle Treatment, 1 Fluid Ounce specifically for these areas, especially my lips. because it got stellar reviews as well. (I spend a TON of time reading reviews on several different products and weighing cost/size before deciding on ANYTHING) and just as with my chest, there was a HUGE difference with my “WTF” wrinkles between my eyes and with my upper lip there was more plumping and those little lines were definitely less noticeable-they aren’t bad to begin with (my “WTF” marks are way, way worse-I guess thinking “WTF” for 40 years will eventually make its mark) but I don’t want them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t plan on continuing to use THIS product on my face because I bought the other product (hasn’t arrived yet) and this one isn’t made for the face…However, if that product doesn’t live up to my now huge expectations; I will absolutely continue to use this one these areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I bet you can guess…BUY THIS! It’s downright AMAZING. I cannot wait to see what the ongoing results will be with continued use of this product.  I just got it last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy de-wrinkling ladies!</li>
    <li> I have a neck that has seen better days thanks to a sunburn from the underworld back when I was in highschool (seriously, wear your sunscreen young people of the world!). We&#x27;re talking bumpy and turkey-like and about a decade older than my actual age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I bought a great body moisturizer from Dove and have since been unable to find any evidence of it. Not a single store in my town carries any type of Dove lotion so I had to look online. I found this listing and took a leap and I love it! A little goes a long way, the scent is not too perfumey and your skin is left super moisturized and smooth. I will be buying this again. I will also be gifting it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my aging neck.  It doing do anything&lt;br /&gt;to make my neck better but it is a great body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this age cream, it work real well for my neck and chest, i recommend it product for sure</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year now. It is a very good product and smells very nice. It does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have really noticed its effect on my chest. It has a nice, gentle sent and is not greasy.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizing serum that adds radiance to the neck and decolletage. I am twenty years old and bought this to moisturize that delicate area (not remove any wrinkles, as I have none), and it does just that. It makes my neck and chest super smooth and supple. I use this twice a day, and in the morning I apply it under my sunscreen. This serum will last you forever; I have been using it consistently for the past several months and am still on my first bottle. I recommend this to anyone looking to help prevent aging without spending a fortune. The price of this product couldn&#x27;t be better for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years but can no longer find it in Europe, so was obliged to order it while in USA.  It is quickly absorbed and non-greasy, with a pleasant light scent.  I use it all year round but appreciate it particularly in summer, when temperatures rise, and my skin cannot stand thick, heavy creams,  I recommend it highly, especially for &#x27;chronologically gifted&#x27; ladies!</li>
    <li> Dove Pro-age Body Serum is just fabulous and it is reasonably priced as well making it even better. I own and operate a farm and I am also a Master Gardener; that means a lot of time outdoors in all sorts of weather. We produce apples, blueberries, peaches, cut flowers, herbs and salad mixes, so I am busy with various chores around and outside all year long. My skin has over the years accumulated sun damage in spite of my best efforts. However, the Dove Pro-Age line of products has exceeded my expectations with visible results in a relatively short time. The spots on my hands, neck and arms are either gone or significantly faded. My skin is also much more moist and supple --- Thank you Dove for a great product keep it coming!:)</li>
    <li> This product did not disappoint. I have only been using it a few days but it smells nice, feels good, soaks right in, makes my skin feel wonderful and hydrated. I got this as a replacement for an Avon product that has been discontinued and now knowing how much I like this, it&#x27;s better than the Avon product. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Not at all greasy. Highly recommend. (47 year old)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Been using it for a long time. Was so sorry to see it leave the shelves. Very grateful to be able to purchase online. It has no rival.</li>
    <li> Helps as much as much more expensive products. Smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted user of this product for several years. It is no longer available in retail stores. I am stocking a drawer full for when it is no longer available online!</li>
    <li> Was on the borderline of being diagnosed as a diabetic and noticed my skin changing.  My neck was getting a little dry and I searched and tried several products but my skin in the neck area was beginning to look a bit dry, not a lot but it was getting dry.  I&#x27;m a bit dark, like tanned and usually don&#x27;t get dry skin.  I decided to do everything I could without becoming obsessed.  I went to see a specialist and the lady that I spoke to told me about this product.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at any nearby stores and then thought to try Amazon and sure enough I ordered it, used it and can honestly say it works.  I really love this product. It is very good for the neck area.  As women I know we like to take care of ourselves the best we can and when you find a product that works and especially doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg let me tell you I like to share that information.  This product works on your neck area.  It did for me.  About the diabetis, I exercised, walked, changed eating habits and got my AIC down to a normal range but will keep an eye on my health and skin.  Take care all.</li>
