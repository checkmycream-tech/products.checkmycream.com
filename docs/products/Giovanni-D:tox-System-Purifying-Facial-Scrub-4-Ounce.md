    <li> I highly enjoy this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft and more even than when I use a harsher product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily as I feared. As well, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry like other products do. (Even in the winter my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry with this product!) WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product at Marshall&#x27;s...had never used it before, but regularly use Aveeno Daily Scrub.  I must say, I really like it and the clay base seems to really help clean and smooth even better than the Aveeno scrub.  I use it almost daily.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this face scrub it makes my skin feel fresh and feels soft also my face glows.</li>
    <li> I am 65 &amp; have several of the Giovanni products &amp; have been happy with all of them!</li>
    <li> Love it- it feels so good on your face!</li>
    <li> Great scrub! worked well for clearing</li>
    <li> I use this complete system of products and I love the way it treats my skin.  Cleans all the toxins way and reduces pore size without drying my senior skin.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or strip my skin. In fact, I use a sensitive facial cleanser after this scrub and there is no excess dryness or irritation on my skin. I have very sensitive skin, so I get excited when I finally find things that work!</li>
    <li> My health food store stopped selling this product, and so of course I looked for it online at AMAZON!  I bought multiples of this product, because the shipping time is somewhat long.  It&#x27;s always better to have a few extras.  The product arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> AMAZING for my skin!  Clears it up fast!</li>
    <li> Made my pores smaller and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> Gentle facial scrub that can be used every day. You just need a drop and this smooths surface skin without damaging it. Have never had a problem with this scrub, but again, I just use a drop.</li>
    <li> The best scrub I came across. Suits to my skin. I use it once in two days. It makes my skin softer, fresh and clean. It takes away the dead skin and dirt. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like the way my skin feels since using this product.  Texture and tone improved. I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 1 month now. I use the Purifying Facial Cleanser every day and use this scrub about every other day. Whenever I have acne, it seems to get rid of it within 2-3 days, which is a few days faster than average for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that in the first few weeks of using the regimen, my face broke out way more than normal. I suppose it takes time for my skin to get accustomed to the product.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it now.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Makes my skin feel very smooth.  I use once or twice a week in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product line did not do anything for my face, I&#x27;m sure it cleaned it but the surface or appearance was not markedly improved.  Hopefully you will have better luck.</li>
    <li> Not too harsh. Skin seems softer and smoother after use.</li>
