<li> (I usually do every other or every third day, depending) and I can do that with this duo and my hair is much easier to comb through after I wash it.</li>

<li> BUT I would like to warn those with small hands that the bottle design renders it practically unusable.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t hardly stomach it, so</li>
<li> but, the red color in my hair still faded like crazy.</li>
<li> This shampoo left my hair dry and nasty looking.  </li>
<li> It is IMPOSSIBLE to dispense the product with one hand into the other.</li>

    <li> This combination of shampoo and conditioner  does protect color and keeps hair smooth.  I do not notice a&lt;br /&gt;scent, so it wont fight the other scents I may decide to wear.</li>
    <li> Have tried multiple different shampoos and conditioners that are designed for color treated hair. I only do highlights but anything that can make them last as long as possible, count me in. This shampoo and conditioner worked amazingly for me. I&#x27;ve had shampoos and conditioners that leave my hair greasy and all knotted up after the first use. This duo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to wash my hair every day (I usually do every other or every third day, depending) and I can do that with this duo and my hair is much easier to comb through after I wash it. Repairs damage and as an added plus it smells great. Will definitely be buying again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Good products and made a difference. Price is reasonable affordable.</li>
    <li> Was taped shut so the bottles would not leak.  Package arrive dun damaged.  What else can be said about shampoo and conditioner...</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and repairs damaged hair that has been colored. Does not leave greasy. Great product. I would recommend this product even for people with high lights or slightly colored hair.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected :)</li>
    <li> i love redken it is the best</li>
    <li> I loved the shampoo/conditioner at first but after a couple months noticed that my hair was breaking off. After I did some research I realized that too much protien in your hair can cause breakage. You are not supposed to use it every wash. So, in short great product but should not be used all the time :(</li>
    <li> Love the delivery time on this product</li>
    <li> The shampoo is fine; so is the conditioner BUT I would like to warn those with small hands that the bottle design renders it practically unusable. The packaging designer who came up with this concave triangle shape ought to be fired. It is IMPOSSIBLE to dispense the product with one hand into the other. You can&#x27;t even unscrew the top to remove it in order to dispense product. What were they thinking?????</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my hair soft without being limp and oily</li>
    <li> Save your color use this shampoo...it&#x27;s simple</li>
    <li> This is a good basic shampoo for colored hair - it is always reliable and rinses cleanly. Price is high, but you get what you expect.</li>
    <li> I used to loove the smell of Color Extend. It was light a fresh. Redken has recently changed the fragrance and it now smells like cheap shaving cream. Yuck! I can&#x27;t hardly stomach it, so I&#x27;m going with something different.</li>
    <li> The positives - I do think my color lasted longer than usual and I like the scent of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives - My hair feels unclean, greasy, and yet surprisingly dry and knotty at the same time. On a few occasions, I actually rewashed my hair, wondering if I had forgotten to wash the conditioner out, only to find that , no, the product was the issue. I cannot state enough how much I dislike this formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for years. Actually, I&#x27;ve tried other stuff here and there, but nothing preserves my color as well as Redken.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and the way my hair looks and feels when I use Redken products..</li>
    <li> Love the smell! So much cheaper and easier to purchase online than trying to find in a salon (at least in my current town).</li>
    <li> Appeared to be different than what was in the bottles from the hair salon.</li>
    <li> I compared the shampoo I received, with the Redken product at the store, and the consistency and smell were completely different.  This shampoo left my hair dry and nasty looking.  I would bet money that the Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles had been filled with a much cheaper product.  I threw them out, and now I am out the money.</li>
    <li> made my hair softer, smells good... but, the red color in my hair still faded like crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
