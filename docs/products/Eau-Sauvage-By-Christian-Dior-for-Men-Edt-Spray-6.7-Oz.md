      <li>/&gt;Not happy w/ this order</li>
      <li>Great scent.</li>
      <li>still smells great after all these years.</li>
      <li>Very nice smell when I mix it with hedione</li>
      <li>It smells very nice when he wears it.</li>
      <li>My dad loved it.</li>
      <li>Had my first bottle of this magnificent fragrance 30+ years ago,and it&#x27;s still a world beater.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But, this is the real thing and everybody around me finds this scent very refreshing and attractive !!</li>
      <li>It is so refreshing with good smell.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, gone by noon.</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I still love it.  </li>
      <li>This has been my husband&#x27;s favorite for years.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I found a seller on Amazon that sells a 6.7oz bottle for USD90.  </li>
      <li>Received many compliments for this Eau Sauvage Edt scent.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with both my husband, and with this cologne.</li>
      <li>Always the favorite of my husband.</li>
      <li>I was not too pleased with that.  </li>
      <li>Tried others but find many smell like soap to me and then return to Eau Sauvage.</li>
      <li>This sensual fragrance introduces a stylish, sophisticated take on the original citrus scent, featuring notes of myrrh, vetiver, and San Carlo bergamot.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for over 25 years; it&#x27;s light and refreshing</li>
      <li>it covered my expectations&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d really suggest as a personal gift to someone special&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great product to give for someone great</li>
      <li>and when you mix them, hmmmmmmmmm not such a good fragance.&lt;br /&gt;Oui! Eau Savage?</li>
      <li>Lasts 2 to 6 hours which is fine with me.  </li>
      <li>fresh scent, using it for many years.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s light and goes away after a couple of hours</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still a classic rebuttal to the overpowering scents popular today.</li>
      <li>Has the original formula been changed, has it been adulterated by unscrupulous people?</li>
      <li>My wife likes its clean, citrus scent.</li>
      <li>but it sure beats one that goes on very strong so it can last all day.  </li>
      <li>If it was good enough for Steve McQueen to wear, heck, it&#x27;s good enough for moi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was my absolute favorite men&#x27;s cologne in the 60&#x27;s when I was a teenager.  </li>
      <li>It still has that clean, fresh, citrusy fragrance</li>
      <li>Delivery is quick.</li>
      <li>Fantastic classic scent!</li>
      <li>He loves the fresh smell and I got the item with one day shipping.  </li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>generally buy the better end,eg Guerlain,Sisley etc,and consider this Dior product,right up there&lt;</li>
      <li>This is a men&#x27;s scent by Dior that I have liked for many years and has been hard to find most recently.  </li>
      <li>With a distinct, natural style, Eau Sauvage Parfum exudes a dark, elegant magnetism that is sure to mesmerize.</li>
      <li>Of course, it might just be that my sense of smell has changed over the last 40 years but it does seem slightly more herbal than I remember.  </li>
      <li>Manly in a clean, crisp way - not heavy or musky.</li>
      <li>Fresh, lemony, just out of the shower classic scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a long time favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>it was exactly what I wanted and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Sauvage has remained undeniably modern since its creation in 1966.</li>
      <li>I still like it, just not as much as I used to.</li>
      <li>This is Eau Sauvage passed by who knows what, and not at all the Real Thing.</li>
      <li>I am very tempted to buy another bottle from this seller just to stock up.</li>
      <li>This one is the real thing.</li>
      <li>The product is just the same as it was described, and was original.</li>
      <li>I have worn Eau Sauvage since high school and it is still my favorite summer scent, hands down.</li>
      <li>I came across this classic and timeless scent and purchased it for him.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for wear at anytime.</li>
      <li>the price is bit too high</li>
      <li>ordered directly from Amazon as the seller.  </li>
      <li>The last time I was there (only a week ago), the price is 40% higher (USD92).  </li>
      <li>However, it is much lighter and does not last very long (as others have noted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Hard to find but worth the search!  </li>

<li> I have been using this Eau Sauvage By Christian Dior For Men for a long time</li>
<li> I have been using this EDT for a long time</li>
<li> I have tried other citrus based men&#x27;s colognes but none have the long lasting staying power as Eau Sauvage spray.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Another reason I don&#x27;t wear any other cologne is simply that it gets into your clothing after a while</li>
<li> Very short lasting and seems watered down, not worth eighty bucks.</li>
<li> Very weak and wears off quickly.</li>
<li> The price seems to get more expensive lately.  </li>
<li> Even the box was wet</li>
<li> And furthermore, due to some Amazon policy, it cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s toned down slightly by the herbal notes in it.  </li>
<li> I have previously used Eau Sauvage.  </li>
<li> Received in less than 3 days.  </li>
<li> There a a few things that everyman must experience......</li>
<li> remind me my father in the past.</li>
<li> The scent here does closely resemble my past experience.  </li>
<li> I usually purchase mine (a 3.4oz bottle) when during my layover in Singapore at a duty-free shop.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, my unit was delivered in a rather damaged Dior box w/ the plastic wrapping already pealed open.  </li>
<li> I try to keep him stocked up, since it&#x27;s sort of hard to find.</li>
<li> which, not only do I dislike but it smells terrible on</li>
<li> Give this one a try if you get bored with the rest of them.</li>
<li> It was a fail.</li>
<li> All I know is that it was a terrible let down.</li>
<li> Almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
<li> I was a bit disappointed when I smelled it.  </li>
<li> and it drove me crazy!  </li>

    <li> Great stuff!  Almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this EDT for a long time and I still love it.  Yes, it&#x27;s light and goes away after a couple of hours but it sure beats one that goes on very strong so it can last all day.  The price seems to get more expensive lately.  I usually purchase mine (a 3.4oz bottle) when during my layover in Singapore at a duty-free shop.  The last time I was there (only a week ago), the price is 40% higher (USD92).  I am glad I found a seller on Amazon that sells a 6.7oz bottle for USD90.  I love it.  I am very tempted to buy another bottle from this seller just to stock up.</li>
    <li> still smells great after all these years.</li>
    <li> Received in less than 3 days.  Well packaged no damage will order again from same vendor.  Received many compliments for this Eau Sauvage Edt scent.  Lasts 2 to 6 hours which is fine with me.  Its not overpowering but just right.  Read in one of McQueen&#x27;s bio&#x27;s he commented the scent gave him clarity when acting. Have not gotten that from it but am not Steve Mcqueen either.  Give this one a try if you get bored with the rest of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since 1972.  My wife likes its clean, citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Very weak and wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> I have worn Eau Savage for perhaps 40 years. Clean verbena scent with NO MUSK!!!! which, not only do I dislike but it smells terrible on me.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I don&#x27;t wear any other cologne is simply that it gets into your clothing after a while and when you mix them, hmmmmmmmmm not such a good fragance.&lt;br /&gt;Oui! Eau Savage? C&#x27;est bon</li>
    <li> Eau Sauvage By Christian Dior For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 6.7 Oz / 200 Ml.- The product is just the same as it was described, and was original.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time favorite of mine.  Tried others but find many smell like soap to me and then return to Eau Sauvage.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, gone by noon. Less earthy and masculine than the last bottle I purchased ~20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Still a classic rebuttal to the overpowering scents popular today.</li>

    <li> Very short lasting and seems watered down, not worth eighty bucks.</li>
    <li> Incredible. I am in love with both my husband, and with this cologne. This is it, from now on!</li>
    <li> It was a fail. One bottle was dripping, so I can&#x27;t use it as a gift. Even the box was wet</li>
    <li> Fresh, lemony, just out of the shower classic scent.  Manly in a clean, crisp way - not heavy or musky.</li>
    <li> I like the item and would recommend it to all my friends! it was exactly what I wanted and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is a men&#x27;s scent by Dior that I have liked for many years and has been hard to find most recently.  I have tried other citrus based men&#x27;s colognes but none have the long lasting staying power as Eau Sauvage spray.  I highly recommend it for wear at anytime.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> Arrived within the time frame provided. This was meant to be a gift for Father&#x27;s Day. My dad loved it. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The very best.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I have worn Eau Sauvage since high school and it is still my favorite summer scent, hands down. Definitely unisex.</li>
    <li> Fantastic classic scent!</li>
    <li> This is Eau Sauvage passed by who knows what, and not at all the Real Thing. Has the original formula been changed, has it been adulterated by unscrupulous people? Who knows. All I know is that it was a terrible let down.</li>
    <li> This was my absolute favorite men&#x27;s cologne in the 60&#x27;s when I was a teenager.  I boy I dated always wore it and it drove me crazy!  Over the years I had forgotten about it so recently when I was looking for something different for my husband I came across this classic and timeless scent and purchased it for him.  I was a bit disappointed when I smelled it.  It&#x27;s not quite what I remembered.  Of course, it might just be that my sense of smell has changed over the last 40 years but it does seem slightly more herbal than I remember.  It still has that clean, fresh, citrusy fragrance but it&#x27;s toned down slightly by the herbal notes in it.  I still like it, just not as much as I used to.</li>
    <li> There a a few things that everyman must experience...... This is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrusy, light, and sensual.... just like me!!!!!  Hard to find but worth the search!  Buy the biggest bottle you can....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And stay away from the &amp;#34;Eau Sauvage Extreme&amp;#34;..... the scent is very different!!!!</li>
    <li> I have previously used Eau Sauvage.  The scent here does closely resemble my past experience.  However, it is much lighter and does not last very long (as others have noted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered directly from Amazon as the seller.  Unfortunately, my unit was delivered in a rather damaged Dior box w/ the plastic wrapping already pealed open.  I was not too pleased with that.  And furthermore, due to some Amazon policy, it cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy w/ this order</li>
    <li> I like it. It is so refreshing with good smell. it was inexpensive to me. remind me my father in the past.</li>
    <li> Returned product. Advertised as 6.7 oz. Received 3.1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Contaced merchant who said I could return for credit, which I did. No offer to fullfil as stated. Still waiting for credit to appear on my next credit card statement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Eau Sauvage By Christian Dior For Men for a long time and I still love it. Delivery is quick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This has been my husband&#x27;s favorite for years.  I try to keep him stocked up, since it&#x27;s sort of hard to find. It smells very nice when he wears it.</li>
    <li> fresh scent, using it for many years.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 25 years; it&#x27;s light and refreshing</li>
    <li> Had my first bottle of this magnificent fragrance 30+ years ago,and it&#x27;s still a world beater.&lt;br /&gt;I generally buy the better end,eg Guerlain,Sisley etc,and consider this Dior product,right up there&lt;br /&gt;with the best.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favour!!!!</li>
    <li> it covered my expectations&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d really suggest as a personal gift to someone special&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great product to give for someone great</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a last minute father&#x27;s day gift for my dad.  He loves the fresh smell and I got the item with one day shipping.  I would definitely buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> the price is bit too high</li>
    <li> Always the favorite of my husband.</li>
    <li> This one is the real thing. I was using this in 60s and 70s. I purchased one bottle fearing it would be not the same. But, this is the real thing and everybody around me finds this scent very refreshing and attractive !!</li>
