### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Tastes great too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best lip exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>am very happy with the product &amp;</li>
      <li>I had heard that this product smelled very good and was very effective.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>They have to work and they need to be pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>I had purchased a MAC lipstick in a bright orange color which was also MATTE.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros. Smells good and does soften eventually good price</li>
      <li>This product is great for convenience if you don&#x27;t want to make your own scrub.</li>
      <li>It may make your lips feel good if you can stand the feel of it, not for me.</li>
      <li>Definitely as good as the $25 products in the dept stores.</li>
      <li>good for price</li>
      <li>have to say that the softlips lip polish is quite good at fixing my dry-lip problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a good option.</li>
      <li>Love this product and wish I could find it in stores!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
      <li>I was worried that something this cheap would ineffective but it works great.</li>
      <li>This lip polish has a nice sugary scent that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The balm itself is nice but it does not exfoliate well.</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t too abrasive and it is nice because you can keep it in your purse.</li>
      <li>it does what it says and is a nice product.</li>
      <li>A toothbrush would work more effectively and more rapidly.</li>
      <li>I would say this is not my favorite lip scrub, but my favorite lip scrub costs over $20.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>but i love coconut so over all i am satisfied</li>
      <li>But hey, thats the way love goes.</li>
      <li>it actually works really good, though!!</li>
      <li>I loooove lip scrubs they are one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of flaky, chapped lips and leaves them smooth!</li>
      <li>But otherwise works ok.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this since I love SoftLips products.</li>
      <li>It is organic which is good (no weird stuff being ingested accidentally).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind softlips products they&#x27;re pretty good and get the job done, however this product works</li>
      <li>I have a HUGE problem with chapped lips-</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product as it moisturizes as it exfoliates.</li>
      <li>- Cheap  </li>
      <li>but if your looking for a better one I would get the fresh scrub from sephora..</li>
      <li>Quick and simple and smells good too</li>
      <li>If your lip problems are more severe, a different and stronger product would be better.</li>
      <li>Pros:  - Works pretty well at lightly exfoliating lips  </li>
      <li>And that is exactly what it did!</li>
      <li>Lip scrub was ok but would prefer if it had more moisture, its kind of thick to apply to the lips as a scrub!  </li>
      <li>Comparatively speaking, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and is effective for minor dryness on lips.</li>
      <li>When purchasing products like this one, I prefer that they do not have harsh chemicals, ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce (lol), or anything else that I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable ingesting or absorbing through my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice texture but doesnt take off dead skin well like most exfolients</li>
      <li>- Convenient/small  - Since you want to lightly scrub your lips with something like this, these types of products are for regular use.. it won&#x27;t work magic the first time, but does work well.</li>
      <li>if I use it right.</li>
      <li>If u are looking for a gentle lip scrub that is formulated without strange sounding chemicals that smells good and works.</li>
      <li>My dry lips now look nice.    </li>
      <li>A good buy if you sometimes find yourself with slight chapped lips.</li>
      <li>Also a good thing to use in the morning to get rid of any dry skin you may have on your lips and to make them smooth for the approaching day.    </li>
      <li>It is also pretty affordable as lip scrubs go.</li>
      <li>this product works very good to help eliminate that feeling, it is rough due to the sugar crystals inside.</li>
      <li>Now that we&#x27;ve covered that small problem let&#x27;s get to the good things about it.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>One problem is you either get too much sugar or none at all.</li>
      <li>Cons:  - Doesn&#x27;t really smell (could be a pro or con)  </li>
      <li>It does not exfoliate as much as I would want it to.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Although these kinds of scrubs can be easily made with basic products you have in your kitchen, I wanted to try a ready made one with a few extra good ingredients that I don&#x27;t exactly have on hand.    </li>
      <li>I think that I probably have to rub it in quite a bit more than some other lip polishes (hense the four stars) but</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers I think this would only be good for upkeep of smooth lips, since there is not much grit to the scrub.</li>
      <li>So, if you are on a budget, and your lips are already in decent shape</li>
      <li>It smells decent, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>The scent is sweet with only a light touch of coconut and does not last long.</li>
      <li>I was beginning to feel the raw lips of winter kick in and knew I needed more than just a lip balm.  </li>
      <li>It also has a subtle but nice smell and taste.</li>
      <li>Leaves lips exfoliated and very soft.  </li>
      <li>Now when I get chapped lips that my lip balm can&#x27;t heal, I use Softlips Lip Polish and it sloughs off all of the dead skin and leaves my lips smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>It is gentle enough and keeps lips soft.</li>
      <li>The polish is not harsh.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a natural product and this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>My lips were so soft and the lipstick glided on like a dream.</li>
      <li>good product hardens somewhat difficult to apply</li>
      <li>I found that it did not have much of a scent and also did not take off much of the dead skin off of my lips.</li>
      <li>its one of those gritty things that you put on them wipe off to reveal soft lips.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s one the little things in life that really bothers me!</li>

<li> i found recently that during the winter my lips tend to get a dry layer that makes them feel plasticy.</li>
<li> No cracking, but definite dry skin which needs to be removed.   </li>
<li> Again, my lips aren&#x27;t overly dry, just winter dry.</li>
<li> They have been getting dry.</li>
<li> I do think that the sugar granules melt a away a bit as you use it, but that is what one would expect from sugar that gets wet.</li>
<li> It took off all of the dead skin and totally moisturized my lips.</li>
<li> The coconut in it goes on rough</li>
<li> I tried the Softlips Pure Organic Coconut and Sugar Lip Polish because I needed something that was going to do some serious lip healing!</li>
<li> Who wants an all natural product that is ineffective or smells/tastes bad?  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small container but has lasted a long time.</li>
<li> Use this product at least 3X a day for as long as you need.</li>
<li> But that seems to be one of the few problems.</li>
<li> For some reason, this winter had been particularly harsh on my lips.</li>
<li> Bought as a gift for someone who was having some trouble with their lips.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t help with severely chapped lips but does help when you have just a bit of dead skin on your lips.    </li>
<li> i suppose because again, it isn&#x27;t harsh on my lips.</li>
<li> Rather small package</li>
<li> I get really dry lips to the point where I can have hard callous-like skin on my lips which is not only ugly to look at, but can be painful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> after reading this review, you will notice that i am pretty stupid!</li>
<li> But even products that don&#x27;t have the questionable ingredients have to work.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought as a gift for someone who was having some trouble with their lips. It helped them a lot and they use it as needed. it does what it says and is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves lips exfoliated and very soft.  I have been looking for a natural product and this does the trick.  Tastes great too!</li>
    <li> Pros:  - Works pretty well at lightly exfoliating lips  - Cheap  - Convenient/small  - Since you want to lightly scrub your lips with something like this, these types of products are for regular use.. it won&#x27;t work magic the first time, but does work well. My dry lips now look nice.    Cons:  - Doesn&#x27;t really smell (could be a pro or con)  - Tastes a bit gross if you get it in your mouth  - Rather small package</li>
    <li> I loooove lip scrubs they are one of my favorite products. This one isn&#x27;t too abrasive and it is nice because you can keep it in your purse. Like other reviewers I think this would only be good for upkeep of smooth lips, since there is not much grit to the scrub. It is also pretty affordable as lip scrubs go. The scent is sweet with only a light touch of coconut and does not last long. I would say this is not my favorite lip scrub, but my favorite lip scrub costs over $20. So, if you are on a budget, and your lips are already in decent shape this is a good option.</li>
    <li> i bought this product despite of reading the reviews of how it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate enough and now that I received it, I have to agree with the others. It does not exfoliate as much as I would want it to. I would have to be exfoliating for about ten minutes to get the results I want. A toothbrush would work more effectively and more rapidly. However, I do like the softness of my lips after I use it. The balm itself is nice but it does not exfoliate well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best lip exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used. You could probably achieve the same effect with baking soda and Vaseline. It smells decent, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again. But hey, thats the way love goes.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this since I love SoftLips products. I had heard that this product smelled very good and was very effective. I was disappointed. I found that it did not have much of a scent and also did not take off much of the dead skin off of my lips. To me, it would have been just as affective to use a home-made scrub with sugar and honey or something of the sort.</li>
    <li> after reading this review, you will notice that i am pretty stupid! haha well when i purchased this, i bought it thinking it was a lip balm type thing. turns out when i got it, its actually a polish. its one of those gritty things that you put on them wipe off to reveal soft lips. it actually works really good, though!! so i still use it every morning when i do my makeup!! haha im so stupid!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am a fan of this product... if I use it right. One problem is you either get too much sugar or none at all. But that seems to be one of the few problems. It doesn&#x27;t help with severely chapped lips but does help when you have just a bit of dead skin on your lips.    Now that we&#x27;ve covered that small problem let&#x27;s get to the good things about it. It is organic which is good (no weird stuff being ingested accidentally). It also has a subtle but nice smell and taste. Also a good thing to use in the morning to get rid of any dry skin you may have on your lips and to make them smooth for the approaching day.    A good buy if you sometimes find yourself with slight chapped lips. If your lip problems are more severe, a different and stronger product would be better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind softlips products they&#x27;re pretty good and get the job done, however this product works I guess, I would just recommend a simple chap stick you&#x27;d get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have a HUGE problem with chapped lips- it&#x27;s one the little things in life that really bothers me! I keep lip balm everywhere- by my bed, in my purse, in the car. I literally have it everywhere. But, sometimes lip balm isn&#x27;t enough. I tried the Softlips Pure Organic Coconut and Sugar Lip Polish because I needed something that was going to do some serious lip healing! And that is exactly what it did! It took off all of the dead skin and totally moisturized my lips. My boyfriend even noticed the difference! Now when I get chapped lips that my lip balm can&#x27;t heal, I use Softlips Lip Polish and it sloughs off all of the dead skin and leaves my lips smooth and soft! I am in love with this product! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> good product hardens somewhat difficult to apply</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice texture but doesnt take off dead skin well like most exfolients but i love coconut so over all i am satisfied</li>
    <li> I tell you no lie. I had purchased a MAC lipstick in a bright orange color which was also MATTE. Without a thought, I tried to wear it without exfoliating or even hydrating my lips LOL. BIG MISTAKE! I looked like a dang on clown with crackly patchy lips. I instantly remembered that I had bought this lip scrub, I found it, slathered it on my lips, gently massaged it in with my finger and the dead skin immediately began to peel off. I let it sit for about a minute or two and then wiped it off with a paper towel. My lips were so soft and the lipstick glided on like a dream. This product is great for convenience if you don&#x27;t want to make your own scrub.</li>
    <li> Lip scrub was ok but would prefer if it had more moisture, its kind of thick to apply to the lips as a scrub!  But otherwise works ok.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this winter had been particularly harsh on my lips. They have been getting dry. No cracking, but definite dry skin which needs to be removed.   Although these kinds of scrubs can be easily made with basic products you have in your kitchen, I wanted to try a ready made one with a few extra good ingredients that I don&#x27;t exactly have on hand.    When purchasing products like this one, I prefer that they do not have harsh chemicals, ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce (lol), or anything else that I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable ingesting or absorbing through my skin. But even products that don&#x27;t have the questionable ingredients have to work. They have to work and they need to be pleasant to use. Who wants an all natural product that is ineffective or smells/tastes bad?  Not me...  This lip polish has a nice sugary scent that is not overpowering. The taste is very similar. The polish is not harsh. When I put it on, I rub it in a bit in a circular motion. I think that I probably have to rub it in quite a bit more than some other lip polishes (hense the four stars) but that&#x27;s ok i suppose because again, it isn&#x27;t harsh on my lips. I do think that the sugar granules melt a away a bit as you use it, but that is what one would expect from sugar that gets wet. It works well at the beginning of the day to scrub off dry/dead skin from my lips, seems to last through the day. I then follow up with lip balm.   Again, my lips aren&#x27;t overly dry, just winter dry. If u are looking for a gentle lip scrub that is formulated without strange sounding chemicals that smells good and works. Try this one. Comparatively speaking, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and is effective for minor dryness on lips.</li>
    <li> I get really dry lips to the point where I can have hard callous-like skin on my lips which is not only ugly to look at, but can be painful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the softlips lip polish is quite good at fixing my dry-lip problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips are definitely softer &amp; I don&#x27;t get the callous/hard skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has made a big difference as I am able to wear lipsticks now and it doesn&#x27;t look weird on my lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product &amp; it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> Cons...you have to scrub for a while..good for price but if your looking for a better one I would get the fresh scrub from sephora..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros. Smells good and does soften eventually good price</li>
    <li> I was worried that something this cheap would ineffective but it works great. It&#x27;s a small container but has lasted a long time. It is gentle enough and keeps lips soft. Definitely as good as the $25 products in the dept stores.</li>
    <li> Love this product and wish I could find it in stores! Gets rid of flaky, chapped lips and leaves them smooth! Quick and simple and smells good too</li>
    <li> i found recently that during the winter my lips tend to get a dry layer that makes them feel plasticy. this product works very good to help eliminate that feeling, it is rough due to the sugar crystals inside. Use this product at least 3X a day for as long as you need.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this lip care product. The coconut in it goes on rough and I hated the way it felt going on. It may make your lips feel good if you can stand the feel of it, not for me.</li>
    <li> I was beginning to feel the raw lips of winter kick in and knew I needed more than just a lip balm.  This is a fantastic product as it moisturizes as it exfoliates.</li>
