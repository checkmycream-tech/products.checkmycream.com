<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this scent of this! so wonderful. i used the serum a lot. the shampoo and condition do not lather as much as like but leave my hair very good smelling.</li>
    <li> Our hairdresser has introduced us to the Marrakesh Argan Oil, and we both love it.  This was an economic way to try the shampoo and conditioner, PLUS receive the Argan Oil and Leave In Conditioner.  The price of the Argan Oil and Leave In Conditioner are more cost effective here on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and this stuff is fantastic.  I can comb it, dry it straight.. it smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 2 and 1/2 and i have been searching for a hair care product for her for the past year.  She&#x27;s biracial and her hair is unmanageable at best.  This product smells amazing and it makes it so much easier to comb out her hair, she still hates every moment of it, but it takes way less time.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with a mixed child that has the tight curls.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products, and they smell wonderful too. They&#x27;re hard to find, so I&#x27;ll definately be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was very thin and difficult to lather.  The conditioner, on the other hand, is so thick that I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle, even with the top off.  I had to add water.  After using shampoo, conditioner, oil and leave-in, my hair did not benefit at all.  I trusted it to work and went to work, as usual with damp hair.  Mid morning, I had the frizzy hair as bad as ever.  So disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Let me say I have long very very straight hair.  The conditioners from Earthly Body are superb.  My hair is shiny without looking oily or plastic.  I have movement in my hair.  It easily detangles my hair.  My hair stays really soft for several days even if I don&#x27;t wash it.  It smells nice - original is spicy and exotic and strong - dreamsicle is a lighter scent that smells like orange creamsicles - high tide smells tropical.  I ordered all three scents to match my moods.  I will say the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work super well on my hair, I have to use a lot and it doesn&#x27;t want to lather up.  I will continue to use the conditioning and stying products daily.  I can even get my hubby to use dreamsicle leave in on his hair.  All in all I love these products!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this shampoo and conditioner because my hair and scalp were in terrible condition.  My hair was falling out and my scalp was itchy all the time.  After using this pruduct for the first time I noticed an improvement immediatley! Now it has been a month and my hair looks and feels wonderful....not to mention the smell! The smell is fabulous! My hair doesnt fall out as much and is much more manageable and soft too.  My hair color lasts longer and my hair stays shiney.  I am so addicted and cant/will not go without!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product I ordered is not what was shipped.  All 4 of the products are different than what is pictured.  They smell similar and appear to be similar to the Marrakesh product that is shown and that I have used before.  I am sad it was not the exact same as that is what I was looking for and thought I had purchased.  Had I known it would be different, I would have purchased the product I was looking for somewhere else. The shampoo and conditioner do not have the pumps that are pictured either :(  Hopefully It works similarly to what I have used before.</li>
    <li> I just got these today and I am returning them, do not like the smell of these products! They smell like a mix between medicine and an earthy product hippies would use. They need to take a note from suave. Now their morrocan oil hair products smell wonderful! being a gir your hair products have to smell good AND work. These stink!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve loved the Marrakech oil forever and I bought this set because I wanted to try the shampoo as well. I do love all the products in this set BUT the writing on the shampoo and conditioner bottles is almost off, it doesn&#x27;t come as showed in the pic with an actual paper label over the front. It&#x27;s just like letters stuck on the bottles. I can barely tell which is which now and so that&#x27;s kind of frustrating.</li>
    <li> Reading through the reviews for this product I was struck by people who said it smelled great, but not specifically what it smells like, which is a hazard of ordering online. One woman&#x27;s Strawberry Bliss is another woman&#x27;s Toxic Berry Hell. \\&quot;Spicy exotic\\&quot; sounded good, and it is accurate. The scent reminds me of hazelnuts, incense, spice cookies, and amber. It smells like Morocco in the best possible way, without being overpowering.     The pump bottle isn&#x27;t particularly generous with the product- I have long hair, so I immediately noticed that. Also- if you&#x27;re really sensitive to gluten, hydrolyzed wheat protein is an ingredient. Still 5 stars. The day after I used this for the first time, the receptionist at the doctor&#x27;s office asked if I had colored my hair, and the lady at the manicure place asked, \\&quot;Is that all YOUR hair?\\&quot; I had a ton of shine and volume, everything was moisturized, and I am pretty much a convert for life.</li>
    <li> Marrakesh products make your hair look great!  I have thick straight hair and my daughter has thick curly hair.  These products work for both of us. Our hair is shiny, smooth and healthy without being greasy or flat.  My daughter uses the X-Detangler when she is at the beach and it keeps her hair in great shape despite wind, sun and salt.  We also love the smell!</li>
    <li> Love these products.  Will be trying the hand and body lotion next and the Miracle Oil, too.  The original scent reminds me of Tahitian Vanilla.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I LOVE these products!  Couldn&#x27;t live with out the oil and leave on conditioner.  They are NOT greasy and make my hair feel and look amazing. I color my hair and blow dry daily, you would never be able to tell, my hair is shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Best product kit for the value! My hair is really dry I found by accident that sulfates have been the culprit! I&#x27;ve tried 4 other non sulfate shampoo and this is by far the best. Been using it for months and my hair dresser said your hair is so healthy what are you doing? I told him and the next time he saw me he said I&#x27;m convinced and is stocking it. Don&#x27;t expect a lather it does not but your hair is still clean. Conditioner is great. My hair is slightly wavy baby fine but I have a lot of it and its long colorred and high lighted. Shine now is amazing. Give it time because despite what people say hair is dead and does not transform over night. The detangler spray is great and I use the oil dry. Seller can&#x27;t be more on top of things because I get these products so quickly! Oh and the frizzy hair complex is gone! I do help it along here in Florida with Avons new Lotus anti frizz product! Works better than the keritan products.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  Originally bought this set because my boyfriend wanted the Endz for his beard, but I wanted to try some of their other products.  Really glad I tried this set.</li>
    <li> If you are very sensitive to string perfumes this is not for you. Aroma/smell is pleasant, but too strong for me.  Too bad, because I&#x27;ve heard good things about the shampoo. Will give it to my sister and see how she likes it!</li>
    <li> Treats the hair gently and gives it a nice sheen.  The combination of the argon oil and hemp is wonderful</li>
    <li> Gave for gift for Christmas to my cousin,  who has hair that is hard to control and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Good product! I just don&#x27;t like the smell, to strong.. Shampoo+balm+cream .. Too much the same smell! But quality so good, make my hair silky and super shiny !!! Even so damage hair will be repared !!! Don&#x27;t believe , try!!!;)</li>
    <li> I read reviews on these products and decided to order them, and finally I didnt like them at all. It makes my hair frizzy and dry. Also I dont really like the smell of it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. Moreover, each of the product is not sealed, so maybe this is the reason and its not original ones, I dont know..</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great, but I don&#x27;t know that they did all that much for my hair... even with the leave-in oil and detangler, it still seemed pretty dull. I think I would buy the detangler again... the jury&#x27;s still out on the shampoo/conditioner combo!</li>
    <li> All the products in this set makes your hair feel silky smooth.  The scent is like no other I have ever used before. I like the fact that this set has a many products to try before buying a bigger bottle of one thing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself. Even though it makes a great gift, I needed travel sizes because my hair just LOVES these products! Amazon has the best prices, I did my research.</li>
    <li> EARTHLY BODY Marrakesh Argan Oil Gift Bag Set arrived on time.  I have been using the Hair Elixir for about 6 months and really like it.  I have fine, blonde hair.  The elixir leaves my hair silky and shiny with fewer dry ends.  Used as directed, it does NOT leave your hair feeling or looking oily.  The addition of the Shampoo, Conditioner, and the leave-in Treatment are great enhancements.  Sold as a set, the price is a bargain.</li>
    <li> Im sorry but wow the smell... omg I couldnt get it off. It reminded me of to much aftershave on a hormonal teen... is this stuff for men? I was looking for the delicious smell of moroccan oil products for a cheaper price serves me right..</li>
    <li> I have very, very fine curly hair 3A for those who belong to Naturally Curly.com.  I got highlights which I love but alas, my ends and one patch in the front are a bit fried (look OK curly but not straight) and its looked dry.  When I air dry curly on a dry day, my hair looks as healthy as it ever has but when I blow dry it there is still some frizz and when I air dry it and it&#x27;s humid it looks like a slightly frizzy &#x27;fro - it&#x27;s NEVER been that curly before. It looked like a little fro bob.  I think I like curly ahoulder length frizz better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to add that it may be the detangler my hair doesn&#x27;t like - the day it looked great I didn&#x27;t use that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hate the smell.  Like others have said, it smells like hippy. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a hippy.</li>
    <li> I tried so many product for my hair,but with Marakkesh product specialy oil I&#x27;m more than happy it&#x27;s gave me very nice hair style after shower.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner - I&#x27;d give this review a 5 if only on them. They smell wonderful and I literally got comments on how good I smelled at work, just from the smampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Agran Oil in this set, sucks. It makes hair look greasy and it leaks EVERYWHERE. It got all over the other bottles in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the brand, just not this set or the oil!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products in the past.  I am always willing to try out something new and when I stumbled upon the Marrakesh line, I was quite impressed.  It received good reviews and I thought I really had to try it for myself.  I have naturally curly hair which has its own mind in this hot and humid summer weather.  I desperately needed something to tame the frizz and I think this might do the trick.  The smell of the product is wonderful - I love it.  I am hopeful of some Marrakesh skin products such as moisturizers, hand creams and exfoliating treatments. Since I have only recently started using the product, I cannot give it five stars yet.</li>
    <li> I have used many different hair products. My hair is waist long, wavy, fine but a lot of it. I purchased this and had it shipped directly to Hawaii to my families home so I would not need to pack my own. This set had everything I needed, but was a brand unknown to me. I spent 5+ hours snorkeling yesterday and my hair was one huge rats nest. I had only used this product once, the day before. When I got back to the house hours later it took me very little time to get all the knots out. After washing my hair and conditioning using this product my hair was so soft and easily combed out. I will be purchasing more of this product for my house and throwing away all of my other Argan oil products. This one is by far a more superior product.</li>
    <li> my daughter liked it. her hairs look more shine and more healthy, will buy more in the future. thank You.</li>
    <li> Great products and the smell is heavenly! I&#x27;d been using the Marrakesh Argan Oil for several years as a hair treatment after before and after blow drying.  I&#x27;d never tried the shampoo and condition until now.  Both are really nice..and the set was a good price.</li>
    <li> The bag contains shampoo, conditioner, detangler, and styling serum. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this line because I love almost everything about it. (I say \\&quot;almost\\&quot; only because I have very long, thick, curly hair so an 8oz bottle of shampoo &amp; an 8oz bottle of conditioner doesn&#x27;t last me very long.) That criticism aside, everything in the bag is useful and actually works. I have tried countless expensive shampoos &amp; conditioners to tame my frizz-prone hair and finally I&#x27;ve found something that not only tames the frizz, but also gives my curls luster and bounce. Needless to say, I will never again use any hair products but these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the scent of the shampoo and conditioner... WOW!! You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it and I big-time love it!! As the name implies, the aroma is very rich, spicy, and Middle Eastern. I find myself smelling my hair off and on throughout the day because the scent is sexy and delicious at the same time. 100 stars!!</li>
    <li> I cannot rave about this stuff enough. Previously I dyed my hair blonde, which made it orange, so I dyed it blonde again the next day. That didn&#x27;t work so I dyed it a Fire Engine Red, that faded within a couple days, so I dyed it a more auburn color a couple days later, that faded within a few weeks so I dyed it back to my original color. This, as you can imagine, resulted in irreparable damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this moronic fiasco my hair wasn&#x27;t the healthiest, but it was pretty manageable, and had some shine. But after the onslaught of bleaches and dyes it was so far beyond manageable, I either had to cut it off or hide it in buns and pony tales. Which I did for quite awhile while I slowly tried to repair it with a multitude of serums and deep conditionings. But nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this since I currently use argan oil on my hair, which I really love and does quite a nice job protecting and giving shine to my hair. I was really looking for any type of shampoo/condition/treatment with a fair amount of argan oil. Well this stuff far exceeded my expectations. My hair feels and shines just like it used to, if not better. Only after a weeks worth of washes. It&#x27;s soft, manageable, shiny, and I don&#x27;t feel guilty putting heat on it because I know it&#x27;s protected. AND this stuff is a bundle, I&#x27;ve spent far more just one one product that didn&#x27;t do half the job this stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given, I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, it&#x27;s too... \\&quot;Hippie\\&quot; smelling for me for a lack of a better description. I think I will try the more fruit smelling one once this runs out. Also, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the shampoo. I realize it&#x27;s sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t foam when you wash it, but I was expecting a little bit of suds or something. Nothing. So I don&#x27;t use it. But when I did use it I did notice it gave my hair more... oil and weigh down. Not in a bad way that it&#x27;s greasy or significant weigh down or anything, it&#x27;s just heavier and a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Totally repaired my hair!  Love the scent too.  Leaves my hair very soft, shiny, and smooth.  Also seems to protect my color.</li>
    <li> Great stuff its the only product that keeps my hair from getting bone dry love it.</li>
    <li> I love the oil and spray on conditioner, but the shampoo does not lather well and the bottle conditioner takes a lot but work ok. The shampoo smells like bug spray. I would buy the oil cause it does work really well on my frizzy hair and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad</li>
    <li> Love this product. I get compliments all the time on how amazing my hair smells. Only complaint is the cost.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair. Oil is great for my hair to keep frizz out, smells good too. But the shampoo (i know it&#x27;s sulfate free but it doesn&#x27;t bubble and foam when I wash so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am getting anywhere) Also my hair can get naughted and the conditionder doesn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;d like it too... will be a buyer of oil seperately, not shampoos</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much! For one, like everyone else says, it smells amazing. A sweet spicy smell, some of the products smell a little more earthy and spicy than sweet.&lt;br /&gt;-The shampoo and conditioner are light, I don&#x27;t see how others found the conditioner &amp;#34;too thick/sticky&amp;#34;.  The shampoo is very light, there is no lather but it seems to clean very well (no greasy residue left behind). Both are very hydrating, which I found surprising since they were so light.&lt;br /&gt;-All three leave in products smell amazing, they are a much more concentrated version of the shampoo/conditioner. All three are extra hydrating, I had no issue detangling the damaged/fried ends of my hair. My ends also feel hydrated and silky. A little goes a long way with the leave in products. (I learned this when I put too much, that you don&#x27;t need much for it to feel silky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have thick coarse hair, some is healthy and some is dry/damaged. Usually my hair ends up wavey and poofy after a blow dry, but this made my hair rather straight (which I was happy about!) The only thing I did notice was my already thick/coarse hair had a lot of volume. My hair looks and feels extra thick!</li>
    <li> Love this love this love this... Smells so good...makes a great gift.best stuff out there for curly hair. Will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and silky. Cannot do without the styling elixir!  Love the smell and shine it gives to my hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells great, lightweight, amazing stuff! The oil is my favorite! It smoothed my hair and made it shiny without weighing it down or making it greasy!</li>
    <li> Great product!! My hair dye has lasted longer than ever, my hair always feels and smells wonderful, and I only have to wash my hair every 3 days or so. The leave in conditioner is a must product!  My hair has less frizz and has a salon-look even when air-dried :-) Tip: make sure you thoroughly wash out the shampoo and conditioner when washing your hair so it doesn&#x27;t over grease.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my package, but when I opened it,  I noticed the containers looked used and old. The lettering on the containers was nearly non existent. I&#x27;m not sure if the product in the containers is actually what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love Marrakesh products. I have ordered 3 sets from here, but the last set had the lids taped on the shampoo and conditioner and they still leaked. Some of the labels were worn off. Not a very attractive set.</li>
    <li> This whole line is really fabulous! I was hesitant to buy after reading some reviews that said the smell was bad, but they could not be more wrong! This stuff smells like french toast to me...a cinnamon maple smell, and every time I swing my hair and catch a whiff of it, I have to smile. It still smells great even after I take my hair down after yoga class. My boyfriend loves it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have started using this line, I have noticed that my hair is not breaking nearly as often, and my horrendous split ends are practically gone! The only downside I have noticed is that the shampoo does not lather very well, so you have to wash your hair twice to get it really clean (I think this is probably because of the lack of sulfates, which is a good thing). Every few days I use a different shampoo just to make sure my hair is clean. However, these products do not weigh my fine hair down, no matter how much of the product I use, and it tames fly-aways and frizz better than any salon product I have tried. I&#x27;m really very happy with the results, the scent, and the service.</li>
    <li> These products have made my hair so much healthier.  I will always use these products!  Very reasonably priced and worth it.</li>
    <li> This Marrakesh Argan oil shampoo and conditioner does not agree with my type of hair. I thought I would try it, but now it will sit in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> ...The fragrance! Others have commented on the fragrance as well. It&#x27;s nice, but WAY too strong initially (when first opened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, good product and nice results for sure! For this alone, I would give five stars. But the pleasant scent is about 400% too strong, not a BAD scent, but overpowering when bottles are first used. I kept the caps off of both the shampoo and conditioner for several days; this helped a lot.</li>
    <li> First off, the smell of this stuff is amazing. I think the other reviewers describe it way better than I could so I wont...it&#x27;s just yummy, ok? The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is more of a serum....I really like that, and buy that on its own. Its great to put in your hair after using a flat iron...it smooths and shines, and smells so good. The shampoo I didnt really like, it doesnt lather at all (probably because its natural) and I absolutely HATE the bottles the shampoo and conditioner come in....the bottles I got, had no pumps like the picture, just the pop open cap...and you have to squeeze really hard to get the stuff out. I don&#x27;t think those brittle hard plastic bottles are made for squeezing :) The conditioner, and &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; hair treatment are pretty nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, everything was great, except the shampoo/conditioner bottles and non-lathery shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Earthly Body Marrakech argon oil for 2 years now.  I started using it because I hated how hair products felt in my hair.  Either my hair felt oily , stiff, crunchy , or just limp depending on what I tried .  Finally someone told me about this product.  I did some research on it and I liked what I read... So I ordered a bottle of the oil.  LOVED IT!!!!!  So having said this I must admit I have not used the shampoo or conditioner but I have ordered this gift pack twice now as gifts and the people have loved the products.  I was asked where I found it as they wanted more!!  It comes in a pretty fine mesh see through bag with draw sting and makes a lovely gift.  And did I mention that the smell of these products are DIVINE!!!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp &amp; have been looking for a product that didn&#x27;t cause sores on my scalp. This product was recommended from my stylist and it has definitely worked great!  Leaves hair feeling clean,soft &amp; smelling fabulous!  Fast shipping &amp; packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Love the product. A little pricey for how much you get. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff so does my 82 year old grandma. I had to buy more of it as this gift set is small bottles and only a 4 piece. very nice starter set but deffinitly only enough for one person and the person should have short hair not long hair like mine ...if you have long hair I would highly recommend purchasing the bigger bottles of the shampoo and conditioner. I get allot of complements on the smoothness and smell of my hair by using these products. I was first introduced to the oil for the hair two years ago at a salon and just that tiny 4oz bottle of hair oil cost me 25.00 however it did last a year.  it takes very little product of this high quality excellent smelling earthly Marrakesh argon oils products to use in your hair... very lovely set.</li>
    <li> Wanted a different scent. Bought wrong scent</li>
    <li> My local beauty supply store recommended the Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner since my biggest complaint was frizz. (I use the flat iron too many times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use the shampoo and conditioner, and then dry my hair, and then use the flat iron, it looks awesome! If I let my hair air dry, it looks not so awesome, but I am guessing they make another product that will help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is YUMMY! I LOVE IT!! I was at a bar last night and a friend leaned in to tell me something and she thought my hair smelled awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $16.99 each, I came here to see if I can find it cheaper but thus far, I have not seen the smoothing S &amp; C.  :(</li>
    <li> Love the way these products.  The detangler mist works great for getting out the snarls and the miracle oil is awesome.  Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair shiney.</li>
    <li> I am using these products for a long time. They are amazing! I can easily see the difference of my hair. And they smell very good!!</li>
    <li> My dry hair is now conditioned and I get more compliments on the smell than I have ever received before!! Very nice products. I will order again!!!</li>
    <li> I have very difficult hair to manage especially on humid days.  These products when used together or alone all work well depending on when they&#x27;re used.  Some are great for washing your hair while others are good for in between.  The price of this gift bag set makes it certainly worth giving them a try.  It&#x27;s a really good deal!</li>
    <li> Whether using all four items or just the oil, this is a great product. The price is right also. Smells nice and works to smooth out my long hair without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start this by saying I have super thick curly/frizzy mess of hair with a real oily scalp that I have no choice but to wash daily due to all the oil. My hair dresser even agrees I have to wash daily even though she wished I could go least every other day. I also have issues finding products for my hair that are parabin/sulfate free products that don&#x27;t give me grease streaks. So this is my xp with my type of hair and scalp. I&#x27;ve used the serum for couple years for when I straighten my hair always loved the smell and I could go 2 days without washing if I used baby powder on my roots next day. For the price I would pay at my salon for just the serum, I found this gift set for only $2 more and got so much more. I figured give it a try. The Brush up spray came with it even though it&#x27;s not listed. Not sure if that was by default or accident. Either way great for me. I did order the Brush Up as an add-on and was glad I did because it has a different spray tip that does more of a mist. Love the smell. Need to bottle for perfume lol. Hair feels clean, shinny and smells great. Only down side is that with my hair if I brush it while it dries it will make me have an afro but that&#x27;s more my hair being a pia. On days I want to go curly I just add a little gel and curles stay fine with it and doesn&#x27;t frizz out. I also made error of frying my ends(grabbed wrong bottle) when straightening my hair and product seams to have helped it some. Still will have to go in and get it trimmed but it&#x27;s not as noticable as what it would have been. All in all love this product</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for your hair! The day after I used the line my hair was softer, silkier, and definitely had more shine. Oh and I&#x27;ll definitely mention it smells great. I am a mixed woman with very fine hair, i can use the serum almost everyday and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like, but that wont stop me from purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Marakesh oil has changed my hair product life! I refuse to use anything besides it now. The smell is an exotic sweet buy spicy scent that I get countless compliments on. Random people in class will tap me on the shoulder to tell me that my hair smells amazing. This is my first time using the shampoo, conditioner, and 10x treatment, but after the first use I fell in love, My hair is super shiny and soft. Since I began using the marakesh oil about 2 years ago i have significantly less breakage. I can go for much longer between haircuts and my stylist takes off far less than she used to have to. Most amazing product. I have been able to grow my hair out faster because it keeps my hair so healthy. Amazing product, I would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> After using regular products all my life I have never seen such a difference with shine, texture and not including how healthy my hair looks and feels. This size works for me for about a month. The key is not to wash daily. I only shampoo my scalp not all the hair, but will rinse through the shampoo. The conditioner and the leave in conditioner is phenomenal. I will continue to buy but now in bulk.</li>
    <li> Great gift pack!  Some very nice products for the price!</li>
    <li> Really love the smell of this stuff but it&#x27;s really nothing special. My hair doesn&#x27;t look shinier or in better condition.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that is easily weighed-down with product, and I started using the leave-in conditioner which smells amazing!  I bought this gift bag set to try out their other products and I am never going back!  What a great set, seriously!  It really does make a great gift.  I spent $15 on just the leave-in from my hairstylist, so this is definitely a steal at $25 for the same size leave-in, and it&#x27;s a great set to travel with too!</li>
    <li> I just received this today, and was so excited to try it after reading all of the reviews. It surpassed my expectations!! It&#x27;s smells amazing, and since I have reallllly long stick straight colored blonde hair my hair looks a little frizzy after blow drying and gets really tangled very easily. I used the detangler and i combed through my hair like it was butter. And the argan oil made my hair  extremely soft and shiny and have lots of movement.  I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product over and over again!</li>
    <li> Oh my Lord...the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;! It is pleasant, but could be reduced by, I&#x27;m not kidding, at least 75%. It is the strongest/highest amount of fragrance I&#x27;ve ever purchased in a product for personal use. I took the caps off of all the products and left them in the bathroom like that for two days, and it helped.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas once and had to get it again after it was gone. I absolutely love it! It smells great and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived right on time. I used to buy it at the salon and it was expensive so when I saw what a great deal this was I had to buy it! My hair absolutely loves this product and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the first time from my hair dresser and loved it! Then I ran out and spent a few months without it and my hair returned to being dry and frizzy ALL the time especially when I used the flat iron.  The product adds a smooth shine to my hair and makes it so manageable and soft!  It also helps with split ends.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair or hands sticky or greasy if you make sure to use a small amount.  I use two drops of the oil everday, but I can&#x27;t use the shampoo and conditioner everyday or my hair gets too greasy (although i&#x27;m sure its a good leave in treatment when that happens).  I use the detangler when I leave my hair to naturally curl and want to add some shine.  Its been a savior and I&#x27;ve tried a million products.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this set, as I use the Marrakesh KaHm Daily Smoothing Treatment and find it works well.  I also enjoyed the scent of that product, probably because I only need to use a small amount.  However, this stuff was on fragrance overload!  It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell (in fact, I think it is the same scent as the smoothing treatment), it was just WAY too much.  After only one use of shampoo/conditioner, just looking at my bottle of KaHm Smoothing Treatment turns my stomach.  In addition, there was nothing special about what it did to my fine textured, medium thick hair.  It cleaned sufficiently, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem any more moisturized and there was no less frizz than usual...pretty ho-hum results.  If you are sensitive at all to strong fragrances, I would pass on this one!</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t understand the high rating. All of these products make my long, thick hair look greasy. Even using a small amount. And yes, they smell great (and strong) but the second I straighten my hair, even just after shampooing, the burnt nutty flowery scent is just TERRIBLE. It stinks up my hair and my bathroom. I haven&#x27;t used these products in weeks and still every time I use my iron it smells awful.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the oil and of the shampoo/conditioner!  Makes my hair smooth and beautiful!  WIll order this product again!</li>
    <li> I love this product not only is the smell remarkable but my hair is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I loved this product until I went it gluten free.  I can no longer use it.  I get a face and head rash because of my gluten allergy</li>
    <li> I loved the Marrakesh Argan Oil Gift Bag Set. I got it to try out the products to see what I would like. I am not a fan of the earthly body scent and neither was my boyfriend which is why I only gave 4 stars. I doubt I would buy the shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t believe it did much for me. The detangler was great; especially if you like to comb through wet hair. The other two were great for straight hair styles. My hair never looked greasy like I put too much in even on my roots and I use more than they recommend. Now I did only use the argan oil for when I curled my hair (it comes with a card that says the soothing creme one is for straight hair styles) and I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the outcome. I like more body in my hair but I will say it was silky. The only down side was that I live in a rather humid area (Florida) and my curls fell the second I walked out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product for straight hair styles.</li>
    <li> I really like the product but was a little disappointed in the shipping. One bottle must have opened and leaked</li>
    <li> Love this product! Love what it does to my hair and I love the way it makes my hair smell. My hair doesn&#x27;t smell for a little while it smells all the way till the next day when I wash my hair again.  Thank you so much for having this product. My stylist used it on my hair and I was sold. However, can&#x27;t find this in any store where I lived so thankfully I found it here. I will be buying my hair products here for a while.</li>
    <li> I finally found what my hairdresser uses.  Each time I have a haircut she uses these amazing products.  Not only do they smell terrific but the product leaves my curly hair manageable without flattening it out.  I&#x27;d recommend any of the line.</li>
    <li> This product smell great and I used it immediately after receiving, my hair smell terrific</li>
    <li> I love the spicy scent. It starts out really strong but when it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;s just a lingering barely there scent. My favorite product is the Marrakesh X. It detangles wet or dry hair with a very tiny amount and does not weigh down your hair. I have reordered that in the dreamsicle scent for my girls. It&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way :)</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s a good set, but the smell is too strong in my opinion. Shampoo and conditioner are good too, but they are not a miracle.</li>
    <li> I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ON TV AND HAPPEN TO GO OM AMAZON TO SEE IF AMAZON TO SEE IF YOU CARRIED IT AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU DID SO I ORDER IT AND I LIKE IT , I TRY NEW PRODUCTS  THAT I SEE THAT HAVE GOOD RATING AND I CAN COUNT ON AMAZON TO CARRY THEM.</li>
    <li> Love the Shampoo. Only need a TINY bit of the conditioner, this bottle with last me for a yr. I also mix it with my asfter shower/bath lotion and rub on after showering or bathing. I leave the spray on/leave in conditioner on over-night and shampoo in the morning. I actually use the Oil on my face, Basically the same ingredients as in the expensive facial serums. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and wonderful.</li>
    <li> What an awesome product! This is a great way to try out all the products. Smells great! My curly, wavy hair is definitely way more manageable. Will buy again. Definitely recommend. Seller was quick to complete purchase.</li>
    <li> The exlier and leave treatment work amazingly, but not the Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Best way to get into this line. I love everything in here! The oil and leave in conditioner are the best, can&#x27;t live without them</li>
    <li> My husband just loves the smell, and we both have been using the shampoo and conditioner for over six months.  I love the leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Order experience went without a hitch.  I love the oils, but not so thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner.  Glad I ordered this sampler as a trial.  Will get the oils in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this! I noticed some people complained about the hippie scent?...but I love the scent!! There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything too special about the shampoo and conditioner, but the serum and leave in conditioner have really helped to seal my split ends during the day. I will definitely keep using :)</li>
    <li> If you want smooth, silky, great smelling hair, THIS is the product!  Aromatherapy at it&#x27;s finest! Neither the shampoo nor the conditioner makes your hair feel greasy, and I have oily hair! It cleans without stripping your natural oil and contains no sulfates that strip the color from your dyed hair. The elixir is a fantastic smoother, and the leave in treatment and de-tangler is a MUST for those with long hair. This is the BEST product I have used in a long time. I would recommend these great hair care products to anyone!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Marrakesh!</li>
    <li> It is the best  hair product I have ever used.  My hair is baby soft and smells wonderful!  I love it!its roots</li>
    <li> Came on time great price</li>
    <li> Nice. i purchased this at United Beauty Supply for $39.00  I wish i could return  this. Is a much better price.</li>
    <li> Eh. It smells very nice, but it&#x27;s no miracle for my hair, which is not coarse, and is curly, wavy and gets very frizzy without some kind of product to tame it.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Oil for years (&amp; loved it) &amp; after learning of this product line from a coworker I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I tried this! Using these products my hair is easier to style, looks great &amp; smells wonderful. Considering its a better price point, I&#x27;m sold on this line. My hair looks &amp; feels even better than it did w Moroccan Oil. The only reason I am giving four vs five stars is that I have to use a hefty amount of the shampoo &amp; the bottle is small-ish. I have lots of long hair ( not thick but a lot of it). It&#x27;s minor considering the results but worth noting.</li>
    <li> Will definitely purchase it again.  We use to buy just the hair oil, didn&#x27;t know you could get shampoo, etc as well.  Great product and great price</li>
    <li> I love the leavein coditioner but the shapmoo dosent do it for me. So I gave it away to friends.</li>
    <li> Since I started using g I have not been loosing piles of hair in the shower, yes I have noticed stronger hair, silkier, and more manageable, I shared with my sister and she purchased as well after trying for 4 days.  We also like the unique smell, it has.</li>
    <li> I have dry. brittle hair; have had all my life.  I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market and nothing worked well or continually.  My stylist gave me a sample of Marrakesh Oil and I&#x27;ve used it exclusively ever since.  It&#x27;s a miracle product!</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful. Comes with shampoo, conditioner, hair oil, and leave in treatment. Came in 4 days before the arrival date. All in all a great product. You will not regret getting this!</li>
    <li> Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this because I have been using the oil in my hair for over 2yrs and wanted to try the shampoo and conditioner and the leave in conditioner and all have been exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I m completely in love with this product. I have dyed blonde hair and this product keeps my ends looking nice and smooth. I have very normal looking hair. Its straight and long with a normal texture. I have never found such an excellent hair product until now. Thank you Marrakesh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I uave waste length hair and hate to use harsh store products. I was looking for a great nurishing product that made your hair shiney and healthy. This product does all and more.My hair is healthier than it has been in years!</li>
    <li> Because its so good and smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Its the best that I had found for my hair at best price.</li>
    <li> I notice these products coat my hair in some sort of plastic feeling? I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. My hair just feels unnatural after using the marrakesh products. The first time I use them my hair feels ok, but by the 2nd application of any of their products my hair feels coated and weighed down. It&#x27;s no good. It feels like it&#x27;s covered in silicone or something? I&#x27;ve never had this experience. It&#x27;s kind of like when you go swimming too many times and your hair feels gross and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to shampoo a few times over a few days to get the feeling to go away. I won&#x27;t be using this product ever again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful, very light with no heavy feeling.  Using the leave in conditioner makes my hair so soft and the oil adds even more softness and shine.  The smell is divine!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy the shampoo again. Doesn&#x27;t lather. Everything else is wonderful. Love the smell. My hair looks and feels like silk.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products &amp; was first introduced to them by my stylist. I was pleased to be able to order them at a much lower price on Amazon than he sold them for in the salon!</li>
    <li> Great gift. Lets you get multiple products to try for a little price. The only bad part is when your wife loves it then you have to buy the big expensive bottles.</li>
    <li> It is the best oil shampoo/conditioner for my hair.  It leaves it light, shiny, bouncy.  The oil is wonderful for hair, face and body.  I am enchanted with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product that was introduced to me by my stylist to correct my dry hair and scalp problem. I wish the shampoo and conditioner came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> So amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry frizzy unbrushable super easy tangled hair from so many bleaching and dyings.&lt;br /&gt;After one wash my hair was so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dye lasts longer washing with this as well.&lt;br /&gt;The spray in detangler works so good. You barely have to spray much in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used many chemical free, hemp, etc products and this one has been the best to me.</li>
    <li> Great natural products. Smell great and perform well</li>
    <li> My mom loved this for her birthday she said it made her hair really shiny and she loved the smell!</li>
    <li> i have been using wen products forever because it has no sulfates so it won&#x27;t dry out your hair. I recently went to a new hair dresser and she used these products on my hair. I love the smell and it lasts all day. the Marrakesh products gives my hair alot of volume and helps retain a lot of moisture because I have fine hair. I absolutely love it. I am replacing my wen products with these instead.</li>
    <li> This arrived having leaked out into the box but fortunately it smelled great. The shampoo does not lather much because it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium Laurel sulfate, but I like the natural ingredients. It smells like exotic spices. The detangler works well and the oil makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
