    <li> Love all their products!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  This is a good price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews and also because I love the Seacret peeling gel. It doesn&#x27;t work. My eyes felt dry and I looked older using this as compared to the Oil of Olay product I used before this. For some reason, I thought the ingredients in this would be healthier so I wanted to try it. Anyway...I tried to return it and the sellers wouldn&#x27;t take it back because they said everyone else loved it. What? So much for customer service. So...if you are going to try this - know you can&#x27;t...try it, that is. You are buying it and stuck with it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Very good eye cream I saw results immediately, but not as dramatic results as time goes on. I am waiting to see if it tightens the upper eyelid as well as it gets rid of fie lines around the eyes. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars! Of course all really good products are expensive, but it was shipped from Israel, and the cost on the package said value $18, Cost me a lot more than that!</li>
    <li> The eye cream is great, and did reduce puffiness under the eye and the price made it worth it for sure. This product will last a long time.  Also, it shipped quickly :)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin itch!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product and the fact that I can get it here for a fraction of the price makes me love it all the more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even THINK about not getting this!  It has really improved the skin texture around my eyes.  Nothing compares and I have tried a lot of creams.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Visibly reduces wrinkles around eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever found.</li>

    <li> Absorbs Well, Can Feel Moisturizer On My Eyes Even At The Ends Of The Day When I&#x27;m Washing My Face.</li>
    <li> Time will tell, if this product lives up to it&#x27;s expectation.  Very glad I did not spend $250 at the mall.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if it works!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a comparison with exactly the same item that was being sold through a cosmetic party. The party ripped me off by charging 4 times the amount That I paid for it through Amazon. As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s to early to tell yet.&lt;br /&gt;Kc</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this religiously and I can honestly say after trying all the major brands including a few well over $200/ounce - this is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  The results on instantly noticeably.  Combine it with the Seacret peeling mask and your face will look like a million bucks.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on my eyes..I also use the gel from seacret also.  Although I only use the cream at night.</li>
