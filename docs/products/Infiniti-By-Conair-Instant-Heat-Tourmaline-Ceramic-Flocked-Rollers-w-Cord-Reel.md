### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>As a result, I made a seperate purchase of Conair Roller Clips that work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This hair setter allows me to choose from 12 heat settings, the retractable cord is a great addition, and 20 rollers in a variety of sizes make this product the best for my needs.  </li>
      <li>The cord rewind is great too.</li>
      <li>just relaxes throughout the day and looks very nice.</li>
      <li>Love this - even the clips!  </li>
      <li>The unit works great and the rollers are fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the clips.</li>
      <li>The curlers come out very easily, without catching lots of hair in the curler, as some setters do.  </li>
      <li>Over all the hot rollers are great.</li>
      <li>I love my curlers.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I think this is the best curler set I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>I curl it to give it more definition.</li>
      <li>And these got HOT if set at the maximum setting - nice to have a range on them!  </li>
      <li>I have found better.</li>
      <li>I love the wind-up cord feature, too.  </li>
      <li>My daughters and i love these.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use any hair product, but I&#x27;m sure that the curls would&#x27;ve held longer if I had.  </li>
      <li>I bought the over sized clips that Conair sells here on Amazon, and they work much better for me.</li>
      <li>The directions say it heats in 2 minutes but waiting 5 minutes seems to give better results.</li>
      <li>I like this model better from the get go.</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Hot rollers aren&#x27;t much good if they won&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
      <li>These rollers warm up quickly, make your hair shiny and don&#x27;t leave unsightly creases...</li>
      <li>These heat up quickly and make a nice long-lasting curl.</li>
      <li>I love their velvety texture, and the clamps are really easy to use too.</li>
      <li>I liked how quickly these rollers heated up.</li>
      <li>They were fine and I prefer them to the wire ones.</li>
      <li>I have plenty of hair, but it&#x27;s quite fine, so</li>
      <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair and these rollers</li>
      <li>and I enjoy using them.  </li>
      <li>It does give you a shinny smooth curl.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had these about a month, but I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them, but I was really hoping I would since I love the retracting cord feature.</li>
      <li>The old kind are much better.</li>
      <li>They heat up quickly, and are easy to use, and stay in your hair until you take them out.  </li>
      <li>The heat settings are also perfect - haven&#x27;t burned myself like I have with other hot rollers, and the rollers themselves go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It really does the best job so far, but not with the large size rollers.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of the flocked rollers &amp; they are not too hot to handle, which is better for your hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to get more body into my hair, and these hot curlers work.  </li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Still use some full clips that Conair sold years ago.</li>
      <li>I love this roller set - it heats up in less than five minutes, and the clips to hold the hair do a really good job of keeping everything in place.</li>
      <li>No weird dents in the curls, no pulling of my hair, and the retractable cord makes them easy to store.</li>
      <li>They heat up quickly for me.  </li>
      <li>They would have been better for me if there were more smaller rollers.</li>
      <li>I really like these curlers, they heat up very quickly and curl well.  </li>
      <li>Works great for a few or a lot of curl w/o burning hair and works quickly so you can do the rush job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not any better than my 25 year old Clairol setter, except for the cord rewind feature, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price point for this set is just about right, as I did end up buying another set to use with it.</li>
      <li>Plenty of rollers, however, I very much dislike the clips.  </li>
      <li>hair is fine and naturally wavy.</li>
      <li>great that you can control the heat of the rollers, hard to tunr the unit on and off...</li>
      <li>but over all it is a great set - heats up super fast - curls last - and cools down quickly when you unplug it.</li>
      <li>This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I was pleased.  </li>
      <li>We recommend you try it first because the clips that come with the rollers may work for you.</li>
      <li>I only had to set it to heat-level 6 and it kept my hair curly for about the first 5 hours and after that they gradually became a more natural-looking wave.  </li>
      <li>This is the first set that works at all.  </li>
      <li>They get pretty hot though.</li>
      <li>MY SKIN WAS BURNED AS WELL, BY THE HOT MELTED PLASTIC.</li>
      <li>I HAD TO CUT HOT MELTED PLASTIC OUT OF MY HAIR.</li>
      <li>This is my first set of hot rollers</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find metal U-shape clips that fit the small size in this set-</li>
      <li>This hair setter is easy to use and brings lots of curls that last all day.  </li>
      <li>I like the large plastic clips.  </li>
      <li>The curls did look really nice though, but too tight for me.</li>
      <li>Her hair is extra fine</li>
      <li>But, these really are so much easier to use in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try to find some that hold the curl , don&#x27;t get tangled or leave marks and stay functional for a reasonable length of time.</li>
      <li>work really well.  </li>
      <li>The clips hold very well, but the drawback is the dent they leave on your hair.  </li>
      <li>Rollers curl hair pretty good, but no better than my old set.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually really bad at curling my hair, but these curlers are actually kind of fun to use, and very easy to put on.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, slightly curly hair.  </li>
      <li>These costs more than both my two other sets combined and they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love them.</li>
      <li>Overall, good product, but I recommend it for someone with shorter/thinner hair or who likes tight curls.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care for the new style clips too much.  </li>
      <li>On days the dent is noticeable, I just use my big barrel curling iron to quickly \\&quot;iron out\\</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure these are worth the price, but they sure put my discount store hot rollers from several years ago to SHAME.</li>
      <li>One improvement for me would be to have more of the large rollers and fewer small ones.  </li>
      <li>The clips were kind of hard to use, but they worked.</li>
      <li>I currently have 2 good sets of curlers I use, but they are small.</li>
      <li>These rollers are certainly worth the money, and I would make the same decision to purchase them again if I had to do it all over again.</li>
      <li>The clips were not hard for me</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair that barely keeps a curl, and I don&#x27;t have time to use the straightening/curling iron to curl my long hair.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t usually use them on the hair on top of my head, so, for me, it has not been an issue.</li>
      <li>I bought this to save my fine hair from other more damaging styling tools that make it hard for me to grow my hair out.  </li>
      <li>They just didn&#x27;t seem hot enough, even with 12 settings.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy these since I recently threw out 2 hot roller sets...</li>
      <li>wish it had more small rollers -</li>
      <li>I have fine shoulder length hair, and oddly enough, there were not enough rollers to do my entire head!</li>
      <li>so I ended up using all 20 of the rollers which didn&#x27;t work very well with the smaller rollers.</li>
      <li>They stopped heating up in early May.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had an old Conair that still worked but looked bad...time to upgrade.  </li>
      <li>I found myself putting too much hair in one roller when I only had 20, and having to reheat.  </li>
      <li>I like the retractable cord too, definitely a bonus, really like that feature.  </li>
      <li>taking up space under the counter - 1 set too big (slid out of my fine hair and the other, old and had seen their day.)    </li>
      <li>I like them much better than the heated rollers I used as a teen long, long ago!</li>
      <li>One thing that will get me at least once each time I curl is the open side of the curlers can, and will, very easily grab hold of your hair and not let go.</li>

    <li> wish it had more small rollers - but over all it is a great set - heats up super fast - curls last - and cools down quickly when you unplug it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these since I recently threw out 2 hot roller sets...taking up space under the counter - 1 set too big (slid out of my fine hair and the other, old and had seen their day.)    But, these really are so much easier to use in the morning.  The clips were not hard for me and I am ambidextrous, so I often feel clumsy.  If you feel like being curlier, you can modify the temperature and time... read the instructions.  I don&#x27;t usually bother but they were helpful... hair type, size of roller, etc.    My only complaint, if you are tired, make sure that you look carefully at the on and off switch...it seems backwards to me and caused me delay in the morning since I thought that they were \\&quot;on.\\&quot;  Could have just been fatigue.</li>
    <li> I got these about 3 weeks ago. Based on the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them, but I was really hoping I would since I love the retracting cord feature. I currently have 2 good sets of curlers I use, but they are small. I was hoping to find set I could use for my entire head. These costs more than both my two other sets combined and they don&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;m returning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and naturally wavy. I curl it to give it more definition. It takes a curl pretty well, and with my other set the curl just relaxes throughout the day and looks very nice. With these the curlers it fell out within a few hours. It was never as defined as my other sets. They just didn&#x27;t seem hot enough, even with 12 settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the clips. They were fine and I prefer them to the wire ones. I like everything about the product EXCEPT how it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love my curlers.  They heat up quickly for me.  The clips were alittle hard to use at first.  Still use some full clips that Conair sold years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it contained Jumbo rolllers as part of the set.  When it arrived, the largest rolller was 1 3/4 inches , not Jumbo which is 2 inches, I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I really like these curlers, they heat up very quickly and curl well.  I like the retractable cord too, definitely a bonus, really like that feature.  The clips hold very well, but the drawback is the dent they leave on your hair.  Some days the dent isn&#x27;t bad and hardly noticeable.  On days the dent is noticeable, I just use my big barrel curling iron to quickly \\&quot;iron out\\&quot; the dent, takes just a moment to do that.  I have long hair though and I guess if you have short hair, it might be a problem.    One improvement for me would be to have more of the large rollers and fewer small ones.  Overall, I think this is the best curler set I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s the most expensive set I&#x27;ve ever purchased, so I&#x27;m hoping it will also be the longest lasting set.  My last set was also Conair, was half the price, and lasted about 6 years.  I&#x27;m hoping I get at least 10 years out of this set!</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this \\&quot;gem\\&quot; in retail stores, so I went online.  Found it at several sites, but have always found Amazon to be reliable &amp; extremely prompt.  This time was no exception. This hair setter allows me to choose from 12 heat settings, the retractable cord is a great addition, and 20 rollers in a variety of sizes make this product the best for my needs.  The clips are worthless, but I have a good collection of wire ones from previous setters.</li>
    <li> These rollers fall out of my hair within minutes...even those that stay in, they don&#x27;t curl my hair.  I would definitely not buy this and will return it now.</li>
    <li> I liked how quickly these rollers heated up. The clips were kind of hard to use, but they worked. I have really long hair so I ended up using all 20 of the rollers which didn&#x27;t work very well with the smaller rollers. Even the biggest rollers weren&#x27;t big enough. The curls did look really nice though, but too tight for me. Overall, good product, but I recommend it for someone with shorter/thinner hair or who likes tight curls.</li>
    <li> This hair setter is at a par for other setters.  It&#x27;s not any better than my 25 year old Clairol setter, except for the cord rewind feature, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Clairol has wire clips which I don&#x27;t like.  I like the large plastic clips.  This one doesn&#x27;t come with either, it comes with these hard to open long spring clamps that are hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because it was a nice looking setter with a cord rewinder, but too expensive anyway.</li>
    <li> Pros:  I like the feel of the flocked rollers &amp; they are not too hot to handle, which is better for your hair.  Rollers curl hair pretty good, but no better than my old set.    Cons:  Don&#x27;t care for the new style clips too much.  The old kind are much better.</li>
    <li> I love this roller set - it heats up in less than five minutes, and the clips to hold the hair do a really good job of keeping everything in place. The heat settings are also perfect - haven&#x27;t burned myself like I have with other hot rollers, and the rollers themselves go on smoothly. I love their velvety texture, and the clamps are really easy to use too. I&#x27;m usually really bad at curling my hair, but these curlers are actually kind of fun to use, and very easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, slightly curly hair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get more body into my hair, and these hot curlers work.  You can vary the temperature to suit your hair.  They heat up quickly, and are easy to use, and stay in your hair until you take them out.  I do have two issues, however.  First - the clips that come with the Infiniti are terribly hard to use.  I bought the over sized clips that Conair sells here on Amazon, and they work much better for me. Second - I would have liked to buy this same unit with all smaller rollers,  My hair is short, so I did send for some extra small rollers through the company.</li>
    <li> I USED CURLERS TWICE NO PROBLEM. HOWEVER, ON 3RD USE SOME OF THE CURLER ENDS MELTED  AND THE CURLERS ARE STUCK IN THE UNIT. ALSO,SEVERAL OF THE CURLER ENDS THAT MELTED PULLED OFF WHEN I TRIED TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE UNIT. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WASN&#x27;T NOTICED BEFORE  I HAD ALREADY PUT 4 CURLERS IN MY HAIR. I HAD TO CUT HOT MELTED PLASTIC OUT OF MY HAIR. MY SKIN WAS BURNED AS WELL, BY THE HOT MELTED PLASTIC. THIS ITEM SHOULD BE RECALLED IF IT HASN&#x27;T BEEN ALREADY! OBVIOUSLY, I&#x27;VE RETURNED THESE FOR A TOTAL REFUND.</li>
    <li> These rollers are certainly worth the money, and I would make the same decision to purchase them again if I had to do it all over again. I would have wished to know the following going in:  These rollers warm up quickly, make your hair shiny and don&#x27;t leave unsightly creases...HOWEVER, the clips that they come with the set, DO leave creases. I still use the clips on the hairs that are not on top of my head (as the creases aren&#x27;t bad enough to quit using the clips entirely), and they usually hold very well, but I have been using the metal U-shape clips from a prior set of rollers for the hair on top. It is convenient that the 3 sizes in this package are the same size as most other standard curlers, so you have the freedom to use the clips you personally would like. I have not been able to find metal U-shape clips that fit the small size in this set-but I don&#x27;t usually use them on the hair on top of my head, so, for me, it has not been an issue. One thing that will get me at least once each time I curl is the open side of the curlers can, and will, very easily grab hold of your hair and not let go. I have also since, bought another set by Conair, the same casing but not with Tourmaline, because my hair is very thick, although it is only just past my shoulders, I find myself using 24-29 rollers in my hair at once. I found myself putting too much hair in one roller when I only had 20, and having to reheat.  The price point for this set is just about right, as I did end up buying another set to use with it. Hope this helps in your decision!</li>
    <li> My wife loves her Conair Ceramic Hair Roller. No more water! The only thing she didn&#x27;t like was the tight fit to the head of the rollers. That&#x27;s why 4 in lieu of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. It can without clips but solved that problem. My wife likes these and uses them all the time.</li>
    <li> My daughters and i love these. They get pretty hot though. The curls seem to last all day.</li>
    <li> I ordered the white version of these in early Sept. They arrived in black. I sent them back and reordered the white. I had them for less than 8 months and only used them about twice a week. They stopped heating up in early May.Hot rollers aren&#x27;t much good if they won&#x27;t heat up.  I&#x27;ve purchased several Conair rollers sets over the years and each time they break earlier and earlier. If they didn&#x27;t work so well with my hair I wouldn&#x27;t have kept trying.  But never again. I&#x27;m going to try to find some that hold the curl , don&#x27;t get tangled or leave marks and stay functional for a reasonable length of time.</li>
    <li> This hair setter is easy to use and brings lots of curls that last all day.  The curlers come out very easily, without catching lots of hair in the curler, as some setters do.  It took a couple tries to get used to the spring clips.  I wish the clips were a little smaller - they give the appearance of an alien with metal spikes sticking way out of the head.  My hair is long and thick so I use the highest heat setting, 12. The directions say it heats in 2 minutes but waiting 5 minutes seems to give better results.</li>
    <li> Exvellent product .  Works great for a few or a lot of curl w/o burning hair and works quickly so you can do the rush job.</li>
    <li> great that you can control the heat of the rollers, hard to tunr the unit on and off...switch feels akward and at times feels like putting a puzzel together, trying to get the rollers back in their correct position...</li>
    <li> not easy to use and not worth the money. Fell out and hard to put in hair. Not worth it. I have found better.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I was pleased.  I have a lot of fine hair that barely keeps a curl, and I don&#x27;t have time to use the straightening/curling iron to curl my long hair.  These rollers did the job well!  They are definitely a healthier alternative to the straightening/curling iron.  I only had to set it to heat-level 6 and it kept my hair curly for about the first 5 hours and after that they gradually became a more natural-looking wave.  I didn&#x27;t use any hair product, but I&#x27;m sure that the curls would&#x27;ve held longer if I had.  I had no problem handling the rollers with my bare fingers either.  The clips were the only downside.  They are definitely a little too long and therefore top-heavy, so I suggest to go ahead and buy a different set of clips.</li>
    <li> These heat up quickly and make a nice long-lasting curl. I use them on dry hair and give each section a spritz of extra-fine mist hairspray before rolling it up with the roller. I have fine shoulder length hair, and oddly enough, there were not enough rollers to do my entire head! I have plenty of hair, but it&#x27;s quite fine, so I thought there would be enough. I had to finish off my head with the curling iron! I with I could buy extra small and medium sized rollers. Other than that, I love them. No weird dents in the curls, no pulling of my hair, and the retractable cord makes them easy to store. The spring loaded clips that hold them in are a little nuts. I don&#x27;t think the person who designed them actually USED them. They work well enough though. I&#x27;m not sure these are worth the price, but they sure put my discount store hot rollers from several years ago to SHAME.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of hot rollers and I enjoy using them.  I have fine, shoulder length hair and these rollers work really well.  I love how my hair feels soft and healthy.  Plenty of rollers, however, I very much dislike the clips.  They do not secure the rollers tight enough.  As a result, I made a seperate purchase of Conair Roller Clips that work perfectly.  Overall, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several sets of rollers.  This is the first set that works at all.  They would have been better for me if there were more smaller rollers.I have fine thin hair and it is hard to get a curl that stays.  It really does the best job so far, but not with the large size rollers.</li>
    <li> Over all the hot rollers are great. You just have to fight with the clips.  I may just buy another set of clips. Tired of fighting with the one size fits all rollers spring loaded clip. If you don&#x27;t mind paying a few extra bucks for clips get this product. It does give you a shinny smooth curl.</li>
    <li> Amazon followed through with their responsibility with this product; however, the manufacturer&#x27;s product description was flawed. The roller clips doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in place.  The container is big and bulky.  The rollers fail to curl my hair evenly.</li>
    <li> The reel out feature is outsanding. My wife loves it ! The unit works great and the rollers are fine. Not too crazy about the roller clips though, so she bought a different clip that seems to work fine. We recommend you try it first because the clips that come with the rollers may work for you. Her hair is extra fine and she need something a little heavier to keep the hold. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After my old Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter died on me, I decided to try these.  I like this model better from the get go. The set lasts all day and I like the the temperature control feature. My hair is thick, so I use the highest setting and was pleasantly surprised how curly my hair came out-and stayed that way.  The cord rewind is great too.</li>
    <li> Love this - even the clips!  I&#x27;ve had an old Conair that still worked but looked bad...time to upgrade.  I was concerned about the clips because of other reviews, but these are a far cry better than those old stupid metal things!  And these got HOT if set at the maximum setting - nice to have a range on them!  I&#x27;ve only had these about a month, but I&#x27;m happy with them. I love the wind-up cord feature, too.  I guess there isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like!</li>
    <li> Stopped heating after one use. Rubbish.</li>
    <li> I bought this to save my fine hair from other more damaging styling tools that make it hard for me to grow my hair out.  I use a low heat setting, the curls last all day, and it does seem gentler on my hair than my curling iron.  I like them much better than the heated rollers I used as a teen long, long ago!</li>
