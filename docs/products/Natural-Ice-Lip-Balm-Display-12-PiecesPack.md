      <li>I have used this product for many years and prefer it over all others.  </li>
      <li>love product and price</li>
      <li>I think it may be one of my favorite skin products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I would love to review it</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it available at Amazon.com</li>
      <li>I am sure that I will be looking for this online again when I run out.</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s always available here</li>
      <li>It is the most fantastic chap stick ever.  </li>
      <li>So I just order a huge pack every half a year, because it&#x27;s the best product out there!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it again in another twelve months right here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is hard to find but its the best stuff out there.</li>
      <li>Good stuff - especially for skiers.</li>
      <li>This product is so good that it is now the only lip balm my wife will buy/use.  </li>
      <li>My biggest gripe with most balms is as they dry, the residue feels sticky and kind of balls up on your lips.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy it at local stores, and when they all stopped carrying it, I was able to find it online--</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lived in the desert and freezing Midwest &amp; have used no other kind since this product came out.</li>
      <li>Not only are the ingredients more natural and contain less petroleum (good for your lips anyway), but this balm even tastes good.  </li>
      <li>We say it&#x27;s the best kept secret...</li>
      <li>I fell in love with how well it worked back then and nothing else compares!!</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it !!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this lip balm!</li>
      <li>When you buy a dozen at a time, the price is perfectly reasonable.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and really doesn&#x27;t smear and cools your lips as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>Just what I wanted and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I am a complete lip balm addict and have used many different kinds over the years, always in search of the \\&quot;ulitmate\\&quot; lip balm...</li>
      <li>We have been using this lip balm for several years and find it superior to all the other products on the market.</li>
      <li>I have proudly converted a few a long the wy to this product and have met someone at work who feels the exact same way I do about this product!!  </li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t happen with Natural Ice; and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the touch of healing medicine in there</li>
      <li>We have compared it with other lip balms that are priced much higher, always to return to Natural Ice Original.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying this many at once because its hard to find in stores!</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t find it where I live.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every lip balm available, but now that I&#x27;ve used Natural Ice, I can&#x27;t stand using any other brand.  </li>
      <li>I first used this lip balm when A local Detroit radio station gave them out at an event in Cork Town.</li>
      <li>I cheered out loud when I did.</li>
      <li>not one of them comes even close to comparing with Natural Ice.</li>
      <li>The texture is not too soft, not too hard, and the slight menthol aroma makes it feel so refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Natural Ice sinks in, makes your lips feel soft and soothed from the inside out and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>I used to buy Natural Ice in Long&#x27;s Drug store but that is no longer around, it is now CVS</li>

<li> This fabulous lip balm can be really hard to track down at your local drugstore.</li>
<li> After using Natural Ice, you wont want to use any other brand.</li>
<li> This supply should last me all year long!</li>
<li> This product works well and lasts long for me.</li>
<li> This way I will not have to buy lip balm for a long time!</li>
<li> .... without my Natural Ice!  For as long as I remember, over half a century, this little menthol lip balm has always been close at hand to use day or night.</li>
<li> I was very upset when I cold no longer find it in local stores.  </li>
<li> My family has been using it for 30+ years, back when it was that plain dark green stick labeled \\&quot;Mentholatum\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I think that I am crazy some times for purchasing this much lip balm, but I use it a lot!  </li>
<li> (not sure what it is) that gives a cooling, soothing sensation if your lips are a little overdry and irritated.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this chap stick for years and have found it hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find though</li>
<li> I am disappointed that it isn&#x27;t sold in stores where I live.</li>
<li> and if I do it is rather expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After using Natural Ice, you wont want to use any other brand. I cant find it in any stores locally, so I am thrilled to find it on Amazon. It REALLY works great. Apply before bedtime, and your chapped lips fell terrific the next morning.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Natural Ice in Long&#x27;s Drug store but that is no longer around, it is now CVS and they do not carry this item. I tried 13 different kinds of lip balm and not one of them comes even close to comparing with Natural Ice. The others all sit on top of your lips and are worn off in a matter of 10-20 minutes. Natural Ice sinks in, makes your lips feel soft and soothed from the inside out and lasts for hours. When I finally realized I might find it on Amazon I cheered out loud when I did. I am a big user of lip balms and when I started using this product something like 12 years ago I have not gone back. I think it may be one of my favorite skin products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good price. I used to buy this at H-E-B, but they stopped carrying it. So I just order a huge pack every half a year, because it&#x27;s the best product out there!</li>
    <li> This fabulous lip balm can be really hard to track down at your local drugstore. So glad it&#x27;s always available here (at a competitive price). Just stocked up on this year&#x27;s supply (12 pack) and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it again in another twelve months right here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. GOOD PRICE. FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> This is the best chapstick I have ever used.  I was very upset when I cold no longer find it in local stores.  I was thrilled to find it available at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this lip balm for 40 years, and have NEVER found one that is a good as this one !!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it !!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and found it to be a great product.  Larry Birden</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;BEST\\&quot; chapstick I have ever used! Nothing compares to this stuff! It works wonders! Definitely worth buying this many at once because its hard to find in stores!</li>
    <li> Some people have a preference for the Chapstick brand, but after I tried this lip balm, it changed my life.  Not only are the ingredients more natural and contain less petroleum (good for your lips anyway), but this balm even tastes good.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every lip balm available, but now that I&#x27;ve used Natural Ice, I can&#x27;t stand using any other brand.  Not to mention it even used to be the cheapest lip balm at any store in my area.  So if you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, then you should because it really is amazing stuff.  Fresh, moisturizing, and good for your lips.  It&#x27;s everything a lip balm should be.  And not only is it a balm, but it already contains sun protection (SPF 15)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to  most chapsticks because of the ingriedent oxybenzone, but this one I&#x27;m not!!I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</li>
    <li> for some reason the stores that I go to have stopped carrying this product.  I love it so much and this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find but its the best stuff out there. I will order more when I run out!!!</li>
    <li> I prefer this balm as it has a cooling feel do to Mentholatum, is medicated and has a SPF 15. It stays on longer than others do for me.</li>
    <li> We have been using this lip balm for several years and find it superior to all the other products on the market. We have compared it with other lip balms that are priced much higher, always to return to Natural Ice Original.  It is a superior product.</li>
    <li> This product works well and lasts long for me. It is the best basic lip balm that I have found. I think that I am crazy some times for purchasing this much lip balm, but I use it a lot!  I gave some as gifts in Christmas stockings and others also appreciate it.  This way I will not have to buy lip balm for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have not found anything that works this well. I am disappointed that it isn&#x27;t sold in stores where I live.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many lip balms and in my mind this one is the best.  My biggest gripe with most balms is as they dry, the residue feels sticky and kind of balls up on your lips.  You have to rub it off and start over.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with Natural Ice; and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the touch of healing medicine in there (not sure what it is) that gives a cooling, soothing sensation if your lips are a little overdry and irritated.  I don&#x27;t bother trying others now, I just order a 12-pack of this!</li>
    <li> I agree that this is the best lip product!  My family has been using it for 30+ years, back when it was that plain dark green stick labeled \\&quot;Mentholatum\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this in stores for years and finally thought of looking for it on Amazon.  It is the most fantastic chap stick ever.  No greasy feeling.  Soothing!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Walmart was the only place I found that used to carry them.  Now I have to mail order it.  This is the best lip balm that keep your lips moist and protected(SPF 15) and also if your lips are chapped the menthol in it really soothes it.  I would highly recommend this lip balm!</li>
    <li> I would love to review it but my product is not here yet. please send it to me ASAP!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, not waxy like most lip stuff - and has that cool Mentholatum feeling. It&#x27;s hard to find though and I was very happy to see it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm that works for me and I can&#x27;t find it in stores and if I do it is rather expensive. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I started using this product several years ago and then couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.  After trying several alternatives and being unsatisfied, I decided to become an online shopper.  Delivery was quick and my lips feel wonderful.  This supply should last me all year long!</li>
    <li> This product is so good that it is now the only lip balm my wife will buy/use.  Everyone I&#x27;ve met who has used it swears by it as well.  If they go out of business, we&#x27;re doomed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lip balm for years - and this is BY FAR the best lip balm ever made!!!  I am a complete lip balm addict and have used many different kinds over the years, always in search of the \\&quot;ulitmate\\&quot; lip balm...look no futher - this is IT!!!  I have proudly converted a few a long the wy to this product and have met someone at work who feels the exact same way I do about this product!!  We say it&#x27;s the best kept secret...</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years but the stores I use all seem to no longer carry this. Nice to fine it online at a price comprable to what I am used to paying.</li>
    <li> love product and price</li>
    <li> Glad I found it online since I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. I am sure that I will be looking for this online again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores any longer. I first used this lip balm when A local Detroit radio station gave them out at an event in Cork Town. I fell in love with how well it worked back then and nothing else compares!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this chap stick for years and have found it hard to find in stores. It is not greasy and really doesn&#x27;t smear and cools your lips as soon as it&#x27;s applied. It&#x27;s always in my pocket.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and prefer it over all others.  Most of my family use it also.  Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, anymore?? I am very happy with the transaction, everything was as it said it would be and I will order again.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever. Using for 38 yrs.</li>
    <li> .... without my Natural Ice!  For as long as I remember, over half a century, this little menthol lip balm has always been close at hand to use day or night.</li>
    <li> I buy a dozen each year - one in each coat, bag, bedside table...  I&#x27;ve lived in the desert and freezing Midwest &amp; have used no other kind since this product came out.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm I like.  The texture is not too soft, not too hard, and the slight menthol aroma makes it feel so refreshing.  I used to be able to buy it at local stores, and when they all stopped carrying it, I was able to find it online--thank goodness!  When you buy a dozen at a time, the price is perfectly reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great service.  They arrived ahead of schedule.  This is the best Chapstick ever and I can&#x27;t find it where I live.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. I have used it for years and refuse to use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Good stuff - especially for skiers.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and shipped fast.</li>
</ol>
