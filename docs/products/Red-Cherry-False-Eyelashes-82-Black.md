<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect! Although I did need to use a bit of lash glue to really secure them</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved them... they look so natural.</li>
    <li> Beautiful eyelashes. Look natural.</li>
    <li> They where too long for me. It didn&#x27;t look fake looked natural but i just didn&#x27;t like how it looked on me.going to try the short ones.</li>
    <li> great lashes, natural looking. Definitely will be buying more of them because they&#x27;re so affordable. This coming from a person who used to buy MAC lashes for 15$&lt;br /&gt;hands down this is better</li>
    <li> I like the more natural looking lashes. I tried them and the brand is good and the shipping was good.  These are a heavier lash than what I care for. Went back to #601&#x27;s  those are my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love them. Will not buy anything else</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these eyelashes. They aren&#x27;t as cheap as I would like them... but you get what you pay for. These are truly GREAT quality and look amazing!</li>
    <li> I only received one pair out of the three I ordered . I liked the lashes , it would&#x27;ve been nice too get all three pairs instead of just one</li>
    <li> I just received my #82 Red Cherry lashes today and I love them.They are exactly the same as my Ardell #105&#x27;s.The only slight difference is the Red Cherry has a better curl to the lash but hardly noticeable.These lashes are so glamorous and will be perfect for my smokey eye. My package arrived FAST and it was wrapped securely in bubbles.I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and will probably buy from this seller again.AHHHHH!! I love my lashes!</li>
    <li> So soft i thought it was going to be too long but it wasn&#x27;t and it is so soft feels like your not wearing them at all! Will absolutely  purchase again.</li>
    <li> I an obsessed these are my favorite ! I wear them almost daily and I get lots of compliments even people asking me where I get them done will continue buying these the quality is amazing for the price</li>
    <li> Love red cherry eyelashes but i have found them elsewhere for much cheaper and free shipping!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product !! totally worth the price! I cant wait to buy more ! and reusable wow</li>
    <li> These lashes are great! They don&#x27;t look over the top and thats what I like about them(: they arrived on time which was great</li>
    <li> Tried this one &amp; liked the style &amp; fact that it also is reasonable durable. Also tried #62 but found it to diva/drag looking. The #62s were recommended by friend , however found those to be a bit over the top, can&#x27;t speak to the durability as I only wore them once.</li>
    <li> These lashes are too short. They do not even cover half my lash line. Sadly, I gave them away.  Nice quality and buy if you have extremely small eyes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes! they are perfect for wearing in the day or a night out with the smokey eye oh my gosh I can&#x27;t there too perfect absolutely will be getting more of these and I can&#x27;t believe that there a pack of 3 for only 6 bucks! I think they look really natural too. Definitely amazing!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try lashes that would look natural but still give that full effect plus the length. I decided to get these because they are affordable and they were just what I was looking for. Now I want to wear lashes every day! They feel lightweight and look great. Definitely will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is I LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUVVVVV THESE FALSIES.. So cute not heavy and very sultry look...sexy. Not overdone</li>
    <li> Got them in like a week, they were long but not so dramatic i did a review on them here&#x27;s the link  enjoy guys  [...]</li>
    <li> We purchased this item to use in pageants for my daughter. She absolutely loves them. They look so good on.I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;these to anyone that wants to stand out and look great!</li>
    <li> I thought these could be worn everyday, but they can not.  Well, I take that back, if you like the super glamor look everyday - then these are for you! I have to wear them on special occasions only because they don&#x27;t look like they are for the office everyday-LOL! Anyway, they are nice, just not for everyday!</li>
    <li> My order was shipped fast and I got it right on time as promised! Packaging was good and most importantly the product was GREAT!!! I can&#x27;t wait to order other RED CHERRY lash styles. WILL ORDER THESE AGAIN!! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried and triedf but I cant get the dang things on. good luck to all who can. I think the price is just right for the item.</li>
    <li> the lashes where bent and the hairs fell off . will not re order it was like a bottleg red cherry</li>
    <li> I will most definitely purchase this item again.  I really love these lashes! The price is great too!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I placed an order for these lashes on the 1st of May and recieved them in the mail on the 4th they are so gorgeous everything I expected, I&#x27;m very impressed by this seller.</li>
    <li> I really love these eyelashes. I had an event to attend and I got alot of compliments on the lashes. The looked very natural on me. It does give you the Kardashian feel. These are one of the best eyelashes to order online if you are into wearing lashes. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> They are a bit larger/fuller than I imagined...I&#x27;m saving these for &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34;...not for office/day wear...well, not if you live in a conservative Republican redneck town like I do!</li>
    <li> i like them the quality is really good just a bit much feels like the lashes overtake my face</li>
    <li> They are nice and especially for the price. They just don&#x27;t have enough flare for me. But if you&#x27;re looking for simple, then these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them! So easy to apply and just gorgeous when they&#x27;re on. With any look they almost look natural sometimes!</li>
    <li> Loved the packaging! It was secure and the product was great as well. I am planning in purchasing more of these eyelashes.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes made my eyes pop i love wearing lashes and i usually wear longer ones than these ones but just add a coat or two of mascara and these are great! will deff buy again! Also it got here faster then expected!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes 👍❤️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are beautiful and I love them</li>
    <li> I love red cherry eyelashes! They are super easy to put on and they are durable. They could be used and washed several times before having to toss. This particular eyelash is really long and full and looks very natural. The product was delivered quick and I can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with these lashes but I&#x27;ve had numerous lashes from MAC that were much prettier than these. I felt like these didn&#x27;t last as long either. So still nice and worth the try but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I wore these to an old Hollywood wedding, it lasted all night, and didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  At first, I thought they were a bit long, but in pictures, its not so bad.  Then after wearing them for a while of course its obvious that they are fake, but they didn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re real easy to apply and look great without that over the top look.  I ordered the pack of six because I like to double them up for a more fuller look. They don&#x27;t seem to do well after they&#x27;re washed but if you remove as much of the glue as possible you get more days wear out of them.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great leashes, even though my eyes are pretty small I loved this lashes. I had to trim them so they can look natural on me, but the volume give your eyes a great impact with a smokey eye!!</li>
    <li> They are good quality,but I only gave it 3 stars because they didnt look long and curved how I wanted them too. But they are good eye lashes...</li>
    <li> looks very natural, ppl asked me what product I used at a beauty workshop</li>
    <li> Awesome. Natural looking, but pretty big lashes for me - I have tiny lashes so this made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Love! Love this lashes it is really looking great to your eyes.</li>
    <li> I see what theyre doing with using Kim K as a marketing ploy but these eye lashes are nothing special. I will wear them but definitely wouldnt reorder</li>
    <li> my favorite eye lashes</li>
    <li> I will NEVER  order again from this place.  I NEVER received my eyelashes. When tracking  it said delivered which is impossible because I didn&#x27;t have my apt# so automatically UPS will returned items just like the other items, and I purchased items all the altogether. Weirdly  this was the only iteam out of 5 that was delivered.  Impossible seeing as it was set up as group delivery not individually which mean THEY ARE FRAUDS</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this style. I got the katy perry and like those and someone advised to try the kardashian lashes so I may try those before a new style # of these.</li>
    <li> I just love these lashes. Super affordable and just the bomb.com. I would definitely purchase these again. Shipping was super fast. which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Love love love these lashes! They feel much more natural than the plastic ones. Would purchase these again!</li>
    <li> What can I say Red Cherry Lashes are my favorite brand of lashes.</li>
    <li> I love these false lashes!  Out of all the lashes I have tried, I like these the best!  (And I have tried a lot.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look natural and are a great length!</li>
    <li> These lashes came in super fast. They&#x27;re super light, cute, and good for many occasions. I recommend these to anyone who just needs that extra flair to their makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelashes!!!😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooo upset with this product got here a week LATE!!!!! was expecting nice quality and good eyelashes the first two were OK but the last one I got looked like someone had worn them and try to sell them again very upset I had to reglue it in place so it could get its shape back.. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when I try to order cheap products. Wish I could get my money back for this.</li>
    <li> Love these false lashes. They feel good, comfy to wear and are dramatic but natural at the same time. Obsessed.&lt;3</li>
    <li> Being that I have thin lashes, I wear fake lashes a lot when I go out. I usually go with Ardell, but because these were on sale, I decided to try these. I&#x27;ve worn them a couple of times to go out and overall, I am quite content. The lashes definitely make a statement - they&#x27;re pretty long. If you&#x27;re like me and have short/non-existent bottom lashes, you&#x27;ll look a little uneven, so keep that in mind if you don&#x27;t mind going eyeliner heavy on the bottom lid.</li>
    <li> I love red cherry lashes,my favs are #43 but wanted to try something different,great price amazing product will buy more</li>
    <li> My mistake, I assumed they weren&#x27;t so dramatic and long...Not my taste, in the pictures they didn&#x27;t seem so thick &amp; long..</li>
    <li> LOVE these! I don&#x27;t always wear falsies, but I have a few different types from various manufactures, and I love these so much! I trimmed them in length just a smidge, and these honestly are hard to tell they are fake. So delicate, and the easiest lashes I have ever put on. SUPER happy!!!</li>
    <li> Very good lashes they look really nice for a night out. Clean them and they are ready to be worn again.</li>
    <li> These are lovely, light, and natural looking lashes.</li>
    <li> Good if you have tiny Asian eyes and you want to look normal they&#x27;re still pretty small even for that so little so short not full so bad!!</li>
    <li> I just got them in the mail TODAY. I ordered these lashes on the 10th and it&#x27;s now the 13th! Amazing quality for the right price of the lashes. I would HIGHLY recommend these to EVERYONE I know! I can&#x27;t wait to wear these tomorrow for Valentines Day :D I&#x27;m very pleased with the lashes and the service. Seriously guys.. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy them! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will be buying more soon :)</li>
    <li> The lashes are really classy and pretty, I love em so much and I would buy em again. Just a lil heads up tho, they do not come with adhesives on the lashes so that was a bummer. It should say that in the product description so customers know what to expect completely. So yea, I would buy again, buh will be a lil prepared next time with my own separate adhesive :)</li>
    <li> These worked well for what I needed them for. I think along with other lashes they are about the same. They already have the glue on them.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes lots of compliments. Easy to apply and reusable. I would recommend these to anyone. Very economical for the quality.</li>
    <li> nice human hair lashes</li>
    <li> They go here fast and were nicely packed. The glue they have on them is actually sticky enough to wear, I tried them on and they&#x27;re a little longer than I want so I will trim them. They&#x27;re a little too curled for my taste but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
    <li> These are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for a glam everyday look. They are long but I have large eyes so the length is good for me. I&#x27;ve ordered these dozens of times and never had any issues with them.</li>
    <li> These lashes are gorgeous.  They are not too thin not too thick not too long but just right for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> So love these eyelashes will be ordering this again</li>
    <li> They were too long, couldn&#x27;t wear them</li>
    <li> I so love these lashes! I just got into wearing false lashes.  This lashes made my eyes really pop and standout.</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased these for prom. They came in three sets of lashes. All three sets came apart. We bought the recommended glue and followed all the instructions.</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing quality, the length is just not what I expected. I like the more natural look and these lashes are very over the top. I will keep them for future big events but I would not wear them personally for everyday use.. I would recommend these however to others as the quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelashes I got. They are perfect for natural looks. Since I have big eyes this eyelashes make my eyes pop beautiful! And they are 100% human hair.</li>
    <li> I expected more but they were nice enough</li>
    <li> Great lashes!! Better than any others I have tried! Got a lot of compliments on them and they did not look really fake</li>
    <li> I have been wearing false lashes for years now &amp; have tried many different brands/numbers. However I think these are my FAVORITE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these false eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;1. they&#x27;re affordable&lt;br /&gt;2. they look fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;3. quick shipping :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered these in the past &amp; will continue to order them in the future. Whenever I use a set, I&#x27;m able to wear them multiple times, which is great! They will literally stay on all day; I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep with them &amp; they&#x27;ll still stay on. Only thing is, you need to purchase the glue separately. Regardless, I still believe this is a great purchase &amp; would recommend them to anyone who loves long beautiful lashes!</li>
    <li> Good for a natural, subtle look. I was hoping for more of a dramatic look...not the drag-queen type but the look you get when you stack 2 pairs of lashes together.  I like full, voluminous and long lashes...otherwise, what is the point.  These are very natural looking...very subtle...definitely good for beginners. You can wear these everyday. These are not Kim K&#x27;s look...too subtle. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very glamorous and natural looking at the same time! Ordered on the 20th and received  on the 23rd. Super fast shipping will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered # 82 eyelashes but i received #42. They are very  long. They look very natural and pretty. They truly make your eyes pop.</li>
    <li> A bit to big than what I expected but was able to rock them at a party a went to I got lots of compliments</li>
    <li> These are the best eyelashes ever! They are long, not thick, which is great for me because I want something that looks natural on me. I got so many compliments when i wore these for my 21st birthday 2 weeks ago. The quality is great and they can be worn more than once if taken care of properly. If you don&#x27;t have these in your life you are missing out.</li>
    <li> These lashes are a bit longer than I expected. but are still a great buy. They are not really a natural look more of a going out look.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality I wear lashes every day I love them so finding them affordable and good quality and affordable is awesome love it will order more thank you!!!</li>
    <li> If you wear lashes and haven&#x27;t tried these you must. I promise you&#x27;ll love them. Natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> great for office (may want to trim just a tad) and perfect for ladies night out! I bought from a seller that happens to be from same state I am so this came like next day. you&#x27;ll need your own glue.</li>
    <li> The are great. Love the easy that they go on with and the they look like my own.  They shipped so fast. A great eyelash enhancement and they can take some mascara too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.  I found them first on &amp;#34;Pinterest&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love it my favorite brand and style</li>
    <li> I love Kim Kardashians lashes, so of course when I saw these I jumped on it. They&#x27;re a little hard to work with when putting them on so you kind of have to work with them. The shipping was fast, which I loved. I dont know If I would order these particular lashes again just because its not my fave and I dont think they resemble Kim Kardashians lashes but for the price they&#x27;re not too shabby.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these lashes!!!</li>
    <li> good volume, just a bit unatural, easy band to work with</li>
    <li> They felt really great on my eyes. Didn&#x27;t have the heaviness or irritation.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. They are by far my favorite!! I wear lashes on a daily basis and these are the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love the Red Cherry brand and apparently they were hard to find so I was sent a no name brand. They told me they were top of the line but there was no way of telling cause they came in a clear top and blue bottom case. Since they were able to get in touch with me I feel they should have.</li>
    <li> THEY STAY ON ALL DAY, VERY LIGHT, I FORGET THAT HAVE THEM ON, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THEM AGAIN. HAVE RECOMMENDED TO 2 MORE FRIENDS AND THEY ARE THRILLED</li>
    <li> The lashes came very quickly and were beautiful when I used them. I was able to wear them a couple of times before I had to replace them.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes sooo much! They don&#x27;t look exaggerated nor boring. They are the perfect lashes for anything.</li>
    <li> perfect and best lashes I&#x27;ve tried ......so light weight you can&#x27;t even  tell you wearing any lashes....I would  definitely order this again....</li>
    <li> I received my package within the estimated time given. Everything was in tact with the right amount of eyelashes. Recently I put on a pair and they were perfect; very natural looking. I can&#x27;t wait to order them again. :-). Thank you!</li>
    <li> Omg! This eyelashes are the bomb hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;They are so much,much, much better than walmart eyelashes. You even can clean them with oil and they still look good.</li>
