<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this epilator.  It was my first purchase into the world of epilating.  It stings just a little for the first few times you use it and then after that - its not noticeable.  I have only been pinched once by the tweezers while using and it didnt break the skin nor draw blood.  Ive noticed after using it 5+ times that it doesnt seem to grab the hairs as well.  Time to epilate ankle to knees is usually 30 minutes total.  Not faster than shaving, but lasts longer! Next purchase I will buy one with far more tweezers.</li>
    <li> Amazing that these are still available, almost unchanged (in function and brand) in a couple of decades.  Works great, was heartbroken when my old one wore out, and delighted to find a replacement!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews and mulled over this purchase before deciding to buy. I LOVE this epilator, and I&#x27;ve used 2 other oher brands. The great thing about this epilator is the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; attachment. Which reduces pain considerably. Lower legs are easy, but I now use them on my armpits with much more ease than I thought! It&#x27;s scarier in concept, than in actuality, the key is to have the hairs be about a centimeter long, at the most. I&#x27;ve also just recently started doing my bikini area (no, really) and it wasn&#x27;t much worse than the armpits! I&#x27;m saving hundreds of dollars on waxes, and lots of annoying equipment, water, and razors by nothing having the shave. The only bad part is that it doesn&#x27;t get all of the fine hairs on the upper leg, but it gets a good portion (70-80%) enough so that the upper leg is incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that I do have hairs growing under the skin, but this is true with ANY other epilator, and certainly with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic and everything I thought it would be, and more. ESPECIALLY for the price. The charge hold for 1-3 weeks, depending on how often I use it. I can throw it into a bag for trips. It makes my life easy and saves me loads of money. I even got my mom one for Christmas, and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative reviews are from people who thought that spinning rows of tweezers would be painless.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I&#x27;m very happy with the Emjoi. I&#x27;m glad I opted for the cordless, as I can see how using a corded unit could be cumbersome. This model had plenty of power and held the charge a long time. The process was less painful than I expected. The size of the head is big enough to be efficient on large areas such as legs, but small enough to work in smaller areas like bikini.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I got what I paid for. I have to go over areas multiple times and it still misses much. While most of my hair is fine, some are thicker and those seem to be the ones hardest for it to get. I guess it&#x27;s just not strong enough?  (And it&#x27;s not a charging issue;  thus holds true even when used while plugged in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that this less expensive product might be enough, but it misses the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a few first passes then follow with tweezers.</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re super hairy, this is going to HURT.  I&#x27;m ​not very hairy, and this is awesome.  I don&#x27;t have to shave, and my skin is nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This thing works tooooo well. It plucks from the very root, causing the area to bleed just a little bit, but other than that, it works its magic.</li>
    <li> Having used Emjoi epilators for more than a decade, I have a couple of tips to help you get the most out of your purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) DON&#x27;T buy the cordless version! The cord on the corded version is quite long and I&#x27;ve used it everywhere, even when traveling. There&#x27;s always an outlet you can drag a chair next to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for this recommendation is that when the cordless&#x27; battery dies, your otherwise-fully-functional Emjoi is toast. I&#x27;m not interested in replacing a $50-$60 item every couple of years. The corded ones last many times longer for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, you really need to use one hand to pull your skin taut. Not really on your legs, but definitely on your bikini area. While the epilator will stop turning if it pinches your skin (a safety feature), that doesn&#x27;t make it hurt any less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Having talked to several women who&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you can&#x27;t predict whether you, personally, will find it too painful to use or not, so make sure you&#x27;ll be able to return it if this is your first foray into epilator-land. For instance, I use it quite comfortably on my bikini area and legs, but just cannot tolerate it under my arms (most unfortunate!), while another woman I know has no problem using it on her legs and armpits but just can&#x27;t use it on her bikini area.</li>
    <li> It hurts, and it leaves razor bumps after using. But it is a good alternative to other hair removing methods.</li>
    <li> Takes TOO long for mediocre results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the very first try, it worked really well&lt;br /&gt;but then after the first use, it started going downhill&lt;br /&gt;can go over spots several times and still have the hairs left there&lt;br /&gt;might as well just shave to get better results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was a total waste of money&lt;br /&gt;I would look for another product, a better one!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this epilator. Reading all these positive reviews I thought it would work great excluding the pain. So as this product arrived and I gave it a try it was not at all the best hair remover. The pain from the hair being plucked out wasn&#x27;t so bad, you get used to it after a short while. The negative thing about this is that it doesn&#x27;t really remove all the hair. Some are removed and some just get cut off, as if you were shaving. So the hair that got cut off would practically grow back the same as hair that was shaved. Overall, I thought this was a total rip off. Just stick to waxing, it&#x27;s much more efficient.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator to replace waxing (I previously used those prewaxed plastic strips from Sally Hansen) and I am finding it so much better! I did my underarms with it and it was much easier, faster, and maybe even less painful than waxing. Of course, it also doesn&#x27;t leave stickiness behind and the skin wasn&#x27;t left irritated! In the hairs it pulled out, I saw lots of roots, so it seems comparably effective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying it on my legs and bikini zone as well. In the bikini area, I can only do a little at a time due to discomfort since I haven&#x27;t previously waxed there. On these non-wax-toughened areas it also left bumps behind that lasted a day or two (so use it a few days in advance of hitting the beach).&lt;br /&gt;It has a cord that plugs directly into it at the bottom to charge it or if you want to run it corded. I like that it can run corded because I have had a lot of trouble with batteries going bad.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, do not get this device if you need it to be painless; It is ripping out your hair by the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing which stands out to me as being an area for improvement is there is no distinct place where the hairs all end up. Instead some fall out of the device as it is used, some get stuck in the tweezers, and some end up on the various plastic surfaces inside the device. Fortunately, they include a brush to clean the hairs out with.</li>
    <li> The soft Caress Epilator met all my expectations.  I am already, after 2 weeks, experiencing the luxury of confidence that facial hairs were not missed and the convenience of not having to attend to them daily.  With summer here my legs are smooth without constant shaving.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I saw videos of this product, and was very skeptical as to whether or not this product would work. When I recieved the product in the mail I was excited to see if it would actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurt just a little, but I am use to the pain, b/c I have waxed and tweezed before. I am very picky when it comes to choose/buying products. I would say this product is a 3.5 out of 5. It does not completely remove every single hair (especially the super short hairs) and it doesn&#x27;t really curve well when using on the underarms and bikini area. I have found that I would have to glide the Emjoi over and over and over. but overall, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i BOUGHT the cordless/corded emjoi, for around 55 but for those who wanna save money, i would recomment the corded. it&#x27;s cheaper, and does the same job! plus, the cord is long, and it works so much better when the product is plugged in rather than cordless!! If i would have known the cord was long, i would have just purchased the corded version for aorund $35, but i was too lazy to return my $55 version, b/c i fell in love with the emjoi, plus, it&#x27;s summer time now, and I wanted to keep it and use it asap!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is way better than shaving. When I shaved, I would have to shave everyday!! but with the emjoi, I dont have to shave everyday. but maybe do some touchups one&#x27;s a week, b/c i like my legs super smooth all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is better than shaving, because when I shaved, I always had little black dots appear on my legs, and it was not sexy at all. but with the epilator, it pulls all the hairs from the root, and you dont see any black dots. that&#x27;s the reason why I bought this product.</li>
    <li> This is a long and perhaps too-detailed review but bear with me and perhaps my experience will be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product originally because I wanted to get rid of tummy hairs for an extended period of time without waxing. Once I got it I decided to try it out on my legs first because I hadn&#x27;t read any reviews of it being used anywhere other than the bikini line, underarms, or legs. I did experience some pain (definitely more than a \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot; as it says in the manual) but it is bearable, and I had never waxed or epilated my legs before. Now, after using it a few times (~4) it still hurts but I have confidence that it&#x27;ll get better, and I&#x27;m a little more used to it now. My hair has been growing pretty quickly also (I get stubble after about a week), but I&#x27;m sure the time for that will improve with time and when my legs are hair-free they are nice and smooth :) It takes a long time (~30 mins per leg, less if you&#x27;re more efficient than me, haha) to get all the hair, but it is easy to do while watching TV so that&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t advise for or against using it on the stomach, but I decided to try it anyway. It is significantly more painful than the legs, even after showering and exfoliating. I even started to bleed a little the first time (but then again I did it while I was on my period and the directions advise otherwise). After the first few times I got little bumps, but they went away easily with exfoliation. I&#x27;m really prone to ingrown hairs but I just constantly exfoliate and it&#x27;s not a problem. Again, the pain becomes more bearable with use, especially as the number of hairs reduces. Right now, I&#x27;m too scared to go near the bikini line or the underarms but that may change later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with mostly negative comments it seems but the main reason why I rated it 4 stars is because although it is not painless, I&#x27;m sure the results will improve with time, and you save money vs. waxing. I also reallylike the cord/cordless feature because I hate having to buy battery replacements. Just a note, I do prefer the cord because after a while it slows down (and thus harder for the hairs to come out). Lastly, it&#x27;s actually kind of fun to use (I&#x27;m only slightly masochistic, haha) and if you follow the directions it should be fine!</li>
    <li> Bottom line I am a chick with furry legs. I am in love with this product. For the first time in my adult life I am not shaving everyday. The epilator gets rid of most of the hair but not the fine blonde hair. I find myself epilating once every 2.5 weeks and shaving twice during that time. It is also great on the bikini line. This thing does hurt. Not going to pretend it doesn&#x27;t but I think the end result is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this! As a girl who has stubble right after shaving, this is a game changer. It came with everything stated. As this is my first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I&#x27;m pleased. As many have said this isn&#x27;t the most comfortable experience. It may hurt but once that spot is clean it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all anymore. I would also recommend starting at your knee and working down to your ankle as it seems ankles are very sensitive. Very easy to clean. After I use it I put in a thick layer of lotion and apply again every night. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had too much of a problem with ingrown hairs or irritation. I wish I had gotten one sooner!</li>
    <li> but it&#x27;s really pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a word of caution: don&#x27;t turn this thing on if you are prone to dropping things when startled or are hoping for a discrete experience. it sounds like my mother&#x27;s electric turkey carver and the second speed is louder still. as a first-time epilator owner, the unexpected intensity of the noise was startling... then it just became funny. i don&#x27;t even want to know what my neighbors think i&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve waxed at home for several years and was interested in trying something new. the experiences are really different so it&#x27;s hard to say which one i like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pain is very different - while waxing is a hot, ripping pain over a large area, this thing creates rapid, tiny pinpricks all over your skin. imagine something between pins and needles when your leg falls asleep and tweezing your eyebrows. it doesn&#x27;t pull your skin like waxing does. if you&#x27;re put off by the pain, stick with it! you&#x27;ll eventually grow accustomed it. promise. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my favorite benefit of this epilator is no mess. you don&#x27;t have to take the time to heat the wax, spread the wax, pick the leftover wax bits off, etc. you&#x27;re not sticky after you use an epilator. a downside, because of the plucking, is that rather than being red all over, you&#x27;ll be blotchy for about an hour unless you put something on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my second favorite benefit of the epilator is you only need the shortest, finest hairs for it to work. with waxing, you have to let the hair grow out before you can remove them. that&#x27;s such an awkward time - \\&quot;oh, sorry i&#x27;m hairy! it&#x27;s a work in progress.\\&quot; the epilator even removes those fine little hairs on the inside of your arm and your lady mustache (the one you thought you&#x27;d waxed but is actually still there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my least favorite part of using an epilator is you lose the feeling of progress: you don&#x27;t come away with a strip of wax that shows you how many hairs you took away in one fell swoop. one rip, and you&#x27;re done with that area in under a second. with an epilator, you need make several passes over an area to get everything. i got bored before my left thigh was finished, but it only took about 10 minutes to be satisfied with my entire left arm (i&#x27;m 4&#x27;11\\&quot; for reference). upgrading to the more advanced emjoi models with more tweezer heads sounds like the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shape of the epilator fits perfectly in your hand and it&#x27;s really comfortable. the ability to use it cordless is also nice because your body hair grows in multiple directions so you&#x27;ll have to flip it around on occasion. cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re still uncertain about buying one: yes, you can give yourself a brazilian with this. you&#x27;re probably not supposed to use it for that so i won&#x27;t recommend it. the potential for snagging is likely very serious. only consider it if you&#x27;ve given yourself a wax brazilian before and are familiar with the way your skin moves down there. make sure you hold your lady bits out of the way and keep everything tight. it even gets \\&quot;those\\&quot; hairs you don&#x27;t want to admit to having.re done with that area in under a second. with an epilator, you need make several passes over an area to get everything. i got bored before my left thigh was finished, but it only took about 10 minutes to be satisfied with my entire left arm (i&#x27;m 4&#x27;11\\&quot; for reference). upgrading to the more advanced emjoi models with more tweezer heads sounds like the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shape of the epilator fits perfectly in your hand and it&#x27;s really comfortable. the ability to use it cordless is also nice because your body hair grows in multiple directions so you&#x27;ll have to flip it around on occasion. cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re still uncertain about buying one: yes, you can give yourself a brazilian with this. you&#x27;re probably not supposed to use it for that so i won&#x27;t recommend it. the potential for snagging is likely very serious. only consider it if you&#x27;ve given yourself a wax brazilian before and are familiar with the way your skin moves down there. make sure you hold your lady bits out of the way and keep everything tight. it even gets \\&quot;those\\&quot; hairs you don&#x27;t want to admit to having.</li>
    <li> So like many others I was reluctant about this purchase.  Now I&#x27;m profoundly thankful I took the plunge. Truly one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought as a beauty tool.  It&#x27;s a little shocking(best word I could find to describe it since I wouldn&#x27;t call it painful) when you first start but it just feels like little stings/tugs on the skin.  At one point it even starts to feel like a massage if you get the right technique going. It does work better according to the way you hold it. Overall, the payoff is great.  No stubble and smooth legs for a lot longer then shaving got me.  Thumbs way up on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using and epilator for the past 2 years until my Epilady pooped out on me about a month ago. I didn&#x27;t want to shave and have it grow back looking nasty so I decided to just stick it out and wait until I got myself another one... That&#x27;s right... I went au naturel... I just got it delivered today and of course I used it after several hours of charging it and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It is such a great deal and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to you if you&#x27;re tolerance for pain is low because it will hurt, but the pain subsides the more you use it (as with almost every other product that induces pain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is purchasing this as your first epilator, don&#x27;t not use it because of how it sounds when you turn it on... (I know it will sound very intimidating) Pain will only last a moment, but the benefits last a life time.</li>
    <li> excellent product, it works very good and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product on time and quick and fast. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first epilator, and needles to say i was very nervous about buying it cuz of the mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But I went ahead and bought it anyway, and I have absolutely no regrets now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the reviews for the product- It works great! Comes with a pouch, an exfoliating scrub, charger, a tiny cleaning brush, an extra (massaging) head. Had to charge it for over 12 hours(package says only 10)for the 1st time. And since then I have epilated my arms, legs, under-arms and its still going strong!! It is light and convenient. The only negative according to me is the amount of sound it makes! It is a LOT! Scared me from using it all! But I guess that&#x27;s how all epilators are. Over all- I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also I want to share my epilating experience here... Cuz i think it might help the first time buyers.&lt;br /&gt;On contrary to many reviews- it WASNT all that painful. I am used to waxing. And this is just like that (if not lesser painful). I dint feel a thing when i did my arms. My legs were- well i wouldnt say painful but i could feel the pinching sensation. But definitely bearable. Trying it on my underarms took the max courage. But once it was done, I wasnt exactly &#x27;tearing up with pain&#x27; or anything. It was OK! And though the instructions say- \\&quot;in the direction of hair growth\\&quot;. for me it seems to work when i do it the other way. Well, as long as it does the job. And also doesnt do as good a job as waxing. But atleast you can do it by yourself at home (i could never wax myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hope this helps! If you decide on buying- happy epilating!</li>
    <li> Well I decided to get the Emjoi Soft Caress Cord/Cordless Hair Remover originally because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the Enjoi Emagine, but I wish it removed hair a little faster.  I&#x27;m guessing the Emagine is probably a lot faster because it has double the number of tweezers.  But Like the title says, the Caress is definitely a good epilator for starters, just so you can get use to epilating your hair.  I mean, it hurts more if you epilate more hair all at once than just 4-5 at a time, but of course it will take longer so you&#x27;ll feel a lower pain level for a longer period of time because of the amount of time you will need to epilate all the hair you want to remove.  It definitely tweezes out the hair, and because it is rotating so fast, the hair doesn&#x27;t snap like when you are using a regular tweezer.  Just to be honest, it definitely hurt at first, but the pain was very minute for me because I&#x27;m use to plucking out unwanted hair from anywhere on my body.  The bikini line definitely hurt the most for me because I usually shave, but it grows back so quickly that it&#x27;s a pain.  I used the epilator and I was amazed at how long it took for the hair to grow back.  An epilator is a great investment, as long as you can bare the pain.  But there&#x27;s always the saying \\&quot;no pain, no gain.\\&quot;  I think I&#x27;ll be getting the Emagine soon just because I am already use to the pain (more like no pain now) and I would rather the epilator be faster so I wouldn&#x27;t have to make so many passes. &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully. it doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad at all and you get used to it. it leaves my legs so smooth and hair free for weeks. it does take a while to get to every hair. i usually go back over a week or so later to get anything i missed. it&#x27;s totally worth it and i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I am very happy with it.  Initially it takes a little time but it does eventually go faster.  I am ready to throw my shaver away and I have never liked waxing.</li>
    <li> I have owned three other epilators, and of the three, this is by far the best for the gentle (yikes!) removal of hair from the legs. My hair on my legs is medium- course, and I have been epilating for the past year. This is far and above superior to the Braun epilator due to the speed of the tweezers. The Emjoi optima&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00008K4UA Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator]] can damage the skin on the legs and is generally very painful to use.  It is possible to use it successfully on the lower legs, or if you have tough skin or very course hair.  I prefer the Soft Caress [[ASIN:B001EAYZEW Emjoi Soft Caress Cord/Cordless Hair Remover]] AP-10 for its ease of use and the fact that it has not damaged my skin. Perhaps I have become more adept at hair removal, and use the light sweeping motion described in the FAQs that come with the product.  I do apply Paula&#x27;s choice skin relief treatment after epilation. It contains aspirin, and seems to calm down the skin. I do use the loofah to combat the inevitable in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- ease of use&lt;br /&gt;- gentleness (my guess is the closeness of the tweezers themselves)&lt;br /&gt;- corded/corless for hard to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- cannot be used everywhere on body, for delicate areas, I use the [[ASIN:B0000DK5LW Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover]]</li>
    <li> absolutely satisfied with the epilator and ultra fast delivery of the product to my door. I have previously owned an Emjoi Epilator so I knew what quality performance to expect. this one has an even better comfort on the head and has a better skin on the body to hold onto.</li>
    <li> It ok.but not great..It s a little hurt..but I think not that bad....every body can handle it.But it not cleaned a whole thing out..I still have to used a tweezer after that.</li>
    <li> This is my second Emjoi hair remover.  I was so satisfied with my older model that when I accidentally destroyed it (due to a faulty adapter I used while traveling - in a Eastern European hotel), I realized I&#x27;d had this machine for over five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Emjoi Soft Caress and the package came sooner than promised - lucky for me since I was beginning to feel desperate enough to consider a razor during the interim.  However, this hair removal method delays hair from growing back, unlike razors.  The hair that does come in is soft, too - unlike with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best company and a great product!</li>
    <li> Came in on the very last date of expected delievery.  It came in a bag, not a small box.  However, I like the product. Only problem is the product states when using it hair will not grow for X amount of weeks But it seems like Im using it every two to three days.</li>
    <li> Loved it until... ingrown hair from hell. It took 6 months to get rid of it all.</li>
    <li> Its useful, but not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly for my legs, pubic area, and under arms. It misses a lot of hair spots.&lt;br /&gt;It is sometimes frustrating going back and epilating the area again and again.&lt;br /&gt;First time users: itll definitely be painful. But you get used to it real quick.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this product working but I got it in the mail today and I must say that I absolutely LOVE it. I&#x27;m Caucasian but the skin under my armpits is really dark. It&#x27;s so embarrassing! It didn&#x27;t even looked like I shaved when I did! This epilator took away the dark spots on my armpits. The sound is really intimidating and it hurt like heck but the results are way worth the pain! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of dark armpits! And obviously you can use this elsewhere too. It can be used on legs, the bikini area, armpits, chin &amp; lip. I&#x27;ve only tried my armpits so far but it was successful :)</li>
    <li> I have experience with multiple epilators and this is the worst one. The shape is an odd curve that doesn&#x27;t allow it to reach all of the areas of the legs, armpits, and bikini. It also doesn&#x27;t remove hair as close to the root as others, so even when you&#x27;ve just epilated, your skin will not be smooth. When compared to the Braun Silk-Epil (which I highly recommend), this one leaves bumps and irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if that weren&#x27;t enough, mine stopped working unless plugged in 6 months after purchase. I requested an exchange and was denied because it stopped working 6 months after purchase. Worst money I ever invested in hair removal. Shame on the company for not backing up such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> I love mine so much... I wrote a poem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I love you.&lt;br /&gt;Why do other women not know about you?&lt;br /&gt;Your only wish is to take my unwanted hairs.&lt;br /&gt;And no more than a charge by electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;They should love you.&lt;br /&gt;Make it known pain won&#x27;t ensue.&lt;br /&gt;From shave creams and razor heads aplenty.&lt;br /&gt;The waste piles of Earth so large and eccentric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;All should have you.&lt;br /&gt;It takes less time for what you do.&lt;br /&gt;More renewable and skin safe.&lt;br /&gt;No longer will I have trash weighed in metric.</li>
    <li> It is SO much faster than my old model.  And it is about time--it just took to long in the morning to have smooth legs with only one unit, as opposed to the double sided unit now.  It really does pick up the finest and shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old model did well, but as you use it, the hairs do get much finer.  At that point, the unit could not grasp the very short stubble.  So, I would never have very smooth legs, once they became fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is picking them up right away, all of them.  Love it!  Love the red color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like that it is not cordless--did not realize that.  That must change in the future.  Also, cleaning should be made to be extremely simple.  Like the gears should be protected from the stubble, because that eventually slows the machine down--even if you try to clean that area, it cannot be perfect again.</li>
    <li> Nothing more to say but this product is awesome and it gets the job done! :D</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator. The first one was OK, but it kept eating up batteries like crazy, so I went looking for a rechargable model. Well I found this one and LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got more tweezer discs than the other one and it removes hair more quickly. Hold a charge for a nice long time and recharges fairly quickly. You can also use it plugged in to an outlet, so if it runs out of charge or you forget to recharge it, you can still us it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...].</li>
    <li> The very first to third time I used this it felt painful but tolerable. It took me 5 mins to do each pit and 30 mins for each leg. The downside is ingrown hairs, however the ingrown hairs is just me (well I think it is). I have always known that I was prone to having ingrown hairs when I first wax and sometimes when I shave.Although I exfoliate once a day and use an AHA cream (alpha hydroxy- ByDaniel Kerns;acne.org)I still got those painful ingrowns, however it was not as bad since the use of AHA. But this was only on my lower leg area, meaning not my thighs, just my calves, shins, and ankle part is where my ingrowns happened. My arm pit, thighs, upper lip, belly button area grew completely normal which is fantastic!!! I just avoid my lower legs and unfortunately stuck to shaving them D:. But I realllyy like this product and before you buy this make sure if your prone to ingrown hairs or not. If you are prone to ingrown hairs, and also don&#x27;t have a great pain tolerance, I would not recommend this for you..</li>
    <li> Love it it really does not hurt as old ones did</li>
    <li> I like it. I bought it to use on my under arms. It does hurt, especially the 1st time. But the pain is better than the pain I get from razor burn and irritation, which also lasts much longer than epilating pain. Plus the pain lessens the more you maintain the hair removal. So if you do it every couple days vs. once a week, the pain is much more manageable. My advice is to trim the hair to be removed to maybe 1/8th inch (maximum, otherwise it hurts more) and to make sure you have the emjoi against your skin. The closer to the hair root was best for me, less pain. I was scared to do it, but I tried it on the palm of my hand (no hair there) to get used to what it would feel like. I gave it 4 stars because it can miss some hair(1-5) in the more curvy areas like the underarm.</li>
    <li> This is the third epilator that I have owned, and is by far the best.  I like that it can be used with or without the cord.  Only thing that would make it better is a light.</li>
    <li> At first i was terrified of the pain. it was better for me when i didn&#x27;t watch my hair being pulled. I am using this for my underarms haven&#x27;t done the legs yet. This is my 4th day into it and it still feels really smooth. I&#x27;m also using the emjoi after epilation cream which makes it ultra soft. my pits feel GREAT!! just a little advice. when the directions say light brush strokes LISTEN TO THE MANUAL!! i got a little crazy about getting every hair that i pushed it to hard against my skin and it caught the skin and it pinched a little blood.(THIS WAS MY FAULT) so just nice and gentle and never ever go back to shaving !</li>
    <li> I literally only used the epilator twice and it stopped working.  The epilator would not charge and seller would not let me return.  It is a waste of money.  $45 dollars down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for the two times that it actually worked...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can rightly give this emjoi five stars, given that it&#x27;s my first ever epilator, but I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and do so any.  I&#x27;m just that happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I had decided to try an epilator, because I have psoriasis on my legs, which makes it difficult to shave.  But that really hasn&#x27;t stopped me, so I&#x27;ve been shaving away, but my last outbreak of psoriasis was not clearing and my dermatologist said I might have to stop shaving, because the razor was irritating my skin and making my psoriasis worse.  So, this is how I came upon the epilators.  I read a bunch of reviews and went with this emjoi cord/cordless model.  I was going to possibly go with the red 72-tweezer emjoi version, but I was afraid that the larger head size might make it hard to tweeze some areas.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...just got my emjoi two weeks ago.  Did my legs after taking a nice warm bath.  I also did take a pain pill before, as some reviewers had advised.  It was somewhat painful for the first minute or so, but it was definately tolerable.  And, I have never waxed before (and have no tatoos or other major body modifications), so I would say that I am true novice in the pain for beuty spectrum.  After one week, I only had a smattering of hairs that had grown back on my legs, which I assume was because the hairs had been broken off rather than actually plucked.  But it was a small smattering...like 6 hairs on each leg or something.  I touched them up like it was no big deal.  This week I made it my goal to tackle some of my other body hair.  I tried my underarms, but found it to be a bit too painful and thought it might be better to shave them first, as the hair might be too long.  So, I went for the bikini area.  This was decidedly more painful than the legs, but once I go going it was not so bad.  I wasn&#x27;t able to do a full brazillian, because it just got to be a bit much.  Although, keep in mind I have never waxed my bikini area either, so my skin is not accustomed to having its hair plucked out.  I think I may try doing a bit more of it tomorrow.  There are definately some red bumps which appear after using the epilator, but they go away within a couple hours.  Of course you would want to keep this in mind if you were considering using your epilaotor directly before throwing on a bathing suit and heading to the beach.  Incidently, I have also been using the after epilatoin cream.  I have used it just the day of epilating my legs and bikini and not using it daily thereafter.  I have also exfoliated my skin before using the epilator and once during the week after.&lt;br /&gt;So, I hope that this review is of value to novice hair pluckers.  I say go for it.ked out.

    <li> I rate this epilator 5 stars. It is great for under the arms. When first using this, it was a tad bit painful but if your use to waxing you should be fine. Even if you don&#x27;t wax much, over a couple times the pain isn&#x27;t as bad and easier to handle. Well worth the money. Love this epilator. I also recommend this to first time users. It has a low speed and high speed. I now use the high speed for quicker use. I started off low for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Unfortunately I&#x27;m returning it because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. I had to shave after using it, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> I like this epilator. I doesn&#x27;t hurt in my opinion. You do have to go over the area several times. I think it is worth buying and trying for yourself!</li>
    <li> The emjoi soft caress epilator works great! It does the job very well and it is not painful unless you are using it in a sensitive area. Great for underarms and arms but u must exfoliate first. Solid and durable product! love this and am obsessed with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Emjoi Soft Caress for nearly 2 months now and I absolutely love it!  I use it every where (body and face) and it really grabs all the hairs.  My hair has always grown super fast, so I use my Emjoi once a week, but this is not a complaint since I used to shave everyday.  I&#x27;m hoping in time my Emjoi usage will become less frequent.  I do find that the power is greater when plugged in during use, but the cord is very long and never a hassle.  Goodbye to shaving and hair removal creams!</li>
    <li> Loved up until it shattered on a low fall. So upgraded</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item after much review an year back...I used to do waxing in parlor....But after coming to US (yeah..back in our homeland its much affordable to do waxing in parlor ;)..) I was searching for various means for wax and finally decided I will use this...&lt;br /&gt;But, it was so painful...that tears started to roll in my eyes...and in the 1st go I was not even able to pull a single hair....i&#x27;m  not sure this is because I&#x27;m new to epilator....but it was terrible...&lt;br /&gt;so I checked on Sally Hansen Naturally Bare Hair Honey Wax Hair Removal kit...nowadays its working fine..only thing instead of their wax strip....i use my old plain cotton cloth pieces as wax strip...so now its all perfect :)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy searching....</li>
    <li> Hurts like no other, but very worth it. Just like plucking your eyebrows, After a few times, you cant feel it anymore. Hair free for about a month and hair comes back finer and easier to pull.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my Epilator this Wed and OMG I feel in love with it lol. It takes off the hair so quickly. I mostly use it for my underarms and facial hair. At first using it, it did hurt but not dramatically pain. If you can take waxing or twee-zing your eyebrow hair you can take this. Best product purchased!!</li>
    <li> I got this based on a youtube review by bebexo. It didn&#x27;t seem to grab the hair all that well, I have to run it against the skin back and forth a LOT to get everything out.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST thing I have ever used. DO NOT waste your money on this. It will feel like you are getting bit and pinched by 100000 bees when you use this. AND to pay $55  for the privilege is not great. Oh also this does not even work., Piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> This is a very good for hair removal.  It hurts when you first start using it but you get used to it.  Hair stays gone for 3-4 weeks for me</li>
    <li> It is an OK product. I was expecting more since I had the Gold model for 16 years. My old one did much better than this one. However it does the work. I use it once a week all over my body. Yes, under arms, full legs, etc. I still go to the spa for my bazilian. but now my bill is no even a quarter of what it was.</li>
    <li> It works great for the underarms! Doesn&#x27;t even hardly hurt under there, it&#x27;s probably becuase the skin is thicker than on the ankles &amp; shin bone of your legs.  Speaking of the legs... its hurrtss! especaially the very first time. It stings like a prickling burn, but you do get used to it after the second or third use. I had to use it over a coarse 3 days to slowly deal with the pain, but i can see how some might like the sensation that it gives too at the same time? Well, The worst part is around the ankle bones and the shins. The bikini line &amp; area was very easy and hurt very little, No redness or sensitivity! i just kept sweeping away and its very rewarding not having to shave every week. The only hairs that it missed was alot of my thin small blonde hairs. I have a few darker hairs on the bottom half of my legs and it took them all right away &amp; they haven&#x27;t come back yet &amp; its been a whole week and a few days.. You will be left with some small short blonde hair and it will grab some thin blonde ones but not all of them.  Make sure that you sweep in the direction of the hair growth or the hairs could break off under the skin causing an ingrown.  I gave it 4 stars because i wish it wasn&#x27;t so time consuming, but then again I just should of ordered one with more tweezer discs, but then again this one is great for starting out, I couldnt of imagine the pain with double the amount of tweezers!</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! I&#x27;ve been pinched by it like 3 times though :/ And its because instead of rolling it flat against my skin, I&#x27;d angle it thinking it&#x27;d get the hair better, and it&#x27;d pinch me!! But this is an absolute must have. I keep it on the charger to get it to work full power :)</li>
    <li> Hi everyone. Just to start things off, I have never written a review for anything before because I&#x27;ve always thought of it to be a waste of time so right off the bat, I would not be writing this review unless I truly believed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a poor college student with VERY VERY thick dark and coarse hair that grows really fast. No matter what, I could never seem to get a clean shave for my underarms and bikini line. I&#x27;ve seriously tried everything, shaving with a man&#x27;s razor, Nair, Veet, you name it. The only thing that really worked was waxing and I would have to buy very expensive wax or go to a salon. Even though waxing worked for me, there are obvious cons to it- a) SO EXPENSIVE. I&#x27;m having issues paying my tuition, spending all of this money on beauty care is a little ridiculous. b) it takes so long!!! I should be studying for exams, not trying to rip out my hair with some wax. c) messy. enough said.&lt;br /&gt;So I came across this epilator and everyone, this epilator is amazing. I was a little skeptical at first because everyone was saying how much it hurt but honestly, the pain is bearable. Not the end of the world, I promise. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a product. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s clean, and in the long run, I&#x27;ll be saving so much money. Two thumbs way up! I recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a year now and it works great. I do my legs and my private part. It is still very painful though. Its more painful than waxing. But it feels so smooth when I am done, so its worth it. The problem with waxing for me is that it breaks most of the hair. That is why I decided to try this. I have very hairy legs and I used to have to shave every day. I use this every 2-3 weeks. Ingrown hair is a problem, but there is nothing I can do about that. This is a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is more painful than waxing and the results aren&#x27;t as good as waxing. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this or any epilator.</li>
    <li> Charged it for a day but the light never turned green (isn&#x27;t it supposed to do that?) Anyway it still worked well tried one arm then did both armpits. I had already read several reviews and videos that mentioned the pain so I wasn&#x27;t surprised but yeah it hurt, and it pulled a few hairs in the armpit so hard it bled a tiny bit, but it stopped like 30 seconds later. The reviews also say that the first time hurts the most so I am not worried, definitely keeping this because I HATE shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> BEST EPILATOR EVER... NO problems whats so ever.. It simple and amazing..At first it hurt a bit but after my second use it hurt less since the hairs grew back very thin. I have recommended to family and friends..</li>
    <li> honestly, this product and related are in many ways better than any other method of hair removal, (other than the laser or other advanced methods.) let me count the ways...&lt;br /&gt;1) no more buying anything!! it&#x27;s a one time investment, recharging is simple, you&#x27;re set with just a payment of $48, for a year, 5, or even 10 (if you don&#x27;t break it or something).&lt;br /&gt;2) and unlike the harmful effects of shaving (thicker faster hair growth), you get much slower growth, less or the same amount as your ingrown. if you get the cream that&#x27;s recommended, it&#x27;s even less!&lt;br /&gt;3) another point against shaving; it&#x27;s 100% safe! no risk of razor cuts, even if you grab skin, it&#x27;s child friendly safe. unlike waxing, you don&#x27;t risk in harming your skin, there&#x27;s no heating, or cutting or buying cloths or making messes, it&#x27;s clean, safe, and the only thing it hurts or grabs is hair!! isn&#x27;t that something?&lt;br /&gt;4) the more you use it, the faster the hair is removed, and the less it hurts. I&#x27;ve been using my electric tweezer by this same company for my lips and chin, and it&#x27;s so easy now, it&#x27;s just a 20 sec routine every week. and don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t have to wait till hair grows back or anything, if you feel or see small specs of hair, just tweeze away! (although i recommend getting a smaller version for the face, trust me, that&#x27;ll be worth every cent as well.)&lt;br /&gt;5) ok, so it hurts, so what? so does laser, so does wax, and even though shaving doesnt, there&#x27;s still those cuts. the pain is bearable, it&#x27;s like getting shots, except it&#x27;s easier to bare. you just have to suck in your breath, and flex your muscles, the pain will strengthen you! besides, it just hurts the first few times, then you get used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt much; it&#x27;s actually less pain than plucking eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;6) perfect for the lazy girl who doesn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of taking this and that out, apply this, wait for that, you just breeze the thing over your arms and legs, and the hair goesaway like magic! and it&#x27;s unbelivably protable, you can remove hair: in the bathroom, in your own room, in a closet, your car, in the middle of the woods, in someone else&#x27;s bathroom, on the plane... you get the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one vs the corded one: trust me, this IS the corded one! except it also can be cordless, you can use it while it&#x27;s hooked up, so even if it&#x27;t not charged, you can still used it while it&#x27;s plugged in, the bonus is that you also use it in other places where there isn&#x27;t an outlet. its kind of like asking which one is better; a corded phone or a cell phone.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail today. Opened it. Used it on my underarm which was pretty hairy since I rarely took care of my underarm during winter cuz it took too long. Wow, this thing works great. It cleaned up my pits in under a minute and no more bumps. Right now my pits are pretty bumpy because I used to tweeze, but hopefully with time they&#x27;ll be smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my upper lip for super fine hair. It was pretty painful for the upper lip and difficult to maneuver because the head of the epilator is too big. But I did it anyway and it also worked (with the pain). When using it on the upper lip area, my skin was a little irritated and a bit red, but I think that&#x27;s normal since the skin in that area is very sensitive. I suggest using epilator on upper lip right before bed so that the skin has time to calm down. I may consider getting the slim version for the upper lip since the slim version has smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this device on my legs. Definitely WORKED great. Not much pain at all, and I actually enjoyed running the epilator on my legs. I&#x27;ve only shaved my legs and never waxed before. Usually I got a few shaving cuts on my legs every time I shaved, and I only shaved when I&#x27;m soaking in a bath. With this thing, no more cuts on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m gonna go tell my mom and sister to get one. Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use the Emjoi Soft Caress on my upper lip, underarms, arms, and legs. It&#x27;s a bit painful at first, but the results are completely worth it. I&#x27;m pleased that I never have to buy another razor again, and I love that this unit doesn&#x27;t require batteries. Just charge and go! Make sure you read the directions first so you can get the best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-My skin was smooth and hairless for about 2-3 weeks! The hair grows back very fine instead of coarse and thick.&lt;br /&gt;-One time purchase for many months/years of hair removal. Once you buy this epilator, you won&#x27;t need to buy batteries or razors.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is very sleek and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with useful accessories such as the massage finger and a brush for cleaning the unit. Also comes with a little exfoliator pad and a little travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Although you only have to do it once every 2 weeks or so, it&#x27;s time consuming because you need to run the unit over the area several times to remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve found that I got a few ingrown hairs, but my skin is already prone to that whether I&#x27;m shaving or epilating. Perhaps it&#x27;s not really the Emjoi&#x27;s fault. You might want to buy the aftercare lotion to prevent ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this product was worth my money. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase if necessary.</li>
    <li> LOVE this epilator. this is my first epilator. It hurts a little, but it hurts wayy less then waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it can be used corded or cordless.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like 32 tweezers is the perfect sweet spot, where it&#x27;s still fase enough, and not as painful, as pulling out with 72 twizzers (I would imagine, pulling more at once would hurt more),&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even think it takes that much time. I JUST got mine today, and I JUST tried it for the first time, so I was pausing in between frequently, especially because I was doing my underarms. For a starter, I handled even the underarms just fine, it&#x27;s not painfree, but it&#x27;s not that painful either. totally love it, and would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> OMG. This product is fantastic. I never shave because I get rashes and my skin gets all red so my other options was either wax or do the ( at the time ) silk epil, waxing hurts and I didn&#x27;t like the surprise that I didn&#x27;t know when they were going to pull and hurt me. So I&#x27;ve used the Silk Epil for several years even though it hurt and broke the hair more than it pulled it from the root. When it was time to replace my old machine I looked on the internet for reviews and found this one had pretty good reviews so decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using this one for 3 months now and it&#x27;s day and night from my previous one: it doesn&#x27;t hurt when I use it, it&#x27;s like the pain is going from 90% to 15%, it&#x27;s amazing, it actually pulls the hair from the root so I don&#x27;t have to do it as often or get as much ingrown hair as I used to. I also use my epilator for every area in my body: legs, arm pits and bikini area and, again, the pain is minimal and tottaly worth it. Hope my review helps. For those of us that has or had the Silk Epil this one is an amazing upgrade. That&#x27;s just my opinion!</li>
    <li> My best friend introduce the epilator to me. She saw reviews online and told me about it because i told her how much i dislike the prickly feel of the hair after a day of shaving. I bought this and I ABSOLUTELY love it. The sound is VERY intimidating (  it sounds as if a lawn mower and a vacuum cleaner had a baby_ YEAH Sounds WEIRD AND SCARY, my eyes almost popped out of my eyes when i turned the damn thing on)  but its not as painful as the reviews I saw or read online. But then again everyone endures different amount of pain, for me it did not hurt at all... I am not saying it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, i am just saying its not painful. Epilator does exactly what it said it does and the results says it all. Smooth legs and NO MORE HAIRY ARMPITS!!!! YESS!!!!! ( cheers ) I personally feel so much more confident. As crazy as it sounds, i wish i have more hair on me so i can use the epilator more often ..........  Easy to clean after use, compact so it&#x27;s great for travel ( bringing it to Wisconsin Dells!!) , hairs grows out WAY thinner ..  I recommended my little sister to buy it so i recommend you to purchase one too.  I also recommend not to share it with anyone else... ITS GROSS....  GREAT PRODUCT!! It will be the best thing you bought on amazon! because it was for me .  PLUS, its purple and pink... THATS PRINCESS COLORS! SO CUTE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never purchased an epilator before, and I decided to try it after reading the reviews.  I like it--not the most comfortable experience at first, but really not bad.  Nice not to have to shave all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a great little gadget that I wish I knew about years ago. I heard that this model is not as painful as other brands/models, which is why I ordered this one. I can confidently say that this epilator does NOT cause a great deal of pain. Then again, maybe I just have a high tolerance for it? Don&#x27;t be discouraged by those who say that it is very painful....that is just not true for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only used this on my legs, but it works fantastically. It does not cut the hairs in half (most of the time). I have not had ANY ingrown hairs. I have only had this product for about two months so I can&#x27;t rate how durable it is over time. I have yet to try it on my underarms...simply because I think it would hurt too much for that sensitive area. Overall though, great product. I highly recommend it for a first-time epilator.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Yuck. This Emjoi epilator gave me ingrown hairs all over my legs. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it works beautifully for underarms.  What&#x27;s frustrating about the reaction on my legs to the Emjoi is that I followed the product&#x27;s directions to the letter, plus regularly use Nads with no problems at all ... but was just looking for something that could remove shorter stubble, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait as many days to get smooth legs. Oh well.  For me, this is an armpit-only product.  Back to Nads I go.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Bought mine 4 months ago and have only had to use it 3 times. I am a woman with very thick hair under my arms. Using razors was annoying because irritating stubble would grow back within a day or two. The first two uses hurt like a mother so you have to go slow and take your time. But 30 minutes for results that last three weeks is a good payoff. I tried to use on my legs, but that took forever so I just wax my legs. After the first two uses my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quick, and comes in thin.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.I&#x27;m  not going to lie at first I was skeptical and not sure if I even wanted to buy it but then I read the reviews which didn&#x27;t help much because they were mixed and saw some beauty gurus on Youtube explaining how to use it properly and stuff and I realized it was worth a try. I also had a $30 gift card which helped.(&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted this one or the red one which has 72 tweezers but I got this one because me being a newb at epilating I figured if I could handle this then maybe sometime in the future I&#x27;d get the bigger one. So my experience with this one was a god one. I&#x27;m glad I bought this epilator. When I first used it I was like this isn&#x27;t so bad but I only did my arms I didn&#x27;t shave my legs and it makes it easier if you shave and wait a day or two before epilating that way it&#x27;s less painful and easier for the tweezers to pick up your hair. It is uncomfortable,I&#x27;m not going to lie but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it&#x27;s just you could feel your hair being picked up by the tweezers. It also helps if you know the correct way of doing it you can&#x27;t press it down on your skin like it&#x27;s a razor you just have to glide it along your skin and it&#x27;ll do it&#x27;s job.The results I got were amazing. My skin was smooth and I didn&#x27;t have stubble which is awesome. I dislike having to spend time shaving and get out of the shower and then have stubble.</li>
    <li> I am a bit confused cause says rechargeable but it only works plugged in .</li>
    <li> It took a few tries to figure out what angle to hold it at, but i eventually got it. I shave everyday b/c i can&#x27;t stand underarm or leg hair, but the hair has to grow a little bit to actually use the epilator. I love that it&#x27;s cordless and you can charge it by plugging it in instead of new batteries. I thought it would save time vs. shaving, but it is still time consuming especially if you want to get a lot of hairs. One pro that i like about it is that the  tweezed hair take a while to grow back</li>
    <li> \\&quot;After reading the reviews, i was scared to try it. But oh my goodness, it hurts only a little...very little! Since i wax my arms, legs, and underarms, i didn&#x27;t have a problem at all!!! But if it&#x27;s the first epilating, i suggest to use Emjoi first. Once the pain is ok, go on to Braun!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (06/08/2012): at times, my skin gets caught in it leaving me with bruises. But, it&#x27;ll go away...maybe i need to charge it more...hmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (07/05/2012): i thought this would really help not having to have waxes but oh my goodness-my skin got stuck twice-this time on my arm and underarm..ahhhhhh. think again before buying this!</li>
    <li> My cousin has PCOS and was looking for various options regarding epilation.  I had done lots of research and videos and reviews of epilators.  I found great reviews about this product and the Emjoi Emagine.  I went back and forth and decided to get this one as it was the one I got for my cousin and she loved it!  Plus the Emagine looked somewhat bulky.  It works well but it requires several passes and sometimes misses a few strands.  I found myself have to change angle positions to pick up one hair.  It is uncomfortable not painful.  After the initial sting, you get used to it.  I haven&#x27;t tried my underarms (and I&#x27;ve heard that is the most painful area).  So far, I&#x27;ve done part of a leg, face and bikini area.  Razor definitely gave me a cleaner shave (and faster process) but epilator is spreading out the time between next use.  I shaved a few days ago and will need to remove hair soon whereas I used my epilator around the same time and am still going strong (which is a definite plus).  I do like the cordless option as well (can&#x27;t comment on how long charge lasts because I&#x27;ve only used it once).&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, a good product.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so maybe with experience, I&#x27;ll rave more about it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros &#x3D; long time between use, clean (no gel/cream), portable&lt;br /&gt;Cons &#x3D; can take awhile</li>
    <li> I decided to shave one leg and epilate the other one to determine whether I preferred the pain and time consumption on an occasional basis to the once to twice a week painless shaving.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I haven&#x27;t owned an epilator since the old coil Epilady. So, I was quite surprised at the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; level. The hair was removed rather quickly and the pain was possibly a third of what I remember from the older version. I should admit here that I am a terrible baby when it comes to pain. I cried when I got my ears pierced and I have a tiny rose tattoo that I have been swearing for years I would change to a larger one. But, alas...pain.&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness, it has been over a week and there is no hair growth on the epilated leg and about 1/4\\&quot; on the shaved leg. I do recall that it took quite a while in the past for the epilated hair to grow back and it always came in more sparsely. I also have a few areas that the hair didn&#x27;t seem to come back after about a year of using the epilady so long ago, so I&#x27;m sure that I will continue to use this and it will be well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this! Easy to use and has good quality tweezers. I use it on my underarms, legs, and bikini area. You get used to the pain after a few runs. The only con about epilators in general is that you sometimes get ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Works well, however leaves little bumps over the skin which are not such a good look.  Eventually went back to shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator because I got tired of shaving my legs and dealing with stubble. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this item since it keeps my legs smooth way longer than shaving. It&#x27;s also the cheaper and more convenient alternative to getting waxed at the salon. I only use this on my legs because I tried my armpits and it just hurt too much. It&#x27;s my first epilator so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to...just my experience with this one. Here go&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST TIME&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the epilator, I thought it was a little loud and the rotating \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; kinda scared me. I&#x27;m used to it now though and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. Also, as a forewarning, the first time you use it it will hurt like hell. Especially toward your ankles and knees. It does however hurt less each time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use the epilator for the first time you should:&lt;br /&gt;  -shave your legs really well in the area you want to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;  -let your hair grow for 2-3 days to get an even stubble. Too short hair, and the epilator can&#x27;t grab the hair. Too long hair and the epilator could just break the hair.&lt;br /&gt;  -I find that short and slow up/down movements work best. This allows you to do several passes over the same area for more effective removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE/AFTER EPILATING&lt;br /&gt;You should epilate shortly after you take a shower. Your skin will be opened up and the hair will come out easier.&lt;br /&gt;After epilating use some type of after shave/epilating solution to help with ingrown hairs and red bumps. I use:&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin Liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY/SPEED&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 speeds: 1 (medium) and 2 (fast)....Pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It has a rechargeable battery and keeps a good charge for about 4-6 uses on my lower legs only. I use speed 1 for the first few uses then speed 2 when the battery starts to loose it&#x27;s charge.</li>
    <li> Epilators can be very scary, intimidating and painful but thankfully, with this epilator I have not experienced any of the mentioned  other than intimidation because of the noise. This is not the first epilator I have purchased in my late teens about eight years ago I purchased an epilator through a home shopping channel. I was so excited when I received it that I didn&#x27;t think twice when I turned it on and began to use it. The ladies used it on live t.v. without any sign of pain, so naturally I would have the same \\&quot;bit uncomfortable but no pain what so ever\\&quot; experience, right? NO, NO, NO! First swipe and I cried out in pain! But, I had spent a weeks pay check (pt after school job and almost double the price I paid for this unit) on this thing and I was going to make it work! I was defeated. I sent the torture machine back. I always wanted to try epilating again but my hubby would always remind me how painful the experience was and he was right but shaving wasn&#x27;t an option any longer. My skin could no longer take it, especially the under arms and bikini area. I&#x27;m almost obsessed with having the area under my arms hair free and smooth at all time even in the winter time when not wearing sleeveless tops. I believe that I have to use more deodorant and feel as though it doesn&#x27;t works as well when there is stubble. I gave in and finally got this epilator. Over a month before I had stopped shaving and just tweezed the hair under the arms but that is a long and dreadful task. I braced myself for the same painful experience as before and was completely shocked when I didn&#x27;t feel one bit of pain! I can&#x27;t explain why but I don&#x27;t experience any pain when using this epilator underarms. Bikini area isn&#x27;t as unnoticeable but I can tolerate it very well. I did wimp and take a OTC pain killer an hour before using it near the bikini area. I have even convinced my niece and mom. They both found very little if any discomfort, again when using underarms. My husband jokes with me that Ican&#x27;t let my epilator out of my sight. Honestly, best investment aside from absolute necessities! I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair in any area. Shaving caused the worst ingrown hairs. Painful enough to bring me to tears more than a few times. I don&#x27;t use nearly as much antiperspirant as before. If anything were to happen to this unit, I would repurchase time and time again. I truly suggest you don&#x27;t grow out the hair completely in any area before using for the first time. You can use this within a couple of days of shaving and please do as instructed and exfoliate your skin! It makes a huge difference. Also, body hair doesn&#x27;t always grown in one direction especially under the arms so to get the best results don&#x27;t just epilate in one direction. Make sure you hold the skin taunt when using or the tweezers will pinch. The first few times you may feel discomfort afterwards, I applied a topical pain ointment then. Brings me such relief to always be smooth, not worry about nicks and ingrown hairs . Thankfully, I&#x27;ve never experienced much darkening from shaving but now the areas where I remove hair are even lighter than when I shaved.</li>
    <li> Its a very good product and Its worth the money but till today I only use it for my underarm I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hurt there or on my bikini line but it does a little bit from my knee down and way to much from the knee up so its good. But sometimes you have to watch out for your head hair if it is loose it will get stuck in it and reduce speed, Over all It was ok.</li>
    <li> Works great. Hurts like a bitch, but works.</li>
    <li> This thing is like a modern day ancient torture device. Moderately effective, in my opinion not worth the pain. It&#x27;s actaully humurous how bad it was.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this unless you have a serious tolerance for pain. It is the most annoying pain! Not worth it! I would rather shave!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the pain. Just take a pain killer and you will barely feel it. The amount of time it takes is what gets me. It takes about an hour to do just one leg. The hair takes a long time to grow back, I have waxed and had the hair grow back within a week. With this it was about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> To start off with this thing hurts. HOWEVER, having read the reviews I was expecting the pain and even managed to get past that initial fear of the Emjoi Caress despite the extremely loud noise it produces. I started off trying to remove the hair from my armpits since that was the only hair that was long enough to be plucked. I definitely do not recommend starting with the armpits as they are more tender than the legs and arms but somehow I finished both pits and have fallen in love with this product! Waxing is too costly for me and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a salon that actually plucks the hair rather than just tearing it. The things we women do to look nice *smh* lol but I definitely recommend this one and I am very glad I started with this 36 tweezer instead of the 72 tweezer. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I thought it very painful, and maybe it&#x27;s because&lt;br /&gt;my leg hair is very course?  There are sensitive areas on the legs too, where it was almost unbearable.  On the upside, the hair didn&#x27;t come back in for some time, so that was nice, but I won&#x27;t be using it again. Probably a more appropriate tool for someone with finer hair.</li>
    <li> I have had a cheaper Emjoi for about 5 yrs. and it still charges but doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it was time to upgrade. After reading the reviews I decided to get this one, it is so convenient to take camping, or sit outside and epilate my legs, I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in years! So far it stays charged a long time, and seems to do a much better job than my cheaper one, which was also cordless. Cordless is really the way to go! At first it did hurt to epilate, but I just started out a little at a time,and now I never have pain, anywhere! I found this one doesn&#x27;t take very long to remove hair, I do my legs, underarms, and face, especially under my chin and it gets the tiniest hairs..Love my Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this little machine business. I have tried waxing, and it&#x27;s messy and time consuming. Did I mention messy? Sometimes it didn&#x27;t even work (at home use, never went to a salon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on Youtube I saw a bunch of people with this SPECIFIC epilator. I usually don&#x27;t buy in to people with their whole \\&quot;GET THIS PRODUCT\\&quot; because they are being paid to advertise. But I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my arms, legs, my stomach (lol) and armpits. I&#x27;ll just tell you my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arms : Great. It was painful at first, but when you concentrate you don&#x27;t really get bothered by it. However, there&#x27;s a specific way you have to move the epilator, or else the hair will just break off, or the hair won&#x27;t be tweezed. The thing is, it takes forever to get an area. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s small, but I have to repeatedly go over, even a small area, to make sure the area is clean. Specific areas are really sensitive like the opposite of the elbow area and the wrist area. But I really don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s just as time consuming as waxing. That&#x27;s why I gave 1 star off. I expected this to get off the hairs in atleast 3-4 shots. No, it takes constant changing of the epilator&#x27;s motions, up and down, blah blah. I still do it though, I feel more confident which is what I wanted, because I had thick black hair on my arms, and I&#x27;m really skinny. It takes like a week to grow back fully. I think it&#x27;s because I still don&#x27;t have to technique right. I&#x27;ll talk about that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting some after-epilation cream or something, because the area does get red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs : HURT LIKE HELL. I have really thick hair on my legs. Unlike the arms, the hair on my legs are tweezed out in about 1-2 shots, but it&#x27;s incredibly painful. I hope to overcome this one day. Because the results on a specific area was excellent. I did it on both my legs. The area I epilated on my legs were the toughest areas, the front middle part of my leg. Thehair took weeks to grow back and the hair came back VERY fine. I didn&#x27;t think this would happen, seeing the results of my arms. But I seemed to do something right with my legs. It is just so painful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armpits : Surprisingly, my armpits did not hurt AT ALL. I hate pain, and I was scared to do it in this area. But it didn&#x27;t hurt at all I kid you not. I would feel the hair&#x27;s pulling, but I didn&#x27;t feel pain. I was amazed. However, just like the arms, IT TOOK FOREVER. I kept having to go around the area and try different motions. And it STILL didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. Just like the arms, I&#x27;m going to have to find the right technique to really get all the hairs out. But, the hairs did grow finer, I am happy about that! I just looked under my arm, I can barely see the hair but it&#x27;s there. Before it was thick and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stomach : Lol. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to do this, but I was like, if I can handle this on my legs, why not! It was actually embarrassing, because when I was younger I shaved it and it just looked horrible. Well, this little thing saved me from more embarrassment. And I got the technique right. I just let it glide and it took out everything and for about 5 weeks it didn&#x27;t grow back and the hair was as fine as ever. I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion : Time consuming, good for beginners (or small areas), you have to get the right technique (motions) to get the hair out without breaking or not getting the hair out at all. I recommend up, down, opposite of hair direction and circular motion. Circular motions seems to get the extra hairs you missed. Also, get a cream for after epilation because you do get all red and bumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it works great with short hairs. the thing is, I noticed it works even better on long hairs (not too long). I saw better results with longer hairs.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with my epilator. On the one hand, I love not having to worry about shaving every day. But on the other hand, I am a complete wuss when it comes to pain. Not going to lie, epilating does hurt. Don&#x27;t worry, it gets better. The first time I tried it, I wanted to cry before I even got a quarter of my leg done but now I can do from the knee down without a problem. Upper thigh sucks though. The closer you get to your bikini area the worse it feels, apparently. Underarms don&#x27;t really hurt for me, but since the hair there grows in all sorts of crazy directions you have to keep flipping the epilator around and worry about ingrown hairs. Still better than shaving! Especially now that it&#x27;s tank top and short shorts season.</li>
    <li> It works on fine hair &amp; thick hair. Skin feels really smooth after use.</li>
    <li> definitely uses this on arms and legs! Your arms and legs feel softer! I highly recommend Emjoi products!! Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this bad boy, I prepped my self for a world of pain. I watched youtube videos and gathered information online so I could be ready. I read that epilating the armpits is the most painful, so I made sure to follow the advice of taking a hot shower and popping a pain killer before hand. I don&#x27;t know if it was the adrenaline in combination with the painkiller, but the pain wasn&#x27;t as awful as people made it seem. I didn&#x27;t wince at all. I have very course hair, so I expected to keel over in pain--never happened. I was able to do one under arm in under twenty minutes. The only reason I haven&#x27;t done my other armpit is because I feel loopy from the Ibuprofen. I&#x27;ll definitely do it tomorrow and see. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Has any lady used this product to remove the hair in the pubic area, not just in the bikini line? I would really like to know your perspective of this item in that specific area. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I will admit that it hurts at first, but I absolutely love this thing! So much more effective than shaving. Pulls the hair out by the root. When I shaved my armpits, I&#x27;d have to shave the very next day. It&#x27;s day 3 after I used this epilator under my arms and no sign of hair! I love it.</li>
    <li> Like this product but have trouble using it on my shins</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this is that it take awhile to get every hair, I wish it would get more with one time over.</li>
    <li> Product does not work as well as the cheeper one.  You have to be carefull my chin got caught and it broke the skin.</li>
    <li> I may not have given this product a chance, I sent it back.  It was very painful, and I didn&#x27;t see the same results as the product claimed, the hair regrowth was the same as waxing.  Yes, I do wax myself, so it is not like I am afraid of a little pain.</li>
    <li> I have the epilator for over a year now and I use it several times a month. It works well and does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator and I have owned it for about a week. I would like to say the package came on time.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself... Isn&#x27;t too great. This is my first epilator and I have read reviews on it as the \\&quot;best cordless epilator\\&quot;.... in reality mine doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minuets. I&#x27;m not sure if mine is defective or it&#x27;s just how it is. It takes me about 30 minuets to do one leg which doesn&#x27;t bother me. It does an ok job, sometimes I have to go back with tweezers to pull out hairs that it just can&#x27;t pluck. Works great on my underarms, the only thing is I really have to grow them out before the epilator will actually work on them. Does not work on my upper lip hair at all! My upper lip hair was sadly visible and long enough to tweeze out without problem but it just would not work on my upper lip no matter how long I tried it out and it would irritate my skin. As for the bikini area, I did not try it out. I would imagine it would be too painful. I have noticed that sometimes it breaks hairs instead of plucking. Also the faster the speed, the less it would hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 3 our of 5... It&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> First time user.  Have been using this product for a couple of months now, and I have nothing bad to say about it. In fact, I have less hair growth. The cordless emjoi was extremely helpful because I don&#x27;t have to stay near an outlet, or lock myself in a room where i need total privacy. Such a great product!!</li>
    <li> Never using a razor again.  The Emjoi Epilator is the way to go for smooth under arms, very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It works, but it is a bit painful at first</li>
    <li> it arrived very fast ,&lt;br /&gt;it works very well , smooth and effective painful at first then you get used it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!! Yes, it hurts at first. But by the second/third time, it doesn&#x27;t. It cleans out every hair in seconds! I use this for my armpits mostly. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it on my legs and underarms and it really helps to avoid ingrown hairs. I used to have to shave my underarms everyday and now I use this once a week. :)</li>
    <li> I have waited long enough to purchase an epilator. I had gotten complacent with&lt;br /&gt;shaving and using depilatories as I wanted to avoid the expected pain of using an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience using an epilator was at the age of 6 or 7 and it was out&lt;br /&gt;of curiousness looking through all of the beauty items my Mom had in our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Well much to my surprise the thing hurt a ton! Forward to today and I finally bought&lt;br /&gt;one after doing a lot of research as I do with most of my purchases big or small. I wanted&lt;br /&gt;something that would be much more effective than shaving or depilatories and this is it you guys!&lt;br /&gt;It works! After using it, I have been hairless for weeks. Yeah it can feel a little uncomfortable at&lt;br /&gt;times especially when your skin is dry but you get more comfortable the more frequent you use it.&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of what it feels like think of tweezing multiple hairs at one time. Pricking your&lt;br /&gt;skin and tugging your hairs. It seems scary but it&#x27;s worth it and it&#x27;s not as bad as you think. The&lt;br /&gt;result is smooth and hairless skin and who doesn&#x27;t want that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the epilator you&#x27;ll receive a cleaning brush, a loufah pad for exfoliating, a charger,&lt;br /&gt;instructions, an attachment to supposedly make epilating more comfortable, and a cute little&lt;br /&gt;white pouch to put everything in. I clean it after every use and sterilize it with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing really negative I have to state about the item other than it&#x27;s a bit hard to&lt;br /&gt;clean the hair out of it&#x27;s nooks and crannies. Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful item&lt;br /&gt;for the results that it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating is the way to go! It&#x27;s simple to use, affordable, and you can do it in the&lt;br /&gt;privacy of your home. I love mine and will continue to use it as long as I have hair to get rid of!</li>
    <li> A lot of people said it&#x27;s really painful when you start, but I found that it felt more like a little zap of electricity not really painful. the key is to do small motions with it. If you just try to do one big motion it&#x27;s going to be a lot more painful.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not a waxer, in fact I&#x27;m 28 and I&#x27;ve only waxed 2 times ever in my life, once was when I got married 8 years ago, and the other was about a week ago. (I got fed up with shaving every day - every other day.) I started waxing last week and didn&#x27;t even finish my legs, I did half and gave up because it was taking so long, and I had to go over every spot 3 or 4 times. I tried warm wax and wax strips, I gave up on the warm wax because it was making a mess, and the strips pulled off the top layer of skin which was painful for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;  If you wax this will be a money saver since you buy it once and don&#x27;t have to repurchase it, and if you&#x27;re a shaver you really need to switch. It&#x27;s a time saver! Just so you know what type of leg hair and underarm hair I have, I can shave in the morning and by 6 p.m. I&#x27;ve got enough stubble that it&#x27;s irritating. Using the epilator I would say is less painful than waxing (at least for me) and the effects last longer than shaving, so it&#x27;s a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;  I just received mine yesterday and I used it right away. The noise I don&#x27;t think is as bad as other people say. It&#x27;s more like the sound of an electric razor if you&#x27;ve ever been around anyone that uses one or have used one yourself. I used it on the remaining hair (that didn&#x27;t get removed with the wax). I also used it on my under arms. I had plucked my under arms so that there wasn&#x27;t a lot left to get just so I could get used to the pain of pulling under arm hairs and I used it on what I didn&#x27;t get with the tweezers. It wasn&#x27;t actually painful to me, but I know a lot of people are actually sensitive under their arms.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works really well. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found it. It does hurt when you use it for the first time. but then it gets much better because you&#x27;re used to the pain. However, It works so well. I&#x27;d recommend it for any body. If you got some unwanted hair.girls...you need to have it...!!!</li>
    <li> It hurts to pull out hair using this. It left bumps on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was very amazing at how fast it got here (3 days sooner than expected)! I have just finished using the Soft Caress, and it works amazingly with minimal pain. This epilator does not cut hairs like I&#x27;ve heard others sometimes do, and it quickly and gently pulls each hair up by the root. In a few places on my legs and armpits, I had to go over my legs twice to get one or two missed hairs, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. This has been my first epilator, and I am extremely pleased with the results. At first, I was frightened because of hearing that epilating is painful and the sound (a simple buzzing similar to the sound of an electric razor) was slightly intimidating, but the actual process is far less frightening that sometimes led to believe. I have a low tolerance for pain, and using this epilator wasn&#x27;t that bad at all. It was no worse than regular tweezing, and in some spots it actually hurt less than getting my eyebrows done. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> So when i first go this epilator i was super excited--i got tired of spending 15 extra minutes in the shower shaving my legs. When i turned it on however, it sounded so intimidating I literally could not do it. After watching motivating youtube videos, i decided to first try it on my arms, which have thinner hair (and a LOT of it) and it was painful, but not as painful as i expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it took me around an hour to do the first one because of the pain and i waited until the next day to do the other. Today, a few weeks after getting my epilator I decided to give it a go on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;HOLY CRAP it hurt so badly, the pain I cannot even describe. I have extremely extremely coarse hair and naturally dry skin (you cant use lotion before hand) so even after doing it within 5 minutes of being out of the shower it still hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep pushing through with it, the searing pain makes you feel numb to it almost...I can&#x27;t really describe it, but you get somewhat used to it. If you stop in the middle and start up again, it hurts all over again and you have to keep doing it until you get to the \\&quot;numb\\&quot; stage for it not to hurt so badly. I haven&#x27;t even finished one leg, but what i have finished is extremely soft and i love it! What I&#x27;m doing right now to help me is playing some fast paced music to pump me up while i do it, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger lasts a long time too, but the tweezers go faster when its plugged in compared to when its not plugged in, no matter how charged it is. Overall, I do say you should get this if you are on the fence, apparently, the first time epilating is the worst, then your hair follicles get damaged so the hair grows thinner and plucking it is hardly painful at all.&lt;br /&gt;cant wait until i get to that point</li>
    <li> At first i was sooooo scared and my armpits wodent stop sweting and i was such a coword cuz of that annoying noise, but then i was like F it and i did it. It does hurt like a B but then i got used to it an also on my legs and it works great. Still trien to get used to the ones on my bikini sides since it hurts more then the others :(.But i still love it and my hair dosent grow for a month, it will but very short, do recomend for everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! Was a bit hesitant at first to buy it but I eventually did. I was getting tired of plucking my armpits hair so I was looking for something that can do the job fast. This is it! It does hurt a little at first but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fine. It takes less than a minute to do each arm pit and that&#x27;s exactly what I needed. If you&#x27;re not afraid of a little pain, and does all the work that you needed done, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Yep, it pinches your SKIN easily (more likely in under arm and bikini area where skin is not so tight). It doesn&#x27;t really hurt, it&#x27;s much rather surprising and, of course, very annoying... And it&#x27;s not as fast as I was hoping for, neither... I returned it.</li>
    <li> Incredible. I love it. I have used the much smaller cheaper one for years and when it went out I decided to order this one. I do use it on my face and yes, it is painful but you do eventually get used to it. This one gets EVERYTHING, even the peach fuzz. It is very powerful and my other one used batteries so I am very happy with being able to plug this one in to charge.</li>
    <li> the speed of delivery, I could not compare with others, It came the second day after I ordered. the quality? well it is 36 Gold plated. althugh it hurts first time used (this is her first time using epilator), it gets better after few trial, with its 36 gold plated material, it leave almost no irritation on the skin, as she said</li>
    <li> I  used this as soon as i got it a month back, although it was painful it did work so i kept it and now after one month i again used it and realized it needs an adopter but it didnt come with one. I should have checked as soon as I got it but assumed it is battery operated and now i past the 30days and cant return it,so have to look for a adopter in some local stores.</li>
    <li> works wonderful. can be cordless!  I have had several different types of epilators.  I love this one.. great price, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have owned. Had the first one for many years. I tend to do it only once or twice a year in summer since I wear long pants most of the time. The first time through I usually end up with some rash on my legs but it calms down fairly rapidly and I don&#x27;t find it painful. I do have tough skin though. Even for 62.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and after watching people&#x27;s reaction to them on youtube I was a little scared, but had to try it cause saving wasn&#x27;t a option anymore. And I&#x27;m glad. My legs haven&#x27;t been this hair free for so long ever and when the hair starts growing back you will notice a big difference that it&#x27;s alot thinner and that was after one. The hardest ares for me is the bikini line and under my arms and thats because one the extra skin so hard to hold taut and two the design isn&#x27;t friendly to curves really. But it gets it done without complaint. It is truely softer than others cause I don&#x27;t think it hurts that bad at all hence the fact i am trying to use it all over my body. Ladies you will love this and i think every woman needs it. Throw away the razors, nair, and that messy wax. It&#x27;s epilating time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Emjoi Epilators for a while now. I own the Emjoi Optima and really liked it, but I wanted another one because of the shape. Even though the Optima is great, the shape that it came in was a bit difficult to maneuver around. As for this Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator, it&#x27;s the shape of an epilator I&#x27;ve been looking for! It fits in the palm of your hand nice and easily. The two different speeds is also nice. It comes in a pouch that includes a cleaning brush, the epilator itself, a massaging finger attachment, a cover for the tweezers as well as the charging cord. While the epilator is rechargeable, meaning it can be used without the cord, it can also be used with the cord while charging. It was a bit difficult to figure out how to remove the cover around the tweezers, but finally figured out that you have to squeeze the sides and the cover will pop out so you can attach the massaging finger attachment. (I haven&#x27;t tried the attachment yet.) Overall, the shipping process was easy and quick. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for an epilator!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a waxer for years (in fact I&#x27;ve never shaved my legs) but I was always dreading having to wax not because of the pain but because of the mess.  I have very fine hair and can easily last 6-8 weeks between waxing, but still, hated doing it and could never find a perfect kit.  This thing is amazing - no pain (or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to waxing), quick (I can do it in 5 minutes), lasts for about 5 weeks, no dreadful thoughts, cleans up in 1 minute - pretty awesome.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of months, so maybe the ingrown hair problem will surface eventually, but so far no problems.  The only thing is that probably because my hair is so fine, I need to give a couple of tries to some stubborn hairs.  Probably if I had thick coarse hair, it would pluck it out from the first try.  But even with that issue, I&#x27;m still done in 5 minutes with no sticky cleanup. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this hair remover.  It does a good job pulling out the hair off the surface but it very painfull.  But compare to waxing, this product is better... it remove the hair not the skin and it&#x27;s way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I recently just found out about epilators through youtube and was very excited about purchasing one to try out. I just received this one yesterday and tried  it out on my legs today. After going over my legs many times, they are still not smooth. No matter what speed or how slow or fast I go, I just cannot seem to get them smooth. I&#x27;m hoping I will have better luck with my underarm and bikini area but I&#x27;m not counting on it. What a disappointing purchase &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> After a bit of a break between epilation sessions, I find that my skin is more used to it and I am able to write my final review now. The emjoi is in my experience the most effective hair removal technique I&#x27;ve done yet, compared to shaving or waxing at least. I feel smoother than I ever have in the areas I was able to easily reach. On that note, I find it a bit of a disadvantage that it is curved, and the bumpers on the side don&#x27;t allow you to place it as flat as might be needed for some areas. Also it seems to \\&quot;spit\\&quot; hairs back onto my skin after a while, despite my cleaning it every few moments. Mine also doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge very long, although I believe this is due to a faulty outlet and not the actual product. Personally, I feel that I should have gone for their 72-head device as it may work faster and more effectively, but this isn&#x27;t all that bad. It&#x27;s effective, it just takes more time and effort to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally though, if you&#x27;re finding yourself deciding between this or the Emjoi with 72 heads, I would suggest going with the latter. It costs a bit more, but in my opinion it&#x27;d be well worth the extra.</li>
    <li> i think that its pretty good but,, for thinker courser hair, so not for like you upper lip of facial hair but its good for like the under arm hair and legs and any where else... for finer hair i found it just breaks them and really doesn&#x27;t pull them out...</li>
    <li> Use it one time so far it ok still have to see how it work not sure yet  so far</li>
    <li> I was afraid it would hurt a lot but it&#x27;s bearable.  Yes it feels like rubberband snaps or the same as plucking my eyebrows.  Not bad at all &amp; much better than shaving all the time.</li>
    <li> OK you guys I know my main concern was the pain issue, I even watched a lot of YouTube videos about this product but have no fear! When I first got it I got a little nervous when I turned it on it&#x27;s very loud and sounds painful, but it&#x27;s not! It only feels a bit uncomfortable at first but you get use to it on the first use. Pain level from 1-10, I&#x27;d give it a 1 honestly. I love it! It saves you money and trips to the salon.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time and works as advertised.  Can&#x27;t beat that combo.</li>
    <li> I use it every week and I love it! Its not fake, it came in a unopened package so it lets me know Im getting a steal.</li>
    <li> Love it , product was just as described, at great price and fast shipping very please with it plus its really pretty. :) Totally would recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. I first tried it on my arms. It took hours and I had to keep going over and over the same spots to still not have all hair removed plus it HURTS! I have 2 tattoos and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like. I waxed one arm and used this epilator for the other. Both grew back in the same time and the waxing is sooo much easier. I am planning on returning. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It was a little painful at first; however, after a few use, you become accustommed to it. This was definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> i was so disappointed with this product. i bought it after seeing so many good reviews. i followed the instructions and that crap hurt me. and i have pretty good tolerance for pain ( i have 6 tattoos)very disappointed..</li>
    <li> I love this epilator so much. Soon as it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait till it charged. I never waxed, and it didn&#x27;t hurt. Just a little pinch, nothing to a big deal. I will never shave or use the hair removal creams ever again. My skin is very sensitive, and had bumps and breakouts from shaving and creams.&lt;br /&gt; Not anymore. This epilator is the right size as well. I was going to get the emjoi emagine, but it so expensive and looks bulky. I got the soft caress, because I wanted to remove hair just about every where. Also I can travel with it,and use it corded or cordless. I am absolutley happy with my epilator. Great job emjoi.</li>
    <li> I have only used this on my face and underarms, but it did a great job with both. I don&#x27;t find it very painful but this is my second epilator. I used my previous emjoi for something like 6 years. It works really well on facial hair, but on underarms, I found I had to tug my skin and make so many passes, its easier to just shave. I am incredibly happy with this purchase though!</li>
    <li> This product is great..good for regular hair which is not too light or too coarse. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is you need to go over the skin a few times to make sure you got all the hairs. But it does get all the hair eventually which is why it&#x27;s a great product. Liking my purchase - definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> OK so here goes. I purchased this epilator a few days ago and I was rather surprised by the size! It&#x27;s really small. I was quite skeptical about the concept of tweezers combining with a razor...but went ahead to try it anyway because I&#x27;ve literally tried it all! From manual shaving to electric shaving, to waxing...plucking...you name it. I have quite sensitive skin so when I use products I break out in crazy hives almost. So if you have sensitive skin like me, you can most definitely use this product because it removes hair from the root and uses NO chemicals. Same results as waxing! And the tweezers are hypoallergenic! Anyway I will go ahead and rate this product (1 rating poor and 5 rating excellent) based on what I&#x27;d tried with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Legs - Rating 3.5&lt;br /&gt;OK so ladies...this product DOES indeed remove the hair from the root...BUT...IT IS PAINFUL AS HELL. Especially if it&#x27;s your first time epilating like me. I followed the directions from the little manual but it still didn&#x27;t help ease the pain. The directions state to take a warm bath and exfoliate the skin to help make the process easier and \\&quot;pain-free\\&quot; but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It does remove some hair but not ALL hair. For some reason, the hair I passed had to be passed again, and some of it just got cut low by the tweezers but not removed. As I passed over my knees, I found it father difficult to grasp the knee hairs but that was OK. Backs of legs...not pleasant to say the least! I also did follow some previous review advice about taking aspirin 30 minutes prior to beginning as it does help out somewhat. I rate 3.5 because well...the leg area just was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Armpits - Rating 4.0&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the product, I was anxious to try this under my arms FIRST but decided on the leg test first to ease into it since this is my first time ever epilating. Anyway...the Emoji Soft Caress is LOUD. I don&#x27;t know if all epilators sound this way but the noise itself makes going under almost off putting! Again, cleaned area, exfoliated, took four painkillers this time and went at it. Underarms didn&#x27;t hurt as much as my legs had but it was really hard to see what I was doing. I wished at that moment I had sprang out an extra 10 dollars and gotten the unit with the light feature on it. Anyway, again, it did pull most of the hair from the root while other hairs it just cut which I eventually went back over as my hair grows in different directions in that area. I finally got the hang of it and I was happy with the ending results. As a post treatment, I used about a quarter of Bio Oil to sooth the area. Not so bad but not overly pleasant either. You do bleed a little but that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try my bikini area because to be totally honest, it scared me and that area is really sensitive! Ending this review, the Emoji Soft Caress comes with the Emoji Soft Caress unit, wall charger (can be used plugged or unplugged), a travel bag, cleaning brush, and a brush attachment head called a massaging finger. Overall, it does what it needs to do. I didn&#x27;t do my legs justice so I will try my legs again soon and update on that as soon as the hair is long enough to epilate again! I probably will go ahead and purchase the other Caress unit with the light on it because it&#x27;s really hard to be around heavy light and SEE without perspiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy epilating! :DDunder almost off putting!

    <li> This was my first cordless epilator, I have a corded philips epilator that still works. Compared to the older one, it was a bit slow, but it charged fast and worked fairly good. At some point after 6+ months it just stopped working and had to return it, that is why I don&#x27;t give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I hated this. It was extremely painful, but I figured that would be okay if it worked well at least. I tried it twice, and both times I got the worst ingrown hairs of my life. It was terrible. Some of them were completely inside of my leg, and others grew just below the surface of my skin so that it looks like I had long hairs plastered to my leg permanently. Finally I had to go to a salon and have them remove the gross mess. Terrible. After I bought it I heard from a friend that the same thing happened to her! NOT recommended. Will never use this device again!!!</li>
    <li> I owned another of these products before making this purchase. My last Emjoi product lasted over 10 years with frequent use! It is compact, easy to use, has a nice long cord and a convenient travel case. It is a truly wonderful product, I recommend highly this product and this company, I have had nothing but good experiences with them. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what it was designed to do it certainly didn&#x27;t remove hair.  I sent it back</li>
    <li> The Enjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover is a great product; it arrived to me earlier than expected and works just as described.</li>
    <li> Great! The first time was scary and I did have little dots of blood...and it did hurt. But after that initial shave and courage, the hairs grew thinner and slower for sure! So that the times after that it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Great not having to bust out a razor and shaving cream for the armpits in the shower. Holds a charge w/o the cord for a long time too.</li>
    <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought and was looking for an alternative to shaving my legs, arms and under arms. I have to say it does a good job but you do have to go SLOW and over again and again till you get the hairs. Idk why others complain about the pain it&#x27;s obviously pulling your hairs so it will hurt. Just like waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for me personally for my legs it hurt really bad. I have coarse dark hair on my legs and sensitive skin so I could do It on my lower legs but no way on my thighs it hurt way to much there. But for some reason when I did my lower legs even though it pulled the hair out it didn&#x27;t really feel smooth as I was hoping. I saw some of my hairs were breaking off and not pulling out of the root but that&#x27;s probably my fault because i didn&#x27;t know how long leg hair would be in 5mm. If it&#x27;s to long it will not work good. I did It a couple days after I shaved where I could notice I was prickly. But it didn&#x27;t work on my legs because my hair for some reason wouldn&#x27;t pop out of my skin and it would lay underneath a thin layer of my skin. I could get it out with a tweezer but I didn&#x27;t like doing that cause it would take forever and tear my skin up. Even when I got the right length of my hair and then epilated it never felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My arms works ok but like I said with the legs when I did it it wouldn&#x27;t really feel smooth when I did epilate. Also I guess my hair grows really fast because when I epilated it would last for about two to three days, which sucks since it says up to 6 weeks hair free. But that&#x27;s not the epilator&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My under arms however works really great! Even though I have to do it every two to three days it takes my hair completely out and it so smooth! It does kinda hurt a little the first time but I can handle it and after about two times I got used to it and doesn&#x27;t hurt no more. It kinda feels like getting a tattoo that doesn&#x27;t really hurt lol. Using this does make my under arm hairs less coarse since I&#x27;m not just shaving the top layer off. I love using it on my under arms because when I used to shave my under arms it would get really sensitive and sting. So this is worth keeping for my under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my bikini area and did somewhat hurt but I did get one bad ingrown hair which idk why cause I do exfoliate with a loofah daily so who knows. I tried to use it on the top of my...you know...lol and it hurts way to much!! I wanted to try it to see if it would work instead of waxing and no it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It did though make it grow less coarse though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator does take a while to charge and lasts for me for about more than 8 uses. Not really sure just guessing. But I can use it charging or not. I like the low speed because sometimes I think the high speed doesn&#x27;t really have a good grip on my hair but that&#x27;s just my opinion. Do what works for you. Easy clean. Make sure you read the whole directions! It says a lot of good info. Be careful also on low raised moles. I have a lot on my body and accidentally went over one and it hurt it. I&#x27;m ok though but just be careful messing with moles. Don&#x27;t shave over low or high raised moles. I know it&#x27;s kinda obvious but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it worked on my legs but I&#x27;m just going to use it for my under arms. My opinion good buy since I can use it on my under arms but maybe the more expensive ones are better but I can&#x27;t compare. Hope my review helps you! Oh the shipping was great too! Very fast!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with fine hair. I bought it for my underarms and it does an ok job but no matter the length (tried all different lengths), it just doesn&#x27;t do a clean job even with several passes. But overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase as it&#x27;s shown me that the pain isn&#x27;t bad and that in the future, I just need to focus on ones that can grab fine hairs.</li>
    <li> It works but takes a while! If you are in rush this won&#x27;t be your best bet. It does hurt a lot too but not anymore than waxing. I am pleased with the results and hope the experience improves overtime!</li>
    <li> I tried this on my legs first and it takes FOREVER to get the hairs all ripped out! I think i took about 20 minutes on each leg! And even after going over the same place over and over again, it still leaves behind some hair. The hairs that it managed to get, grew back just as fast as if i had saved time and shaved. Then i tried it on my armpits.. bad plan. It tried ripping the hair out, but failed. I bled a little. So then i thought, maybe it&#x27;ll work on thin hair? (my upper lip) nope, not really! it got out some but not all, no matter how many times i went over it, the pressure, the angle, the setting, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.. Totally NOT worth it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let EMJOY scare you away from using this for smooth cheeks and chin, ladies. I have been using EMJOY epilators on my face for 12+ years, with no ill effects. I used to spend 15 min on average tweezing dark and/or heavy hairs several times a week. With the machine it takes a few minutes twice a week and I cover more of my face in that time. I just bought my third one. The first one was not rechargeable and the adapter gave up the ghost. The second was rechargeable - love it  - and seemed that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge well after about 5 years. So I went with the EMJOY Caress Light. Don&#x27;t waste money on the light  - it&#x27;s useless! abut the device works great and is comfortable in the hand. I have never used it anywhere else on my body.</li>
    <li> I read reviews about it before I bought it. I must say it works as it was described so I&#x27;m happy with it. Didn&#x27;t have any problems. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> OUCHHHHH! man this thing hurts! I felt like my skin was going to bruise, but I guess thats what you should expect when your hairs are getting ripped out. I wanted this mainly for my underarms, but Ive only used it a few times although Ive had it for many months. I also tried it on my legs.. Basically, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, and its super painful. My underarm skin is too sensitive to shave everyday, but I think getting them waxed might be my better option. Also, the hair grew back faster that I expected, but that supposedly gets better the more you do it- so maybe I&#x27;ll try it a few more times and see if the results change</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Form factor is nice, holds well, feels ergonomic (not sure if it is)&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless, so no tangling up&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle, does not hurt to use&lt;br /&gt;- Seller sent item fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Slow - takes double the time as the old Panasonic to remove hair&lt;br /&gt;- Low powered - even on the highest setting, it seems like it does not pull out hair easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you have never used an epilator before, otherwise, you may want to look for a higher powered faster model.</li>
    <li> I did research on other epilators and which ones would be effective and hurt the least, this one had top reviews. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very sensitive to pain but this is just too uncomfortable. It doesn&#x27;t grab all the hairs either, you just have to keep going over, and to be honest it is SCARY. You don&#x27;t know when its going to grab a hair. It hurt very bad around my ankles, and overall more on my right leg specifically (which is funny). I tried it on my armpits, and I think if you have a very HIGH tolerance and a lot of patience it can work by getting the hair from the roots. I bought it, used it a few times, but will not use it again, because for the pain...it takes tooooooo much time and is beyond unpleasant. I need to find someone who can tolerate it, so someone can get some use.</li>
    <li> I have never used an Epilator before, and was tired of shaving my armpits every other day. So I decided to give it a try. First of all I purchased the Emjoi AP-17SE Divine 36-Disc Tweezer Epilator and hated it, it was slow and didn&#x27;t get all the hairs out!! So I decided to give the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover a try, I am in love with this product!It gets all the hairs out and honestly I don&#x27;t think it hurts at all, and I have never waxed my armpits before.I even tried it on my bikini line and the upper base of my huha, not full brazilian it does hurt a lot more in the lower sides of the huha I decided to keep shaving there the pain is too much for me to handle. And yes it did hurt a bit there (top base of huha) but once I started it felt less painful.Just make sure the hairs are not too long, that way you wont be that much in pain. That is a sensitive are so pain is expected.It does leave your skin red and a bit bumpy but after a couple of hours its all gone and your left with soft beautiful skin.Make sure you exfoliate with a loofah during a warm/hot shower to get rid of all the dead skin, this helps minimize the pain also.I am having a harder time on my legs, the hair is very fine so it doesn&#x27;t pluck all of them out that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this a 4 out of 5. But my armpits and top base of huha have never felt so soft and looked so good!! Purchase this Epilator you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Looks nice, holds well&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s Cordless&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s Gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;- Results, you are left with soft hairless skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pluck fine hairs!</li>
    <li> I get horrible razor burn and have foliculitis ( irritation of the hair follicals) also so I can&#x27;t really shave unless I want days of itchy, red, bumpy skin. I can&#x27;t afford waxing as often as I&#x27;d like so I figured I would try this out. First of all OUCH!! This pulls the hair out at the root with several tweezers rotating quickly. When I first got it I used it on one leg, I couldn&#x27;t bare to do the other until the pain had subsided from the first one! I also was hoping to be able to use it on my bikini area how ever it says to avoid pubic area and face. And I can&#x27;t imagine the pain it would cause if you used it on the bikini area. The next day I took two Tylenol and waited about a 1/2 hour then began on my other leg and under arms. It felt a bit better, still like hair being ripped out at the roots- but not as bad. I try to use it at least every other day and it helps reduce the pain since you aren&#x27;t pulling out as much hair at once. This is great for under arms and does work to a point on your legs- they feel smooth and clean but you can still see hairs that were missed in the sunlight, so it is better for the feeling of having hairless legs rather than the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of totally hairless legs.It also takes a while to get all of the hair for a whole leg it can take up to 35-40 mins. I try to make sure I am in a warm room before I do it because you can end up with goose bumps and then you can&#x27;t grab the hair as well. It has also pinched the skin a couple of times behind my knee caps- so be careful. Over all I would say it is a good product for underarms and an okay product for legs. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again or not...</li>
    <li> I use this instead of shaving and it&#x27;s perfect! The first time I used it for my underarms and bled a little but after a couple more times it barely hurts anymore and its way better than shaving. It gets everything off and leaves me with smooth underarms and I dont have to use it as often as shaving requires. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with dark underarms and stubby hairs unlike shaving. If you can tolerate the pain, I would recommend these. I have been using it for 2 years already and it still worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being using this epilator for the past 5 months, and all I have to say is very good on removing hair from the root. It takes 2 weeks or more for my underarms and legs hair to grow back. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because at first I used to get some ingrow hair or pumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a student &amp; i think the price is within range from what i earn monthly. Also this works sooo well! It doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit in my case, [I uses it only for underarms].&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use and the battery life is awesome, I can carry anywhere since i love going on road trips with my friends :)</li>
    <li> The epilater itself seems good. As long as you use the low setting for fine hair, and the high setting for thick hair it does a good job of pulling the hair out from the root. So as far as functionality goes, it works well. But is it worth the money? I feel like it requires more persistence and patience than I have. But I guess it depends on where you are planning to epilate. I was planning on using it on my arms, legs, and armpits. It works really well on armpits, and barely hurts at all. But you still have to do it every couple of days, because hair grows at different rates. So you&#x27;ll epilate all the hair one day, then the next day some new hair shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is more a problem on the legs though. On your legs, not only does it take forever to actually epilate just one leg and get every hair, but it also hurts like a bitch. I feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but it just sucks on your legs. I could deal with the pain if I could finish in like 15 minutes but it takes me like 30 minutes per leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not that bad on arms, but it does take a few minutes. Sometimes I pick it up and use it, but for the most part I&#x27;m still shaving every couple of days. Also it causes some redness and irritation for me especially on the legs, so I recommend doing it at night.</li>
    <li> This device has saved me from the hassle of scheduling, driving to and paying for salon waxing visits.  The pain factor is managable.</li>

My boyfriend bought this one for me during Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. It&#x27;s my first epilator and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews, the instruction manual, and watched videos online before my first use. I took a warm shower, exfoliated, didn&#x27;t put on lotion, was in a decent temperature room (not so cold as to have goosebumps and not so warm as to sweat), made my skin taunt, etc. I even took pain medication beforehand, but I don&#x27;t think I really needed it. I have semi-thin, but dark, hair on my legs. It took me almost THREE HOURS to epilate my legs and armpits because I had to go over the same areas multiple times (plus I stopped to clean the head several times). I had to plug it in because it wasn&#x27;t performing at optimal levels after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had several missed patches of hair and areas of my leg were extremely itchy, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as when I shaved. As the hair regrew I developed countless ingrown hairs. Every single use was like this. The major difference that makes it better than shaving is that SOME of my hairs are growing in slower, making my legs look less hairy when I don&#x27;t have time to dehair them. Additionally, smaller portions of my legs are being scratched and even smaller portions are being scratched raw, so that&#x27;s the other benefit compared to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it on my armpits was the most painful. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all now, which is good because I need to use it at least twice a week (the same as if I was shaving)! I read reviews where people complain that it only lasts a week and I think how lucky they are that it lasts THAT long. I don&#x27;t see a difference between shaving and using the epilator when it comes to my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this isn&#x27;t the epilator for me, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it until it breaks or the cost of it (compared to shaving) breaks even so I don&#x27;t waste my boyfriend&#x27;s money. I don&#x27;t know if the problem is my weird body or this epilator, so I rounded it up to 3 stars.ller portions are being scratched raw, so that&#x27;s the other benefit compared to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it on my armpits was the most painful.

    <li> I purchased this product in 2011 and I&#x27;ve been consistently using it every 2 or 3 weeks to epilate my armpit hair and arm hair and it works extremely well. It takes a few minutes and takes off even the finest of hairs. I always take this with me when I travel and since it&#x27;s rechargeable I try plug it in the day before the trip and I take it with me and it will last me a good month. Just be aware that it will be very painful when you first use it since it&#x27;s essentially ripping out your hairs but exfoliating in the shower before hand will make it easier.</li>
    <li> I expected  all hairs to be removed. This does not happen. The pull is like tweezers. I do not mind this, but some might.</li>
    <li> Dear Emjoi Epilator, where were you all my life? This is the best grooming gadget I ever invested in. As for the pain factor, I experience no pain, only a pricking sensation while using it on my arms, legs and underarms but everyone is different. If you are considering getting an epilator but are afraid of the pain, you&#x27;re never going to know unless you try it. I spent a long long time not venturing into epilators because of the pain factor but I was pleasantly surprised by how little the pain was when I did start using one. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered the corded-cordless model (purple one) one that can work on battery and in corded mode. Comes with a handy brush to clean the hair around the blades. The massage attachment is useless in my  view but all in all this is one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> It was compared to &amp; listed with the No NO which is a laser product. I thought I was purchasing a laser product. I was pleasantly surprised however that it worked so well.  Sure beats shaving :0)</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use but painful! If you have always shaved and decide to stop and use the epilator it will hurt! My armpit hair is thick and course and the epilator grabs a hair at a time so it&#x27;s very time consuming!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to replace my old battery operated Emjoi, but I thought I needed to order one for backup.  I am loving this Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless/Corded hair remover. It came fully charged early January.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few times a week (cordless mode) and it&#x27;s still charged up.  I am very pleased with this product. I haven&#x27;t had to plug it in yet.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for underarms, legs and bikini area. I shower at night, exfoliate entire body and epilate while skin is dry and clean. So far no ingrown hairs. I will never shave again. My legs and underarms look smooth.. no more razor bumps or cuts. Love emjoi.</li>
    <li> I have never used an Epilator before, purchased this one based on reviews/price comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to tweezing rogue hairs so thought, I can handle this.  You know what... I was right.  The first time using it I was shocked that it bugged me less then individual tweezing.  Partially because I didn&#x27;t know exactly when/where the pain would hit.  Partially because it just happened faster.  The back of my leg, and near my ankles/feet was very sensitive, but not unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the after Epi cream.  I did notice that that the next time I used it was much easier.  The hair came out easier and less painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the performance and ease of this.  Great first timer.  I took one star away because I have bumpy knees and it takes quite a bit of changing angles to do them.  Other then that super easy to use.</li>
    <li> i like it, it does hurt a lot when i dont use some type of numbing cream or spray but it does get all the hairs...ive only used it on my face but i do love it minus the pain</li>
    <li> I thought I had a low tolerance for pain, so I was surprised to see that the pain I experienced when using the Emjoi Soft Caress was bearable.  It definitely hurts, but I feel the pain is worth not having to shave my legs everyday.  Emjoi recommends to use warm water but do not apply lotion/cream before using the epilator.  I find that this makes my skin extremely dry.  Not fun.  To make it less painful, I like to wrap up my legs/arm with a towel warmed from the dryer right before using the epilator.  This will open up the pores to expose the hair follicles for easier removal. I am even able to watch some TV (at a high volume because this machine is LOUD) while using this epilator.  It helps distract me from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was buying this, I had a hard time choosing between the cordless or corded.  I was thinking I could save the couple of bucks getting the corded one because it is not like I&#x27;m planning to use this outside of the house.  However I decided to get the cordless one because I can still use it as a corded hair remover if I don&#x27;t feel like waiting to charge it.  I am completely happy with my choice to pay the extra couple dollars to get cordless because I can carry it around the house with me without having to worry about finding an outlet.  I only had it for a month, but I am surprised how long the battery lasts on this thing!  I was able to remove all the hair I wanted with one charge.  Gotta love that.  I also just charge it overnight and unplug it when I wake up if I plan to use it the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying to decide the difference between Soft Caress and Light Caress is that Light Caress has a built-in light.  When I am using Soft Caress, I can now see why a built in light would be super helpful but not necessary.  I have fairly good eyesight, but I would recommend people with vision problems to get the Light Caress.  As for me, I just decided for me, it&#x27;s more important that it be cordless than have a built-in light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who hate shaving, hate spending a lot of money on disposable razors, and can tolerate some pain.  I hope this might help in your decision! :)</li>
    <li> It does work, i didn&#x27;t stick to doing it though.. i need to start again.. it gets frustrating the first time around but the hair i did pluck out with it did stay gone for awhile 1-2 weeks</li>
    <li> First off, I give this four stars instead of five, only because the product claims its great for arm pits. I used this on my legs, arms pits, and pubic area. It was very easy to use on my legs, the knees were a little difficult but you just have to straightened your leg and try going in different directions. It definitely took a lot of time to do my legs, I did it in two sessions with a few hairs still left over. I waited three days after shaving to try it out, I figured the longer the hairs the better the results, and I would recommend waiting. My arm pits were very difficult to do, I ended up taking skin off from both pits which is very painful for a few days. I shave my pubic area entirely so I tried it just on my pubic bone and that was fairly easy and a lot less painful than my arm pits, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mixed about buying this product after seeing all of the negative reviews, but i think all of the problems had to have been user error. Over all I really enjoy this product and am very happy about my choice!  I am a mom and co-bath so I don&#x27;t have time to shave when I shower, every single day! I really want to order a hair inhibitor next and try to completely eliminate the hair!</li>
    <li> Simple as that, great buy! As soon as I used it I thought \\&quot;I want to get another one just to have another one!\\&quot; I would recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! it&#x27;s like, one time pay wax and never pay again! and it works by  electricity, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries. Watch out the voltage though if you travel to a different country! but overall, this is one of my favorite products, and they do a great job keeping me hairless :P</li>
    <li> I did my research on youtube for this product. I bought it mainly for underarm hair, but I also use it for legs, facial hair and bikini area I gave myself a Brazilian with it. I absolutely love it. I will never razor shave my underarms again, it gets all the hair and leaves them flawless. The charge lasts a long time and it is powerful. You only need to use it every week or so to get the stray hair growing back in then the hair will come in less. It is painful the first time you use it but after that initial use it is not so bad. I wish I had gotten it years ago I am too lazy for daily shaving. Don&#x27;t hesitate as long as I did to get this product.  Its a great investment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this epilator! It hurts, yes, but that&#x27;s the price we pay for beauty! :) However, my charger has a short in it. I have to wrap it around a knob on my dresser drawer to get it to charge. My mother loved it so much, she&#x27;s ordering her one ASAP!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I would give it 5 stars except that I&#x27;ve found one problem with epilating in general that keeps me from saying it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 6 months.  I&#x27;ve traveled with it and found that it keeps its charge for many uses.  It pulls out hair very effectively.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s true of any epilator, though, that you generally have to use it two days in a row to get rid of ALL the hair.  After that, you can use it at the very least every other day as maintenance.  To maintain the epilator you just have to take the shield off and use the brush to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even though I love it, I still have some problems with ingrown hairs.  I exfoliate with a loofah in the shower every day, and I use lotion after I epilate, as recommended, but I still get a lot of pink bumps.  I will keep looking for solutions, though, because it&#x27;s still way better than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that they should consult a designer about the colors.  The pink and purple are really gaudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year.  The battery life isn&#x27;t as long anymore, but I can plug it in to get full power.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to keep it up at least every other day, but daily is better.  I&#x27;ve also found, over time, that ingrown hairs and bumps are nearly gone because I finally got into the habit of using a large loofah on my legs every single time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TIPS AND ADVICE&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliate roughly with a very soapy loofah every time you shower, even if you&#x27;re not going to epilate that day.&lt;br /&gt;- Epilate only after a shower or warm bath so your pores are open.&lt;br /&gt;- Let your legs dry thoroughly and epilate in a room that isn&#x27;t too humid.  If your legs are still moist or the bathroom is too humid the epilator won&#x27;t glide over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Pull your skin taught (gently) while epilating an area of skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Knees are difficult, bend your knee and try different angles with the epilator.  You might not get all the hairs but if you use it every day you&#x27;ll get rid of most of your knee hairs and no one will notice the few fine hairs that are left.&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend shaving the backs of your thighs and behind the knee because the hair is so fine and the skin so easily irritated.  You don&#x27;t have to shave those hairs that often.  They&#x27;re fine and soft.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t worry about very fine hairs that might be left over on the front of your thighs.  No one will notice them.  If you really want to you could shave them, but I recommend just leaving them.&lt;br /&gt;- Afterwards, you MUST use a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting such as shea butter, baby oil, or azulene oil that has benzocaine.&lt;br /&gt;- If you get lots of red bumps try wiping witch hazel (should cost less than $2 for store brand at the drug store) on your skin with a cotton ball or soaked paper towel, let it dry, then apply moisturizer.ry different angles with the epilator.

    <li> I owned one of the earliest Emjois and just grit my teeth when I had to use it. It also had a tendency to pull and catch more sensitive skin regions. This newer version at any of the speeds, is gentle and completely effective. I would never have considered using it on my face, I will NEVER again waste mornings pre makeup, tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some minor bleeding, I use peroxide and antibiotic ointment. I am pain free which is a whole new experience after using Emjoi, this version is perfect for everywhere on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not shower pre use, I prefer showering later when my skin calms down and the antibiotic cream has been applied for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a whole new world ladies, you can do this and not only have privacy, save money, feel clean and fresh any time. Emjoi is a total Joy to use.</li>
    <li> Amazing this is my first Epilator and i&#x27;m in loveeeee.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product.  I&#x27;m new to the epilady world so this is great for beginner&#x27;s, but once you get used to the rapid snatching of the hair you&#x27;re ready to move on to a more advanced system.  It does remove hair, but you have to go over the area a couple of times before you get a smooth hairless pit.</li>
    <li> We bought this 2 years ago and it gets frequent use from 2 people.  It works great for removing unwanted body hair.  It is a bit painful at first, but it fades with regular use.  It is much faster than using tweezers, and much cleaner than waxing.  Some hair does break off, but after a few growth cycles it cleans things up nicely.  The battery is convenient for allowing chord less use but most of the time it is used plugged in because it has more power.  The small head fits in some tight places as well.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs from the root on my underarms. Which is mainly why I got it. Yes it is painful, but like waxing your eyebrows, you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to epilating but I really like this epilator. it hurts a little but, but I find it tolerable.  It&#x27;s nice that it can be used with or without the cord but I did notice that it seems much stronger when plugged in.  BUT, I do notice that it leaves behind a few hairs when I use it. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for epilators, if I just need to get better at using it, or if its the quality of the epilator.  That said, it does remove the majority of the hair and leaves my skin visibly smooth (I use it for my underarms and bikini area). Hopefully I will get better at using it as most people who have experience with epilators say.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have hair in my legs but I have such a problem with the hair in my underarms, I&#x27;ve tried everything to remove hairs from my underarms (waxing, plucking, shaving) and I just found out about epilators last week. So I went on youtube and found out about this Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator. I got it yesterday and tried it for the first time. The sound was very intimidating when you turn it on, but when I tried it was very good! I didn&#x27;t expect it would remove all the hairs and it didnt hurt at all.</li>
    <li> I have thin, sparse hair on my arms and legs and found it took many, many passes to even get 90% of the hair removed.  I&#x27;ve never been pinched by the blades, and find the battery life quite good and the noise tolerable.  The included bag/case is convenient, but the covers can be a little tricky to interchange if you have nice nails.  I found the results to last about a week before regrowth.</li>
    <li> Love it! works great. Little to no pain. Compact. You can charge it and use it anywhere, or just plug it in and voila!</li>
    <li> I just got my Emjoi in the mail today and I have to say that I love it.  I will never shave or use any other hair removal system ever again.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now and it is still going strong.  The charger does not work real well but if I keep it plugged in it works great.  This was my first epilator and I am sold for life.  Originally I purchased this because I spent 15-20 minutes per night tweezing those awful unwanted facial hairs and thought there has to be an easier way...there WAS!  I now use this on face, legs, underarms, lip, bikini line and anywhere else I see random unwanted hair.  Best results if you use it right out of a hot shower then the plucking is not as painful.  My hairs have become softer over the years and my underarm hair is thin, fine and no more shaving rash or redness.  I highly recommend and remember to use when your skin is dry but fresh out of the hot shower to decrease pain.  Plus...pain reduces the more you use it...beauty is pain:).</li>
    <li> Painful...used for over 1 year religiously and no decreased ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used religiously for a year...painful and no decreased facial hair regrowth for female. Less painful on legs but still no decreased hair regrowth</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use it at first because of the sound, I tried it in my arms and legs it was painful at first but once you continue epilating the pain will go away.  I&#x27;m glad i found this product, best epilator for first user like me.  Awesome device!</li>
    <li> I like that it does simultaneously pull the hair from the root and that it does it fast.  Depending on the thickness of the hair, sometimes you have to go over the same area multiple times to get all the hair out.</li>
    <li> I have tried other epilators from Remington to Phillips. Both products were unbearable. I thought it was because I was just not used to epilating because that is what I was told, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain. Got the Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator very shortly after purchase and it is amazing. Almost pain-free (come on, we are plucking here, it can&#x27;t be totally painless) and gets everything smooth and silky. Best epilator on the market and at the most reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a while now, so I&#x27;m going to be getting another one soon. But this is a great one to start off with as a beginner to epilators. Yes, it hurts at first, but you get used to it. Keeps the armpits hair free for a few days.</li>
    <li> There is some discomfort but it did not hurt nearly as much as I thought it might.  Hurts worse to pluck my eyebrows. Doing small areas and holding the skin very taught helped with the discomfort as well as helping to remove the hairs.  I really liked the &amp;#34;massaging fingers&amp;#34;.  They did seem to make it more comfortable.  It did a better job on shorter hairs.  The longer ones took a couple of tries to be removed.</li>
    <li> I literally use this everywhere on my body. ;) I&#x27;m hair free!  Can be painful if you&#x27;re not use to it.</li>
    <li> my 2nd one! lasted me a long time and battery last long enough without cord for several uses if I&#x27;m just epilating my underarms. Small but handy, not bulky. Used it correctly and I havent have any kind of ingrown hair problems. Take their advice and scrub frequently.  Its amazing!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first in buying an epilator, but my friend recommended this exact product. She said she had been using it for a while and stated that it started to make her unwanted hair thinner. So i decided to give it a try. The first time i tried it, it was a bit painful, but the emjoi takes the hair out pretty quickly. I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to determine if it does in fact make your hair grow back thinner, but I would recommend this product based on its ease of use. It also does take longer for hair to grow back vs. shaving.</li>
    <li> This was much more painful than expected.  The epilator worked great the first few times I used it (didn&#x27;t have to use for about 3 weeks in between).  After that, it seemed to become more painful and the hair started growing back quicker.  I would definitely never buy another epilator.  I&#x27;m going to try the No-no next.</li>
    <li> Well Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginner to epilators. This is the first time ever using one and it definitely isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect. I read the instructions carefully and watched countless reviews to make sure this is the route I want to take even knowing that there would be SOME pain. I was NOT prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when you read the instructions, its states that there would be no pain, but a slight &#x27;PRICKLY&#x27; sensation. Ok, well I felt that mixed in with hair pulling, mixed in with being poked by needles. PAINFUL!!! It&#x27;s the kind of feeling you really have to psych yourself up for!  It&#x27;s not a sensation that can be down played at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that because Emjoi has such a reputation for being the most comfortable out of all the different brands they have that I would be in the green. Wrong. I&#x27;ve tried on my legs, on my arms and hands, under my arms, and my chin and neck area, and it all is just painful. So by now its like, well, why the four stars?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, its a great hair remover. It did such a great job on my legs and arms that I am now researching a topical cream that could ease my pain, lol.  My hair is right in the middle of fine and coarse, and it does the job nicely. I had a couple of girlfriends suggest waiting until you have a night all to yourself and pouring up a few glasses of wine to relax me just so that the pain is more tolerable. So, of course I&#x27;m gonna give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only advice I can offer is to not be fooled into thinking that a device that pulls your hair out is not painful. But if your willing to put up with the pain and have lasting results for at least 2-3 weeks then you should consider the buy.  ;-)</li>
    <li> size and battery life are good, it does not work as well as stated. it take so many passes i would rather shave. to save time.</li>
    <li> First, with proper use and care, you should be able to avoid ingrown hairs/bumps. Second, with time, you will start to tolerate the pain better, and it won&#x27;t hurt anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this epilator is a good beauty tool to have handy. It&#x27;s compact and effective against unwanted hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few cons: It&#x27;s is pretty loud. Sounds like a remote controlled toy monster truck! The curved tweezer bed doesn&#x27;t really work for me...I feel that the curvy design actually prevents me from reaching certain places.</li>
    <li> i BROUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVES IT. COULD&#x27;T AFFORD THE NO NO. VERY EASY FOR HER TO HANDLE</li>
    <li> Works extremely well! But seems to run out of battery quite quickly so need to charge a lot or leave plugged in when using. But overall I really like it due to it working so well, it was recommended so much that I shipped it from America to me in the UK...I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product and I have to say in order to get the full potential from this product you need to know a few things.  One, the product works better plugged in.  Two, you must go in a circular motion so that the epilator pulls out all the hairs.  The things on the side of the epilator protect you from feeling the pain of the hairs being pulled at the root. But, because of the protectors, you must move the epilator in circular motion so that all the hairs get removed.  The product is phenomenal once you get the hang of it! This epilator not only gets the hairs but makes your skin soft  you can use on legs, face, and bikini.  Again, go in circular motion.  I was sold!</li>
    <li> This epilator is fantastic! If you&#x27;ve never had your arms or legs waxed before (or have lots of hair), I&#x27;m sure the sensation could be unpleasant. But if you have a history of waxing and are simply tired of growing your hair out long enough for those 6-wk sessions, this item is definitely for you. It works quickly and very smoothly. I didn&#x27;t find it at all painful, even under the arms. The bikini line was a different story, however, but that could just be because I don&#x27;t get a bikini wax and my little nerve endings down there aren&#x27;t used to the feeling. I have a history of ingrown hairs, so I&#x27;m using the PX After Epilation Cream and the loofah daily. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so tired of shaving my legs, I thought I&#x27;d give mechanical hair removal another shot. Years ago, I had the rotating coil kind. It sort of worked, but you had to wait for your hair to get so long. These new ones claim to get hair as short as half a millimeter! Well... they do! This is great, I am never shaving again. I run it over my legs when watching TV every other night or so. This way, I&#x27;m never ripping out ALL the hair at once, and it&#x27;s no problem, barely a little random stinging. Not even pain. Seriously. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, although this seems like it will last longer than I will ever need it, I will get the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and \\&quot;lifting finger technology\\&quot; for the hairs that lay flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can use it when plugged in or not. It seems to have more power when plugged in, though it works fine on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sought out the Emjoi after a lot of research and found a great price, and it arrived faster and (with today&#x27;s gas prices) cheaper than if I&#x27;d had to head out to the store.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying an epilator and after researching for a while to decide which one to purchase, I bought the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless. It is convenient as you can use it without the cord so you can take it into the bathroom to use and avoid getting electrocuted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I used it after a warm shower and exfoliated my underarms also. The pain was hardly there for me so I thought I was doing something wrong as everyone else said it hurt a lot. However, after epilating, I found out it does work as I could see the difference on my underarms! It wasn&#x27;t as dark but I did have to use it a few times to make sure I epilated what I could. Like others said, your hair grows at different pace so at first you may not get all of it so just keep trying for the first week!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found confusing was which way to hold the epilator and which direction to epilate - against or in the direction in which the hair is growing as I had read mixed instructions on this. However, I tried both and am still in the process of getting the hang of it as I am still a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to note is that it may seem fast and powerful on level 1 and 2 but even on 2 sometimes I had to go over the areas more than once to fully epilate my underarms. However, it may just be due to my lack of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope my experience can help other females/males out there!</li>
    <li> only epilates long hair. Braun is way better. this is my first Emjoi and i hate it coz its painful and does not take the hair out.</li>
    <li> why didn&#x27;t I know this existed sooner? I have been strictly been waxing for about 12 years now, it&#x27;s been good but I always have to wait for the hair to grow to a decent length before I can go get it waxed. With this I don&#x27;t have to! and I am saving ton&#x27;s of money! worth the pain (which isn&#x27;t to bad).</li>
    <li> works and hurts. start with low speed and before cranking it up. keeps you smooth much longer than a razor. love it.</li>
    <li> If you want smooth legs this is a must. After the initial discomfort you will love it. The first couple times when there&#x27;s a lot of hair is the toughest. I&#x27;ve been using one for 25 years. LOVE LOVE it</li>
    <li> When I was 20, I wasn&#x27;t yet womanly enough to be able to stand the pain of one of these gadgets.  Now that I am a perimenopausal 45-year-old, I can handle the tiny tweaks of hair no problem, except I&#x27;m still a weenie when it comes to doing my armpits (maybe I have to be a more weathered and postmenopausal for that).  In any case, I love using this and use it everywhere - I mean EVERYWHERE - I even do the nether parts which is actually pretty easy and cuts out the tremendous cost of waxing with only a mirror and a little more contortion on my part.  I still don&#x27;t really get how to clean it, but it does come apart easily and I blow on it which works well enough.  It isn&#x27;t so loud you can&#x27;t carry on a phone conversation while using it and I LOVE that it is rechargeable - and it works as well off the charger as on.</li>
    <li> I hat it and will not use it. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice and it pinches. I would never refer this product to anyone</li>
    <li> doesnt last long. had to buy this one multiple times for my sister. but she keeps on going back to it. so i am giving 3 stars</li>
    <li> I like, my hair still come back but it is thinner and less comes back, the brush provided is well suited for cleaning the device. The only down side is it takes a while to charge.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this epilator does an okay job, not great, just okay. It doesn&#x27;t  remove all the hair. It leaves patches behind. Not worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims, but it has been really hard to get used to the pain. But ultimately once you&#x27;re through its really nice not having to worry about the hair growing back for a while.</li>
    <li> I love the concept and I don&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; sensation, because I know it&#x27;s doing the job I want it to; the only drawback I see is that my chin whiskers (white, now) are like my dad&#x27;s--hard to grow out--thus hard to tweeze.  So it&#x27;s necessary to &amp;#34;wait out&amp;#34; the growth so I can rid myself of the stubble.  Every day, I tweeze a bit more, hoping that soon all of it will be long enough to be done and gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also the love the concept of not having to SHAVE every day, because it all came back the next day when I shaved!  No more . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> This epilator works quite well and is pretty portable and sleek looking. I also like the soft feel of the outer rubber. However, it&#x27;s really quite loud, especially compared to another epilator my roommate had. And this might also just be mine, but the battery doesn&#x27;t not last at all so I need to keep it plugged in when I use it. Not too much of a hassle since I tend to just use it in my room anyway.</li>
    <li> Works just okay. I do like that it&#x27;s a wallplug versus battery operated,  and I like that it&#x27;s portable  for travel. But it doesn&#x27;t  really catch all the hairs, especially  the shorter ones. Had to keep running over the same area several times  and still not does not catch every hair. I give this a rating of &amp;#34;B-&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product and always say, this made life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier to charge and use and also can be clean easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about six months and really like it.  I have very thin hair and pale skin, so I got it for the armpit 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (not cute).  At first it hurt and made me nervous, and when I finished one armpit, I&#x27;d have to wipe down the other because it made me perspire a little.  So there&#x27;s that.  It doesn&#x27;t do that anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my under arms once a week for around 6 months now, and you can barely see any hair when I&#x27;m about to use it- it&#x27;s so sparse and thin and light.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.  The armpits are the only area that hurt me at all.  I use it on the bikini zone (not brazilian, I keep a slice of pie), and that has never hurt.  Legs don&#x27;t hurt either.  I do the legs about once a month and bikini maybe every other week.  Armpits are once a week, and it takes less and less time every time.  I used to have to shave every day and still have an unpleasant darkness in the pits, but I don&#x27;t anymore, and now I invest that same amount of time I did daily, only it&#x27;s weekly.  I recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator years ago and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. Love it.</li>
    <li> Had the epilator for about 6 months and it worked well enough (though I now have a new slightly more expensive model and it works way better). The unit completely stopped charging eventually. Although it was under warranty, I am now living abroad so they are unable to fix it.</li>
    <li> I really love this epilator, but it is not for those with a low pain tolerance.  This is the first one I have ever used and I really do like it, it removes hairs on legs and under arms and keeps a charge for a very long time.  I don&#x27;t like how the hairs get stuck in some of the crevices.  I wish that we could take it completely apart to clean it because I personally think that random hairs lodged in the machine could be a problem down the road...but doesn&#x27;t detour me from using it regularly.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before because I always shaved using a razor. Then started to pluck my armpit hairs using a tweezer because I felt that shaving did not give me as clean of a result as I wanted. However, plucking took too much time, which is when my friend suggested that I get an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually epilators have a stigma of being really painful. However, when I first used this epilator, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! The only downfall about this is that it doesn&#x27;t pluck as cleanly as I want it to. After epilating, I still have some random hairs which I need to individually pluck using tweezers. However, it&#x27;s still a good product that I enjoy using all the time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t perform as well as it should. The concept is great, but i still find myself going over the same areas a million times.. so it&#x27;s not worth the money spent on it.</li>
    <li> This has been a very good product for my use. I reviewed a number of epilators and am well pleased with the Emoji Soft Caress Epilator. I believe  l got a good price for an excellent product. It continues to work well for me. It took me a bit to get the hang of it since I had never used an epilator. It is superior to the ordeal &amp; expense of waxing. I,wish I had bought way before I did.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase from Emjoi and my least favorite of the three.&lt;br /&gt;The curvature of the model is difficult when switching from right to left.  Don&#x27;t see a difference in gold plating.  Wider surface makes it a challenge to get in grooves of underarms and bikini areas.  Takes 3 times the amount of time to remove hair when compared to smaller tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;I do however love the cord/no cord option which was a big selling point for me.  It sounds like a jet engine when plugged in.  Definitely got some power to it.  Would like to see this version in a smaller head.</li>
    <li> Was expecting more from this product. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair from the root, it just ripped the hairs so afterwards I had a lot of stubble on my legs. I should have went with the emoji that has 72 tweezers. This product also takes a very very long time to complete one leg</li>
    <li> Pluck out a strand of your hair anywhere on your body, and multiply that feeling times 30 , that&#x27;s the gist of the pain you&#x27;ll feel. If it&#x27;s somewhere a bit more sensitive like your armpits it&#x27;ll hurt a bit more than let&#x27;s say your lower legs. It won&#x27;t get rid of 100% or even 90% of the hairs you want plucked out, so if you don&#x27;t have a ton of hair this might be for you.</li>
    <li> First i would like to tell about the delivery experience. It was so TERRIBLE! USPS sucks. It should only take 2-3 business days to shipped this small item but it didnt happened. It took ten days before i got this item and not just that i still have to picked this up from postal office bcoz i cant even track my package. USPS such a very poor service. System is not updated. Amazon already took my money out from my card and i still didnt have my epilator. So i decided just to pick it up instead of keep waiting and guessing if they are really gonna deliver this to my house or not. Its been ten days so I went there and my package is still at the warehouse. I cannot belive! I dont think they will deliver this to me. So finally i got it by picking it up, theres no sense of shipping if customer has to pick it up by themselves. AWFUL SERVICE! Now lets talk about the epilator. It does hurt really bad. SO BAD! It pulled most of armpits&#x27; hair out but some were just got trimmed. Idk why is it like that but my hair should be long enough to pull them all out for not shaving a month. The pain is EXTREME!. I felt a very bad BURNING SENSATION!. I did put an ice to lessen the pain  after i epilated my armpits. I just swallowed my fear and just deal with it so i can get this done quick.  Would i recommend this? Absolutely yes! The pain is worth it. Im a 19 year old teen and im able to take the pain so i guess somebody else can do it.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s rechargeable. Good size with travel bag included. Not as strong as my previous Emjoi, but it&#x27;s mostly because this does not have as many tweezers.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to because i based this purchased off reviews. This is my first time ever using an epliator. I have never used a tweezer before but I have waxed before. Okay a lot of reviews were on pain. Day 1.. After taking a bath I did my legs. There was minimum pain and it took 20 min for both legs. Very good on time because I read it took a long time. Day 2.. Was only able to do 1 underarm versus 2 because yea the pain was out of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest it was a 10. I am gonna do the other underarm and do as suggested by other reviews which is take a pain reliever. But overall I do recommend this product if your thinking of using an epliator.</li>
    <li> I have tried it all. Shaving, depilatory, waxing. I thought waxing was the best solution but then I always found the hair burst below the skin rather than were pulled out fully from the root so the hair always grew back too quickly. So when I saw this product, I was sceptical at first, but I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed off the bat was that it looked like a joke. And then I tried it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been waxing for over two years, but the hair just disappeared...only to land on the floor. Seriously, I had no clue where the hair was going (so silly of me) so take my advice and pass a broom when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Level of pain? Minimal, easily forgotten. (again, I&#x27;ve been waxing for just over two years so my follicles were pretty loose)&lt;br /&gt;- Post irritation? I wouldn&#x27;t advise bathing too soon after your first session but aside from a SMALL level of tenderness, I had no problems. No bumps, no burns, no cuts, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;- One month later? The hair is growing back finer, and there were some ingrowns but not as many as when I was waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lost a star on battery life. It&#x27;s great plugged in, no problems there. But I wouldn&#x27;t advise doing a full-leg session on one charge. The power starts to fade a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m never going back to any other product. This is it! This product is the best solution I&#x27;ve found for hair-removal based on the relative levels of discomfort/irritation, speed of hair-growth and convenience. Try it!</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because this product works great! It gets the small hairs in-between waxing services. Also, battery recharges fast and great shipping. Only downfall, this product does hurt after the first use and to me it hurts every time. Don&#x27;t let me scare you off!! I have tattoos and wax often, the product does feel like every hair in area you are treating is plucked out. Imaging the feeling you have when your eyebrows tweezed, now picture that feeling with 25 tweezers being used on your underarms or legs. I would not dare use this product on longer strands of hair...OUCH! My review is purely based on the use of the product on my underarms which is waxed once a month due to my hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this epilator for a year now and it has held up well with regular use. The first time I used it, I wanted a drink and a pain pill, however with repeated use the pain level now seems no worse than plucking or waxing and you don&#x27;t have to do it nearly as often! The Emjoi feels pretty ergonomic. The rechargeable feature or cord use option are convenient. It does a thorough job on legs, arms and bikini. As a woman of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t use it on my underarms as the skin there is not as firm as it once was and there are too many opportunities for pinches! My only complaint is that it does take a chunk of time to use. I have to plan a solid half hour for my lower legs, 15 minutes for arms and another 20 for bikini and upper legs. Have heard from others that there are other models that have more teeth and therefore take less time to epilate an area and will probably consider that when it&#x27;s time to replace this one. In the meantime, this product works as described and I wish I&#x27;d bought one years ago!!!!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what is a Epilator until I saw the reviews on You Tube. I love my Epilator. I use it for my upper chin hairs and legs. It feels like a slight pinch but worth looking at the embarrassing hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost two years now. I must say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It&#x27;s definite worth every penny. I use it for my legs and underarms. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not as painful as I expected from a first time user, work really well plus lasts longer than shaving. Thanks</li>
    <li> This needs a full charge in order to work properly and that takes a bit of time. You also need to go over areas again and again to get every single hair, which can be painful the first time, but gets better every time you do it (Just like plucking your eyebrows). I had a super smooth leg shave, but I would never use this anywhere near my bikini line and I am a bit disappointed for that reason in the performance given the price. It&#x27;s not the priciest epilator, but I had hoped to give this at least four stars. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this model, but it did sway me into becoming an epilator devotee.</li>
    <li> Honestly this epilator isn&#x27;t what I expected by such the awesome reviews. It takes a very very very long time to epilate your arms or legs and the legs it doesn&#x27;t really get very well. Yes it hurts initially but as the hairs thin out the pain lessens. I would probably buy the Braun Wet Dry epilator if I hadn&#x27;t bought this one because it is on many websites as the number one epilator for 2014.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in item for the price. Doesn&#x27;t remove facial hair as well as I hoped. I still have to manually pluck hairs after using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for facial hair for about a year and 1/2.  The longer I use it the less I need to use it and when the hair grows in it is very soft  and unnoticeable.  It has made an every day problem something I only need to take care of every two weeks.  It stings  little when you first start using it, but that diminishes with time and I hardly feel it now.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very bad machine&lt;br /&gt;If u use this machine it feels like that it peeling ur skin off its that rough do not buy it do not buy it</li>
    <li> saves time ...yes its a little bit pricey but does its job...at first its kinda scary because of the sound that it makes just make sure your skin is dry and stretched and you&#x27;ll be fine..i&#x27;m totally happy with this item...</li>
    <li> I consider myself somebody who has a low pain tolerance, but I&#x27;ve adjusted to this with no problem. Then again, I got a tattoo on my collar bone and didn&#x27;t even flinch. I guess it depends on where you&#x27;re using it and how sensitive that area is FOR YOU. Many people on here talk about using it on their legs with no problem, but dying when they used it on their underarms. I was the opposite, and continue to only use it on my underarms with great results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny to be standing in the shower not sure what I forgot to do, only to realize that it&#x27;s shaving. I only have to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; every few days and it&#x27;s painless now. My underarms adjusted within a few minutes of the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some suggestions for first time users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wait until you have just a little stubble on the area you&#x27;re using it on. This meant for me that I waited 24 hours before epilating for the first time. So, I shaved Monday night and used the epilator Tuesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Exfoliate!!! The loofah it comes with is great for dry use right before. I also used a sugar scrub (literally just sugar) in the shower to ensure there was no dead skin blocking the epilator&#x27;s ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) If you are used to irritated underarms, this probably won&#x27;t be hard to adjust to. I always had bumps there and over time I noticed the irritation less and less because I just got used to it. I noticed I adjusted to the epilator quickly, and this might be why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Try it more than once. You can&#x27;t give up before giving this a fair chance. I love not having to shave all the time, but I&#x27;m still in the &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; phase. From what I&#x27;ve researched, it will take a few weeks for your hair to go through a complete cycle. Once you hit that, you won&#x27;t have to touch up as much and probably won&#x27;t have to think about it for at least a week--some users say a month, but that seems a little too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped, I really love this product!!</li>
    <li> My first epilator and it works great! It hurts a little the first couple of times you use it but it&#x27;s not that bad, especially if you&#x27;ve been dealing with plucking and waxing. I&#x27;ve only used it on my underarms so far, and I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. I ordered mine middle of August and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice so far (including the very first charge). I use mine typically about once a week to a week and a half, so the battery life is pretty good. I like that cordless option as well. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 star rating because for me it has done miracles, works very well I use it while plugged in so it has more power leaves skin soft and hair free!!!! Very painful but you&#x27;ll get used to it not a big issue for me. This is a Must have.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, it makes your skin smooth and hair free for a week or two, leaves no bumps and redness after using it. Giving it 5 stars because it does the job very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painful not going to lie but the results are awesome &amp; my hair has grown back very slowly. I only give 3 stars but like I said it&#x27;s painful and uncomfortable. But once you get past all of that there&#x27;s no problem</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying this due to fear of how it would &#x27;hurt&#x27;. I had never used an epilator or waxed before this.  I was pleased to find it super easy to use, with very little discomfort. I had no issues doing my legs the first time.  It did take a few times to master doing my under arms without it pulling, but after a few uses I can do the area with very little discomfort.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use!! I must admit its a bit painful but it&#x27;s quick and works great!! .</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. The Emoji Soft Caress Epilator is quick and easy to use. I actually find it less painful than waxing.</li>
    <li> I returned this and bought a Braun Silk-epil 7. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It doesn&#x27;t remove nearly as much hair as the Braun, and I think the Braun hurts a lot less, too.</li>
    <li> As described. Seller was prompt and sent item on time. New and was exactly what I was looking for in a epilator. I did research on different brands and found this one to have the best rating and reviews. I only use it on my legs but the results are long lasting. The unit is easy to clean and take apart.</li>
    <li> This epilator totally works. If you wax, you&#x27;ll appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all by comparison. If you don&#x27;t wax, you may find this little gizmo torturous, but I say give it time and don&#x27;t give up. Yanking hairs out gets less and less of a big deal the more you do it, and when you have this dream machine on hand, it makes maintaining freshly waxed legs a snap. Plus, you can hang out and epilate while watching a flick, instead of wasting your money and your lunch hour at the waxer. One tip, don&#x27;t press down hard like a razor or clippers, just follow the instructions and use short brush strokes. Success!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my armpits, and although it hurts and gets really red, it&#x27;s so worth it! I stay hairless for at least a week!</li>
    <li> I got one of these epilators for myself and got completely addicted to it. Then I got it as a gift for my mom and she loves it too. Okay, here are the pros: It works. It actually removes your hair and has a very similar effect to waxing. Hair comes back in a couple weeks or so and finer than before. Con: you don&#x27;t get as smooth of an effect as shaving, but it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t hurt. One of the only reasons I put up a review was to say it is a rather minimal pain experience. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it hurts less the more often you epilate. Oh, the other con is that it is rather loud. It sounds like a small hair dryer. Other than that it is a fabulous product for the money/value. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a mission for a better underarm defuzzing experience. After reading some internet suggestions I abandoned my razor&#x27;s and creams and invested in the epilator. Though it&#x27;s not a magic pill to eliminate dark underarms it has been an improvement as the epilator pulls out the root of the hair which gives you the dark underarms. I definitely feel I can wear my sleeveless shirts with confidence.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I did a LOT of research before buying this epilator since they are kind of an investment.  Really though, this will save you a LOT of money, especially if you get professional waxing done.  I use it for my underarms, legs and bikini area (I think anyone with a moderate pain tolerance, a bit of bravery and a desire to save money and time should try it!).  I work at a spa and an underarm, leg and bikini wax would cost you  $100 or more every 4-6 weeks...No thanks, not to mention drive time and appointment time.  I epilated my underarms 4 days ago and not a trace of hair yet, and no dark shadow!  Love it!  Legs is a bigger area and has to be done more often unless you are willing to let all the hair grow out at once and go for it.  I just do it every few days (it only takes a couple of minutes and is less irritating than shaving, not to mention that good razors are really expensive over time).  It does not get every tiny hair on legs like shaving but takes out an impressive amount for sure!  For special events I just use this as usual and then shave the day before. Works great.  Try it if you are sick of shaving every day and don&#x27;t want to deal with the mess/time/money involved with wax.</li>
    <li> This works but it ruined my legs because of all the ingrown hairs and now I have lots of dark marks all over my legs. I exfoliated and did everything to prevent ingrowns. I never had any ingrowns before using this, and I can only use electric shavers because of my dexterity issues so I don&#x27;t think I am naturally prone to ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave in and invested in a Tria Laser, and with lots of pampering and treating the dark marks in conjunction with the laser hair removal, I am finally beginning to see healthier skin!</li>
    <li> Great epilogue for the price. I moved to a better model and gave this to my sister</li>
    <li> Worst epilator I have owned.... It missed hairs like crazy. It says the curved shape is to follow the natural shape of the body for a more efficient epilation... All the other depilates I owned before were straight and worked better. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> My first epilator and I will never go back to razors again.  i got it about two months ago and love it! Yes it hurt the first three times I used it. Originally I just got it for my awlful chin hair but I use it every where now. The hair seems to get thinner the longer you use it and therefore is less painful.  Powder is a must for underarms as it helps it glide across. Battery power sucks it goes to slow amd hurts more in my opinion so I just keep it plugged in. Amazing results will def buy another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Yes it hurts the first few times you use it, but once you are used to it, it is well worth any discomfort. I love that my legs stay smooth for weeks.</li>
    <li> This works but it does hurt. Takes time to get used to it. I was scared at first but you have to be patient.</li>
    <li> It works fine. Quite a bit stronger than my last Emjoi</li>
    <li> Every time I would shave my underarms I would have hair showing again the next day. No one has time to shave every day! I also don&#x27;t want to keep burning my skin with Nair or Veet. With this epilator I won&#x27;t have hair showing until over a week later. My skin feels smooth and it just looks so pretty being hair free.</li>
    <li> I was really scared to use this because my friends told me its going to hurt but I wanted to try anyways. IT DID NOT HURT AT ALL. LIKE NOT EVEN A LIL BIT! My underarms are so much smoother and it has help lighten up the darkness. Overall this is amazing! Don&#x27;t think twice! Buy it</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators since the late 70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s and wouldn&#x27;t go any other way.  This does everything it is supposed and in a very efficient way.  I think it does a good job getting the hair and I like that it can be used with or without the cord.</li>
    <li> It has met my expectations. The first couple times are painful, but the outcome is great. I use it every couple weeks. I have coarse dark hair.</li>
    <li> was told it was great and it hurts in the begining but you give yourself time and get used to it. it&#x27;s worth the pain in the begining to get the benefits- much cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating so long, I think this may be my 4th epilator.  This model is by far the best for several reasons:  (1) the cordless option is fantastic because I like to epilate standing in the shower and I have used extension cords before to get that done.  No more!  (2) Significantly less (if any at all) irritation.  I not only epilate my legs, but also underarms and bikini area, which are much more sensitive than the legs.  Previous epilators have given me lots of irritation under the arms and red bumps in bikini area.  The Soft Caress left me pretty much irritation-free!  I put on deodorant after using it, which used to STING with my other epilators, but not with this.  I don&#x27;t really know WHY, I just know it&#x27;s vastly better than any other model.</li>
    <li> I used to go waxing every other week or so for my arm pits. I&#x27;m glad I can use this at home anytime I want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works so well. There are two speeds: 1 for the thinner hairs, 2 for the thicker hairs. There is a recharging wire, a bag, a little cleaning brush, a massage add-on thing that you can put on the epilator if you want to have a better experience, and also a protective cap for the tweezer area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple, practical, not too big, and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to every girl out there.</li>
    <li> This item is totally worth it!!! I initially purchased this item because when I got home from a 2 day camping trip and took at my underarms I freaked out! Then I started thinking how crummy it is for us girls having to shave every other day or two. I looked at some reviews on YouTube and read the reviews on here and decided to purchase this device although, I was scared to death of the pain factor. Many reviewers say that the more you use it the less painful it will become over time. I took all precautions the first time I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what a I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Became familiar with the sound the device makes on both the regular and fast settings. (Kind of intimidating the first time you turn it on).&lt;br /&gt;2. took 700mg of Ibuprofen (I told you I was scared)&lt;br /&gt;3. Took a nice long and hot shower and exfoliated well with Sun Laboratories device (similar to Clarisonic)&lt;br /&gt;4. dried off completely.&lt;br /&gt;5. immediately used Emjoi Soft Caresses.&lt;br /&gt;6. applied lotion with aloe vera to sooth redness (my legs were red and bumpy for about a day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy and the pain was completely tolerable. I actually did my legs first because I thought it would be less painful than my underarms (underarms weren&#x27;t bad either, and I skipped the ibuprofen step), and I ended up finding it easier and less painful to use the fastest setting. It hurt the most around my ankle area. TOTALLY WORTH IT!! Recommend following these steps if your scared the first time. :)</li>
    <li> As someone who has been looking for alternative ways of the everyday shaving this was a great start. I followed the directions that were given, BUT they say the hair removal can last up to 6 weeks, im lucky if itll last a week for me. Its a great start but id rather wax, the pain isnt the problem its the time that the hair is gone is the problem.</li>
    <li> have used this item three times have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I loved it after first use, even if it took me 2 hours just to epilate my legs. After second time it gave me terrible rash and ingrown hair. I wanted to give this thing a chance, so I tried it again, after six weeks break- same result- ugly red bumps all over my legs. And my skin is not sensitive. You have to be very careful around your knees,this thing will scratch you. Wish there were more reliable reviews.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an earlier version of the same product that has, after several years of use, lost its punch.  I consider it a bathroom essential.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;strawberry legs,&amp;#34; where dark hair grows under the skin a bit before it grows out, making my legs look spotty and gross. I thought getting rid of the hair entirely might fix the problem. Using the epilator has made my legs smoother and the hair has grown back in lighter, just like promised. However, I haven&#x27;t had the epilator long enough to see if it helps with the spots on my legs. I hope it does. I haven&#x27;t used any after epilation cream, so maybe that would help. Pain wise, the epilator was fine. It stung, but it felt more like itching than pain.</li>
    <li> I did a ton of research on these things. Which ones to buy, what to do to your skin before you use them, what to do after you use them, etc. I used it about once a week on my legs, armpits, stomach, arms, and upper lip. I would have to dedicate about 5 hours (because you have to go over areas very slowly and multiple times) to this and I couldn&#x27;t watch TV because this little machine blocked out all sound. So it was 5 hours of me, myself, and my epilator. No matter how well you upkeep with exfoliating you will get ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s just not an efficient tool for hair removal. Don&#x27;t even think about removing pubic hair. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, I used it everywhere else with little to no pain, but it is truly excruciating to get through the pubic region and the ingrown hairs are worse here than anywhere else. The only place the use of this thing was practical was on my armpits, but the ingrown hairs were still unsightly. Either way, I don&#x27;t think is was the product that was specificly bad, it&#x27;s just epilators in general. The biggest complaint I have about this product specifically is it went dead in about 6 months even though I gave up on it about 4 months in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: There isn&#x27;t an issue with this product per say, but just epilators in general. They don&#x27;t efficiently remove hair, it takes a long time, and ingrown hairs are inevitable. This product, however, won&#x27;t last you too long as an investment anyway though. Mine stopped taking charge about 6 months after I received it.</li>
    <li> I thought it would hurt but after a while you get used to it and it beats having to shave every day.</li>
    <li> Terrible. I bought this in the hopes that I&#x27;d be able to save time and effort shaving (I have MS and both of those things are precious to me). Not so. I tried it on my legs and arms, and it felt like I hadnt shaved conventionally in two or three days. Needlessly said, I am returning this and sticking with my Venus razor.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife.(she asked for it) She has fine hair, and this works great for her.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about how well this would actually work, and how painful it would actually be.  the only places it really hurts are by my ankles and around the back of my knees, other than that it&#x27;s actually not too painful, and it does get more tolerable the more you use it.  I have noticed my hair coming in much thinner!  it is time consuming at first, but if you keep up with it with touch ups every week or so it&#x27;s not so bad.  totally worth it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the new item</li>
    <li> It works but this method isn&#x27;t for me at all!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this product, but I&#x27;m sure glad I did. It&#x27;s amazing. Yes, it hurts at first. Not terrible pain, but some discomfort. After the first time, you&#x27;re good to go! I will never shave again. haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, the first-third time you use it; it is going to leave behind the little hairs. If you&#x27;re a woman who waxes, you know your hair has 3 growth stages before you can get 4-6 full weeks of complete smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, don&#x27;t give up at first, and trust me. You&#x27;ll LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t let the intimidating sound scare you off.</li>
    <li> This product does what would normally take me up to an hour in probably 15 minutes or less. The sound it makes can be truly frightening when I first started to use it but you get used to the pain. If I can&#x27;t take anymore I will just stop and continue another day. This thing is really great. Hair will grow back at the same rate as it would waxing, but without the mess and the cost. Recommended</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my life to shaving. Although it might hurt when using for first time, it is worth the pain :) You won&#x27;t have any hair issues for as long as 3 weeks. My fiance loves the product too and he was the first one to give me the high five on that :). So, why wasting your time? Worth your money and if you take in consideration that you pay about $10 every month and a half for a packet of 6 razors that&#x27;s about even better!!!!</li>
    <li> I have rather fine hair, and when it comes to arms, legs and my body it&#x27;s pretty much not there. But as any woman I have to take care of my underarms and bikini area every so often. I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time and so one I&#x27;ve decided to try a different method of hair removal. I did some snooping around and every place I went to Emjoi products were on top of the best epilators out there on the market. So I bought Emjoi Soft Caress, it arrived very quickly, nicely packaged, so same night I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try. So I charged it for several hours, and did my legs first. It wasn&#x27;t so bad, and since hair was fine it took me like 15 minutes total and then... Emjoi just died on me. Just like that. So I charged it some more, but still Emjoi wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge for more then 15 minutes. So sadly I&#x27;ve decided to return it. I was too afraid to do my underarms while connected via cord. Overall it&#x27;s a good product, but I can&#x27;t say how well it works on other areas of my body. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was overall a great experience to get this product from Amazon. It came before the expected date. Was very well packed. Initially I was hesitant about using this as I m new to epilators and have a very sensitive skin and had also read some of the reviews saying it really hurts. But when started using it i was amazed. It does its job perfect and the feeling is WOW. Overall I m really hapy about this product and would recommend it to anyone who are new to epilators and would like to try one.</li>
    <li> I really hated to shave my legs every day and still feel the stubbles the next day, so I finally decided to have them waxed.  I had to go without shaving for 6 days before the process.  It hurt plus there were many hairs that remained.  To me, that process was a failure so I decided to order the Emjoy.  I was really surprised the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel the pain that I thought that I would (I&#x27;m sure it helped that I had my legs waxed a week prior). Now I use it every 3-4 days and there is no pain.  It only takes a few minutes to quickly go over areas and that can be done during a TV commercial.  No more cuts and showers take a lot less time.</li>
    <li> I have never shaved my armpits, I only plucked, but it was a huge pain and tiring for my arms. This saves me so much time and energy! I am not sure how well it would be for those that normally shave, but it plucks all of the hairs for me effortlessly and painlessly (although you do feel the pulls, it is not painful). It leaves my armpits feeling smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my upper lip, but it was slightly painful when used there. I would recommend numbing the area with ice first. It worked well in picking up the hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only area that was disappointing was on the legs. I had to run the epilator several times before it got most of the hairs (but I really had to try hard to get every one of them). I don&#x27;t shave though, so my hair is fine on my legs and only sparse patches of hair, so that might be the problem. It is also not painful here, but you feel the plucking. I think it might have been faster hand plucking the leg hairs in this case. I will keep trying though.</li>
    <li> Works great if you can stand the burn. Not good for clearing large areas (like legs). That would take all day. Good for smaller areas.</li>
    <li> I used this on my legs. I got a lot of ingrown hairs, and it was too painful for my tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively to epilate my underarms. It hurts at first but your are ripping hair out of your skin what do you expect? It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much on my underarms as it did on my legs. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and it only takes me a minute to a smooth hairless underarm. I do my underarms about once a week. My hair is growing in different stages... or it just grows fast!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I absolutely love using it. It doesn&#x27;t really last long without it being plugged in but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Good size to hold and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator ever and I loved it!!! The only reason why I dont give 5 stars is because it only lasted me 4years and i think it&#x27;s was kind of pricey, i mean there are cheaper brands so i thought this was supposed to last more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin but my hair is thick and dark, that means that even after shaving you can kind of see my hair!! after using this epilator for 4 years my hairs did get thinner!! even after i stopped using it.... i mean it has been about a year since it broke and my hairs still are thinner than they were 6years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my legs and arms. i tried using it on my face but it is SUPER painful!!! I also used it on my armpits every now and then and it leaves my armpits really soft but, like I said before my hair is thick, so sometimes it makes me bleed a little and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
    <li> The epilator works fine when it&#x27;s plugged in....but it&#x27;s not very potent with battery power.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the one I have is a lemon, or that&#x27;s the way they are made.  Will be&lt;br /&gt;returning it to the manufacturer for verification.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and my wife loves it and i love it too if you know what i mean  ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a research junkie and spent hours reading reviews of tons of epilators on Amazon as I&#x27;ve never used one before (or waxed for that matter).  I ultimately choose this one because it could be used corded or not and I couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted the power of a corded or the convenience of being able to take it anywhere. First off, many reviews scared the crap out of me about pain and ingrown hairs so I actually delayed my purchase while deciding if I really wanted such a torture device.  I have a bikini wearing vacation coming up so I ultimately took the plunge and pressed the order button.  My first experience was not nearly as big of a deal as some reviewers talk about.  I popped some ibuprofen and a bottle of wine about 30 minutes before starting my bikini line.  I cleaned, dried thoroughly then lightly baby powdered.  The feeling was more of a tingling vibration.  I didn&#x27;t find it bad at all and wound up doing my bikini line as well as my legs that first time because it wasn&#x27;t very painful.  Holding the skin as right a you can, going slow and making sure the device is pointed the right way (I&#x27;m left handed so the shape contour made for a right kept making me grab it backwards) and kept at a 90 degree angle is key.  My skin was quite red the first time. Afterwards I rolled on some Tend Skin as tons of reviewers recommended for after care then spread on a triple antibiotic ointment and went to bed.  The next morning I exfoliated with exfoliating gloves and rolled on more Tend Skin.  The following day (so second morning after epilating) I woke up with no redness and smooth skin.  I then rolled on Tend Skin twice a day and exfoliate every morning.  I&#x27;ve had three minor ingrown hairs on my legs and have just put extra Tend Skin on and then a layer of antibiotic ointment.  No biggie. I wish I would have bought this epilator sooner!</li>
    <li> This is  a good Product for those with a lot of hair. I have very little hair, and I have to epilate almost every week as all the hair do not get epilated every time. However, the pain level is low as I thought for the Armpit area.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work half as good as it says.  Will pull more hair than it removes.</li>
    <li> (not James, his wife, we share this account.) I LOVE this product!! I&#x27;ve had it for 2 yrs now and have saved myself a ton of money on waxing! I am not super hairy to begin with so it doesn&#x27;t really work for my legs, I have friends who have this &amp; use it on their legs and it works great for them. I tried to go 4 weeks (yikes!! But my husband couldn&#x27;t even tell the difference, not hairy.) without shaving or waxing my legs and it just couldn&#x27;t grab hold of my fine hairs. I use it for my under arms and bikini area. I spray a little rubbing alcohol and dry completely!! The longer you use it the less you have to, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am pleasantly surprised. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and had obvious apprehensions about the pain and ingrown hairs but it really isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as some people say. I have used it all over including my bikini area and the pain is very tolerable. I had the most discomfort on my legs actually but I just kept going and it eventually got better. I have used the tria laser and this was actually LESS painful and has turned out to be the most effective hair removal method I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a wonder how smooth my armpits were after and so great not feeling self-contious wearing tanktops! I gave it 4 stars only because I had some irritation on my legs and arms that is taking quite a while to fade but aloe seems to help some and I also am planning on putting alcohol-free witch hazel on right after and hopefully that helps minimize the red spots.</li>
    <li> Emjoi Soft Caress Hair Remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buying a hair remover.  When you first use it tickles a little up your leg but tis gentle I had to use twice to make sure I got all the hair.  It is worth the money my skin is soft as a baby.  I would recommend it anyone it works great I was impressed. My arm pits needed to be done twice but it is worth it. My skin feels smooth and soft!  5 Stars I would so buy another if this one every falls apart on me!</li>
    <li> This epilator rocks!  I bought it 2 years ago or so and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  It&#x27;s so perfect if you&#x27;re on the go or if you travel - (I&#x27;ve been known to do touch-ups in the car on my way to school or work). It does take a long time to do the legs but the head is pretty small so it&#x27;s good for all the nooks and crannies :P  I can&#x27;t stand shaving my underarms so this is my only option (because the salon is expensive and they leave me sticky).  And, although it&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s great for the bikini area.  It may be painful to begin with if you aren&#x27;t used to epilating but you can get used to almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, mine doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Fair warning - I took mine to Europe where I was studying for a few months and I would charge it and use it (not use it while it was plugged in).  In any case, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I charge it and it&#x27;ll run for 1 minute or so. I don&#x27;t know what happened but I am so bummed because I love love my epilator and use it all the time. Everything I took with me from the U.S. that had to be charged now has a ruined battery (e.g. my laptop stays charged for 5-10 minutes and before I left, it stayed charged for over 1.5 hours). Case in point, if you&#x27;re staying in Europe and can&#x27;t live without your epilator like me, just buy one in Europe and don&#x27;t ruin this one or one you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because hair all over your body grows at different rates, it&#x27;s hard to say how often you need to use it.  One hair, once ripped out can take up to 6 weeks to grow out but if you have a hair brewing under the surface, there&#x27;s no epilator that can get to it and it will eventually grow out not at the same time as others. BUT, that being said, those hairs are still much less noticeable than if you forget to shave or don&#x27;t have the time. Just need some touch-ups now and again.  Overall, I stay smoother 5x longer than I do with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to go with the Emjoi Emagine now since it&#x27;s bigger and will take less time onthe legs but otherwise I&#x27;d stick with the Soft Caress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Epilating!</li>
    <li> This exfoliator is miles better than my old Braun exfoiator.  This is fast, painless and comfortable to use on underarms, legs, bikini line.  THIS PRODUCT is GREAT.</li>
    <li> I am totally sold on this epilator.  I had never used an epilator before and I had heard horror stories but this epilator is very easy to use and handle even for a first time user.  I love the fact that it is cord free and rechargeable when needed.  It holds a good charge.  I was so pleased with the product that I bought one for my daughter who was not happy with her brand and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator when my Emjoi AP99&#x27;s cord stopped working. The soft caress works well but not as well as my AP99 did. When epilating with the soft caress, I have to go over the same area of skin several times before all the hair is plucked out. It definitely works and the hair is removed, it just takes some time to do so. I feel as if the lack of hair-pulling power on this unit is due to the unit&#x27;s emphasis on the \\&quot;soft caress\\&quot; when being used. Compared to my AP99, the soft caress is a lot less painful to use. So if you&#x27;re looking for a less painful experience, then this is the epilator for you. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something to get the job done well and quickly, I&#x27;d go with the AP99. Overall, this is a great product at a great price. The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t require you to carry a cord all the time is also very nifty.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve waited a bit before writing this review. First a couple of things you should know about me. 1. I&#x27;m an esthetician/waxer. 2. I have super fine hair which means it&#x27;s easy to wax/epilate. I&#x27;ve been waxing my own body hair/getting it waxed where I can&#x27;t reach or see (under arms, nether region) for about two years now. Waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt me as much as some folks because I have fine hair. (That&#x27;s sometimes where the pain comes from... if you have thick, coarse hair, it hurts more to rip it from the root).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve gotten tired of waxing my own legs and underarms. Legs are just too messy, the knees never turn out right and my underarms, well, let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve hurt myself more than I&#x27;d like to admit because the angle is weird and I&#x27;m pulling with the wrong hand. I usually trade waxing with a friend of mine who is an amazing waxer here in Los Angeles. But I&#x27;ll be honest, I couldn&#x27;t get to her as often as I&#x27;d like to remove hair. I also get frustrated that you have to wait so long to wax. My waxer friend suggested I buy the Emjoi. I was skeptical because of bad experiences in the 80s with the Epilator. So I sat down and started Emjoining with lots of fear. Now I&#x27;m an Emjoi addict. I Emjoi once a week, instead of getting waxed once a month. The reason I like Emjoing over waxing is that it grabs the hair when it is shorter (0.5mm vs. 1mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts on the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;1. Try to get any part of your body that you want to Emjoi waxed for at least a year if you can before starting with the Emjoi. Part of the reason that Emjoing is such a delight for me is because I&#x27;ve been waxing for a while and I don&#x27;t really have that much hair left on my legs, etc. If you are worried about cost, talk with your waxer about getting you on an all-you can wax plan for a year. Usually they will be happy to have a loyal customer!&lt;br /&gt;2. Then use the Emjoi for touch-ups about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure that you put baby powder on your skin before Emjoiing. That helps dry all the wetness off of the top of the skin. If your skin is moist it can hurt how effective the Emjoi is and also make it hurt more. You wanna Emjoi on as dry a palette as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4. I use the Emjoi on my legs, underarms, arms and bikini. On the legs, it hurts like little rubber bands snapping on your skin, but it&#x27;s not crazy painful. On the underarms and bikini (where you have more delicate skin) it definitely hurts more but it&#x27;s still not a deal breaker. I DON&#x27;T use the Emjoi for a Brazilian. The skin down there is too sensitive and at a weird angle, so there is too much of a possibility that I could hurt myself. Plus let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s not that easy to see. So if you need a Brazilian, I&#x27;d still go to a professional. I do use the Emjoi on my arms, doesn&#x27;t hurt really at all. Where it hurts me too much to use is on my face. That&#x27;s because the skin there is very delicate. I tried Emjoing my sideburns and lip. Never again. I&#x27;ll just wax it and be done with it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Going to a professional waxer is still way easier. I just know that it isn&#x27;t in the cards for everyone (money &amp; time). So if you have done your budget and you have money allocated to spend on waxing, then I would definitely do that over the Emjoi. For me it&#x27;s not just about the money, it&#x27;s about time. I don&#x27;t have the time to get to my waxer as often as I want to rip hair out by the root. So that&#x27;s why the Emjoi is perfect. You can use it where ever and whenever. Now the one thing I&#x27;ll say is that if you are sensitive to pain, waxing is still way better because it is quicker. I can wax my legs in 10 minutes. Emjoing them took 30 minutes. So the pain is prolonged. BUT like I said at the top of the post, hair removal doesn&#x27;t really hurt that much for me (except my lip oh Jesus the pain there is crazy!!!). So that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t care if it takes a little longer to Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;6. The little sucker is loud. Just be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;7. I spurlged and spent extra money on the light. It doesn&#x27;t really do all that much for me. I have a little light that I keep near my wax station at home and that helps me see the hairs way better than the little light. But you might like it. I think the light is a personal preference.e light. It doesn&#x27;t really do all that much for me. I have a little light that I keep near my wax station at home and that helps me see the hairs way better than the little light. But you might like it. I think the light is a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this epilator! It was my first time ever using an epilator, so I was a little nervous about the pain, but it did not hurt at all. I used it on my underarms and legs. The epilator worked really well, even though there were a few stray hairs that I had to pluck out myself. My legs have never been smoother, and I cannot stop touching them! I don&#x27;t see myself going back to shaving now that I&#x27;ve used this epilator. The only thing that I do not like about this epilator is how loud it is!! It sounds like a lawn mower.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something a that would last a little longer than shaving and was drawn in by tales of slowly thinning hair over years of use that people say they get with epilators. I was particularly hopeful for being able to use it on my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I&#x27;ve only been able to do my legs--when you epilate armpits or the bikini line for the first few times there&#x27;s some bleeding, and I&#x27;ve been putting off really diving in there. At first I was a little disappointed because there was still a lot of stubble left. I think the best advice I saw online when reading guides to using these was that you should think of epilating more as a long term solution than a quick fix like a razor. You have to epilate several times over the course of a few weeks to really see results comparable to shaving. I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times since I got it several months ago, and my legs are starting to feel as smooth as having been shaven after use, and it really does last quite a while. Each time I go over with the epilator at this point I&#x27;m just picking off hairs that were broken instead of plucked the first few sessions. So over the course of time it&#x27;s becoming what it was promised to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide describes the feeling of the epilator as a sort of pins and needles or tingling sensation... but to be honest it really does hurt. It&#x27;s not unbearable and if you stop, the pain goes away immediately, so you forget that it hurts every time you go to epilate again. It&#x27;s just enough to make you wince when you start, but not enough to make you avoid it. It definitely hurts less the more you epilate because there are just fewer hairs to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not as effortless as some of the reviews and the product description would have you believe... but it&#x27;s worth it over time.</li>
    <li> This thing is great for the most part. I did notice the downfall that the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully charged when using unless its plugged in while in use. The after use it is definitely necessary to buy the after lotion because the ingrown hairs are terrible! Alright for my first epilator.</li>
    <li> I used to use Braun epilator. After using for few years it was time to get a new one, I was very happy with Braun, when I decided to purchase a new one, I coudn&#x27;t find Braun, so I decided to try something else. After reading many reviews I stopped on SOFT CARESS EPILATOR. I hate this product. It doesn&#x27;t remove anything, and hair start growing in the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. I&#x27;m going to get Braun again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this about a month ago and have used it twice. The areas I used it on are still smooth which is fantastic. I had another epilator from another brand I had used occasionally, but this Emjoi works much faster and has given me better results.&lt;br /&gt;Is it painful? Sure. Don&#x27;t use it on hair that is super long, best used on stubble. Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs. The exfoliating pad Emjoi included is great for that.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is tired of shaving, and is wary of the skin pulling associated with waxing.</li>
    <li> This made my legs all bumpy after epillating. It broke the hair instead of plucking it snd caused ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> The shipping was faster than expected! This is my first epilator and it was a great investment. Given that I usually pluck my armpits , this is a lifesaver and it was not as painful as you might think! The noise level is okay and the product came with useful tools. I think it is very convenient to use and easy to clean. I am more than satisfied and overjoyed with my purchase !</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Honestly, it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made through amazon. It&#x27;s so easy to use and does not hurt as bad as the other reviews stated. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to the pain of waxing but the only thing I felt was a tingly sensation after going through with a couple of passes. It&#x27;s really convenient when you want to get the job done fast and not have to go though the process of heating up the wax and cleaning up, etc. The only thing I would say is that you really have to exfoliate before and afterwards on a regular basis and moisturize so your skin is prepped before and after epilating. Also, like others have stated, I would highly recommend not having your hair too long because it will hurt even more given the epilator will be pulling at the hair and you would have to clean it more often in between passes. Otherwise, definitely a good buy. Have used it twice after initially letting it charge for a good couple of hours and have not needed to charge or plug it in yet.</li>
    <li> it took a while for me to use it the sound of the gadget is a little intimidating, the pain is tolerable, i love the product but i have a hard time using it in the underarm you have to do it over and over before the hair pull out...my legs are soft and hair free...how i wish its summer already so i can wear skirt.i love the result.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator 2 months back and used immediately after i received it and felt so good as it was smooth all over my legs and hands &amp; thought its the best epilator but let me tell you i was wrong the reasons are..&lt;br /&gt;I never had ingrown hair on any parts of my body except my feet and it was difficult for a wax to remove my feet hair but emjoi has done a miracle by removin it at once but let me tell you once my hair growth started i started noticing black spots of ingrown and thick hair all over my legs and little on my hands. My thighs used to look good even without waxing as i had very less hair there..but even my thighs experienced the ingrown n thick hair and it started getting worse with every little growth of hair on my body..and spots left after removing hair is still on my legs and i dint dare to use it again on any part of my body&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my armpits and felt so smooth after using it and after 4 to 5 days of removal i experienced small bumps there which was even little painful.&lt;br /&gt;In short its not worth spending 47 $ on this product as it makes your skin worse and leave you with small spots all over your legs because of ingrown and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try it on bikini as bikini area is loose and tends to get caught in tweezers may be u need to be expert to try it there.</li>
    <li> Having looked at the reviews for this product, I decided to get it. When using the Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator, I didn&#x27;t feel much pain because I was used to tweezing unwanted hair. But, for those who aren&#x27;t used to plucking their hair, it may hurt at first. I thought this was a good first epilator and would recommend this to beginners!</li>
    <li> My previous Caress was at least 15 years old and was great, but this one is even better. I&#x27;m amazed at how much better this version gets rid of unwanted hair. I&#x27;m still not used to it though and have nicked myself a few times, but the built in safety feature prevents serious injury. If it&#x27;s your first time using,  be careful, especially when using on the face. My only uncertainty is the plastic on/off switch - it may not last as long as my first one.</li>
    <li> It seems to slow down or turn off easier than my prior Epilator, but it&#x27;s also gentler and doesn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have to be attached to a wall to work! The packaging was horrible to get into, there was really no convenient way to cut into plastic and it doesn&#x27;t tear off easily but the product is great.</li>
    <li> I just bought this one around three months ago and I adore it. I use it for my armpits and legs. Now the first time I ever used it it was the most painful thing ever, it felt like torture I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to finish epilating but I did! And I&#x27;m glad I did because my skin felt the smoothest after. I honestly do see a difference now when my hair grows back it grows back really thin compared to when I shave. I&#x27;m not lying when I say that when I epilate my armpits now I feel no pain at all, maybe it&#x27;s just me idk but it&#x27;s really fast just like if I&#x27;m shaving. My legs still feel a little pain but I don&#x27;t epilate them as much because I wear pants most of the time. Anyway I&#x27;m glad I started epilating although however you will get ingrown hair if you don&#x27;t scrub right after you epilate, it happened to my armpit and I got the hugest zit ever after that experience I started scrubbing before and after and never had that problem again :)</li>
    <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s not painful (not really) and the battery lasts pretty long. Although it doesn&#x27;t leave my legs perfectly done and I end up using a razor to get them all smooth. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> def makes hair grow slower, but WOW ingrown hairs are outta this world!!!</li>
    <li> Received as described</li>
    <li> I had really high hope for this but it&#x27;s kinda disappointing I try it on my arm and leg. It didn&#x27;t really pull out the hair more like broke the hair. The result is like after shaving for 2-3days. I have to go over the same area a few time and still isn&#x27;t clean. Pain level 3.5/5</li>
    <li> I had an older model for many years and finally shorted the cord out. I love that you can charge this model &amp; use it without the chord attached.</li>
    <li> painful but does the job</li>
    <li> I had a no no which cost much more&lt;br /&gt;This is doing what I want&lt;br /&gt;For much less&lt;br /&gt;Yes is more painful at 1st&lt;br /&gt;But now is fine&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got it</li>
    <li> Works well and the hair grows back slower.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. Plucks every hair out. I just hate the fact of having to clean the hair out several times while using it. It does HURT on the first time you use it. You will get ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t exfoliate. I use on my legs and underarms. After several uses, you&#x27;ll get use to the pain.</li>
    <li> Wow this s*** hurt! My first time using it was on my armpit. I didn&#x27;t think I could finish, but I sucked it up and did it. I think it is so worth buying. After a couple times of using this, it doesn&#x27;t feel as painful. It leaves my armpits hairless for about 7 days which is amazing for me. Also the more you use it the less amount of hair you grow back. It&#x27;s freaking awesome.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 3 years so far on a weekly basis, it works well for me, I use it for upper lip and sometimes underarms/arms. Battery life did decrease a little after this much time, but I would still consider it pretty good. I don&#x27;t have another experience with an epilator to compare it to though</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 years ago and it still works like a charm. What I like the most is how quickly it works. I used to own a coil epilator and it was like a weekend project but I always spent the time. I hated shaving stubble and had many more issues with ingrown hair from shaving than epilating. With this epilator I can be done with both legs and my under arms in about a half hour. Yes the under arms hurt but it is tolerable and is only necessary every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i has to shave everyday but now i so it once a week , and my hair is not as thick as it used to be</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to removal facial hair. Unfortunately, my skin is far too sensitive.  I broke out in a rash after using it the first time.  After waiting several weeks for the rash to resolve, I tried it again several times in different spots, and broke out each time.  By the time I finally gave up on it, the window for returning the item had closed.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it was easy to use and exactly what was in description</li>
    <li> Great Product! I was tired of dark armpits from shaving and this has definitely helped. YOU MUST  exfoliate every day tho. which is easy just do it in the shower everyday!</li>
    <li> This works like a dream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use a razor again. This thing is great. Over time the hairs seem to get thinner. It&#x27;s a little hard to get them all if you&#x27;re not in the right light. Love this and most of the women in my family are fans. Would be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Recieved the emjoi yesterday.  Plugged it in and charge it up and put it to use this morning.  Instructions are clear and concise.  Product worked efficiently and most importantly, no pain!  My legs didn&#x27;t look like a plucked chicken like they did with my old epilady.  Great product.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing changed my life. I don&#x27;t shave my armpits or wax my lip any more. Works equally well on coarse and fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts the most the first time. The hair grows back thinner and not all at the same time. So using my epilator is annoying, but not a horrible prospect, at this point. And yes, it does hurt. About the same as waxing, except you have to do it to yourself, and slowly. I want to do my legs, but can&#x27;t work up the will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair needs to be fairly long - about a sixteenth of an inch - for the device to be able to grasp it. A more expensive product that hugs your body more closely might be able to solve this problem to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure not to get any loose skin caught in the wheel thing either. Hurts a bit and leaves a bruise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work well on wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and it&#x27;s still going strong, so it&#x27;s that durable at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold a charge, but not for very long. I just use it when it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Does not do anything for the hair on my chin or my legs. Does not hurt as much as I expected but seems to just break the hairs rather than pulling them out.</li>
    <li> So I used another version of emjoi 4 years ago and it gave me  a rash since it wasn&#x27;t hypoallergenic.I looked all over until I found this one on amazon. Perfect that it&#x27;s gold plated for skin that can&#x27;t take nickle. You have to be careful not to pull out your own skin by  not pressing it into the skin. The only problem is that lots of hairs do not stand straight up, so you end up pressing it closer to the skin, resulting in nicks. It&#x27;s a pretty good product. Not perfect, but less messier than waxing. As far as pain, this one hurts much less than the panasonic wet/dry one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit April 25 2015* This second epilator I just received is defective. You cannot use it without the power cord in. When I tried to, the second setting is actually setting number one, which is low. There is no way to remove coarse hair with this second setting unless the power cord is in.</li>
    <li> Bought this item from looking at reviews on Amazon &amp; Youtube by users like xteeener, fafinettex3. From looking at reviews, this epilator sounded like a replacement for razors, tweezers, &amp; all that painful hair removing processes; a dream come true. It didn&#x27;t turn out that way. :( I was SO excited to try it out, but even from the start it gave such poor results. The epilator works, but it always leaves so many stray hairs around. I&#x27;d say it removes about 75% of your hair (which takes a good 30 minutes) and you have to remove the rest with another method. Honestly, $50 bucks for this \\&quot;life-changing\\&quot; hair remover is not worth it. I should have gotten an epilator that didn&#x27;t cost so much, then I wouldn&#x27;t have regretted it as much. The invention of an epilator is great, but this one wasn&#x27;t as efficient as I thought it&#x27;d be. I would recommend epilators to friends, but not this specific Soft Caress. . .</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare, but for a novice epilator I can say it works tremendously well. It smarts the first few times, so I agree with others who&#x27;ve compared it to the first stages of getting a tattoo. Pulling your skin taut, per the instructions, reduces the sensation of discomfort significantly, as does using some oat flour or corn starch to cool the skin down afterward. Homemade Tend Skin (rubbing alcohol, crushed aspirin, and some tea tree) also helps after. I did my armpits a week ago, touched it up once briefly, and they&#x27;re still completely bare. It&#x27;s impressive. My legs are also smooth, with a quick daily touch up. I have a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs, so it&#x27;s hard for the epilator to catch them all each time, but overall they&#x27;ve stayed mostly hairless for the past week. I have wasted a lot of time shaving my legs and underarms in the shower.. I wish I&#x27;d been using one of these all along. I can&#x27;t attest to durability, but it seems well made. The battery lasts a long time, as far as I can tell. It has a sturdy feel in the hand and is easy enough to clean, too. Marvelous gadget.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed before, and never used an epulator before so this is coming from a newb.  I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly a month now and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I wasn&#x27;t at first though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good week of using it every day in the beginning before you start noticing that it really is better than shaving. Just have to stick with it.  I use it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a mind of its own and I cannot STAND how my legs feel after as short a time as 12 hours after I shave because my hair seems to grow back so quickly. (And I actually have REAL hair; not this thin, fine, blond crap you couldn&#x27;t see with a microscope...)  And if I get goosebumps, forget it; it&#x27;s like I never even shaved. Which is why I bought this thing, hoping it would be more effective than just shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it is.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little painful but nothing to be afraid of. I think that&#x27;s the key: don&#x27;t be afraid to try it different ways to see what works best.  I&#x27;ve tried it straight up and down against the skin, at an angle, in a circular motion... It&#x27;s not going to catch and pull on your skin.  At least, with all the ways I&#x27;ve tried it that&#x27;s never happened to me anyway. You have to learn the different directions your own hair grows in though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because it seems it could grab the hair a little better; I have to go over the stubborn ones several times to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do notice my legs stay smoother a lot longer.  I can even skip a day and feel comfortable, where before I would want to shave twice a day to stay comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t grow my hair out or anything the first time I used it (I couldn&#x27;t stand to grow my hair out anyway).  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that because it would probably hurt more as you rip all the hair out at once.  The first few times it left little red bumps from where the hair was pulled from; but that was just my skin getting used to it because it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS, which means I&#x27;ve been tweezing the hairs on my chinny chin chin for almost 20 years now.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many hours I&#x27;ve spent trying to get all the hairs, just to be out driving and feel a new one and then I&#x27;d obsess on it all day.  With my first use of this product, all of my pesky chin hairs were GONE within about 1 minute.  All of them!  I felt silly that I hadn&#x27;t bought one of these before now!  I would describe the Emjoi hair remover as very similar to a men&#x27;s electric shaver.  Looks a lot like it, sounds a lot like it, used a lot like it, but instead of cutting the hair, you have a bunch (25+) of tweezers yanking the hair out.  I didn&#x27;t find it painful on my chin at all.  If you&#x27;re used to tweezing, this is really no big deal.  I tried it on my upper lip, and that was a bit more sensitive.  I&#x27;m scared to death to use it on my lady parts, but I really just bought this for my chin, and am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product! I was tired of plucking every 4 days or so. My armpit hair didn&#x27;t grow back as quickly as it did when I shaved, but it still grow pretty quickly. I used the emjoi hair remover and my hair grows back the slowest out of all the other options. It wasn&#x27;t even painful for me :) My only problem, is that it didn&#x27;t catch all of armpit hair. But all in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> So I finally got around to purchasing this cordless epilator. It works fairly well with patience and a couple extra strokes along the same row of skin. After a couple months of using it, the epilator won&#x27;t turn on unless it is charging on the cord now. It&#x27;s a shame since I specifically bought this model for the cordless option. Other than that... it&#x27;s easy to clean and carry around. It was a bit loud, like you&#x27;re running a mini chainsaw in your room... so taking it on trips can be compromising as well. I still prefer it over shaving. It&#x27;s much easier. Make sure to exfoliate to avoid ingrown hairs though!</li>
    <li> It comes with a cute little bag to keep all your accessories in, a head cover and \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachment, and a little brush to clean it out with. You can operate it at two speeds, I use the first setting for the fine hair on my arms or face and the second setting for coarser hairs on my legs. The only other place I&#x27;ve tried it on is the bikini area...which would work well except I have trouble getting it very close to the skin because of the curve on top. Maybe I&#x27;m just holding it wrong, because it does work very well for other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like that you can use it while plugged in if you need to use it but the battery is low. Also is very easy to pop the head guard off and clean the hairs out of it. I found that the first 2-3 times I used it hurt the worst, with each time getting less and less painful. The first time I used it around my ankles and behind my calves, I could have cried...but if you can get through that first time it does get better. It also seems that if my leg hairs are getting somewhat long before I use it, it will just break the hairs off instead of pulling them out so that I end up shaving the next day just to get rid of the stubble feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, great investment for someone wanting a good beginner epilator. I would recommend it and probably buy another if this one ever gives out.</li>
    <li> Hurt like hell!!!! Won&#x27;t recomment to a friend.</li>
    <li> The first one I received worked great when plugged in, but the battery didn&#x27;t work. I emailed the manufacturer and after a couple of exchanges, he decided I received a dud and sent another one to me, no return on the other. Just plain, simple backing of their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself. I have bad problems with ingrown hairs. Seriously bad, like I&#x27;ve consulted a doctor about them. The Emoji hair remover has caused fewer ingrowns than ANY other method I&#x27;ve tried: shaving, waxing, epilady, creams that caused me to break into hives. Yeah. All of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who remembers the epilady from the late 80s - early 90s is probably thinking, \\&quot;why in god&#x27;s name would I want one of these?\\&quot; Those things should have come equipped with a bite-stick or a bottle of whiskey. The Emoji, on the other hand ... it&#x27;s great! By far better than anything else. I&#x27;ve tried singing the Emoji&#x27;s praises, but sort of like enthusing about a Diva Cup, it takes the right kind of audience to get swept up in the enthusiasm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you&#x27;re looking for a hair removing product that won&#x27;t make you writhe in pain and also does the job, this little gizmo is for you.</li>
    <li> Honestly, everyone said that their first time was super painful, but mine really wasn&#x27;t. I have a low pain threshold, and never tweezed or waxed my body. I tried this on my legs and all I felt was a prickly feeling on my lower half. On my thighs, it was a bit more comfortable, but not unbearable. I used an after epilation cream which helped. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> It is not working as good as it supposed to work.It take out half or you hair but just shaves the other half so I need to use it every week.It is less painful than waxing.</li>
    <li> I will be honest, I never owned one of these before, however, as I have gotten older, you start to tend to get hair in places you don&#x27;t want (at least I do), so I said why not, give it a try.  I will say, I have an exceptional tolerance for pain, been through the waxing, tattoos, childbirth, dislocated kneecaps, broken bones, etc., etc., THIS is painful!  I have been through a lot and maybe it&#x27;s the areas I use it are a little more sensitive, but to say it is just uncomfortable is ridiculous.  I will also say that in addition to the pain, I still had to go back with my tweezers.  Not a horrible purchase but will only probably use it in a &amp;#34;rush&amp;#34; situation...back to my tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have owned other hair removal products from this company and this one is an improvement on the last one I purchased from them. The rechargeable feature is convenient and the hair removal is actually less painful and easier, so thumbs up for the new design. I like the improvements to the device and would buy other products from the line in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works wonder! But it is a bit loud! But it&#x27;s definitely worth it! Do the job right!</li>
    <li> I like the speeds, but it does not get the tiny hairs. Also its hard to tell if it pulling the hair out or breaking them, since the hairs is back after a week or so. Very convenient though, just keep in the sock drawer and pull it out at night when I noticed the hair. Done in probably 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it causes a lot of ingrown hairs but other than that its way better than shaving!! I use it under my arms and they last smooth for about 2 wks as opposed to shaving they only last smooth a day &amp; a half. My husband uses it on his chest a stomach. He is not very hairy so he doesn&#x27;t have to do much but he says its quite painful. I have to say epilating my underarms will make my eyes water since it is pulling the hair from the root but its bearable. Now I have also tried it \\&quot;down there\\&quot; &amp; oooh it HURTS!! I&#x27;ve only done it once &amp; it lasted smooth about a month but I have not been brave enough to try it again. Overall I do recommend this!</li>
    <li> love love love it!! the very first time was horrible!!! lol. i used it for my underarm hair and it was painful! BUT, after the numbing sensation (once you go to your happy place to not feel the pain), it&#x27;s great. leaves the underarm super soft, cleans amazingly down to the root, it&#x27;s crazy to see just how many hairs this thing pulls at once, insane! easy to clean, lasts a really long time in between charges, sometimes i&#x27;ll use it while it&#x27;s connected to the charger cable in order to have more power. do not use if you are slightly sweaty or fresh out of the shower as it will not work well. i use before showering and it works wonderfully and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly and isn&#x27;t painful at all anymore. i tried using in &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas...yeah...that will NEVER happen again!!! i have also tried using on my legs twice, and twice it irritated my legs and gave me little rash bumps. it has 2 speeds, but i just use it on the higher of the two, maybe that&#x27;s why i get through the process pretty quickly. amazing little buy!</li>
    <li> Perhaps one of the most worthwhile purchases I have ever made. The very first time you use it, if you have a lot of hair to remove, it will BURN LIKE THE FIRES OF HADES in a sort of addicting way. But after that, it&#x27;s fine. You have to go over an area several times to remove all the hair, but once you&#x27;re done, it takes a while to grow back in and it grows back thinner. I use this a lot, in a lot of places. I even use it on my arms (soooo smoooooooth).</li>
    <li> The Emjoi soft caress epilator is very easy to use, though it&#x27;s very painful, it&#x27;s such a great tool for long lasting smooth skin. It comes with it&#x27;s own charger which is fantastic, it eliminates the need for constant battery searching, along with a carrying pouch for travel &amp; a mini brush to keep it clean. This is totally worth the price, also the pain will subside after a couple of uses. With shaving I&#x27;d have to worry about shaving the next day to keep the prickly hairs away but all of the shaving stress is gone for almost 4 weeks after one use! I highly HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
    <li> Just got this epilator and I can already say it&#x27;s a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main purpose for it was for underarm hair removal. I was impressed by how a few glides over my skin removed so much hair so quickly. The result is very smooth skin. It was also virtually painless for me. In fact, I thought the unit was defective because I couldn&#x27;t feel anything, until I looked down and saw all the little hairs on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the underarms, legs and face, it feels like a slight prickly sensation. The bikini area is a different story. It is a sensitive area, so epilating is more painful down there, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything you won&#x27;t get used to in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this unit is so easy and effective, that I actually enjoy epilating. Some areas take more time, but if you have fun with it (in my case, I epilated while I had the hockey game on), this unit will help you through the experience comfortably.</li>
    <li> I think its a little slow, time consuming. But, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad, I feel like waxing is just as much pain.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t think this product is the greatest because it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for thicker hairs. It only works on the areas that have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I watched the videos, read the instructions, googled for more information. I tried to use it several times. This did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Just arrived and I was a bit nervous :3 but I got it all set up and ready to go. If you want unwanted hair gone, this is it! Glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;But you have to let your hair grow long enough to use it. that&#x27;s an uncomfortable period of time.&lt;br /&gt;overall, works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. It is a bit painful way to remove hair and it does not get all the unwanted hair but it works ok for the money.</li>
    <li> Very painful for the first few minutes but eventually the pain does subside. The reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it did leave behind a few unwanted hairs but that may be because they were too short to grab on to. I am not going to shave for a few days and see if it will remove them then.</li>
    <li> ...YEOWCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can never bring myself to use it because it just hurts. It&#x27;s a good quality and has a lot of little accessories. I like that you can use it while plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilation hurts, but if I could just get past the first few painful sessions, this tool would be great. Unfortunately I won&#x27;t grin and bare it so I won&#x27;t be using this much!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and I have to say that never again will I go back to shaving or waxing. The product arrived right on time and included accessories and a carry bag. It does hurt so much the first time but the pain is worth almost two months of not worrying to shave or wax. Get it. It&#x27;s great(:</li>
    <li> Alright, I have gone through so many hair removing tactics...waxing, shaving, threading, tweezing...granted all of them work but they all cost so much money! I would usually spend so much on threading for my upper lip &amp; eye brows it would be around 20 bucks.  This was my first Epilator (sp?) and I was so weary! I spent hours looking at user reviews, product pros/cons, etc.  I bought this one and just used it on my upper lip, eyebrows, and my chin.  Now, I will tell you this: it does hurt but it does get better while you use it.  I say its worth it because: I am a Middle Eastern girl and by definition, we tend to have course hair and it is pretty severe.  I have suffered for a while and I can say, if you have to pluck your eyebrows a bunch, have to have your upper lip done every 3 weeks or so...get this.  I am so happy with my purchase! Best of luck!</li>
    <li> I tried to return this item because it hurt me when I tried to use it, I have had others that did not do this. UPS came twice. I  missed them both times, now they tell me I could have left it outside, I was home but in the yard. I tried to get a new label as the one I had was for pick up only. I have been unable to figure out how to get an answer to my complaint. The thing is I have returned things before with amazon but never asked for pick up before. I am sure this epilator is very good, just too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all of my life?  I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing, and everything but this is by far the best way I&#x27;ve discovered to get rid of the hair.  Love, love LOVE this!!</li>
    <li> I have never thought about my Emjoi Hair Remover will be powerful and great so my results were worth while.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase ever with a epilator and omg it hurt so bad at first but after that it has been a breeze.  I use it for my under arms first and went two weeks with any hair growth and my under arms were the smoothest I have ever seen them.  Tried bikini area just took a little more time and legs.  But overall I will never shave again.</li>
    <li> I have ligher hair so it seems to break some rather than pull them. The new hairs that are growing back in are ingrown, I have never had and issue with that before. The ingrown hairs are making my legs feel bumpy. Not sure what to do, other then use a shower scrub and try not to pick them out. The product itself is not that painful and easy to use. I am going to try and keep using it for awhile but if the ingrown new hair does not stop then it will end up not being a good product in the end, for me. Came with a nice bag to store it in. Does not seem to work very well at all on my face. It does a good job on my armpits.</li>
    <li> I purchased a month ago and I think its ok.it had really good review but I am not that sure about it... When i use it under arm it pinched my sink and it&#x27;s does take couple times to take the hair out.</li>
    <li> Is good l like it it just hurt  very much</li>
    <li> This product is awful. It hurts so badly and leaves red marks on the skin. It would be better to pluck out your hairs instead because it does not even pick up every hair it only takes out a few here and there and it burns your skin. DO NOT BUY THIS it is awful. I have tried it on thin and thick hair and it hurts both places and does not take that many hairs off.</li>
    <li> it does not hurt once you get used to it which did not take really long time for me, probably 2 - 3 times</li>
    <li> it stopped working after like 2 months, so I don&#x27;t recommend buying this. Just go get waxed b/c less pain and more convenient</li>
    <li> I used to buy many different brand. Don&#x27;t even mention about the Japanese brand which cost me a lot. Emjoi is really strong so I don&#x27;t feel the pain and also my hair got remove really fast. Save me time!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in October and while it took some getting used to, it does save me time. However, it almost seems like the hair grows back thicker too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...On another note, it sopped working as a portable hair remover...I have to plug it in, in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilator for over 10 years now. This one surprised me as to how relatively painless it was.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought as far as getting rid of hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this on the brazilian area because it hurts so much. If it doesn&#x27;t hurt you, though go ahead. I&#x27;ve other reviews where people would do it down there. I simply couldn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s perfect though. No more underarm waxing for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant about buying an epilator. I read reviews on how they&#x27;re expensive, and occasionally painful. But then I though it out... it&#x27;s not supposed to feel REALLY gentle: it&#x27;s ripping the hair out of you from the root. So I tried waxing, using the veet strips that you warm up with your hands, and they worked mostly. But waxing, if you miss some hairs, you have to re-wax the area, and that seems like a waste of the product that should&#x27;ve worked the first time. But you won&#x27;t have to worry with an epilator, as you can go over the spots multiple times. Now, it is kind of painful once you start, depending what area you&#x27;re doing. I found that my legs weren&#x27;t that painful, nor were the underarms. But also note, your legs do get a bit red, and i recommend that you do this when you don&#x27;t need to go anywhere for a day. I did mine when I got home today. It took quite a while, especially since it was my first time(about two hours, and i did only the bottom half of my legs, but i wanted to be thorough). Hair does get in the area that you&#x27;re working in, so keep it to somewhere that&#x27;s easy to clean, like your bathroom(or even outside, if you&#x27;re adventurous and don&#x27;t have nosy neighbors). It&#x27;s been about an hour since I finished, and the redness is calming down, but my legs are still tingling. Be thorough, make sure your skin is dry, exfoliate, and clean the machine. I&#x27;d recommend this product to most people, if you can tolerate a bit of pain. It&#x27;s totally worth it, and I don&#x27;t want to be stuck shaving every day this summer, and now I wont be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant, try waxing first, and see how you feel about that. But it&#x27;s a great epilator, and I LOVED IT. Totally worth five stars.</li>
    <li> Just got my product 2thumbs up. I love it I just hope it lasts for a long time...  just incase it dosent ill be back and post a review....</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get it in the mail! I&#x27;d already read so many reviews of how PAINFUL it is. And I will agree that it is painful. On a pain scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7.8 honestly. The pain, I&#x27;d say,  depends on the amount and length of hair you are epilating as well as the area. At the same time,  I&#x27;m used to getting waxes at the salon...which was costing me quite a bit of money. But, what made me purchase was the YouTube videos I saw of women who had these beautiful underarms. So I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at how it pulls the hair from the root. I even tried it on my upper lip and as short and fine as the hair is there, it still got it...and now my upper lip is very smooth. It worked on my chin as well. My legs...I had to go back and shave (this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars), but my legs feel so luxuriously smooth. It hurt a bit under the arms, but it certainly got the hair up from my underarms. All of the services I get at the nail salon are taken care of with this epilator. And I&#x27;m glad to have spent a one time fee of $42.95 versus approximately $648 over the course of a year getting different waxing services at the nail salon. I was even considering going to a European wax salon to utilize their services, but this epilator made me change my mind! Definitely happy with my choice!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try because I saw videos on how it works.  Waxing at home took forever to get one leg done and shaving I don&#x27;t like because I have to shave a few days after.  This works great and gets the job done. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for so long.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really remove hair unless it is pretty long-and not effective on coarse or very fine hair so it actually only works on very little</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really need this since I had laser. This is for my daughter but I had to try it first to check if its really painful.  To my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t at all.  It stings but it was okay.  I even tried it on my upper lip.  That area hurt but its tolerable.  It&#x27;s less painful than threading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the epilator and gave it to my daughter to try.  It hurt but she was able to tolerate it. She was able to do it by herself. I just guided her to the spots that she missed.  I saw all the hair that came off her armpits. There are a few strands left but since this is her first time, I didn&#x27;t push it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple of times so far, so getting used to the pain level. Better then waxing, quick and easy, worth the money.</li>
    <li> It kind of stings, I won&#x27;t lie. This is my first Emjoi product and I am very happy with it. The hair stays away for a long time, but not anywhere near 4-6 weeks. And it is pretty time consuming; I find myself having to use it 3-4 times to get all the hair off. I would recommend for first time users and it is a lot cheaper &amp; has better reviews than the No!No!</li>
    <li> Replaced and old epilady with this and am totally happy with it. Works so much better!</li>
    <li> The trick is to hold at an angle for shorter hairs. My only complaint is it is loud. I have sensitive skin, and this does not break the skin. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It def removes most if not all hair but I feel that if you use it for facial hair like I do, that the hair could grow back a little thicker. It is painful but I prefer this then the messy wax.</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator for about 4 years and I still use it semi-regularly! I&#x27;ve never had any issue with it and it was worth the money, in my opinion. Comes with a carrying bag, a brush to clean it with, and a protective cap as well as a loofah and a massaging head which I have never used. I chose this one over the corded one in case I ever wanted to take it with me somewhere but so far I&#x27;ve always been able to plug it in for use while traveling. I find epilating in general more painful than waxing since it goes so much slower but pain-wise I feel like this one is as good as it&#x27;s going to get. I prefer to wax, then touch up and use the epilator in between waxes, it works great that way for me. I searched epilators on Amazon to see what&#x27;s new out there but I guess I will keep this one a few more years!</li>
    <li> This works great i love it. Pain depends on the person personally doesnt hurt much for me if i dont let my leg hairs get long. I stopped using it though because my hairs started growing under my skin which was weird. You could see the hairs underneath but couldnt get to them because they were under a layer of skin exfoliation is important but i felt like i had to scrub my leg off to get to the hair.</li>
    <li> I  bought this a  while ago (maybe a 1yr or so)  once you can endure  the pain ( not that bad)  it&#x27;s fine. I  tried it on my arms and legs. I  like using on my arms more.  honestly, more, I  don&#x27;t even use it any more.  went back to shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the only epilator I have used. I used it on my legs and underarms. I find it very effective for use in the arm pits as it removes all the hair in a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving my legs as it takes far too long to remove the hair- at least an hour to get them sufficiently smooth and I never am able to remove all the hair I&#x27;d like. I found the pain to be bearable and I tend to have a low pain threshold. It certainly does become less painful the more you epilate. I like the portability of the machine and I found the battery to be long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two complaints: It takes too long to remove hair on larger areas of the body and I got so many ingrown hairs on my legs that it took nearly six months for them all to clear up. The way you epilate may help with ingrown hairs. I read to only go in the direction of hair growth, but the epilator could not grab the hair unless I was going opposite to the direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this on my underarms and it works beautifully. I would purchase this epilator with that intention only.</li>
    <li> glorified set of super tweezers but man I love it to pieces.  When you use this the hair seems to stay gone longer and when it comes back its lighter.  I am a major fan of this - I lost the cord to my old one to charge it.. I will be buying another one of these and maybe one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Background info: This is my first epilator. I&#x27;ve never had my underarms waxed (I&#x27;ve had other sensitive areas done), so it was pretty darn painful the first time I used this, even after taking a pain reliever 30 minutes prior. However, by the fifth time the pain barely fazed me and I&#x27;m good to go in just a couple minutes. I don&#x27;t have a particularly high pain tolerance - I think you just have to WANT to push through the initial pain, knowing that your body will adapt and the results will be worth it. I started off using the slower setting, but quickly moved on to the faster setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I use this about twice a month on my underarms. One full battery charge lasted me 4 months. It&#x27;s able to pick up most of the hairs, leaving me with incredibly smooth underarms. I use the loofah it comes with to exfoliate every time I shower and haven&#x27;t had a problem with ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s great that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. I&#x27;m hooked - I won&#x27;t ever go back to shaving with the kind of smooth, long-lasting results I get with this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not that great for the bikini area. It just doesn&#x27;t work with the shape of my body and it takes longer than waxing. Also, when attempting to charge it for the second time, it didn&#x27;t tell me that it was fully charged, even after 48 hours of being plugged in. It still works fine at the moment. No other complaints!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I both use this to remove hair. He uses it on his chest and I use it on my arms. I used to wax and it was time consuming and messy. This doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as waxing but it&#x27;s close enough and it is so convenient, I haven&#x27;t waxed since I got it earlier this year.</li>
    <li> This removes my hair and lasts so much longer than shaving, and you get used to the pain! This product came on time and in perfect condition. I can never go without it. Haven&#x27;t shaved once since I bought it!</li>
    <li> I love it but wish it was a little easier to clean. The little brush it includes helps but doesn&#x27;t clean it completely. Besides that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I use it to epilade everything including my armpits, arms and legs. It&#x27;s lightweight and very convenient and is cordless. This is the second one that I have purchased. The charger on the first one broke which really sucks cause I only had the product for a little over a year. The only major flaw to this product is that it is very hard take the cover off to clean the hair off. Despite this, I still love this product. If you don&#x27;t like shaving every day this is something that I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I repurchased the second one, the same exact thing happened shortly after. It no longer held the charge. So in order to use, I had to keep it plugged in which was really frustrating. Because of that, I found myself not using as much and I had went back to shaving more. Whenever I used the epilator, I still thought did an excellent job but I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase.  Not only did it arrive quickly and in one piece, the performance of this little gadget is awesome.  I will never go back to waxing or shaving again.  The Emjoi is easy to use, accurate and gives great results.  My skin is smooth and no irritation!  The hair also grows back must finer and a lot slower.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is sick of waxing or shaving.  The pain level of this is 0-1 for me.  It may be because I have a high pain tolerance or because it feels just like waxing.  However, I will say the upper lip area does hurt just a bit.  I would be cautious around the bikini area as well.  Definitely worth the money.  If something ever happened to my Emjoi, I would most likely purchase a new one.</li>
    <li> Very useful I use it to do my armpits don&#x27;t need to shave or buy waxing strips every time so even if it&#x27;s an investment in the long run it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve had mine a while now and it still good to use.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been waxing for years. I&#x27;d wax 1000 times before I did this again. It was such a HUGE waste of money. Im very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It really does work. I got mine today and tried it right away after the shower. Underarms were hair free within minutes, I did have to run it over a couple of stubborn spots a few times. However, the legs &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; A LOT when you use this. I will probably continue shaving my legs and use this for everywhere else.</li>
    <li> works awesome! painful at first, but has yet to lose power and is easy to clean and is extremely effective.</li>
    <li> I just made it through my first epilation and it was just as I expected. I bought one of these around 12 years ago and tried it one time and couldn&#x27;t do it. I get horrible bumps after I shave so I was researching different methods of hair removal and came across this again. I decided to try again and went ahead and ordered it. I guess back then I didn&#x27;t know what to expect so it was a fail but after reading review after review and watching a few youtube videos I felt encouraged to try it again. It did hurt like I knew it would but it works good. I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying an epilator and I&#x27;m really impressed, wondering why I never used something like this sooner. I was about to start waxing my legs since I am tired of shaving and the bumps/razor burn it created. But then I decided to go for an epilator instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first turned on the Emjoi, the noise was definitely intimidating and it felt pretty painful to use. The good news is that your skin will go almost numb after a short while and you will hardly feel the stinging anymore. For me, epilating was most painful on my arms. The legs were alright because the skin is more tough there, and the underarms were much less painful than I thought it would be. They feel a bit sore now though since I think it also cut any bumps that were sitting there. Maybe exfoliation beforehand would help prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips I would mention are to hold the skin very tightly, especially while using it on the underarm area. Once I was comfortable using it there, I had looked away without holding the skin and part of my arm got caught in the epilator. Nothing bad happened but it stopped turning and scared me at first. You also need to hold the epilator directly against your skin otherwise you will not be pulling hair from the root...it will only trim the top of hair like razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I want to try this on the bikini area but I&#x27;m really not sure... It seems like it would be 10 times the pain. After having used the epilator, I will definitely NOT be going back to shaving. This is also very easy to clean...pull off the top and use a can of compressed air to get rid of any hair trapped inside.</li>
    <li> First off, the product came extremely fast I thought it was Amazon Prime (But it&#x27;s not!) so I was very pleased with the fast shipping. Also, everything came organized and neatly packed so I was very impressed with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the performance of the Emjoi-I, like most people, anticipated excruciating pain. Once I got it in the mail, I charged it and turned the gadget on. The sound was very intimidating! I slowly placed it on my leg area (lower calf) and let me tell you, it stung! But literally after 2 seconds, it felt like nothing. I was able to move more further up my legs all the way to the thighs and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! I was extremely surprised at how \\&quot;un-painful\\&quot; it was! Now that I was done with the legs, I had to now move on towards the underarms which I was most nervous about. Again, I slowly placed the epilator towards my underarm and again, NO PAIN! I was so surprised! But it all depends on each person. When doing your underarms, however, make sure you hold your skin taut or it WILL get stuck in the epilator! I seriously thought my skin was going to rip out but I just slowly pulled it out and it was fine. Just make sure you hold your skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little con-It doesn&#x27;t grab every tiny little hair. It&#x27;s not a big deal for me but for some it might. Just an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great service and product!</li>
    <li> 7.29.12&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to do a bit of a progressive review here. I have never had my legs waxed, but I have had my upper lip, under arms and bikini area waxed. I have used a hair remover cream from Avon before on my legs but typically I am your every day shaver. I HATE SHAVING! With in the next couple days after shaving I have stubble, which many have told me I&#x27;m fortunate because they have stubble later the same night.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a an ad on TV for the NONO! and searched in on Amazon, but after the bad reviews I decided to search for other products. That&#x27;s when I came across the Emjoi Soft Caress. I decided to give it a try after reading reviews. I agree with a lot of them but disagree at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third day of using it. and Yes I said 3 days. Even after being a regular with waxing, it is NOTHING like the same feeling. Waxing removes a large quantity of hair in one short pull of the material off your skin, which of course hurts a little for a few seconds. This machine tweezes each hair out individually. IT IS VERY PAINFUL. it is a very short pain but on some parts of my legs (ankles, knees, and calfs) i am very sensitive apparently and I have had to do it in small sections at a time. I have one leg done up to the knee and about 3 inches up and around my other leg done. It feels like a bunch of bee stings.&lt;br /&gt;In order to get the best results, you need to go slow, which just prolongs the pain. and you need to go back over most areas to get all of the hair. Some reviewers stated that you go numb after a while and get used to the feeling and dont feel it after a while, I did not experience that luxury. Some people also said that if you take a shower and exfoliate the skin and the hot water will also open the pores making it easier for the hair to come out, I also didnt experience that luxury. It just plain hurt, the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;But you know what? it does what it says, it removes the hair. Some people might be disatisfied after using it the first time because hair can and will grow in the first week, this is because hair grows in 3 stages. and after the pain of doing it the first time, it may seem daunting to have to go through all that again, but so far I give it a 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to.  I&#x27;m sure I will have to touch up to get the hair that broke off or comes in the next stage of growth, but if it really gives you smooth legs for up to 6 weeks like it states it does, it will be very well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I will update again as the weeks go by about the hair growth and the continued use and function of the device!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; on this site, I decided not to waste my money. I had the original epilady years and years ago and was hesitant about going this route again as it hurt so much. I looked at several models and the reviews and had almost decided not to purchase anything when I ran across this hair remover. The reviews looked promising so I ordered it. Best purchase I have made in a long time. I had almost given up on being able to keep my legs clean and smooth. I used this device right out of the box. It took under an hour to remove the hair from both of my entire legs and bikini line. It was quick and efficient and worked fine running off the power adapter. Yes, it does hurt in the beginning, but you get used to it. I told my daughter that if you can get a tattoo, you can use this. I&#x27;m so excited by this product that I am going to buy one for my daughter immediatey. If you are hesitant about purchasing a hair remover, don&#x27;t be. Buy this one, you will not be disappointed. I&#x27;m on day two since using it. I have no stubble growing back and my bikini line is still clean with NO razor burn. You can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The product is as good as the reviewers said: convinent and beginner-friendly. The price for the product itself was affordable but shipment was way too expensive as it costed even more than the product itself (from US to HK). In addition, it didnt come into my mind that the plug of the charger wouldnt fit here as HK has different eletricity-supply and the sockets we use here are three-legged, unlike the two-legged ones in US or other places, so I have to buy an extra charger for the epilator. Though it costed me HKD $1000 in total on making this epilator work on me, I would rate 5 stars on the product.</li>
    <li> I read the directions and did all the prep work! Shower scrub down w loofah. Got comfortable and nope, very painful. Also like some of the other reviewers said it snaps the hair instead of pull it out by the root.  I even tried numbing cream and wrapped it and let the numbing cream sit for 45 mins. It was still painful! I will be cleaning and listing this on eBay.</li>
    <li> I am a young Middle Eastern woman with medium thick hair that have very strong roots. I notice that about 75% of the time, this only cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t actually pull it out. It is actually faster for me to sit there with a tweezer and pull all of the hairs out one by one than to use this because I have to go over the same spot 5-10 times. This might work better for someone who has thin hair that comes out easily. I definitely lost out on the money I paid for this product. :( I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, but it seems like some people do like it. I guess it just depends, but I am glad I bought the cheaper one of the two I was contemplating at least!</li>
    <li> I love my Emjoy I think the secret is short hair and exfoliate so that you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This epilator is my first and is easy to use and clean. Comes with a convenient drawstring bag too. Definitely epilate after a hot shower, makes it a lot easier. Yes, it does hurt at first but you do kind of get used to the pain after a few uses. However, it doesn&#x27;t pull hair out that well so you will have to go over your skin slowly/multiple times. It also isn&#x27;t very powerful by itself, so I usually plug it in whenever I use it. Also, I find my hair does still tend to grow back faster than I expected...but maybe that&#x27;s just &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t apply lotions and stuff after epilating. All in all a good product.</li>
    <li> Its an okay epilator; however, I&#x27;d prefer not to have to pass an area 15-20 times before most (never did get all) of the hair is gone. Furthermore, it didn&#x27;t even get the finer hair no matter how many times I passed over it. Save your money and look elsewhere for a good epilator.</li>
    <li> fast service, have used it several times now, it takes a few times to remove all the hair, but overall very satisfied !</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old epilator. I love it it is not as painful and seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> most painful piece of torture contraption ever made.  Much more than any of the numerous waxings, shaving cutes, threading and tweezing treatments I have had done and have done to myself.&lt;br /&gt;Save your cash and get laser removal.</li>
    <li> Worked well for my spouse.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful time saver. It does take a little getting used to if you have never used an epilator before, and the original sensation is akin to a slight pinch when it&#x27;s removing hair but it&#x27;s very, very momentary. If you have a small pain tolerance, I suggest stretching the skin taunt and using it. It will slow the process down a bit but it will reduce the pinching feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it comes with its own handy pouch that you can cinch up. The accessories are also nice and useful - especially like the small brush which helps get hair out, but this can also get easily lost since it is quite small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to use this and reduce the spending cost on razors and shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator for the past three years. The pain was expected, so I just gritted my teeth through the process. It was still better than shaving. When the unit began to overheat and not keep a charge, I started shopping for a replacement. I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $140, and, after extensive research, I settled on this little jewel. You have to expect a certain amount of pain with anything that pulls the hair out by the roots. But let me tell you, this thing is pretty painless. I had to keep going over the area with my hand to make sure it was smooth because I literally did not feel the hair being ripped out. If you hate the idea of shaving but are afraid of the pain of epilators, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Its good as I expected...if you get scared to touch on your skin its painful ..just touch the skin and gently move up and down in 90 degree..there will be no pain..good luck</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this! My life is so much easier using the epilator instead of plucking my armpits in front of the mirror. I love it &amp; it&#x27;s so convenient when I travel. Great purchase!!! :)</li>
    <li> I was so nervous about using this epilator , but although it&#x27;s not pleasant it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought and I love the results! Leaves my legs and underarms so soft and smooth. A little heads up if you don&#x27;t wax the first time you use this on your underarms they will bleed, not profusely, but I kinda freaked when I saw it as I was not prepared for that. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> I lovely....it,s great.</li>
    <li> product is great i never have to shave again!!! :))</li>
    <li> this Emjoi is the one I needed and happy to purchased it</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this Product!</li>
    <li> This product arrived packaged as described.  It works well (plugged in or left unplugged) however, my only recommended improvement would be to add more blades or tweezers.  I must say that on the first try, i only did my lower legs and it hurt like hell and my skin was red and slightly irritated all over for about 24 hrs (therefore, not recommended to do for the first time prior to a big event).  It did the trick however, as i didn&#x27;t have to shave for about 3 weeks.  Minor touch ups here and there were needed as the limited blades didn&#x27;t grab all the hair.  The second time i used it thought, it worked like a charm and the pain was practically gone.  Not sure why that is but i&#x27;m sure by try #5 it should be virtually pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see the benefit to the curved design, as a straight machine would probably do the same job.  All in all, i highly recommend this type of hair removal device however, if you can spend $20 more, get something that has more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also attempted to use it on the bikini area as well as the upper lip and chin (of course after carefully sanitizing it).  The bikini area is definitely doable and not too painful but brazilian is a no-go.  Too much pain for me to want to even attempt it for more than 2 seconds.  The face also hurts (especially cheeks and middle of upper lip where your skin is senstitive).  Chin was fine though, not much pain at all.</li>
    <li> I have not waxed since I got this baby, I love it and will buy a new one to have it just in case.</li>
    <li> Long lasting battery and will operate while plugged in and charging.  Gets even the finest, shortest hairs!</li>
    <li> I am not a pain wimp but darn is this thing painful to use.  Still can&#x27;t get used to it but I paid good $$ for it so I&#x27;ll keep trying.  Don&#x27;t recommend though. :-/</li>
    <li> I use the product for my armpits and legs. It works very efficiently and effectively on the legs but it&#x27;s more difficult to use for the armpits. It couldn&#x27;t pull all the hairs and that&#x27;s probably because the surface isn&#x27;t as flat. Overall it&#x27;s quicker than waxing.</li>
    <li> This is my second emjoi soft caress epilator, this one I bought for my friend because she saw mine and had to have one! Love the product and it was delivered on time by sender.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator.  My first was a Braun corded.  The Braun did a pretty good job, but I didn&#x27;t like being tied to the cord, so I looked for a cordless and found the Emoji Caress.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I like it a lot.  I may upgrade to the 72 tweezer model eventually, but for now I am happy with this epilator.  I use it for my arms, legs, underarms, bikini area and complete intimate area.  I won&#x27;t lie to you.  It isn&#x27;t pain-free especially the intimate area and the underarms.  The legs and arms are minimal pain.  I also use it for the few stray hairs that crop up on my upper lip and under my chin. The upper lip really stings especially right in the middle, but it&#x27;s so much better than the old-fashioned tweezers. I used regular tweezers for my face for the longest time, and then one day I decided to try the epilator. It&#x27;s a little big to maneuver it above your upper lip, but it can be done, and it will take everything out at once instead of the tedious one at a time pulling that I had been doing with the regular tweezers.  One thing I want to point out is that you shouldn&#x27;t use the epilator on long hairs, especially on your legs, but really everywhere because they will break off or turn into ingrown hairs. The epilator works best if the hairs are short.  Also, work a small area at a time and do your best to hold the skin taut so the hairs will pop up and be grabbed by the epilator.  Aim the epilator in all directions, because you will have some hairs that do their own thing and grow in a different direction than the rest.  If the epilator feels like it&#x27;s dragging or sticking, apply a thin layer of baby powder so that the area is completely dry.  I use a loofah to exfoliate my legs and arms before using the epilator.  Then after the epilator, I use a moisturizer or butter.  I think the Body Shop butters do the best job for smoothing and moisturizing.  If I do develop any bumps, I use PFB Vanish which rolls on. I bought it on Amazon too. It smells terrible, but it works and the smell goes away quickly.  It moisturizes too.  My legs have never looked this good.  Once you get passed the pain, it&#x27;s win win all the way!on too. It smells terrible, but it works and the smell goes away quickly.  It moisturizes too.  My legs have never looked this good.  Once you get passed the pain, it&#x27;s win win all the way!</li>
    <li> This product not only pulls SOME hair from the root, if not it CUTS some of the hair as if i were to shave. I&#x27;m very unsatisfied of this product  leaving me horrible rashes on my legs and arms. It has marked my legs and arms with huge hurtful bumps. I&#x27;ve always had clear skin and i have never had any type of rash when waxing or shaving that area. Ever since i used this product, blemish has been appearing on my skin. The reason i bought this product was to have the smooth legs and arms i&#x27;ve always wanted but it APPEARS that i know feel BUMPS all over me even worse, it looks like i have ACNE ALL OVER MY BODY!!!!! NEVER BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> great tool, as long as you don&#x27;t mind some pulling sensation, after a few times it&#x27;such easier, most hair seems to quit coming back after a few months.</li>
    <li> I have had several epilators in the past but none of them worked as advertized.  This one works for every area that I need removal of hair.</li>
    <li> Much improved from older model I was using which is about 10 years old. Does not sting, very fast and more efficent. Nice to have the rechargable batteries. Older model used AA&#x27;s and slowed down quickly. Less ingrown hairs with this newer version, also. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who likes to use an epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because after I shave, I have about 3 hours before i&#x27;m stubbly again. I got this and followed the directions to the T, but did not get good results at all. In fact, I have nothing good to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-HURTS! Oh my god, I took a vicodin after the first minute of trying to use this and it still didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve had a chunk of my stomach cut out without anesthesia and this hurt more!&lt;br /&gt;-Messy, it was just flinging the hair everywhere! I ended up having to sweep my whole bathroom after using this for just a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;-It was breaking the hairs off above the skin. I was more stubbly after using this than I have ever been after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;-THE BLOOD! My legs looked like a murder scene, blood dripping everywhere. I did what the directs said and soaked my legs in warm water and lightly exfoliated before hand, but it was horrid.&lt;br /&gt;-Ingrown hairs, I now have HUNDREDS of ingrown hairs everywhere on my legs. I&#x27;m going to the doctor later this week and will probably need help with them.&lt;br /&gt;-Tried my under arms for a split second and I was gushing blood for the next 2 hours. All it did was pull out 2 hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to return this, but having no luck.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Emjoi epilator. First one lasted for almost a year so next time i bought a  higher quality one which is this. It worked okay for the first 5 to 8 uses and then getting stuck as if it clogged. I have tried my best to clean but it is frustrating since it makes a 10 min job take 40 mins stopping every 2 min. :( not very happy with emojoi epilator</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a year now and I JUST started using it regularly (when I start seeing hair growth). I just couldn&#x27;t get over the pain part of it. The trick to getting over the pain is; go to a professional salon and get WAXED. I had my legs waxed for the first time, as well as my under arms. Once they started to grow out I used it to touch up the areas. I can use it now without the pain being bad. It&#x27;s more than worth it and the product pays for itself. I paid more to wax my legs and under arms ONE TIME than for the epilator. My under arms are super sensitive, so I put just a tiny amount of coconut oil before I epilate to help the epilator glide on my under arms. Happy hair-less customer :)</li>
    <li> It hurts sometimes, but it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s much more efficient than rolling a spring on my face for 30 minutes.  It&#x27;s cordless.  A full charge epilated my face, armpits, and legs, and maybe more, it never lost any juice.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  For me, the armpits hurt the most, they actually bled.  The upper lip was also sensitive.  The legs didn&#x27;t really hurt.  Make sure to exfoliate and read all instructions.  It was my first time epilating and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Is cordless. Fast delivery. This is my third one in 16 yrs. my first one I had for ten yrs but I got it wet n bought a new one my second one I lost :(. They last a while. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister cuase the old one I had bought her finally ran it course but she loves this new one! she says its catches every little hair! best buy yet!!</li>
    <li> This is an older model and I hope they never stop making this one!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought one for the house and one for the cabin.  Love how it works and no shaving stubble!</li>
    <li> Im not very tolerant of pain, so when I first started I actually jumped at the sensation I felt. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll get used to it, and it&#x27;s not so bad that I can&#x27;t handle it for the sake of not having to shave. All in all,  a good product, well made and easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator and how efficient it is at getting the job done. It can be used for almost anywhere on the body. It comes with a nice little case to keep all of the supplies in one place. It moves very fast, and the speed of the tweezers along with the loud noise can be a little intimidating, but you can get used to it. I&#x27;ve read a lot of people say the pain eventually becomes bearable...yea that&#x27;s true, but you still feel it. I&#x27;ve also read that sometimes the epilator doesn&#x27;t catch all of the hairs... that&#x27;s also true, but a little adjustment of how you hold the tweezers and going over an area a few times can help with that. It&#x27;s not as bad as others may say it is. Also holding the skin taught is good advice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi epilators for years, and wouldn&#x27;t be without one. No more irritating stubble, and what hair that does grow back is baby fine and soft  I say &amp;#34;what hair that does grow back&amp;#34; because less and less hair grows back over time.  I think the hair follicles must die out after so much plucking with the epilator. I use it for legs, underarms, bikini area, and chin &amp; upper lip. You get used to the little stinging feeling, but at first it is uncomfortable. Be sure you use it on very short hair. If you let it get too long, go ahead and shave it, and then after a day or two start over using the Emjoi from there on out. Long hair really pulls and hurts. I will say that the upper lip does hurt, but be brave if you want to get rid of that ugly fuzz on your upper lip. It certainly isn&#x27;t anymore painful that waxing your upper lip!</li>
    <li> I could kick myself for how long it took for me to discover epilators. I just received it yesterday and used it on my arms, legs and upper lip... and it might sound weird but I can&#x27;t wait for the hair to grow back just so I can use it again! In one device, I replaced the need to shave, wax, pluck and thread various body hairs. The pain is just something to get used to. Pain is beauty and its totally worth the hurt... after awhile you become numb to the pain. Its not like you have to do it everyday. It is totally worth the price because over time, I will pretty much eliminate the need to purchase razors, and waxing materials. So it pretty much pays for itself. Also the fact that it is rechargable, is a big plus because I don&#x27;t need to add this the list of battery eaters.</li>
    <li> caused so many bumps on my skin on both legs and hands.... those bumps started turning dark and created  bad look on my body... could njot wear skirts for a while...</li>
    <li> hurts!!  plus leaves bumps and zits whereever used on face - at least mine did....</li>
    <li> Best money ever spent !!! Love this product . Battery last forever and charges super fast . Perfect for traveling !!! Easy to use</li>
    <li> Having tried similar epilators, almost nobody believes me when I tell them that this is pain free, and it is as good as waxing for reducing hair. Of course if you have shaved mostly and have coarse hair, then the first and second time might hurt but otherwise, this is the most painless epilator with the added benefit of really reducing hair. With waxing you have to wait for the hair to grow a bit, with this you don&#x27;t have to wait. Also for those suffering from skin reaction to most types of hair removal, this is the one for you. Again depending on your previous method of hair removal, at the very most/extreme you will experience red skin for an hour or two and then it&#x27;s gone. No more itching for days until the hair has grown out again.I have been using emjoi gold plated hypoallergenic models for 15+ years now.</li>
    <li> So I just received this yesterday and tried it out for the first time.  I&#x27;m not impressed at all.  Had to go over the same skin surface over and over.  Irritated the skin without taking out the hairs.  I don&#x27;t understand how this got 5 STARS from users.  Did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t pluck out every hair. it tends to cut rather than remove the hair, making the follicles stubby and unattractive looking. i use it for my arm since shaving my legs and underarms are much more efficient than using this epilator to remove the hairs. the hair on my arms grow back in a week. i would not recommend this product unless you are consistent with your hair removal routines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it twice but I wanted my initial impressions.  I&#x27;ll update after using it several more times.  My skin bruised slightly in one spot, which went away pretty quickly.  It also went red the first time, but not as much the 2nd time.  THe 2nd time was because I got tired of using it the first time.  I also tried it on one armpit which DID NOT GO WELL.  It kept sucking the hair up to pinch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time consuming to use.  It&#x27;s embarrassingly loud.  It&#x27;s painful (though I hear it gets better, and anything beats actual shaving, uhg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first epilator.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple electric shavers before that didn&#x27;t seem to do the job very well.  The promise of using a regular shaver was the biggest selling point, along with being able to recharge it.  I hate batteries :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get some smooth skin on my legs but it look a lot of time.  I may be holding it incorrectly.  Or I&#x27;m using it at the wrong speed or whatever.  I&#x27;m going to keep at it and figure out what works best, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean... I don&#x27;t hate this thing but I&#x27;m not in love with it.  Like I said I&#x27;ll update it after I use it some more.  Don&#x27;t rule it out, I&#x27;m still glad I got it! I think...</li>
    <li> I love this epilator and it does the job. I gave it 4 stars because it is pretty painful (but I still continue to use it). I use it on my under arms and legs and it is pretty painful when I get to the knee area. It&#x27;s a nice product and it gets the job done. I definitely noticed I don&#x27;t have to use it as much as I would if I used a razor.</li>
    <li> Did not catch all hair. Have to keep going back over the same place. Would catch about 90% with patience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good epilator, and the pain didn&#x27;t bother me that much after the first try. The epilator is fairly easy to use, but even when charged, it will not work as fast unless you&#x27;ve plugged it in.  It definitely caused some of my hair to grow thicker because it plucks hairs one by one, which stimulates hair growth more than waxing. Just like waxing, there&#x27;s a lot more risk of ingrown hairs, and it&#x27;s noticeable. I&#x27;m going to switch hair removal methods, but if you still want to epilate, exfoliate A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but don&#x27;t expect any less hair growth.</li>
    <li> Better than the Epilady I used previously, gets closer, less painful, holds a charge longer than needed to do all my body hair removal twice before needing to charge. Good product and worth the price!</li>
    <li> It very comfortable to use.  It fits in the hand very nicely..&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested in a replacement for the plastic head cover; please advise</li>
    <li> I bought this emjoi hair remover 2 years ago and it still works just like new! I only use it on my arms, underarms, and chin/upper lip. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve already gotten used to the pain, and the hair grows back so much less noticeable and thinner I&#x27;d say. As far as other parts, for me it&#x27;s too painful to use on my legs but I mainly wanted it for my underarms. Now I don&#x27;t have to shave there every single day! Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2015: I bought this epilator 5 years ago and it still works! The charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to but I like it so much I ordered a new one. Just wanted to point out that it works even after so long.</li>
    <li> This Epilator sounds to be powerful but it&#x27;s not, It gets stuck on the skin, you can not rotate that on your skin,&lt;br /&gt;It does not work on thin hair but grabs very well thick hairs, so I returned that, I might go with a Braun which was much faster and more flexible that this.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator so I can&#x27;t compare to others. I did some research here of reviews of several epilators and decided to get this one...glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly felt any pain and after awhile I barely noticed any pain. I do have a high tolerance to pain so I don&#x27;t know how bad it would feel to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does a great job with hair removal. I&#x27;m one of those that Really hates to shave and don&#x27;t do it as often as I should, but with this gadget that won&#x27;t be an issue anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quick and easy to use and comes with storage bag to hold all the accessories that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of getting another for my sister as a gift and would recomment this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, but it takes time to get all of the areas, patience to deal with the pain until you get used to it or use it a bit.  The hair does stay away, and I am sure it will the longer I used it (meaning it will continue to stay away longer each time).  Be prepared for pain in some areas and use slow speed to get the hard one, stand it straight up in that case.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, and I am more or less satisfied with my purchase. I am a light-skinned dark brunette with relatively thick and fast-growing body hair, and this has really cut down on the amount of shaving I have to do each week (1x/week as opposed to 5-7x/week). It is a little hard to use in curved areas (armpits, bikini line, etc.) because the tweezers are in a straight line, but with a little maneuvering it does the job. It can also catch very short hair, and I don&#x27;t notice it breaking too many hairs. I don&#x27;t know why they even have the two speeds, since the slower speed is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend buying yourself some AHA-containing exfoliating lotion - I use a loofah every time I shower, but I was still getting a lot of ingrown hairs until I started using Amlactin.</li>
    <li> Never took any hair off, what a disappointment this was after reading all of the great reviews, I guess if you have really fine hair it might work good.</li>
    <li> This epilator is pretty great, however I wish I had bought a model with more tweezers. With only 36 total tweezers, you end up with only 4 or so on each line. As you can probably guess, you have to make multiple passes sometimes to catch a single hair you&#x27;ve been chasing after. There&#x27;s a bit of space between each tweezer, so some hairs get missed and must be gone over again. However, although it&#x27;s painful (much less painful than waxing though), I really like the results that epilating gives. I have multiple areas where the hair has not yet grown back after having epilated weeks ago. The hair that does grow back is finer and harder to see. Win-Win!</li>
    <li> I HAD ONE OF THESE EMJOI EPILATORS &amp; IT LASTED A FEW YEARS. IT FINALLY STOPPED WORKING BUT I DECIDED TO STILL PURCHASE THE SAME BRAND &amp; MODEL FOR IT WORKS GREAT &amp; WILL HOPEFULLY WORK FOR  A LONG TIME. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Takes a few runs to pul out the hair.</li>
    <li> im loving it so far althiugh it may take some time to take out the hair but its all worth the wait heheeh:)</li>
    <li> This thing hurts. Women put themselves through a lot of punishment to look a little less harry.  I had my daughter do my back for the summer and it hurt more than my Tatoo (that was 6 + hours under a needle).  I will say I remember my sisters with the old ones in the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s which were a coiled spring.  This is a much better option.  I will say I had my daughter do a second pass about 2 weeks ago and the hair is less and not as dark and the 2nd time it hurt less (only a little tho).  I would say this is better than the creams and waxing and seems to last longer.  My daughters agree it keeps their legs smooth longer so WTH what a little pain???  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money to get the cordless the chargeable battery is better than most shavers and can do a large area with out running out (so says the large area).</li>
    <li> Ingrown hairs.. wears out after a while. Sometimes it breaks the hair off and sometimes it pulls it off. Not very consistent. Legs dont feel that smooth after. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, I always shaved. So here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks: very cute and easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Easy to use but some areas are almost impossible to do such as knees area. Hard to grip the hair. Also the hair lifting head is pretty much useless unless your hair is like 5mm long. even then....it&#x27;s kinda too thick to work. Oh and it&#x27;s loud :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels: It took me sometime trying to put this into words but i got it. Epilator feels like getting stung by a bee. Every time you touch skin with hair - stung. Keeping moving up and down - constantly stung. Until there&#x27;s no more hair then don&#x27;t feel anything obviously...So it does hurt but you just have to suck it up. A lot. But after sometime you feel pain so much you almost dont care. i recommend turning on tv, so you can be distracted while going up and down and after you&#x27;re used to it focus on areas you missed. Start slowly epilating only small areas at the time. Over all when it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s not that bad :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: super easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though that happened to me... leg didnt feel too smooth after, was still poky because some of the hair just got cut not pulled out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So so far that&#x27;s all I have to say :) I am keeping it and will learn to use to better with time. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I personally have thick hair and my hair grows fast. I had to use this for a week straight! Then after that week I&#x27;ve been using it 1 day a week... I hope I&#x27;ll be able to reduce the usage after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I do love this product. It&#x27;s my first epilator so I have nothing to judge it to. But my legs so smooth! Even with the hair growing back it&#x27;s still smooth! No annoying stubble</li>
    <li> i opted to ship this to the uk, had to pay extra £12 for customs clearance etc, only to find out that it does not work as it was a defective unit. not only was i unable to use it immediately, i had to pay for return shipping which cost me a hell load more money. really hope to get my refund soon :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this in April 2012 and for the first few months, and it was terrific! The pain took a little to get used to but it wasn&#x27;t anything that a regular person can&#x27;t handle. Sometimes you had to run the epilator over the skin a second or third time if it was done incorrectly the first time, especially in places like your armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, the problem came about half a year later when I went overseas and charged the epilator. I made sure everything was the right voltage and current and used the stock charger. However, after a while, the epilator just lost its power and started to turn very weak. When the epilator was running, it sounds less powerful and fast, and you are even able to stop the epilator from running with your finger! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is still usable but it just takes more time and more patience to use. I honestly do not know what happened as every other electronic product I have can be used overseas and in USA with the same charger, voltage and current, yet the Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator does not fall into that category. I am in the process of contacting customer service with regards to the warranty and hope I can get it fixed/replaced so I can continue using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I DO recommend this to people who are thinking of buying it. The cordless ability makes it much more convenient for me, despite the charging takes a while (around 12hours so I do this overnight) and for those who are just starting to epilate, this epilator is tough yet not too painful to handle! In my opinion, I think this hurts less than waxing but everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance level and preferences are different but sincerely, try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to travel with (just hope yours doesn&#x27;t lose power like mine did) and the cleaning brush is great until you lose it and don&#x27;t know what to clean the epilator with!</li>
    <li> This is good for the price but it is a bit of a slow process.  I wish had a higher speed so that it can make everything a little faster.  Most people say that it works great for the legs and are too scared to try the bikini line and/or armpits.  However, I find that doing the bikin line and armpits the easiest to do.  I hate doing my legs with this thing.  It hurts and it&#x27;s slow.  I strongly recommend for doing the bikini and armpits, however, I&#x27;d recommend just getting your legs waxed... so much faster and easier.  In other words, it works great for smaller areas!</li>
    <li> Have always used this product.  Mine finally quit after almost 20 years.  Found this one on amazon.  Love it, its the best.</li>
    <li> very beautiful and works well! it has two speed modes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good epilator, my first one I&#x27;ve gotten. I seen reviews on YouTube which made me get it. It hurts so bad the first time but after it&#x27;s not that bad. After yu epilate I get a lot of bumps n redness but they go away the next day. My hairs took weeks to grow back n they grow thinner and not thick as with razors. And I got no ingrown hairs whatsoever. It&#x27;s good use. But I&#x27;ve gotten another epilate more expensive it was 106$ it&#x27;s water proof and faster speed so much better! This one is good too though. Try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit in Sept. 2012, recommended by sister, not this unit but an epilator.  When you first start (every time) it is a bit uncomfortable, especially just above the ankles (for me).  I am kind of a harry thing and what I don&#x27;t miss about shaving is the stubble, my hair is smooth now when it is growing in and is a lot sparser.  I think one is better off using this every other week for a bit rather than every 6 weeks .... you spend less time overall doing this.  I also like how my legs feel after using this.  I will dry brush my legs, shower and epilate ... they feel like they have been massaged ... I swear this system is good for cellulite too.  I guess I am reviewing epilation? more than the product but this is the first product of this nature I have ever used.  I have only used this item with the battery a couple of times but the battery no longer seems to hold a charge.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because I never used it much or what but i would think it should have had more life than that??  otherwise I am happy with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;August 2016 ... battery is now dead as a door nail, otherwise it runs fine but .. bit of plastic on side is loose now and it seems to miss a lot of hair now.. you need to go over and over areas but no biggie because it is less pain when less is pulled out at a time.  I have found it is best to use this every other week, the job is less painful.  I think but can&#x27;t recall they say 4-6 weeks but that is too long for these hairy beasts.  I like the fact though that I have so much less hair and when it does grow a bit it is soft and not course.</li>
    <li> It works really well at ripping out hair.  I wasn&#x27;t ready for how painful it is to use but it does a terrific job doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do! It&#x27;s well made, charge lasts forever and it is easy to travel with, just make sure you soak the area you plan to use it on in warm water prior to use to help reduce the discomfort and cool water when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little painful at first on longer hairs. It&#x27;s not as painful as waxing and it lasts all month long. I&#x27;ll definitely be shaving money on razors now. I used to shave my legs every two days but not anymore!</li>
    <li> Bought this off an infomercial 10 years ago. It still works and I&#x27;m amazed. It was half the price back then.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s used several times a month.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned and after several attempts of getting through the initial issues a first-time user goes through, I can say I am not sorry for taking the dive in. Although the Emjoi Soft Caress did the job, it took a GREAT deal of time to clear the area under my arms and legs. I cannot blame it all on the Emjoi because it took a few times to figure out which direction to hold and move the epilator. The directions says to hold it with the logo facing you, but didn&#x27;t say which direction to move it,... up, down, against the grain, with the grain, I just didn&#x27;t know. So once I started moving it in ALL directions, I started to get results, but I believe I still got broken hairs vs. pulled follicles. After a day or two, I still don&#x27;t have the results I expected. I wish I&#x27;d gone with the larger epilator to cover more area because after going over an area several times, it HURTS. I took a pain killer and used the emjoi after a hot shower to open the pores, but I still felt discomfort. Again, I don&#x27;t regret buying it, and maybe after a little more experience, I may feel differently. It does reach the curves under my arms, which adds to the aggrevation, but my biggest headache is the amount of times you have to repeat a stroke to remove the hair. I still like it, but will probably end up getting the two-head epilator also.</li>
    <li> This hair remover works well, and is comfortable to use.  I had one with a double set of &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; which works even better, tha&#x27;s why this one gets four stars.</li>
    <li> If you have never used an epilator before then yes this product will feel slightly painful, but you will get past it after first use. Also, The Emjoi gets the job done. My skin feels subtle and smooth and LOOKS GREAT! I really like this prdouct and would reccommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this product by lots of good review. I have very high expectation for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is very good. It is better that razor but it didn&#x27;t do job very neatly.</li>
    <li> This Enjoi didn&#x27;t last a year.  It died too quickly for the price.  I got a new Enjoi that has duel heads and it is one that needs to be plugged in to work.  I really like this newer model and think the duel head cuts my time in half for catching hairs.  I would not repurchase this model.</li>
    <li> I ❤this epilator! It&#x27;s the best investment I made on amazon for hair removal. I gave it 4 stars due to it being loud when u on the device and the fact u have to go over some spots.</li>
    <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time, but I had no trouble with too much pain (although I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34;), even though I&#x27;ve never waxed before. I just love not having to deal with the prickly-legs phenomenon that shaving causes. I highly recommend this! I take it travelling with me, too.</li>
    <li> the first time with my long legs took awhile, however the maintenance of the device is easy and my legs have been nearly completely smooth since.  sure I miss hairs here and there, did the same thing with a razor, however now there is no razor-burn and I stay smoother for way longer!  it is true that there are some painful spots, but after a few times it&#x27;s not that bad.  And I love that it can be charged up and taken away from an outlet.  definitely the best purchase before summer swim time!</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend recommended trying one.  This one was a good price and had good reviews (wasn&#x27;t hugely expensive but seemed to work).  I figured that i was, of course, buying a torture device.  I got my emjoi and at first was simultaneously impressed by how little it hurt and disappointed by how little hair it removed.  THEN i realized that the directions say to hold it with the text facing towards you!  This is KEY because of the direction the tweezers are closing.  Being left handed, I have just grabbed it naturally and thus it was facing the wrong direction!  Once I flipped it around (no big deal, it&#x27;s still comfy enough to hold), it worked like a (painful) dream.  However, it really wasn&#x27;t as painful as I was expecting based on the reviews I had read, and my legs feel nice and smooth!  It&#x27;s not perfect, but since you don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow out long or anything like you do with waxing, you can easily touch up with a razor or alternate with shaving.  I have a short attention span, so I&#x27;m sure i could get my legs perfectly smooth with it, but I prefer to get a lot of the hair and then shave the rest that I miss.&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a 5th star is simply for the right-handed design.</li>
    <li> This is a first epliator for me. I&#x27;ve owned it for 4 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I have sensitive skin so shaving is a no-no. I found waxing expensive, time consuming &amp; messy. A few months back I saw an ad for an epliator. I had never heard of epilating before, but thought it seemed worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item shipped quick and was charged when I pulled it out of the box. I found the sound a bit frightening at first. I timidly tried the epliator on my legs and it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit. Fears assuaged, I went on to use the device on my bikini line. Hair removal w/ the epliator around my bikini line created a mild stinging sensation, but was far less painful than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users have said, removing long hair is unnecessary and painful. Shave or wax &amp; then use the epliator to remove new growth. Finally, I realized I can see all of the hairs I \\&quot;missed\\&quot; glistening in the sun. This epliator is rechargeable - I&#x27;ve discovered I can take this baby with me to a sunny spot in my yard &amp; grab all of the straggler-left-behind hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/26/12 - update: we&#x27;re still in love. The wedding will be in July.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator. I just read the instructions given in the box and I was able to use it with ease. Good product at reasonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an epilator before this one, and I was skeptical.  It does work better than I thought it would.  It&#x27;s been about a month and I haven&#x27;t gone back to shaving yet.  But my skin isn&#x27;t as smooth/soft as it is after shaving.  I did get used to the pain...at first I couldn&#x27;t do more than just put it against my skin for 2 seconds. By the 3rd time though, I was going over my whole body in 10 minutes without batting an eye.  I do have red bumps and ingrown hairs, but I&#x27;m still trying to perfect my technique. All in all, I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well. I ordered from amazon after seeing some videos on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;I used once, the product looks well made and works great. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something neater than waxing so I got this. It&#x27;s buzzing was intimidating at first. It&#x27;s louder when you use it at a high speed which is recommended for thicker hair and me being Chinese have thick black hair.  I noticed that I have to run it by the same area a few times to get everything, can be annoying.  I usually turn this off and grab my tweezers. I also stop it to blow out and clean the hairs that are left in it after each shin, front and sides.  My hairs are thick but I don&#x27;t have much of it.  I don&#x27;t really have any on my calves, back of legs, nor on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on my arm pits but not successful.  I think because it&#x27;s not a flat, smooth, area.  I have bled and it barely got any hairs. I&#x27;m scared of using it there again.  It also hurt, I think because it tugs the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull it out. I have waxed my armpits before, no big deal, I now pluck them. A lot of time, 20 minutes, and a little pain but not as much as with this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a few months now just between my knees and ankles. The hair is growing back slower and thinner and it does not hurt anymore. ^_^</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of fuzz on your face, these are great for a smoother look without the feel of stubble. It breaks off a lot of hairs at the skin surface, but after you do it over and over, they finally get pulled out. It beats waxing, and is not as irritating to your skin.  It&#x27;s quick, clean, and easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a year ago and used it ever since. It&#x27;s a great investment tool to gradually lessen the unwanted hair growth. Unfortunately my charger has stopped working, can anyone tell me where I can get the charger for this product?</li>
    <li> took me a while to get it to work right, after that it worked fine, just be sure to recharge it after each use</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it according to every word of the instructions. It died in less than three months. The red light indicates charging, but it won&#x27;t even turn on at the lowest setting whether attached to the charger or not. I decided it&#x27;s not even worth utilizing the warranty, because I do not want the same device.</li>
    <li> This epilator is amazing, i had it for 3 years and worked perfectly. It has just stopped working after 3 years which is reasonable. I am going to purchase a the same exact one again :)</li>
    <li> I adore this thing. It holds a charge for a long time. Works best if you have very straight hair. If you have curly hair, don&#x27;t bother; as the hairs grow back in they&#x27;ll burrow into your skin and cause cysts. This is nothing special for this particular device, it&#x27;s just a fact of life for straight versus curly hair.</li>
    <li> The Best Epilator I have own! Love it! I can do my more sensitive areas...</li>
    <li> I like this epilator for my first time buying it. I did good. it works very well and leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth., I admit that it hurts a bit but its worth it. the size is great and the color love it. don&#x27;t be afraid of the noise it makes lol</li>
    <li> Good tool but def. hurts :)</li>
    <li> It stings at first but after 3-4 times, you just get used to it and go with the flow. However, I noticed my hair grown back up for like 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s definitely softer than shaving. I would recommend you buy this, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very excellent in removing hair but a little painful. Removes hair by pulling not trimming that gives a very clean and lasting look to a skin.</li>
    <li> Now that I think about it, I dont know why I went for this expensive product. :( I couldve bought a cheaper one that still gets the job done. When I first used the emjoi hair remover, it wasnt a terrible painful experience at all like I thought it would. The whole process feels as if it&#x27;s pinching your skin. For the first few times, I used it on my legs, armpits and sometimes facial hair. It hurt too much when using on the face so I stopped. I didn&#x27;t like using it on my legs either so I stoppped. Not that it hurt when using it on my legs, it just gave me ingrown hairs. So now the only reason I pull this epilator out is for my armpits.. haha oh well. A lot of people seem to love this product, that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m not a big fan of it having to spend alot of money to just use it on my armpits :/</li>
    <li> Love it, it does not irritate my skin and it leaves it soft and perfect!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: my hair removal method of choice is waxing, which is not without its challenges, so i tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like it was painful at all. Of course yanking hair out will sting, but that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;Its convenient; I had used it, realized after i was in my skirt that i missed a patch, and used this baby. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it pulls hair from the root, though I do believe there is a right and wrong way of doing this, and if you do it wrong, it will simply break the hair instead of removing it.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that this is LOUD -ladies if you want to be discreet, you ...better pack a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Also charge doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: this is a good product when used correctly. Still going to wax at least once a month.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator so I have no comparison points.  A friend of mine recommended using a epilator vs. shaving.  I spent some time on Amazon looking at reviews and decided to go with this one.  It is a bit painful at first, you absolutely have to exfoliate, and it takes way longer than shaving but the results seem to last longer and the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; factor (when hair is first re-emerging after shaving) is no longer an issue.  Will have to wait and see how it does in spring/summer when there is more exposure...</li>
    <li> This is totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well. Just follow the instructions carefully. I find it does not bother me, but my daughter finds it a little uncomfortable-everyone is different. But, overall, it does a very good job of removing the hair. This is my second epilator; the first broke after 3 years. (The one I had before was a smaller, less expensive model; this one seems to work better.)</li>
    <li> I&#x60;s ok, not for your face!!!</li>
    <li> I looked at this package and show how painful this looked with its many tweezers.  It looked very painful.  Unfortunately I waited longer than the designated time to sent it back.  Despite the fact that the package was never opened, I got far less than it cost me and with no shipping reimbursement.  I was very disappointed with Amazon and the provider.</li>
    <li> It works greats when it is connected to a power source. When it&#x27;s running on the battery, the tweezers run a little bit slow and so they are not as efficient as removing hair as when it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product. I use it mainly for my armpits and my upper lip. The attachments that come with it are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it four stars because of how it works when it is not plugged in. I would give it five stars if the battery power was a lot stronger and would run the tweezers faster when it isn&#x27;t connected.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I am menapausal and get chin hairs which are mortifying.  They are thick and tough  This yanks them out and they are gone for a couple of weeks.  It pinches, of course, but the results are very satisfying.  No swelling like with wax and no stubble like shaving.</li>
    <li> Of course this thing sounds crazy, but it gets the job done. It comes will a rechargeable battery so you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I loved it ever since I received it!</li>
    <li> did not work, sent back.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. It&#x27;s a solid and well-constructed product. I&#x27;m not sure though how it functions :-)</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment and product works as everyone reports, easy to use, less hair growth, and very portable. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Sounded good, but it does not charge. Tried on different outlets to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the charger, but after many attempts, I couldn&#x27;t get it to charge. Can&#x27;t use. Needed to return Emjoi</li>
    <li> The emjoi does what it says, but I find it to be more time consuming than shaving.  Epilating lasts longer than shaving, but you have to keep up with it a lot in the beginning to keep it smooth.</li>
    <li> love it works great and not very painful</li>
    <li> Removes hair completely, but I am confused on to actually clean it besides brushing off the hair. What are others ways to clean it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! but be aware that it will hurt the first couple of times. The best part is that each time the hair grows, it grows thinner &amp; thinner. I would recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I guess for someone like me, who is used to waxing, it is much quicker and less painful.</li>
    <li> Product does what it says rips the hair from the folical. I used my Enjoi one morning as usual only to discover the area I used it one was filled with unsightly ingrown hairs. Moisturize religiously inbetween uses, and you should be okay.</li>
    <li> Although I follow the instructions and watch some videos in You tube, every time I use it my skin gets irritated and I get ingrowing hair. I got ingrowing hair even in my face, which I never had that before. I suggest you to do more research if you are considering this depilation alternative.</li>
    <li> The Epilator doesnt grab much hair. So it really can only be used on the face or maybe the neck. I tried it on my arm pits but its painful and takes forever. It took me 1 and half hours to finish one arm because i had to constantly stop to clean out the epilator. But if you have all day to stand while looking at yourself in the mirror, by all means go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a quicker method, Just wax it off your hair with strips found at CVS, exfoliate, and use St.Ives scrubs. Every now and then clean your hairless areas with bacteria killing soap or handsanitizer. You&#x27;ll be clean, smooth, and resist having ingrown hairs where ever you do this.If you have scaring, Ambi Fade Cream helps fade them. ;)</li>
    <li> I just got this and it does work. I am waiting to let my hair grow out a bit more to get the smooth effect since I had just shaved a day prior to recieving it. It hurts at first but you do get used to it.</li>
    <li> Picks up most hair and it doesnt grow back as fast and as thick shaving would. I love that it is portable and it isnt a mess like waxing is. The only cons i have is it misses a few hairs and you have to go back several times and the battery tends to run out fast</li>
    <li> As a guy, I&#x27;ve never experienced pain such as a tiny device ripping out hair.  This little torture device works well.  Misses a hair occasionally but all in all works well</li>
    <li> I have a larger one that you can not charge and it works better. I bought this to travel with, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as well on a charge. So I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this one, just get the normal one that doesn&#x27;t charge, plugs in, it works better.</li>
    <li> For a person who really hate shaving and would pick waxing over shaving any day-this is a really good product.  The first time was the worst! It was so painful that it took me a few days to completely epilate all my underarm hairs.  I did bleed a bit and sometimes still do, but I noticed it is more painful when it&#x27;s around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; and/or when the hairs are a bit long.  I would recommend others to first trim your hairs unless they are already small as it will cause &amp;#34;less pain.&amp;#34;  Also, make sure to use powder to keep the area dry while epilating-it helps the epilating process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you can deal with the pain, get an epilator-it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts ladies. It&#x27;s kinda like getting a tattoo. Not awful after you get used to it. It even came charged! Which was awesome  since I had let my hair grow out a few days. My legs are pretty smooth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: pull your skin taut - take some pain relievers and take a hot shower before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and looking at EVERY SINGLE epilator on amazon you should really consider this one. I LOVE IT. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> works as it should, it rips hair! Legs sucked the most for me! After a while though it wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge so I have to plug into the wall now to use.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  People who have more sensitive skin or low tollerance for pain would probably have difficulty using it.  I have a high pain tollerance so for me its as others have described- slight stinging sensations.  But not bad.  It does a great job overall, but so far i havent gotten my legs or underarms to feel completely smooth or stubble free feeling.  But maybe that improves with time.  I agree with someone else who said you do have to move it in different directions to pull more hairs.  And the instructions mentioned using it after showering and drying off.  BAD idea for me!  My skin was so pliable, especially in the underarms, that it pulled and pinched my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m figuring out how best to use it for my skin.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it, she uses it often. She says the pain is moderate, but expected. I wouldn&#x27;t care to use it myself, it looks like spinning hair death.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before and bought this for my very first one. I bought this last year and all I can say is that it&#x27;s a great product if u are still trying to learn how to epilate. (btw this is better than shaving). The first time I used it was on my underarms. I had a bad thick hairs on my pits. sometimes there was two in one hole , it was bad. so i used this on my underarms for the first time without using any painkillers except for a cold towel (didnt really help)... IT HURT SO BAD FOR THE FIRST TIME .. however it was hard for me to get used to my skin cuz it would always pinch my pits and made it bleed &amp; left bumps that was also painful .. u really have to stretch out ur skin and brush through ur pits so its easier for the tweezers to pluck them. also tried it on my legs and it hurt like s*** .. lesson learned for me never use it anywhere but my underarms....overall this is an awesome epilator and u just hav to learn correctly how it works with ur skin ..also it was shipped really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Take a warm shower&lt;br /&gt;-Use ice cubes before epilating (makes ur skin numb so its less painful)&lt;br /&gt;-Cut two circular shape cucumbers/ potatoes &amp; rub it for 2 mins in ur underarms after epilating&lt;br /&gt;-Use baking soda as ur deodorant (optional)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> New, at first using it did hurt but as time went by, the pain was bearable.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. WHY have I never heard of an epilator? A few months ago my friend and I were staying at a resort and I was stuck forever in the shower shaving and making all this mess as always. I finally asked my friend why she never took that long shaving in the shower. She told me she doesn&#x27;t shave and I was shocked! What?!! She said she \\&quot;epilates\\&quot; which lead me to questioning her more. Anyways, I got on Google and for months I researched online on epilating/epilators. I made my way to Youtube and found ultra helpful reviews specifically on Emjoi Soft caress rechargeable epilator. I saw how an armpit was transformed from dark and hairy to smooth and skin-colored lightness in a blink of an eye. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with just one or two videos and continued my research for months--I mean this literally. That was I think back in September of last year since I started researching on epilators. The first thing that scared me was how some people described the process-that it would \\&quot;sting.\\&quot; Fast forward, I waited for longer to get the best deal and my patience was rewarded when Emjoi went on sale from $59.99 to $42 through Shavenow.com. I should&#x27;ve gotten it when it went on sale for $37 over Black Friday weekend and again through Shavenow.com via my Amazon prime account. I did everything that the Youtube reviewers and the manual instructed: took a hot shower, scrubbed with a towel exfoliator and made sure my skin was dry and clean. So, the first few moments in contact with my skin did sting, but it&#x27;s very tolerable. Now that I&#x27;ve epilated 4x or I have not problem with that. It really is equivalent to plucking--I mean, it IS plucking with 46-something tweezers. You roll it on that area of interest and my armpit was clear of hair in 2 minutes! It&#x27;s fast and simple and clean! NO MORE RAZOR BURNS, NO MORE SHAVING MESS! A friend of mine was so excited about it that she purchased her own. She had always gone to get waxing on her armpits and would have to wait for a month beforeshe could go again so the hairs are long enough. She was worried that epilating would be difficult since her hairs were REALLY LONG after not having gone in to get waxing for a couple months! Anyways, I helped her. It does make it easier if you pull your skin taut. Within maybe 5 rolls in different directions her jungle armpit that head about half an inch of hairs long was transformed into smooth, undiscolored pits! My friend did not feel any sort of stinging whatsoever. It really depends on how sensitive your skin is, but after your first time you won&#x27;t feel it any longer. I&#x27;ve epilated my little whiskers above my lip. You&#x27;re not supposed to epilate your whole face according to the manual. I epilated my arms, legs, abdominal area. This epilator works GREAT especially for the course armpit hair. Every time I&#x27;ve epilated these hairs would come off and I can see the roots of them! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about epilating until a few months ago! Now I&#x27;m telling the whole world about it!</li>
    <li> This epilator was the BEST thing i have ever bought! no more shaving, and hair grows back thinner and takes a LONG time to grow back. i love everything about it, although it hurts at first because you dont know what kind of pain to expect but get less and less everytime.</li>
    <li> This was a moderate disappointment for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. Pain, it is pretty painful actually, I would rate the pain as moderate, regardless of the setting the hairs are ripped out of the skin and that hurts.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not very effective. It only grabs hairs that are sticking up in the air. Lots of hairs are lying down on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t pick them up. Beware about pressing it into the skin, it will pinch the skin and make a little rip or cut in it. So all this work and pain and you still have about 10% of the hair on the skin lying down. Also, it won&#x27;t pick up the hairs that are short, don&#x27;t believe what they say, the hair has to be at least 5-6mm and sticking straight up for the machine to grab it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Irritation. Don&#x27;t know why but there are big red ugly bumps at every spot where each hair was pulled out. My skin is on \\&quot;fire\\&quot; right now, I know it will calm down in a day or two but never got anything from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4. Forget doing the private/bikini area, you are going to kill yourself and your skin down there, the hair is way too thick for that.&lt;br /&gt;5. Forget doing the face, it&#x27;s too dangerous putting this aggressive machine near the face, if it grabs the skin you are in trouble and the face has so many curves.&lt;br /&gt;6. Unless you are doing the front of the legs where both of your hands are free and you can see everything right in front of you it is very difficult to work on the back of the legs or other areas.&lt;br /&gt;7. I gave it a good try, will be returning to the store.</li>
    <li> removes hair pretty good. the first few times are painful but you get use to it. I would recommend this product. its much better than shaving. also it takes longer for the hair to grow back.</li>
    <li> This works as described, so I can&#x27;t complain about that. HOWEVER, it hurts like crazy. I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s just too painful.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t pick up ingrown hair .</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says!  Make sure to exfoliate prior to using, otherwise you will end up with ingrown hairs!  The pain does get better with every use.  Make sure to go SLOW, otherwise you have to do the same spot over and over.  It was worth the money!</li>
    <li> The noise kinda scared me at first but acctually doesn&#x27;t really hurts. This was my first epilator so I don&#x27;t really know how better the others are. But I&#x27;m not interested in buying another, this one really works it. I wasn&#x27;t very expensive and does its job. My hair are less thicker and brighter. I have to say I&#x27;m not brave enough to do it on my underlips and it hurts on the upper legs and arms. And you need patience t do it over and over because misses some spots.&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to wax there won&#x27;t be much problem, because it&#x27;s impossible to do not hurt a bit, but with time and patience you will do great.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts less if some time before you waxed not shaved because shaving makes the fur thicker so it might hurt more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilator for years and have always preferred it to shaving and waxing, especially since I have extremely fine, blonde hair. Often times, cheaper epilators end up snapping my hair off at skin level because my hair is so fine. As soon as I started this one up, I was shocked by how fast it was! I&#x27;ve never used one this fast! Because of the quick rotations, it was able to get all hairs that could be plucked, without just snapping them off. I even did my underarms with this. In the past, that has resulted in my eyes watering and little bloody spots left behind and often pinching. Not with this baby! It was so thorough and fast! It was actually a joy to use and I LOVE the cordless feature! I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because of the good reviews I read but they delivered a deffective item so I don&#x27;t have a chance to try it.It was noted the box was opened to ensure it was working, apparently it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d rather get the unopened item than tampered item. If they send me a free one, I would like to try it though. I paid for the return shipping and I&#x27;m glad amazon credited it back to my account. I ordered with Karenza so make sure you order it with a reliable company.</li>
    <li> I love how it works! now i dont have to worry about my daily routine plucking anymore. But i lost my charger. i hope they sell the charger itself alone.</li>
    <li> Having never used an epilator before, or heard of one for that matter, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I have never waxed, but did have a couple of laser hair removal treatments on my arms.  I was terrified of my first go and started with my arms.  I followed the instructions and ran the tool in the direction of hair growth.  The hair was long but relatively sparse due to the laser treatments.  It came off quickly and (relatively) painlessly.  Great!  Now, onto my legs....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure.. I have a lot of hair.  And it&#x27;s course thick Italian hair.  And it grows quick, I could shave my legs in the morning and feel stubble at night.  Ok, so, I had shaved a couple of days before and I start the Emjoi on my legs.  It hurt much more!  But, nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle and certainly less than the laser hair treatments did.  The problem was, it took forever!  I had to go over and over the same area on my leg dozens of times.  I even tried ignoring the instructions and going against hair growth, sideways across the growth, then I just hovered and did little circles.  Even though I could handle the pain, after about an hour of it - it was starting to get to me.  All in all, it took me over 2 hours to do my legs and they still weren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, and the battery was dying, so I quit.  Well, \\&quot;Ok,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;That&#x27;s probably because you have a lot of hair that wasn&#x27;t long enough for the epilator to grab, we&#x27;ll try again in a few days.\\&quot;  The good news is that it didn&#x27;t take as long and hurt less, the bad news is that they weren&#x27;t much smoother.  I kept waiting for the hair to grow and trying again and again, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting the results like I did with shaving.  I finally cracked and shaved my legs a month and a half ago.  Here&#x27;s the crazy thing, now, when I use the epilator, they are significantly smoother.  I have no real explanation other than that maybe it was dry skin I was feeling, not hair stubble, and the razor took care of it?  So, I guess I can&#x27;t blame the Emjoi for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks, I got enough guts to try it on my under arms.  Mother of God - the pain.  After a constant stream of explicits, I did have great success removing the hair!  As with shaving, I found the hair grew in multiple directions so I had to change the direction I was running the tool to get all the hair.  The good news is that the Emjoi did a great job removing the hair to the roots and I no longer had that underarm shadow.  More good news, is that after a couple of touch-up treatments, I&#x27;ve found I only need to do it once a week or less.  Yet even MORE good news, is that the pain is all by gone after using it for a couple of months.  I had been thinking of getting laser treatments on my underarms.  But now, I plan on saving a couple of hundred dollars and will just use this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and here&#x27;s the breakdown for me with this hair removal tool:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forearms (with laser treatment):&lt;br /&gt;Pain level - minimal&lt;br /&gt;Removal Time - 15 min&lt;br /&gt;Growback period - For any hair, a couple of weeks.  However, its been 3 months and not enough has grown back to bother me so much I need to do it again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;Pain level - Medium/Medium-high&lt;br /&gt;Removal Time - First time: 2 hours, Subsequent times: 15-30 min&lt;br /&gt;Growback period - 5-7 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br /&gt;Pain level - First time: Mother of God, Subsequent Times: Minimal&lt;br /&gt;Removal Time - &amp;lt; 5 min&lt;br /&gt;Growback period - Just over a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  This was my first epilator so I can&#x27;t say if it works better or worse than others.  Nor can I say if it hurts more or less.  It got the job done and I think I&#x27;m going to be an epilator user for life now.  However, I do find it takes a long time to do my legs.  So, someday, I might look for a faster model, maybe one with more tweezers?  The flip side is that I feel that more tweezers might hurt more...  All in all, I&#x27;m glad I purchased this andI think it is a great first time epilator for people.</li>
    <li> regret buying this product.  it doesn&#x27;t pick up as many hairs as I thought and it is actually uncomfortable, even on the underarm.  will not use this regularly. I did have times were I noticed small streaks of blood if the hair was too long.  should be used on short hair.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, put the item on my wish list, received for my birthday and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I love AMAZON.  It initially does hurt but the results are fabulous.  Whish I bought it years ago</li>
    <li> I got this with a good time period. It removes most of the hairs from the roots. The skin is not as irritated as how it usually gets after waxing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Emjoi Caress in October.  Amazon tells me I have had it since then.  I know I have only used it once a week for under two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It failed yesterday.  Nothing works.  It will not operate when plugged in; it will not hold a charge; I changed and moved it over to another outlet, but no operation at all.  it completely and entirely failed to perform as advertised and is going into the trash today December 17, 2012, after I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to go back to shaivng with razor,............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please beware, this is not a good item to last such a short time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggieohana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Very odd, but you try and enter product code, you get disconnnected by amazon.com? what is that all about?</li>
    <li> I read a bunch of reviews before picking this one. I expected it to hurt a lot, especially since I&#x27;ve never waxed before, but it didn&#x27;t hurt that much. I got used to it after the first use. Works very well!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my girlfriend. it works as advertised. she said it was painful at first but becomes bearable after a little bit of using it. it does not really remove all her leg hairs but i don&#x27;t think that is the epilator&#x27;s fault coz she has very fine, short hair in some places on her leg. she loves how it works though on her underarm. it removes all of them and only after 2 uses, i notice a slight lightening in her armpit skin color. not to mention it made her armpit a lot smoother to the feel :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine, blonde hair on my legs along with sensitive skin.  Razors go dull and Nair or Veet burns my skin.  This epilator is great, but it does take several passes to get all the tiny hairs.  I wish I had purchased a model with a light, but I am happy enough with this one.</li>
    <li> makes your hair situation WORSE.  If you want bumps scars and ingrown hairs then this is perfect.  This product removes hair very well but i used this on my stomach and i regretted it.  I have scaring, in grown, and bumps to where i needed to see a dermatologist to help</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product is not good. I am white with dark normal/thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator does not pick short hairs and often break the ones it picks. The hair needs to be quite big to be able to epilate, at least 3 weeks in my case! This is insane. I would like to epilate once a week but I&#x27;d have to shave if I wanted to be hair free which I don&#x27;t like because I hate cactus legs.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the people who say this product doesn&#x27;t work or hurts too much, I was terrified when I ordered this because of some of the reviews. It is not nearly as painful as one would think, I have gone from shaving every day to shaving once a week with this product. I use it 2 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, the occasional shave is needed, but it definately cuts down on the time in between shaves. And it is AWESOME for facial hair!!</li>
    <li> my main problem with this epilator is that the battery life only lasts about 20 mins the first time and subsequently less than 5 minutes. Also, it will not work when plugged in so i have to plug it in to charge and then try again...</li>
