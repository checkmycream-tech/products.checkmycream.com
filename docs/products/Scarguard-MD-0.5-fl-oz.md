      <li>amazing.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>Between those and my own experience I can recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and  my scar rose up again.</li>
      <li>but, the scars soon rose again albeit a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because of the location of the scar between my thumb and pointer finger, the Scarguard tended to peel off around the edges of the scar which was kind of a nuisance.  </li>
      <li>This goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>We will not know whether that is effective for many weeks to come.</li>
      <li>then it will just crack and peel off very easy on top of this..</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll use it twice a day for sure</li>
      <li>ordering three more of these</li>
      <li>should be better, I see no results after 6 weeks</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m glad I found it $10 cheaper on Amazon than at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>It is flattening and looking a ton better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it at all if I had been more diligent about using this.</li>
      <li>I have recommended this product to so many people, and when they look at where my surgery scar &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; been, they but it.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working! :)</li>
      <li>E worked better.</li>
      <li>i love this product.  </li>
      <li>Going to keep using and see how much more they will fade.</li>
      <li>If I used it in the morning and the evening like it said, I would probably see even better results, but the flaking...</li>
      <li>Just saying... but still love the product.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll let you know how that works out too :)</li>
      <li>Ok  </li>
      <li>The scar is better but not gone.  </li>
      <li>After more than a month of usage.</li>
      <li>This is a simple and best treatment.</li>
      <li>But honestly, I can&#x27;t say its the best out there, but it surely has done very well so far.  </li>
      <li>It flakes/peels off easily on any active/stretchy areas, including fingers, most of your hand, elbows, knees, and most of your face.</li>
      <li>This product really worked for me and I am just thrilled with the results!  </li>
      <li>I saw some pretty good improvement in color and flattening of the scar in the 6 weeks</li>
      <li>Worked pretty good.</li>
      <li>But works great make sure to apply as direct and I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle (daughter had a huge dog bite scar on face) but its working great!</li>
      <li>A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Make sure your skin is clean and not oily before applying otherwise it will not stay.</li>
      <li>Since my scar was on my thigh that was quite easy.</li>
      <li>Now I have the clean and healthy skin I always dream of.</li>
      <li>The smell out of the bottle is quite strong, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another person had a problem with the cap, but the cap I used was fine.</li>
      <li>Product Worked fine.</li>
      <li>Scarguard seems to work fine although it does have an odor until it dries.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
      <li>Either way it really does work, i am so glad i found this product!</li>
      <li>I had substantial raised scars around my ears and after a month they were significantly reduced, and it was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I notice a huge difference after applying at night and peeling it off in the morning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this as the best scar healer.  It does seem very good.  My only concern is that the top didn&#x27;t seal well and it spilled out when I traveled so I had to buy a second one.</li>
    <li> A good product at a reasonable price. Great service by this vendor</li>
    <li> Works but mine was mysteriously yellow unlike clear stuff I normally get in stores</li>
    <li> I am really impressed by this product.  In the short time that I have used it, I see a marked difference in the scars I have.  They are less red and less raise.  Thanks,</li>
    <li> This product is amazing if you have new scars! The combo of Vitamin + Silicone is great for treatment. Plus, it stays on all day long, even in the shower!</li>
    <li> The best product you can use for scars. This is a simple and best treatment. I feel confident that Scarguard is doing the best at keeping my scar covered, moist, and aided in healing by the silicon. Apply daily, be patient and know you are doing the best you absolutely can. Best of luck, and remember you are awesome scars and all.</li>
    <li> I had skin cancer surgery on my nose and used this for several months. I think it helped the scaring not to be as noticeable.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  very easy to use.  breaking down a fairly large keloid quickly.  one piece of advice - use painters tape around the cap and bottle to keep all air out.  this will keep it from drying out and from smelling up wherever you store it.</li>
    <li> It may work but I found it to annoying to use. The liquid dries hard like compound W. Bit. E worked better.</li>
    <li> Last summer I was out running and took a bad fall that gave me deep cuts on my knee and forehead. I probably should have gone to the emergency room for stitches, but I didn&#x27;t and ended up with some nasty looking scars.    So I bought a bottle of ScarGuard because the scar on my forehead was quite unattractive. I didn&#x27;t bother treating the scar on my knee because I really don&#x27;t care how my knee looks. After faithfully using ScarGuard twice a day for about 3 months now, the scar on my forehead is barely visable, but the untreated scar on my knee is still the way it was originally.    I&#x27;m not sure if the product will work for everyone, but it clearly worked for me.    My only complaint and the only reason for 4 starts is that it leaves a silicone film on the scar that looks a little strange.    I see that other people have complained about the smell, but I didn&#x27;t find it that bad, and it smells only briefly while applying it.    Another person had a problem with the cap, but the cap I used was fine. The company may have corrected the problem.</li>
    <li> Just had silicone implants periaolar. And tried this for 2 weeks. Never saw a difference. Hoping it clears or blends in on its own!</li>
    <li> This product has such a strong, unpleasant smell that I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it even works.</li>
    <li> So my cat scratched my face by accident in his sleep 2 weeks ago. Great way to wake up with 2 bleeding slashes to my cheek and cheekbone. The minute it started to heal, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t healing flat and the texture was raised, red and \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot;. Panicking since it was on my face, I bought Scarzone first before this product. To be fair, I didn&#x27;t give Scarzone enough time to say it doesn&#x27;t work, but after a week of no improvement, I decided to skip the cheap and go with this product since I&#x27;ve been reading the efficacy of Silicone gel. I gave it a week and although the scar is still there, it&#x27;s noticeably flatter! It&#x27;s less red and scary-looking, and the scar tissue seems to be receding back to normality. Hopefully with continue usage, it will keep flattening it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is, I can only use it at night (and not twice a day as directed) because it&#x27;s definitely NOT invisible and you CANNOT wear makeup over this product. Maybe for other less conspicuous parts of your body, but definitely not your face. It stands out worse than the scar itself. So instead, I&#x27;ve been massaging a gentle moisturizer to it during the day and using Scarguard at night. Seems to be working! :)</li>
    <li> Scarguard helped turn my red scar into a light pink almost flesh color! Worked pretty good.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, it does excatly what it says! The only problem is, you have to constantly order it because the bottle is so small and only lasts for a little while.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FOR HYPERTROPHIC OR KELOID SCARS, WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. STUFF SMELLS LIKE FINGERNAIL POLISH, IT&#x27;S MESSY, AND IT NEVER REMOVED MY SCAR. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS STILL NO LUCK!</li>
    <li> i did not see a visible difference - I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Its wonderful gets rid of scars, lines and any imperfections on your face or anywhere on your body.  I am on my 2nd bottle of it. Thank you for carrying this.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me and I am just thrilled with the results!  I had a raised scar on the back of my hand that kept peeling and seeming to get bigger all the time.  Nothing worked, and I tried everything including expensive prescription ointments. It was driving me crazy for years actually, until I found Scarguard MD about a year or two ago.  It was expensive, $30 at Target, but I thought why not, if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll just return it.  Well, it worked very quickly, in a matter of a few weeks really, until the whole scabby scar thing just peeled off.  At first I thought the skin underneath had torn open again; but it wasn&#x27;t torn, it was just really red, so I kept applying the liquid for a few more weeks and it healed perfectly to 100%.  There is just a flat, barely discernible discoloration and it feels soft and smooth like the rest of my skin.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I&#x27;m off to buy the Scarguard Scarlight MD to deal with a darkish splotch on my left cheek.  I&#x27;ll let you know how that works out too :)</li>
    <li> Hove to use it for months. I&#x27;m still waiting on results to show if it truly works.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m unsure how my scarring would look in the event I did not use Scarguard, I can tell you my scars are noticeably fading in the 4 weeks I have been using this product. I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned about how to speed up the course of the healing.</li>
    <li> I had horrible cystic acne starting at around 19. It consisted of infected pimples that were the size of quarters. They would last for 2-3 months and terrorize me. It was so bad that I did not want to go to class, did not even try dating, and it lasted for about two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was bad enough... but there were two that had to require surgery to be drained. Needless to say I had really bad, elevated scarring on my right and left cheekbones below each eye. Over time they became less noticeable, but to me it was a reminder of the horror of having to deal with bad acne. You never know what it is like until you deal with it first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarguard erased both scars in a matter of five weeks. It is a miracle serum. Now I don&#x27;t have to be reminded of that horrific acne every day. Now let me clarify to you... it does not work over night. And it takes diligent responsibility per the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use it morning and evening. The applicator they provide is the only thing that is weak about the product. I recommend you use a Q-Tip swab and vigorously massage your elevated tissue with it. It is ok if it becomes red and you see flaky stuff. That means it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a total of three containers and the &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; term of the scarring which I had is &amp;#34;hypertrophic scars&amp;#34; are erased. I would recommend this product to anyone who has patience. It cost me close to a hundred dollars but I don&#x27;t care. Now I have the clean and healthy skin I always dream of. I paired it up with a little bit of mederma which helped too.</li>
    <li> i have a raised redish scar on my face from a mole being removed.  i got it about a year ago, Mederma did not work for me.  i am very impressed. it went down about half its size in the first week, the process there after has taken a little longer. i still have a little bit to go but i can barely notice it myself, let alone people that see me would never guess there is a scar there.   The reason i don&#x27;t like it is because i have had to exchange 3 bottles because both lids on the first two were defective and started loosen after a few days.  The third bottles lid is also defective, but i am much wiser now.  If you do buy this product, (and i recommend you do) get a cheap row of masking tape, (there is some at the dollar store,, for a dollar.) and tape over the crack where the lid and bottle meet.  From day one- even if the lid screws on all the way. This product does not like air, and i am sure the lid will eventually loosen the same as the past three bottles of mine. IF you tape the lid shut after everytime you use it it will stay just as new.  Either way it really does work, i am so glad i found this product!</li>
    <li> With this product you receive a little bottle that looks like clear nail polish.  And guess what?  It also smells like nail polish, is applied like nail polish, and dries like nail polish.  But it&#x27;s not as thick as nail polish so it flakes and peels off almost as soon as it dries.  I can&#x27;t say if it really works or not because I couldn&#x27;t find a way to keep it on my scar.  I would recommend trying silicone sheets, cost is about the same and I saw a vast improvement with them.</li>
    <li> Definitely has a strong smell, this product was recommended to me by my doctor.</li>
    <li> .. I bought this cause i ran out of Scar Away gel and they didnt have any at rite aid , So i said well let me see if i can get by on this , it looks good .. Ok  , here is what happened , i first open it up and a strong nail polish smell comes and hits me!! uhhh.. so then i put it on my scars or incisions and i feel a burning sensation.. ouch!! then it gets really white film which if you use makeup just forget it!! ok so then i wake up with my incision hurting for the first time in 3 weeks, more like inflammed .. then it will just crack and peel off very easy on top of this.. well that was a good thing cause i never want to see this product again.. in fact i know it will not be in stores too much longer!!!!! SO i recommend Scar away gel in the daytime and scaraway silocone sheets at night to get the best solution.. Scar away gel works beautiful and is clean .. and can be worn under makeup.. Ok please dont waste you money on this stuff.. it Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I put this on and within five minuets it was flaking off. I will never buy this product again! Trying to get my money back !!!</li>
    <li> not impressed so far,this seems like a shellac on your face..not normal</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it helped.  The scar is better but not gone.  I used other products during the same period.  Disappointed I can still see it a bit.</li>
    <li> The product dries quickly on your skin, like glue. It then peels off so how is it supposed to work???</li>
    <li> Real brand, what i usually use, effective and great! I would recommend this user for any external or product! Very pleased</li>
    <li> This product is satisfactory but container that it comes in is very disappointing because the cap quickly gets stripped and therefore is compromised.</li>
    <li> I got a breast lift/augmentation 2.5 months ago and have been using this product for a little over a month.  It seems to be helping with fading my incision scars, and I have a friend who swore by it after her surgery.  I will keep using it for now!</li>
    <li> I had to switch to the silicone strips. THis was constantly flaking off. I would do my arm therapy then massage with vitamin e oil then wash to add this stuff. I found it too much work for a new scar. It&#x27;s also terribly expensive and does not provide sun protection. The silicone strips I bought afterwards do the trick. This might work for an area that does not need massaging to alleviate scar tissue and does not see the sun.</li>
    <li> I have a scar on my neck from thyroid surgery done last summer and bought ScarGuard MD to help fade and flatten it. The product is difficult to use in that after application, it starts to flake and peel away. The instructions are to apply twice a day after washing the area. The problem is that washing does not remove all of the previous coat of ScarGuard so I had to rub to peel off the remaining flakes. I did not think this process was good for the scar and wanted advice from the company. The only phone number on their website is for ordering their product.  If you want to ask a question, they have a contact page where you can email them. They say they will respond to questions within 2 business days, so I emailed them with my question&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did not hear from them after a week, I called the phone number for &amp;#34;orders only&amp;#34; and told the representative my problem. He was very polite and took down my question, my email address and phone number. He said he would relay this information to the technical people upstairs and they would be getting in touch with me in 2 business days. It has been over 3 weeks now and I have heard nothing from them. I have discontinued using the product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works.  It helps reduce scar.  Don&#x27;t expect it to remove scar completely, after using it for about two weeks I notice slight reduction in the visibility of scar.  As I said it doesn&#x27;t remove scars it only makes it less visible.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  This product is wonderful at shrinking my keloid!</li>
    <li> Product Worked fine. Great service as always.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I had a breast reduction  about 6 months ago and I was left with ugly scars, my surgeon told me to get this stuff and after using for a month I can see my scars fading</li>
    <li> Had great results with this product on a previous incision scar and am currently using it on an incision after bunion surgery.  I can&#x27;t even see the other incision now.  I do massage my incision daily and use this stuff diligently as indicated on the instructions.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and works great. Has a horrible smell but it work. My scars really lightened up. Waiting to purchase again from vendor but they are out of stock.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for me! As a result of an accident a little over a year ago I ended up with a very big scar that never went away and after some time it became very raised and noticeable. A friend of mine recommended I use Scarguard as she used it after a tummy tuck surgery she had and it helped her incision scar tremendously. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, i will keep using it religiously. I highly recommend everyone to try!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  I got my first bottle from my plastic surgeon after my surgery, and it&#x27;s really making a difference in the looks of my scars.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I had substantial raised scars around my ears and after a month they were significantly reduced, and it was easy to use.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working, but it&#x27;s in the first stages.&lt;br /&gt;I think I would recommend to my friends, wish I knew about this when I had open heart surgery.</li>
    <li> Wife used these on her scars after her enhancement as suggested on a few web sites.  You can barely notice the scars.</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal. This product really works. No gimmicks. My doctor recommended it and U tried it. It usually sells for $30/ bottle. So, I hope you continue to stock it.</li>
    <li> I know it smells intense but I didn&#x27;t mind that if it was going to work.  The problem is how can this product even work if it keeps peeling off from the scars?  They&#x27;re sticking out on my skin.... I even tried using another coat right after the 1st application was dried but the same result occurred which makes this useless for me.</li>
    <li> Helps to smooth and quicken the healing process of scars.  I notice a huge difference after applying at night and peeling it off in the morning. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered (literally)! Helped my scars tremendously. It will flake, but re-apply often.</li>
    <li> Good but had a bit of reaction not sure if it is suitable for me</li>
    <li> Product pealed off as soon as it dried. Don&#x27;t wast your money, try something different.</li>
    <li> Works miricles but I think its too much money for something so small didn&#x27;t even last me 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I had a breast augmentation and lift. There was alot of scar tissue. Wound up getting Kenalog injections was advised could use this or the silicone sheeting tape. I got both. I prefer the tape. This goes on nicely. Even coating. Very thin and dried quickly. At the end of the day peels of like sunburn skin. Scars are gradually getting lighter.it&#x27;s a matter of preference the tape or the liquid. End results are about the same to fade the color had no effect on texture . I alternate between the 2 for fading.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!!  After 4 weeks of a tummy tuck I started using and at 7 weeks can already see a difference!!!</li>
    <li> I got my breast augmentation about 4 months ago and the scars under the &amp;#34;fold&amp;#34; of the breasts are really bad, but after using this twice a day for only 5 days the scars have really diminished. Going to keep using and see how much more they will fade.</li>
    <li> Recently I have started to develop hypertropic and keloid scars due to my severe cystic acne, especially on my jaw line but also on my back and chest. Being a teenage girl this was a little disconcerting. I was sent to a dermatologist who has given me lowest possible dose of steroids twice now over the span of 5 months. These worked for a couple days but, the scars soon rose again albeit a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either I or this product is odd. The scars on my whole body fluctuate between flat and raised; usually changing on a daily basis. If the product is the cause of the reduction of inflammation I am not sure, but I find it very odd. The product is unpleasant smelling but it stays pretty well even on my jaw which moves quite a lot. The application brush is sort of useful but it&#x27;s easier to just use your finger. When I first applied it my scars seemed to swell. Oddly enough it was actually acne on top the scar. As to whether the Scarguard caused these pimples I&#x27;m not sure but since then the scar has been raising and subsiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will continue to use the gel until this bottle runs out (about half left) due to its seemingly promising results.</li>
    <li> Scarguard does seem to work. I&#x27;ve had it for just over a month now and I can see a decrease in the scar right above my eye. The only problem I have is that over the course of a few hours the Scarguard has a tendency to dry up and look like flaky skin, so I only use it once I&#x27;m home for the day. If I used it in the morning and the evening like it said, I would probably see even better results, but the flaking...</li>
    <li> Although I have not had ample time to see the results of using Scarguard yet, I would have to give it a rather low mark because it does not adhere to the scar area. My husband had extensive surgery which resulted in a scar running down the length of his torso (about 12 inches) and across half his stomach (about 8 inches) We have been applying it twice daily, but it does not stay on during the day, perhaps because of his shirts rubbing against it  all the time, and it does not stay on at night, perhaps because of moving around in his sleep. In any event, it might do well on places where the skin does not have any friction on it, but it is not doing a good job for him. He is now using a good quality vitamin E and massaging it into the area twice daily. This is supposed to soften up the scar tissue, which is his major concern.  We will not know whether that is effective for many weeks to come.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference.  A doctor told me it would only make a difference on fresh scars, not older ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this product. I didn&#x27;t see changes for one month used. It&#x27;s a little bit pricey for me to continue to use it and not sure if it is really going to work on me.</li>
    <li> this stuff  works!  it&#x27;s no miracle over night stuff,  but I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my scar is significantly smaller!  I&#x27;m goin to continue to use it and hopefully it&#x27;ll be even smaller and maybe won&#x27;t be  able to see it!</li>
    <li> Item is great! I can tell a difference after using it just a couple times. Would recommend to others. Got it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> My scar from my surgery, (Gallbladder) was thick and raised and after a few months I noticed that it was becoming softer and less noticeable. Scarguard was very easy to use, I just painted it on (like nail polish) and it dried to a transparent film. I called customer service and they told me to apply it 2xs a day and to remove the old dried layer with a piece of tape to prevent it from flaking. I was a bit nervous but it came off gently and my scar is hardly noticeable now. I would definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I had a double mastectomy with breast reconstruction &amp; lapascopic ovarian removal due to breast cancer. At my post-op visit, my plastic surgeon recommended Scarguard MD for the extensive scars on my breast &amp; stomach. We are talking alot of areas to cover from the bottom of both nipples (an upside down T) on both breasts, scars from the (6) drain sites, &amp; (7) small laposcopic scars on my stomach from the removal of my ovaries. After using ScarGuard MD for two weeks, the scars have flattened &amp; fadded tremendously. I have been using Scarguard for about 2 months now  &amp; each day the scars are getting lighter &amp; lighter. I will continue to use it for another 2 months; as recommended on the bottle. Because of all the areas I have to cover, one bottle last about 1 1/2 weeks. It has cost me alot of money but it really does work; so well  worth the money. I am very happy my surgeon told me about ScarGuard.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment about Scarguard is it forms a skinlike scab over each site where it is applied and each morning &amp; night it takes me about 7 minutes to remove all the scabs from the sites with my fingers so I can apply the product again. This process is timely and cumbersome &amp; sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time to remove all of them in the morning before going to work so it doesn&#x27;t get applied twice a day as recommended. I also find pieces of the Scarguard scabs on my bedroom &amp; bathroom floor as they fall off sometimes on their own while undressing or going to the bathroom; so annoyingly I have to pick them up off the floor one by one. I wish they could make the product so it didn&#x27;t form these scabs but after reading the specs of the product there is a reason it forms the scab. Just saying... but still love the product. I guess you have to take the good with the bad...</li>
    <li> I tried this product on an abdominal surgical scar. It didn&#x27;t work for me. Also it has a tendency to peel off. I&#x27;d paint the stripe over the scar, and then it would dry and peel right off my skin. Maybe this was due to friction caused by waistabands -- but either way, it felt like thrown out money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see my scares any more people may want to use clear tape right after putting it on it makes it ease to remove.</li>
    <li> My scar had formed into a hypotropic  (raised) scar and my podiatrist recommended this. After a few days of using it, I noticed a huge difference in my scar. It is flattening and looking a ton better. I feel this takes over when Mederma isn&#x27;t cutting it. Good product!  Happy!</li>
    <li> Scar next to lip and under chin of 3 yr old.  Works wonders to help appearance.  Solution is a bit pungent, requires immediate fanning so noxious fumes clear quickly.  Probably because of location of cut.  Have re-ordered due to working so well.</li>
    <li> This company shipped the item very fast.  Scarguard seems to work fine although it does have an odor until it dries.</li>
    <li> It DOES work on sunken scars too. I have a small scar under my eye, very close to my lower lashes. This product has very much improved the appearance of the scar of this 6 year old scar. I use it every night. I found the best way to apply product to this very small area is to use a toothpick because application is more precise that using the brush. I will keep using this. I&#x27;m telling you it works! I&#x27;ve tried about every other product out there, nothing compares to the effectiveness of Scarguard MD.</li>
    <li> Scarguard is absolutely amazing. I had surgery and it left me with crazy, lifted, Frankenstein-esk scars. My surgeon cleared me to use this one the stitches had dissolved &amp; wound had closed up/healed (after 3 weeks for me). After 1 week of using this they were almost completely flat. I have continued to use it as the scar heals and it is only getting better and better. This stuff works miracles!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet, how much my sutures will disipate and relieve possible scars as I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks.  However I don&#x27;t like the flimsy brush that it comes with.  For the cost of the tiny bottle, You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d use a better brush for application. :(</li>
    <li> wow.  use this stuff as directed and it will fade your scars.  amazing.  just don&#x27;t expect it overnight.  it takes awhile</li>
    <li> I started using Scarguard pretty much as soon as a burn on my wrist had healed enough to apply anything on top, roughly about a year ago. The burn mark has definitely faded, but I suppose I may never know whether or not it was because of Scarguard&#x27;s help, or if the mark would have ultimately faded on its own!</li>
    <li> A little difficult to get solution adhered to scar but effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I had mohs surgery on my nose and the scar was about 3/4 of an inch. Thankfully this product helped to diminish it over time. If you follow the instructions and apply regularly you will see the scar begin to fade.&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work well, but only in certain scenarios:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It flakes/peels off easily on any active/stretchy areas, including fingers, most of your hand, elbows, knees, and most of your face. If used on stable skin surfaces, it does tend to stay on fairly well even over long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is definitely not \\&quot;nearly invisible\\&quot;. The edges tend to turn white (as it peels a little) and the center part becomes quite shiny when dry. This isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re putting it somewhere that will be covered by clothing, but it&#x27;s not quite something you would want on your face in public. Although, I guess you could put a bandage over it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It dries fast and without any tackiness, so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell out of the bottle is quite strong, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the main thing is that if you have a scar in a non-active area of your body, this is a pretty good treatment option.</li>
    <li> please dont buy this product it does not work and its expenseve dont waste your money all they are doing is ripping you off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using several products in conjunction depending on what is closest at hand when I am in bathroom, my car or downstairs. I&#x27;m fairly happy with all, but this seems a notch above the rest. When comparing ingredients, this seems to have what others don&#x27;t, thus the elevated price of $35. I&#x27;m impressed with the concealing fake skin/bandage strip that this creates so crevice sore does not look so severe while healing.</li>
    <li> I saw some pretty good improvement in color and flattening of the scar in the 6 weeks or so I&#x27;ve been using this. It smells awful, though, like wart remover! Also, by the time you&#x27;ve use 2/3s of the bottle, the rest is dried and sludgey and hard to apply, and thus less effective. After 3 bottles, I think I&#x27;m looking for a new method.</li>
    <li> I broke my wrist a year ago which required surgery- with a horrible, puckered scar.  I wore the silicone patches the hospital gave me at first but after a while it just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this bottle hoping it would help and at first, portions started to peel while other parts took scrubbing to remove.  That&#x27;s when I realized applying in a cross-cross fashion extending beyond the scar helped me.  The portion that peeled was not Touching the scar and I could wear it all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE THAT WILL HELP: The bottle doesn&#x27;t close very well, but I would just brush a little of the silicone on the tp screw of the bottle and then close.  Worked wonders hand hasn&#x27;t thickened in 7 months, even I forgot to use it for 2 mo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing this, in the end saved money from buying the thick silicone pads and bandages to keep it on and no one noticing it nearly as much as having a bandage on your wrist at work and clients staring at it thinking the worst.  HUGE improvement to the scar months later and the puckering is gone and the redness is almost completely gone.</li>
    <li> Only used it for a month. I like it i think i would order it again</li>
    <li> It works! Does the job healing and lightening the scar. In fact, it lights the scar better than Scarlight from the same company. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on the tender skin areas like eyelids though...</li>
    <li> My surgeon recommended this to use on scars that I can&#x27;t tape.  I&#x27;ve been applying 1-2 times daily for the last month.  My scars seem lighter.  I&#x27;m using this on a covered, non-active, part of my body, and it does crack and peel away a bit at the edges after several hours under my cloths.  The second time, I apply on top of the original coat.  The second layer hold together better and longer. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I don&#x27;t mind the peeling as long as it heals my scars. The smell is strong, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Using it as I do, one bottle lasted about a month.  If you apply 3 time daily as recommended, the tiny bottle will be gone fast.  So, I&#x27;m glad I found it $10 cheaper on Amazon than at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s amazing&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after first three days of using this product I saw difference&lt;br /&gt;It lightening my scars&lt;br /&gt;And shrunk my keloid&lt;br /&gt;And now after three weeks of using it at least once a day although you SUPOsed two use it twice a day there&#x27;s a BIG difference and improvement it really deminshes scars like it said&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering three more of these and I&#x27;ll use it twice a day for sure</li>
    <li> Very good improvement is seen after applying this medicine for my son&#x27;s injury</li>
    <li> After more than a month of usage. Can&#x27;t tell if the scar is shrinking. However, it softens my scar a lot. The thin polymer film also keepsmy scar from harsh surfaces.</li>
    <li> Once I started using it twice a day, it was only a couple days before I could definitely see results. I&#x27;ve tried mederma before for older scars, but I had fresh scars, and bought and tried a couple different things.I didn&#x27;t really want to spend this much money, but I knew if it did work, it would be worth it, so I made the gamble. I absolutely 100 % saw results that I KNOW are from using this stuff. I&#x27;d absolutely buy it and give it the benefit of the doubt if you are even considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 6 out of 8 people found this helpful so I&#x27;m trying to figure out what would help. I usually pay approx $30 for a bottle the size of a bottle of nail polish. It will often peel off after not very long, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it still works. I try to leave it uncovered for a couple minutes after applying, and I&#x27;m pretty sure whatever needs to be absorbed is getting absorbed even though it will start flaking off before long. I have NOT tried silicone sheets, so I cannot comment on how this works compared to silicone sheeting. It isn&#x27;t cheap but I&#x27;ve bought it several times because I keep seeing results. The puffiness from my keloid scar has decreased significantly.</li>
    <li> For all of winter I used this on a scar I had on my leg, and I know it made the difference! I had this scar for a few months prior and it was healing/fading way too slow, which led me to using scarguard. Make sure your skin is clean and not oily before applying otherwise it will not stay. Since my scar was on my thigh that was quite easy. Needless to say once I started using it and it had been a few weeks, I noticed how my scar was healing so much faster! It was losing its uneven texture and shrinking. Today the scared skin feels exactly like the rest of my skin and 90% of the time you can&#x27;t even see it, except when light hits it a certain way which makes the scar colored differently than the rest of my skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this on an old keloid scar she has had for nearly 20 years, and it&#x27;s working great? The scar is kind of large, so it&#x27;s taking some time, but overall it is far less raised than it was, and the color is started to return to a flesh-tone (rather than bright red). She&#x27;s been using it for roughly half-a-year, with slow but noticeable results. She&#x27;s also stated a few times that the scar is far more comfortable when she has ScarGuard applied to it. Otherwise, it can be itchy and painful. We&#x27;re hoping that it will fully heal the scar with enough time.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by a Dentist (!) when I suffered a recent cut to my forehead which required stitches (and that Dr. confirmed what that individual said), and has worked quite well on keeping that scar to a crease  . . . but what stunned me was that while I was using it for that purpose, I decided to apply it (since the product said it worked on old scars) to a scar near my eye that I have had for about 49 years (yes, I am that old), and in just 4 months it has become 80% less pronounced.  Wow!</li>
    <li> It is very itchy and irritated my skin. It kept peeling as well. It is impossible to get off. I tried multiple scrubbings and when that didn&#x27;t work I resorted to scotch tape. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for, in a really good price</li>
    <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
    <li> I bought this product to treat a new surgical scar on the top of my right hand.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 3-4 weeks, twice a day.  It has reduced the inflammation from my surgery and helped reduce the swelling from scar.  It hasn&#x27;t eliminated the scar, just made it less noticeable.  Because of the location of the scar between my thumb and pointer finger, the Scarguard tended to peel off around the edges of the scar which was kind of a nuisance.  By following the instructions on the bottle, removal was easy by applying a piece of scotch tape over the application and simply pulling it off.  Worked great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Scar guard doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the sheets. It flakes off, see no improvement from using it.</li>
    <li> A plastic surgeon recommended this to me after having my nose done. You can hardly see the scar and I&#x27;m sure you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it at all if I had been more diligent about using this. It smells pretty badly but it works really well.</li>
    <li> It is not medical grade.  At the time that I did a search, the site did not indicate that it was NOT medical grade.  Now I am stuck with 2 bottles of Scarguard I will never use.</li>
    <li> I have red and raised scar after foot surgery for two years in a row. The scar from last year is barely visible now. I tried Mederma,  the Silicon tape by various brands.  The most dramatic improvement came from Scarguard. I am faithful using it again after  my second foot surgery.  Red and Raised scar from surgery four month ago has subsided significantly. My foot doctor is very pleased too. Amazon has the best price. I paid about eight dollars more in the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  No refund given yet.</li>
    <li> this product is difficult to stay in place, i prepped the scar site with an alcohol swab first and then it would stay put longer. i wish you sold the 1oz bottles. this has been an amazing product to use post surgery and has keep my scarring to a minium.</li>
    <li> My surgeon specifically recommended ScarGuard ScarCare to treat the scars following surgery (after the proper healing time). I happened to read a few reviews before purchasing and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Between those and my own experience I can recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now (have gone through 2 1/2 bottles) and the scarring is very minimal. I plan on continuing to use it for another 6 months as per the doctor&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve learned that may be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the cap with brush...it doesn&#x27;t seal well and the brush is not the best way to apply the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep and continue to use the small, red plug and cap without brush that it ships with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your middle finger apply - with your finger over the opening, turn the bottle upside down and give a little shake/flick to get a decent amount on your finger tip. Immediately smooth (for long scars) or dab (for small scars) onto scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply 2-3 coats per use on long scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll flake up and look like its not adhering, but it is. The edges tend to peel away and look ridiculous. Let it dry for 10-15 minutes and then gently rub the loose flakes off. The center portion should be shiny and firmly adhered to the scar. If not, apply again! My scars are under clothing, so I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about the flaking, but I read other reviewers complaining about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look good with make-up applied - the packaging claims you can apply make-up over it once its dried and they&#x27;re technically correct. You CAN apply make-up, but it doesn&#x27;t look natural - it looks like a wart. In my case, the small scar I was trying to lighten looked better minus make-up at all. I only apply at night to that one.</li>
    <li> Had two hip replacements. Used Scarguard on one scar, another silicone product on the other. I used both products as soon as the incision was healed. Scarguard flattened and smoothed the scar in two months. The other made only small improvement. Now I&#x27;m using the Scarguard on the other incision. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fast now that the scar is 4 months old. I highly recommend Scarguard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it diligently for the last month and don&#x27;t see any results yet :( I&#x27;m hoping that it changes...</li>
    <li> Used it on a surgical scar on my wrist.  The scar is almost entirely eliminated.  It is an excellent &amp; effective product.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because I am an OCD scab picker and end up with scars and keloid scars. My most recent spot is on my face. Has been there for a few months because I can&#x27;t leave it alone! It turned into a keloid which made me pick at the spot more! The product said it reduced keloids and I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it for $25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have written it looks and smells like clear nail polish, but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell like it, and the consistency is different. Anyways, I applied product per the directions and within 1 day I can already feel the difference! I can&#x27;t wait to see what a week difference will make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because they advertise you can wear make-up over the product. Although you CAN, the spot is VERY noticeable because the edges flake up and catch make up under the edge, so I would not recommend it. I&#x27;ve been applying make-up and cleaning the small area then applying product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, fantastic stuff, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term use results!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using the product for several months and the ugly spot on my face is hardly noticeable, only seen if you know its there. This stuff is fantastic. I had to buy 2 bottles total, but to finally be rid of a keloid scar on my face that I picked nonstop, totally worth it. I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I discovered the nail polish smell is there as a disinfectant so that no bacteria or nasties get trapped under the film. It is very clever. I read on Wikipedia that the reason that Scarguard works and all the other products like the onion extract creams and green tea creams don&#x27;t work is because Scarguard actually attaches to the skin like a second skin and that enables it to maintain a tension on the skin and hold the silicone against the skin which is critical to getting the body&#x27;s own mechanisms to start shrinking the scar. The problem with the ointments, gels, creams and patches is that they either rub off or peel off and so do not work nearly as well. It is brilliant technology.</li>
    <li> Good price and it covers up the scars.</li>
    <li> I am not writing a review based on the other ingredients but only on the inclusion of vitamin E alone. My doctor sold this to me after my surgery so I figured he wouldn&#x27;t sell me anything that was bad for me. He must have some sort of deal with the company and that saddens me that he would sell me something like this. It does include vitamin e and that is a problem. Vitamin E is NOT effective for scar treatment and may actually be harmful. Please read this link about studies done on the effectiveness of vitamin E on scars: [...]</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;I had a birthmark on my neck that was fairly large, I would like to say the size of two quarters. I went and got Cryosurgery done to get the birthmark removed (three treatments). After the third time of the cryosurgery a keloid scar was left over that was very large and noticeable. So I started to use ScarGuard MD and in two days it actually shrunk double it size. I have been using scarguard MD for about one week now and the scar is almost completely gone, I am so glad I found this product. I finally wont feel self conscious about my birthmark/scar anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have with this product is that when you apply this product it can get just a little itchy. I don&#x27;t find this to be a major problem but the only reason why I am mentioning this is that it is very IMPORTANT not to scratch your scars. If you want your scars to go away you can not scratch them. after two minutes of applying ScarGuard MD the itchiness will go away after the hydrocoritisone is soaked into your scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note:&lt;br /&gt;I have day by day pictures of my scar healing with ScarGuard MD, if you would like I would be more then willing to show you how my scar has healed with this product. I stand by this product and even appreciate the fact that I stumbled upon it.</li>
    <li> I bought this becausen of the great reviews it had because I have a 2 inch kelo scar . It seemed to work fine the first few times, it seemed to get it a bit flatter. But after awhile it just stopped working and  my scar rose up again. Finished one bottle and bought another one left about half of it after I noticed it didn&#x27;t work. Save ur money not worth it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Left literally zero scars after my liposuction! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a real customer, l really used it a week after my surgery, my scars are not noticeable.</li>
    <li> Is working great, it has a little brush that makes the bottle look like nail polish, so make sure you keep your child out of it. But works great make sure to apply as direct and I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle (daughter had a huge dog bite scar on face) but its working great!</li>
    <li> I had Mohs surgery above my lip almost a year ago.  I have a a raised and thickish scar.  I use Dermablend to cover it, but it is still noticeable.  I have used Scarguard as directed for almost eight months and have had no improvement.  I have tried to reach out to someone in customer service but Scarguard has no customer service department nor do they respond to e-amails.  It&#x27;s appalling!  As for the doctors who have endorsed this product, they also sell it in their offices and make a profit from it. There are no clinical trials for this product to speak of.  It doesn&#x27;t work plain and simple.</li>
    <li> Very helpful . Scars rapidly disappearing.</li>
    <li> should be better, I see no results after 6 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used contractubex and mederma continuously for a year with almost no results. My c section scar remained raised and red and itchy. 2 weeks after usin the scar guard I&#x27;ve noticed my scar is a thin flat  white line. The product dries in under a minute so it doesn&#x27;t get on clothing.</li>
    <li> Been using to diminish the appearance of a forehead scar. Not seeing much improvement additionally, it makes my forehead look like it has dried skin that is badly peeling--but I have caramel brown skin, so this may be a pronounced problem for darker people. Additionally, the application brush this comes with is inadequate and hardened within a week a use, so I have been using a stick to apply. I thought it would work miracles on hypertrophic scars, but no real changes from other scar treatments previously used (silicone scar pads, steroid tape, oil (coconut and tea tree), silicone massager, and Mederma). I will update if this changes, but I have already been using it for over a month.</li>
    <li> I had a thyroidectomy last year which left a huge scar on my neck. My doctor recommended ScarGuard and within 6 months the scar was gone. I went back to my endocrinologist and she said if she hadn&#x27;t  know where to look, she would have never noticed it. It is essentially invisible. I have recommended this product to so many people, and when they look at where my surgery scar &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; been, they but it.</li>
    <li> i have a keloid scar, and i&#x27;ve been trying scargaurd for about 3 weeks or so.  my scar has become more tender, (it was previously hard).  I have noticed a slight change in color, it&#x27;s getting lighter.  But honestly, I can&#x27;t say its the best out there, but it surely has done very well so far.  I still have a good amount of medication left, so lets see what happens after the bottle finishes.. I might buy another bottle? Not sure yet.. but if i remember, I will put an update for what happens after the medication starts to dwindle!</li>
