    <li> I was s o excited when I ordered this pallet couldn&#x27;t wait to try it .shipping arrive on time the product was in great shape whenever I got it, I have no complaints about that. as far as the quality, it is not that great to me they&#x27;re not very pigmented and when you put them on at first they look pigmented but then you blend them out and they look very washed away and I&#x27;m not impressed at all. I was really expecting more because I have bought some help elf shadows in four quads at the store,  they were really great and I love them. However this one was real disappointment to me I do not recommend this.I only gave one star because I had to.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described just fine!</li>
    <li> Important review: I was very excited to get this palette when it arrived, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything too crazy since it is just 8$ and you know what they say; you get what you pay for. I used it the same day I got it, and it&#x27;s not had if it&#x27;s your first palette or something just to add a one tone to your eyes.. it doesn&#x27;t blend well, and is by no means anywhere close to the professional eyeshadows. Looks a bit chalky when used w eye shaDow primer, especially around the eyebrow area. I&#x27;m not a big fan of it. I should have just kept my money and ordered a different one. It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but its not that good either.</li>
    <li> It is drier than urban decay. Not recomended at all.</li>
    <li> nothing special about the colors. I don&#x27;t use it very much. Pigment leave some what to be desired. I tried it, it&#x27;s ok, no need to buy it again...still searching.</li>
    <li> This was the first e.l.f. eyeshadow palette I have purchased and I was not disappointed at all!  I expected it to be a little lower quality, considering the price, but when it came, I fell in love.  I have had previous experience with e.l.f. brushes and have a Long-lasting Lustrous eyeshadow pot, but knew that would be different from their powdered eyeshadows.  I love the different color options on this palette, even though it is the neutral palette.  I can create an entire look for day or night just with this one set.  Also, it fits inside a tiny clutch bag!!  This is a great product for beginners or advanced makeup artists because it provides a variety of colors and it so small that it can go anywhere with you.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome quality and last longer than most eyeshadows I have purchased. The color selection is great and was exactly what I was hoping it was. The case is a lot bigger than I thought It would be and so I got even more product than I was expecting!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. Everything was intact when it arrived, and the eyeshadows looked great in the palette itself. I swatched them later and they all look wonderful. The matte eyeshadows are really creamy and so gorgeous, and the shimmery ones were beautiful. Definitely recommend this palette if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality and inexpensive eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> This is very good! I use it all the time! This is a MUST BUY item. It&#x27;s really awesome and color is great. You can&#x27;t beat the price! Not to mention, the component is very sleek. LOVE e.l.f.!</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup. Great look every time that lasts</li>
    <li> goes on nice love this pallet!</li>
    <li> Really love this eyeshadow palette! It&#x27;s comparable to top brands and the colors are very pigmented!</li>
    <li> This palette is absolutely AMAZING! All the colors are warm and rich and show up lovely. I will definitely be purchasing this again when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice colors- No exchange or return- allergic to product after first use :(</li>
    <li> I love this palette set! I use the light tan color almost everyday as a base for my eyeshadow. I use the dark brown for eyebrows. Blends so well and stays all day ( sometimes until the next day too! ). Worse every penny, and will get it again when I run out of my favorite colors out of it.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality, a bit chalky. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it and some colors are better than others in the pallette</li>
    <li> Love it, last all day and shipped fast. But its not $8.00 it was $14.00</li>
    <li> I only use the black. All the other colors lasts for like 5 minutes tops</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors &amp; amazing price. Would buy again.</li>
