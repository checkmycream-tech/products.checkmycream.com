      <li>no problem ...run great and light</li>
      <li>I do my own acrylic nails at home and this machine is just like they use in the nail salons.</li>
      <li>I kind of disappoint</li>
      <li>I never used a drill before and this is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It beats out my co-worker drill which cost her $100 more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this file.</li>
      <li>Love this nail filing system.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to express how much I love this file.</li>
      <li>I have used many others over the years.</li>
      <li>The hand piece accepts all standard sized bits, so you can use whatever bits work best for you.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and control.  </li>
      <li>Easy to operate.</li>
      <li>this is a great drill, light weight, very quiet.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold on to.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Hand piece is very comfortable and pretty light weight.</li>
      <li>Originally I was going to go with Medicools Pro 30K model</li>
      <li>I finally settled on this one because it had good reviews, wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but also wasn&#x27;t going to cost a fortune.</li>
      <li>Shipping  was super quick .</li>
      <li>Other than that I love this drill!!</li>
      <li>Being able to change the direction of the bit is crucial when filing your own nails, so I really like that.</li>
      <li>Motor gets hot and doesn&#x27;t spin like it should!</li>
      <li>Since I only do my own nails the machine will not be taxed the way a nail tech&#x27;s drill would be.</li>
      <li>Great drill very quite, smaller handle than most, only thing I can complain about</li>
      <li>Great Machine small &amp; convenient..Been using it for a year now...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the machine more than a few times but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
      <li>I love this drill, quiet and efficient.  </li>
      <li>This is my first medicool file.</li>
      <li>More than enough power.</li>
      <li>And I love the fact that it has the twist and lock chuck, and uses the standard size drill bit.</li>
      <li>Crapped out on me only being LIGHTLY used 8 months ago!</li>
      <li>I only have to set it halfway of the power level and it is more power than I need.</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own nails for years but more recently in the past two years have become more serious with it, meaning I&#x27;ve invested more into it than just some nail polish colors.</li>
      <li>Overall it is everything I wanted and super powerful.</li>
      <li>but it is comfortable to hold, not too heavy, and performs smooth but with plenty of power.</li>
      <li>It is so much quieter than any of the others I have had.</li>
      <li>The variable speed works very well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I spent $400 for my drill many years ago</li>
      <li>It really gets the job done.</li>
      <li>There is a little vibration and the hand piece is a tiny bit heavier than I would prefer but other than that it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>It DOES NOT have a high torque.</li>
      <li>TOO HIGH</li>
      <li>My customers say they like the new e-file.</li>
      <li>I have small hands and the hand piece is very comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>The variable speed did not work and only operationed on high speed!!</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $500 on a professional Kupa brand drill</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this machine twice so far</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Machine small &amp; convenient..Been using it for a year now...no problems...definitely will recommend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the machine more than a few times but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far I&#x27;ve loved it. Originally I was going to go with Medicools Pro 30K model and I&#x27;m very glad I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a nail tech and one of my coworkers has this model and it has lasted her two years without any problem. There is a little vibration and the hand piece is a tiny bit heavier than I would prefer but other than that it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This drill is too awesome! It really gets the job done. It beats out my co-worker drill which cost her $100 more.</li>
    <li> Great drill very quite, smaller handle than most, only thing I can complain about, it doesn&#x27;t  hook up to a foot pedal. Other than that I love this drill!!</li>
    <li> this is a great drill, light weight, very quiet. I would order again and recommend it to other nail techs</li>
    <li> Crapped out on me only being LIGHTLY used 8 months ago! Motor gets hot and doesn&#x27;t spin like it should! Ugh!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter who is in cosmetology school.  She began her nail portion just this month April and when she broke the seal on the box the drill was already broken.  Since I am beyond the 30 day return policy I have no recourse and a drill that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this file.</li>
    <li> I DONT LIKE TOO MUCH,,SPEED TOO HIGH</li>
    <li> So far so good. But it&#x27;s only few days.i hope it lasts</li>
    <li> I have small hands and the hand piece is very comfortable to hold. Being able to change the direction of the bit is crucial when filing your own nails, so I really like that. The variable speed works very well. The hand piece accepts all standard sized bits, so you can use whatever bits work best for you.</li>
    <li> Very quiet. Love the variance in speed and bought it for a great price. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I never used a drill before and this is very easy to use.  Easy to handle and control.  Met my expectations!</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for 25 years and my daughter just recently became a nail tech.  I bought this for her and for the price it does everything she will need.  I spent $400 for my drill many years ago but when I have to replace it I would be happy with the Medicool 520 and save myself a ton of money.  It has a winey noise but I think I could get use to it.</li>
    <li> The drill is great....in beginning i thought that cordless...I kind of disappoint but i can use them for now.... no problem ...run great and light</li>
    <li> I love this drill, quiet and efficient.  Does a great job for the price.  Comfortable to hold on to.  Easy to operate.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product as a good beginning.  If it lasts for a couple of years I&#x27;d definitely buy another.  Price was very good.</li>
    <li> This is my first medicool file. I have used many others over the years. I can&#x27;t even begin to express how much I love this file. It is so much quieter than any of the others I have had. More than enough power. I have never had to turn it up past half way. My clients are happy as well. We are getting the job done in a lot less time with this file.</li>
    <li> I am a pro nail tech. I wanted a smaller e-file, this unit is small. This e-file is different than my last e-file. It does bog down with a little pressure. It DOES NOT have a high torque. Applying pressure to the artificial nail to remove it -is a bad habit and not necessary. My customers say they like the new e-file. They like the lighter touch this e-file forces me to use.</li>
    <li> Arrived  broken and Ican&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;t get info to return it</li>
    <li> Love this nail filing system. I do my own acrylic nails at home and this machine is just like they use in the nail salons. My only negative is that the handle gets really hot and you have to hold it really close to the bottom where it is a little cooler. Overall it is everything I wanted and super powerful. I only have to set it halfway of the power level and it is more power than I need. Would definitely recommend this file. I only gave it a four star because of the heat generated with the file.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own nails for years but more recently in the past two years have become more serious with it, meaning I&#x27;ve invested more into it than just some nail polish colors. I stopped getting acrylics at the nail salon because of the cost but missed them terribly so decided to do them myself. One of these drills is completely necessary for getting the job done but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $500 on a professional Kupa brand drill so I began researching and reading product reviews. I finally settled on this one because it had good reviews, wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but also wasn&#x27;t going to cost a fortune. Since I only do my own nails the machine will not be taxed the way a nail tech&#x27;s drill would be. I&#x27;ve only used this machine twice so far but it is comfortable to hold, not too heavy, and performs smooth but with plenty of power. And I love the fact that it has the twist and lock chuck, and uses the standard size drill bit.</li>
    <li> Shipping  was super quick . Hand piece is very comfortable and pretty light weight. So long as it last I would differently buy another as a backup for my salon.</li>
    <li> The one I received did not work properly! The variable speed did not work and only operationed on high speed!! The reverse also did not work. Sending in for replacement.</li>
