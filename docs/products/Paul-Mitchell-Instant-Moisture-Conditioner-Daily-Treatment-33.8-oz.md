      <li>Bought the wrong stuff, but kept as a spare bottle since fairly inexpensive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottles were not the same tone of color, different methods of printing the ink were done, the shampoo itself smelled more bland, and was a white paste rather than opaque.</li>
      <li>I had to tip the bottle upside down after the first time using it.</li>
      <li>This goes for other high end salon products too!</li>
      <li>Just like the last reviewers said, I can barely touch the conditioner with the tip of my finger when I put my finger in.  </li>
      <li>After only a few days, I have found Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment fantastic for curing my dry winter hair blues!</li>

<li> Try this if you have dry hair.</li>
<li> and I used to have very dry hair</li>
<li> My 6 year old daughter has very thick, long hair</li>
<li> I might have to go check this conditioner out in other stores to see if the one I received is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> you only need a very small amount</li>
<li> Well, to my surprise, when the conditioner came and I opened it up, the bottle was indeed NOT full.  </li>
<li> Do not buy Paul Mitchell from &amp;#34;Beauty Concepts&amp;#34; or any other seller who is not a legitimate salon!!</li>
<li> but worse is that it made my hair really dry.  </li>
<li> I have bought this product for a long time, and never get tired of it!  </li>
<li> EVEN THOUGH ITS A LITTLE EXSPENSIVE!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ridiculous to pay for 33.8 oz and get a bottle that&#x27;s missing 1/5!!  </li>
<li> You literally have to poor the shampoo from the bottle onto your scalp :/</li>
<li> I was skeptical of the one review that mentioned that the conditioner comes not full thinking, \\&quot;It&#x27;s Amazon!  </li>
<li> Needless to say, it makes squeezing the conditioner out fairly difficult.  </li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> I will poor some in my hand and it is impossible to get onto my scalp without it all dripping!</li>
<li> Horrible product either way - I do not recommend!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A review mentioned a counterfeit shampoo being sold, well I bought this product online and did a side by side comparison by the bottle purchased at the salon. Don&#x27;t buy this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were not the same tone of color, different methods of printing the ink were done, the shampoo itself smelled more bland, and was a white paste rather than opaque.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner for my boyfriend&#x27;s mother. She loves it</li>
    <li> Do not buy Paul Mitchell from &amp;#34;Beauty Concepts&amp;#34; or any other seller who is not a legitimate salon!! The product was counterfeit even though they were verified by Amazon. I called the number on the invoice and they gave me the run around and never did anything about it. I never got my money back.  This goes for other high end salon products too! If the price seems too good to be true, it is. On the back of every Paul Mitchell product it says this, but I never listened. I wish I would have read a review like this before buying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I know the product was counterfeit because it had a really funny smell to it. I have used this product a million times before and I would have recognized the smell.</li>
    <li> So I would love this shampoo if it was thicker!! I will poor some in my hand and it is impossible to get onto my scalp without it all dripping! You literally have to poor the shampoo from the bottle onto your scalp :/ I would prefer it to be thicker.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this conditioner, but when it came and I tried to use it for the first time, I had to really squeeze the bottle to get anything out.  I stuck my finger in the bottle and only touched the conditioner with the very tip of my finger.  It&#x27;s ridiculous to pay for 33.8 oz and get a bottle that&#x27;s missing 1/5!!  Will never order again.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t help my hair</li>
    <li> This daily Moisture work great with my curly hair i&#x27;m 52 years old and without a dot is the best produce i have ever used. thank you Mitchell.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this conditioner.  My 6 year old daughter has very thick, long hair and I could never find a conditioner that helped detangle her hair the way this one does.  It leaves her hair soft and smelling great.  And the best thing...you only need a very small amount so although you&#x27;ll pay more than some of the others, you will use alot less!!  Will but it over and over!</li>
    <li> Yes it hydrates my hair,,makes it shine I use it and alternate with clarifying shampoo,,makes my hair real soft,,shiney and pretty I&#x27;m told</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I used to have very dry hair and this has made a miracle in my hair. I would definitely recommend it to anyone as a leave in. Paul Mitchell products are very good.</li>
    <li> Bought the wrong stuff, but kept as a spare bottle since fairly inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought this product before.&lt;br /&gt;It works reaaly well on my hair! And it lasts a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about ten years now! I am a black women with permed and natural hair (transitioning)! I wash my hair once a week and the longer this sits the softer my hair! Bottle lasts me three to four months. Smells great... Expensive but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I believe this is a counterfeit product. It didn&#x27;t smell like the conditioner I&#x27;ve bought at salons which is the tell-tale sign but worse is that it made my hair really dry.  Horrible product either way - I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Perfect for dry, damaged, or brittle hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy soapy feel to your skalp or hair.</li>
    <li> After only a few days, I have found Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment fantastic for curing my dry winter hair blues! It&#x27;s worth the extra buck folks...</li>
    <li> Got here on time and was packaged well.  I love the product.  Very good experience ordering and receiving this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product as a daily conditioner.  It truly saves my hair and keeps it soft, shiny and smooth!</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY PAUL MITCHELL ON HERE ITS A PROFESSIONAL LINE OF PRODUCTS. IT WILL BE TAMPORED WITH IF YOU BUY IT OR IT WILL NOT BE 100% PURE QUALITY. GO TO PAUL MITCELL ONLINE AND LOOM UP SALONS WHERE THEY SELL IT OR IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS A COSMO LICENSE THEY CAN GET IT FOR U CHEAPER! ITS WORTH IT AT A SALON EVEN THOUGH ITS A LITTLE EXSPENSIVE!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for a long time, and never get tired of it!  I have naturally curly hair and it keeps it soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with Deva Curl products, which I love also.  Thanks so much for having available at the price you offered it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings, Cheryl V</li>
    <li> honestly i liked the conditioner. i didn&#x27;t love it. there was nothing special about it from any other one i have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  Its not sold in this size in any Salons where I live so I&#x27;m glad to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Great product that gets the job done, although I tend to use it in conjunction with Paul Mitchell The Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I have fine blonde hair, works great for me -- I wash my hair daily and this conditioner does not leave any residue.  I also use it for my kids (two boys, 4 &amp; 7 -- one has blonde curly hair, the other is brown and straight) as it helps to make their hair easy to comb.  The boys swim a lot in the summer, basically every day, and the chlorine damages their hair some.  This conditioner makes their hair easy to comb, fewer tangles which the kids love.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on 3 out of the 4 wonderful reviews here on Amazon.  I was skeptical of the one review that mentioned that the conditioner comes not full thinking, \\&quot;It&#x27;s Amazon!  How is that possible?  They won&#x27;t do anything of the sort!\\&quot;  Well, to my surprise, when the conditioner came and I opened it up, the bottle was indeed NOT full.  Just like the last reviewers said, I can barely touch the conditioner with the tip of my finger when I put my finger in.  Needless to say, it makes squeezing the conditioner out fairly difficult.  I had to tip the bottle upside down after the first time using it. (I shouldn&#x27;t have to put a BRAND NEW bottle upside down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner two times as of now.  It feels pretty good, but I did just visit the salon last week.  Also, the conditioner is for some reason thicker than any conditioners I&#x27;ve used.  I might have to go check this conditioner out in other stores to see if the one I received is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 because the shipping was extraordinarily fast.  I received my item two days after I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the shampoo. Great product, I have curly dry hair and this works great! Try this if you have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and is safe for my colored hair. It has helped heal all the damage I&#x27;ve done to my hair over the years of over-dying. I use the Paul Mitchell Color Safe Shampoo, then this conditioner and let it condition my hair through my shower and rinse at the end. My longish hair comes out soft and easier to brush through.</li>
    <li> Would recommend highly!!!</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell - this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found. I have bleached, over processed hair. This conditioner keeps it looking the exact opposite!</li>
