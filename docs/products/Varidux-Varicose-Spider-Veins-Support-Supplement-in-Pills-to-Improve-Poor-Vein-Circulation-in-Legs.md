      <li>we highly  recommend this product.</li>

      <li>and even though they are not very hard to swallow, they are still a pain.</li>
      <li>what do I have to lose since it is a natural product.</li>
      <li>if you are looking for a natural way to relieve the pain and improve circulation, this is for you, but it might not work for you to make the veins disappear.</li>
      <li>I couldn’t deal with the pain and swelling, but this product took all of that away, and now I can complete my household chores without it taking me all day to complete.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s possible, I suppose, that things get worse before they get better.  </li>
      <li>My last two kids I had later in life which has put my body through major changes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m really note sure about this right now.  I&#x27;ve taken this product for a little over a week, and I&#x27;ve noticed more spider veins pop up.  It&#x27;s possible, I suppose, that things get worse before they get better.  If that&#x27;s the case, then I&#x27;ll adjust my review in the future.  However, as another user pointed out, practically all the 5-star reviews on this product seem to be written by people who got paid to review it.  If you look on their profile pages, you&#x27;ll see that almost all of them gave raving 5-star reviews to the exact same group of other VH Nutrition products.  Therefore, I&#x27;m a little skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month now, and I&#x27;ve been consistent about taking it daily for the past couple weeks.  I will say that I think I am noticing some fading in my spider veins.  For some reason, they seemed to get worse before they started getting better.  I might try this for another month before I make a final decision.  I still am not impressed with the fact that this company had so many fake reviews.  However, if the product is working as it&#x27;s supposed to, I will rate it appropriately.</li>
    <li> I get this burning sensation in my legs every time I take it</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but I said to myself what do I have to lose since it is a natural product. So I gave it a try and happy that I did. I will order some more because it has helped me with my leg cramps. the good thing about this product is that they offer 30-day guarantee, and you can return the used portion of veridux for a full refund. </li>
    <li> I have taken this product for a month as well as used a horse chestnut cream on my legs and I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The product is good.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m very satisfied with consideration and service for customers.</li>
    <li> At times my leg pain makes me want to cry. I have pretty much been bed ridden but I was determined to find out something that can help me deal with this intense matter. It happened by accident that I discovered this product. The pain usually starts small but increases with time. Varidux has rescued me from my troubles, thanks to the makers.</li>
    <li> My legs doesn&#x27;t hurt when i am taking those.I am able to sleep at night again.</li>
    <li> There is finally a product that gives me exactly what I need.  I didn’t want a product that would get rid of my varicose veins for a few hours or relieve the pain for a few days.  I know the only permanent solution to getting rid of these type of veins is surgery, but that is not something I wanted to do.  I tried this product, and at last, the product worked, and it lasts for quite a while.  Finally!</li>
    <li> I am proud of myself for stepping outside of my comfort zone and trying a product that I was kind of on the negative side about.  I must say that it has been a joy to use this product and reap in the sweet rewards and benefits of being free from varicose veins.</li>
    <li> Undoubtedly i am convinced that this product has saved me from the unbearable pain I always fell on my feet. i have done everything including visiting the doctors office but nothing worked until I discovered varidux. I love this product and glad I found it. It has made significant difference in my life</li>
    <li> Although I have just started taking these.... I believe I can see and feel somewhat less noticeable spider veins... we will see if that improves over the first month of taking these tablets.</li>
    <li> got this for my wife, she has had leg problems with a lot of pain associated with it. she&#x27;s only been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now and has noticed a big improvement, better circulation and a lot less pain. have already ordered another bottle and plan to keep ordering. we highly  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works better than the prescription my doctor gave me for my varicose veins.  I couldn’t deal with the pain and swelling, but this product took all of that away, and now I can complete my household chores without it taking me all day to complete.  This product helped me a lot.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for a month, but I haven&#x27;t seen, or felt much of a difference.  I will try for the next two months to see if there is any improvement.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased these before seeing the 1-star rating that someone left.  It probably would have made me not order them.  I am only on my 4th day and I can&#x27;t quite review about any veins disappearing, but as far as the pain goes...OMG, these have helped so much.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t take any veins away, I am hoping that it will stop more from coming.  I will update if need be:)</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Still not go to talk much about the product. I have a few days that I am using. I believe that to have results will have to use longer. I noticed a slight improvement as it is appearing less purple bruises on my legs.</li>
    <li> my circulation has improved greatly and the swelling of the legs also decreased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 4 kids, in very good shape, exercising 5 times a week. For some weird reason I have been seeing varicose veins for about a year. My veins are beginning to appear very noticeable and specially painful at night. It&#x27;s been very hard for me to sleep comfortably lately, I move my legs up and down and sideways all the time. So trying to find products for varicose veins, I came across with this product, and I have to say that my legs felt relieved almost immediately. My legs are not hurting anymore! I was still a little skeptical and after a couple of weeks, I decided to stop this product for a while, but sure enough, the pain came back. So I guess, I will keep taking this product going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not give Varidux 5 stars for 2 reasons: 1) The capsules are big!... and even though they are not very hard to swallow, they are still a pain. (by the way... the dose is 2 pills!! ... which obviously I don&#x27;t like)&lt;br /&gt;2) I have not seen any improvement in the appearance of my varicose veins. They have taken the pain away but my legs don&#x27;t look any better.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a natural way to relieve the pain and improve circulation, this is for you, but it might not work for you to make the veins disappear.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but this product changed my life.  I am 38 years old with 4 kids. My last two kids I had later in life which has put my body through major changes.  I work 8 to 13 hours a day running literally.  According to my step tracker I average 5 miles +.  My legs would be so swollen and ache so badly when I got home and the pain made things hard for me like cooking,  laundry and honestly being the mother I needed to be. When I started taking these,  within first week I began to feel and see a difference.  Now my legs NEVER hurt and no swelling!  I have very bad spider veins and I&#x27;ve seen a improvement on their appearance.  They ,for the very first time, are not worse but better! ! If you live this life then remember your worth $30 if you can feel and look better.  Now I can go go go! Love these Supplements!</li>
    <li> I suffered from terrible and painful spider veins for many years before I found this product.  Varidux took my spider veins and made them disappear!  No more pain, no more scars, just beautiful skin.  I can say that I am extremely pleased with the way my legs look.  I used to be ashamed to take pictures, but now I am as photogenic as they come!</li>
    <li> This product is a winner in my book.  This isn’t a scam or a joke.  I was a little on the skeptical side, but I wanted my veins gone for good, so I tried this product.  No longer am I a skeptic because it works!  This product will always be #1 for me.  You should try it and see how great it makes you feel about yourself.  You will never want to use another product for varicose veins.</li>
    <li> I loved every part of my body until varicose veins showed up at the party.  I was so ashamed.  I was young when they appeared, and I was under the impression that only elderly people go them.  When they appeared on my legs, I was terrified.  Luckily, I tried this product, and the creepy spider veins are gone.  I now love my legs and every inch of my body.  I can’t wait to schedule a photo shoot in honor of my varicose veins not being a factor anymore.</li>
    <li> I wasn’t looking for this product to do much for me, but to my surprise, it did everything I needed and wanted it to do.  I was in the best mood of my life and I noticed that my blood was circulating better to my legs and throughout my body.  I wasn’t ready for this surprise, but I’m thankful for it.  I can now throw my stockings in the drawer and leave them there!  I don’t have to cover up my legs anymore and be conscience about the people around me and wonder if they are staring at me.  What a pleasantly shocking surprise.</li>
    <li> Just as a warning to Amazon customers-  if you look closer at all those who gave this product 5-star reviews-  they also happened to give 5-star reviews to a bunch of similar products, all probably from the same manufacturer.  So I would likely guess they were paid to do so.  I have become much more savvy about purchasing based on reviews now.</li>
    <li> I could cry!  I can’t believe I actually found a product that could help me with the pain and suffering I was dealing with.  Some days I didn’t want to get out of my bed because of the pain, but now, I can dance, jump out of bed, and do all of my household chores without being in agonizing pain.</li>
