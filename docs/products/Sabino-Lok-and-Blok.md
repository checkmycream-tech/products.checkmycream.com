### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I did not listen to  some of the reviews on this product!</li>
      <li>The best product was the Kerastase Oleo Relax.</li>
      <li>this is one of the best products I have tried, it is a keeper.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome!</li>
      <li>A humid, rainy day in Florida is the perfect test day for Lok Blok.  </li>
      <li>With this Moisture Block, my hair stays perfect looking for three to four days.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very impressed with both the product and the company who manufactures it.</li>
      <li>This is the best product on planet earth for curly hair.</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considering straying away from the instructions and finding another method of application that works best with my hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Lok &amp; Blok and received it the day before Thanksgiving which was the perfect time to see if the product would do what it claimed to do since it was supposed to be a rainy day.</li>
      <li>Otherwise,it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good match for the Texas humidity!</li>
      <li>I knew the product would be great.  </li>
      <li>Great product, one bottle lasted me for over a year.</li>
      <li>Sabino Lok and Blok had great reviews.</li>
      <li>(It works great on my niece&#x27;s hair, though.)</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!</li>
      <li>If you follow the enclose instructions its outstanding!!</li>
      <li>But the product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for more than 5 years and it&#x27;s the best for my type of hair (fuzzy and curly)</li>
      <li>I loved it but after a year of use, my hair is in rotten shape.</li>
      <li>The product is really good for straightening hair and it leaves a nice shine.</li>
      <li>Smooths even the most dryest and frizziest hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazingly, my hair is like relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Whereas before, humidity would cause frizzies, Lok and Blok effectively blocks out moisture so that your hair holds a set for days.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely the best for curly, frizz prone hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read all the reviews listed and felt inclined to write my own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a special night INDOORS.  </li>
      <li>My new best friend!!</li>
      <li>The sabino Lok&amp;blok is by far the best if you want to block out humidity on your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and healthy looking and NO FRIZZ!  </li>
      <li>I may then just straighten the roots to give my hair more lift and body and movement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Still, when I left the house, my hair looked perfect.</li>
      <li>Today, I think it was even more humid.  </li>
      <li>Adorable bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have used Frizz Ease, Bed Head and Moroccan Oil with much better results, and without that weighed-down feeling.  </li>
      <li>I ordered one of each just to be safe.</li>
      <li>and I am so pleased.  </li>
      <li>My first time not as good, but now I&#x27;ve got the amount for my hair down and results are good!</li>
      <li>Although I have tried a range of straitening serums and pressing cremes, Sabino Lok and Blok is the most effective for course, curly, natural African-American hair.  </li>
      <li>So I emailed the company and they are going to replace it for me free of charge, thank goodness.</li>
      <li>I wish the product were available in stores</li>
      <li>I will preface this by saying that this product was given to me for free, by my stepmom.  </li>
      <li>love this product, in fact, I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle right now.</li>
      <li>it does EXACTLY as claimed!!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product for your hair - I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
      <li>This stuff has significantly reduced my frizziness and protects my hair from the humidity.  </li>
      <li>Please note that I have not received the original</li>
      <li>This is the original Moisture Block.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product at Ulta.. and could no longer find it.</li>
      <li>Im so excited about this product.</li>
      <li>need to clarify to really clean the hair.</li>
      <li>Clean hair allows water into the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>thanks to Sabino its manageable!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
      <li>Ive never been able to go 5 days with bone straight hair.</li>
      <li>straight, shiny and healthy...</li>
      <li>When I first began researching hair straighteners, I concentrated on those with high ratings, of course, and those that mentioned something about being effective even in humid/moist conditions.</li>
      <li>A previous stylist favored the product, but I never purchased it.</li>
      <li>It will hold up to a fun night on the dance floor or even through a workout at the gym</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about this because I did not get the greatest results with the original formula</li>
      <li>Just if you are using only natural shampoos you will need to do about five or six good washes to get the hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>You do have to find a decent shampoo to clean the sabino out of the hair at each wash.</li>
      <li>It is super light and it leaves your hair very silky without weighing it down (AT ALL), which is more than I can say for Lok and Blok.</li>
      <li>It offers EXCELLENT protection against heat (flat iron, blow dry) and humidity too.</li>
      <li>I used the product exactly as the instuctions told me to.</li>
      <li>I apply it to my ends first then rub the remainder through the rest of my hair.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will:  block humidity from hair.  </li>
      <li>and it actually frizzed more.  </li>
      <li>I used the Lok &amp; Blok exactly as directed</li>
      <li>Love that it has only 2 products, dimethicone and cimethicone.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, when I walk outside for more than 10 minutes, the product does not hold up to Texas humidity.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY</li>
      <li>It just seems like no matter what quantity I use, I need to scale it back more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for 7 months now.</li>
      <li>I began searching for a product that would hold up to hot, steamy climates.</li>
      <li>I slept through the hot, sweaty night and when I woke up...</li>
      <li>The hair is movable, soft, frizz free, stays straight or curly for days and blocks</li>
      <li>but most of the time I flat iron it straight.  </li>
      <li>I used this product the first day that is arrived and was satisfied at the initial results, but then my hair automatically reverted since I live in rainy Portland, Oregon.</li>
      <li>I used this item as directed and it made my hair look even MORE dry and frizzy than before.</li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and feels super soft the whole time.  </li>
      <li>My hair is to fine for 450 but 400 and one pass through left me with silky straight MOVABLE hair.</li>
      <li>it (fog, mist, humidity) and the chemically treated portion is still bone straight and the roots are beaded up like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still trying to gauge how much of this product to use on my hair.</li>
      <li>The company is very helpful if you can&#x27;t figure out how to use it; Victor Sabino himself will talk you through it.  </li>
      <li>And so the hunt continues for a straightening product that really is humidity/moisture proof, to keep curly hair straight all day...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been a struggle to keep my hair straight in humid weather.</li>
      <li>We visited several family members that day and it was light rain all day.</li>
      <li>Bone straight hair.</li>
      <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>shiney, healthy looking and dead straight!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving the product two stars because it did make my hair easier to blowdry straight, and I was able to do it in less time.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty curly naturally</li>
      <li>I waited until after my first wash to give a review because I wanted to see first if there was heat damage and second how the product washed out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I am comfortable with wearing it loose, not in a pony tail.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a must have along with Avlon hair wax stick. Smooths even the most dryest and frizziest hair! Love that it has only 2 products, dimethicone and cimethicone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I did not listen to  some of the reviews on this product! This is one product you just have to try for yourself. Just make sure you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!! If you follow the enclose instructions its outstanding!! Ive never been able to go 5 days with bone straight hair. It would have stayed that way longer except it was dirty by the fifth day. For those that like to stretch their hair washings, and not use heat everyday this stuff is it!! I live in foggy Daly City, CA it withstood all the fog and mist!! Bone straight hair. I even moisturized every night with my aloe vera juice mixture which is watery consistency... no reversion!! I only used 400 degrees! Anything less and the product will not work! It is true the heat pushes the product into the hair, anything less and your wasting your time! Its designed to be used with heat! My hair is to fine for 450 but 400 and one pass through left me with silky straight MOVABLE hair. I was under the impression it would weigh it down, but that&#x27;s not the case! I waited until after my first wash to give a review because I wanted to see first if there was heat damage and second how the product washed out of my hair. I dont use sulfate shampoos. The brand I used removed all the product. Just if you are using only natural shampoos you will need to do about five or six good washes to get the hair squeaky clean. But the product is amazing! I have 3a 3b natural hair. No complaints! My new best friend!!</li>
    <li> When I first began researching hair straighteners, I concentrated on those with high ratings, of course, and those that mentioned something about being effective even in humid/moist conditions. I came across Sabino on several websites and saw that there is an original version and a new version (with two extra ingredients) called Lok and Blok. I ordered one of each just to be safe. Please note that I have not received the original but I did receive and use the Lok and Blok (from official website). I tried it following the directions exactly and even tried several different ways of using it just to be sure that I was using it every which way possible. I read reviews where a consumer with used the product, blow-dried and ironed her hair and then went into humid conditions on purpose (sweat/workout, shower steam) and her curly hair did not revert back to its natural state.     I have 3C hair and am in the process of growing out my chemically relaxed hair, with about 2 inches of new, curly roots. You can imagine how my hair must look when a little moisture hits it (fog, mist, humidity) and the chemically treated portion is still bone straight and the roots are beaded up like nobody&#x27;s business. THIS STUFF DID NOTHING FOR MY HAIR THAT I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. I&#x27;ve tried Alterna hemp straightening balm, Chi straigtening cream, Chi silk, Silk Strate, and Kerastase Oleo Relax. Of all of those, Lok and Blok is the thickest, but as soon as I hit the streets to battle NYC heat/humidity, my curly roots made an appearance. The best product was the Kerastase Oleo Relax. It is super light and it leaves your hair very silky without weighing it down (AT ALL), which is more than I can say for Lok and Blok. The KOR is not designed to fight humidity but I had better results than when I used L&amp;B.     Maybe the L&amp;B&#x27;s two new ingredients are making the new version less effective, but if I have different results when I receive the original version (whichis almost 3 weeks late), then I will repost.     I&#x27;m giving the product two stars because it did make my hair easier to blowdry straight, and I was able to do it in less time. It did, however, revert with the slightest moisture. If the product is supposed to block moisture, I&#x27;m telling you that it did not deliver in my case. If it is supposed to keep hair straight until your next wash, even in humidity, I&#x27;m telling you the product did not deliver.     And so the hunt continues for a straightening product that really is humidity/moisture proof, to keep curly hair straight all day...</li>
    <li> My niece recommended it. I loved it but after a year of use, my hair is in rotten shape. I toook a while before I narrowed down the reason.  My hair became very dry and brittle and would break with a touch, so imagine what happened when I used a come or brush.  By the time I narrowed down the cause, I had 2-3 inches of breakage loss.  I hair is permed so I thought it was because this product is geared to natural hair uses but received a call from my niece who recommended product and she is having the sames issues.  She has not permed in years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  John Frieda did absolutely nothing for my hair but dry it out and it actually frizzed more.  I used the Lok &amp; Blok exactly as directed and I am so pleased.  My hair is smooth and healthy looking and NO FRIZZ!  The humidity was super high here the last few days.  Yesterday I styled my hair and within 5 minutes of being outside, it frizzed and I had to put it in a bushy ponytail.  Today, I think it was even more humid.  I went outside after styling with Lok &amp; Blok and it stayed exactly how I styled it.  I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> One of the new stylists in my brother-in-law&#x27;s salon recommended this product to him. Me being a product junkie, I HAD to try it. I began transitioning from relaxers 2 years ago and it&#x27;s been a struggle to keep my hair straight in humid weather. I ordered the Lok &amp; Blok and received it the day before Thanksgiving which was the perfect time to see if the product would do what it claimed to do since it was supposed to be a rainy day. We visited several family members that day and it was light rain all day. I was in and out of the car several times WITH NO UMBRELLA and my hair did not frizz a single bit. I recommend this product to everyone and not one person who&#x27;s tried it has been disappointed. The only time it&#x27;s ever failed me was really my fault because I was still using the same amount as when I first bought it and my hair has grown a bit so I had to increase the amount of product I put on my hair. My routine literally consists of 3 products. I use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (which I&#x27;ll not name since this is Sabino&#x27;s page) and my lok &amp; blok. I add nothing else to my hair. It&#x27;s totally worth the price. I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for 7 months now. And I shampoo 1-2x per week. I&#x27;m only ordering a new bottle now so I can give the remainder of my current bottle to my niece. Great product. I hope it never goes off the market.</li>
    <li> It has been over six months since I last relaxed my hair; I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from chemicals. Although my hair is long, for some reason, it has been thinning for the past 2 1/2 years. The dermatologists don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;ve been very uncomfortable with wearing it down because it is so thin. I can only get it thick by wearing it natural. However, I like to comb my hair throughout the day. I can&#x27;t do this going natural. Therefore, I flat iron it. I had been using Etae products, but I prefer my hair a little less oily. Also, Etae doesn&#x27;t help me with humidity. (It works great on my niece&#x27;s hair, though.) I began searching for a product that would hold up to hot, steamy climates. Sabino Lok and Blok had great reviews. I tried it and like it. Amazingly, my hair is like relaxed hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other oils that I have used. Now, my hair appears thicker. I am comfortable with wearing it loose, not in a pony tail. I will do an update, if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> The sabino Lok&amp;blok is by far the best if you want to block out humidity on your hair. I was skeptical about this because I did not get the greatest results with the original formula but this one seems to do the trick. I am able to straighten out my hair and it last without the sweat or humidity destroying my style. it also does what it saids it blocks in the moisture your hair has. I deep condition and them apply a little moisturizer and I put my lok &amp; blok on the hair and the hair feels so soft and moisturized, don&#x27;t have to apply anything else to my hair for a few days. this is one of the best products I have tried, it is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Although I have tried a range of straitening serums and pressing cremes, Sabino Lok and Blok is the most effective for course, curly, natural African-American hair.  Only a little is needed in order to achieve a silky, satiny press.  After applying the product on clean, dry hair, I use a pressing comb or flat iron.  Not only does the serum impart a bone-straight effect, it also leaves a shiny finish that gives that \\&quot;just walked out of the salon\\&quot; look.  I have used this product on my natural hair as well as on my daughter&#x27;s.  Whereas before, humidity would cause frizzies, Lok and Blok effectively blocks out moisture so that your hair holds a set for days. I wish the product were available in stores and I hope Lok and Blok is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> I used this item as directed and it made my hair look even MORE dry and frizzy than before. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I will preface this by saying that this product was given to me for free, by my stepmom.  She has thinner hair than I do, and said that she didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the product.  I have curly/wavy hair that I either straighten with an iron, or blow dry with a round brush.  I had read about Lok Blok and decided to give it a shot.  I typically use John Frieda Frizz Ease 3-Day-Straight, which does wonders for my hair, along with \\&quot;It&#x27;s A 10\\&quot; leave-in conditioner.  Both products are $6 and $20, respectively.  A humid, rainy day in Florida is the perfect test day for Lok Blok.  I did just as the directions said, and straightened my hair with my CHI 2\\&quot; flat iron.  The consistency of this product is a little thick and weighed my hair down.  Still, when I left the house, my hair looked perfect. However, when I got out of the car and just during the short walk from the parking lot to the office, my hair immediately began to curl and frizz.  It wasn&#x27;t even raining!  I went out over my lunch hour and it was sprinkling, so I used my umbrella.  I caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror and was horrified!  It looked like I hadn&#x27;t straightened it at all!  Not to mention that it felt greasy and weighed down, though it didn&#x27;t look that way.  My advice?  Forget spending $20 on this product. I have used Frizz Ease, Bed Head and Moroccan Oil with much better results, and without that weighed-down feeling.  Remember, this review is coming from someone in Florida, heat and humidity capital of the country!</li>
    <li> This is the original Moisture Block.  I am mixed race--black and white.  I haven&#x27;t relaxed my hair in over five years, so it&#x27;s all natural.  My hair is pretty curly naturally but most of the time I flat iron it straight.  The problem would be, I would flat iron it, it would look awesome and then an hour later it would be a frizzy mess; especially the ends.  With this Moisture Block, my hair stays perfect looking for three to four days.  This is after daily workouts, humid weather, rain, and sex!  My hair looks shiny and feels super soft the whole time.  It&#x27;s like a miracle!  Seriously, this is the first time something has worked so well for my hair.  I wash my hair and put a dime sized amount of product on my hands.  I apply it to my ends first then rub the remainder through the rest of my hair.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to gauge how much of this product to use on my hair. It just seems like no matter what quantity I use, I need to scale it back more. It offers EXCELLENT protection against heat (flat iron, blow dry) and humidity too. The other day I was assisting my youngest with her shower and some of the water from the shower head made contact with my hair. After toweling my hair there was a slight curl to it which was gone after a very quick touch up with the straighter/flat iron.  The problem I have with this product is that it is heavy on my hair. Even though my hair shines like glass and feels silky to the touch, it is clumpy and has very little life to it. I&#x27;m considering straying away from the instructions and finding another method of application that works best with my hair. (Type 3C)</li>
    <li> I have been using Sabino for several months. My hair&#x27;s roots are natural and the ends are relaxed. I purchased the product to use during my transition to natural hair.  The product is really good for straightening hair and it leaves a nice shine. HOWEVER, when I walk outside for more than 10 minutes, the product does not hold up to Texas humidity. I even purchased the flat iron from the Sabino site.  I did exactly as the instructions suggested and even turned up the flat iron to the recommended temperature.  Within 10 minutes of being outside in the humidity, my natural hair was completely kinky again and the relaxed portion was very frizzy.  It&#x27;s a great product for a special night INDOORS.  It will hold up to a fun night on the dance floor or even through a workout at the gym so you don&#x27;t leave the gym looking crazy. Otherwise,it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good match for the Texas humidity!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews listed and felt inclined to write my own. This product is AMAZING!!! I have 3c curly hair and have been in the battle of attempting to make it straight and humid resistant for the past 15 years or so. I thought I&#x27;d never win the battle with humidity. This product is everything I ever have been hoping for. I used the product exactly as the instuctions told me to. The result, my hair came out shiney, healthy looking and dead straight! Almost too dead straight (if there even is such a thing). I usually wrap my hair before going to bed and the first night I used this product I went to a party and came home too drunk to wrap before bed. I slept through the hot, sweaty night and when I woke up...yup..you guessed it...my hair was still dead straight. Im so excited about this product. Finally. Finally. I have won the war against humidity. Thank you Sabino!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is really thick and wavy so frizziness is a part of the package.  This stuff has significantly reduced my frizziness and protects my hair from the humidity.  Before, after blowing dry my hair and straightening it for close to a combined hour, I would walk into work and spy my hair in a window reflection looking like a lion&#x27;s mane.  All my hard work gone in a matter of 2 minutes.  This stuff protects against that.  Be mindful though that you do NOT need more than a nickel sized amount (for thick, wavy long hair) and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent (so get some pretty smelling shampoo).  I only gave it 4 stars because I am still working out the exact amount that works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on planet earth for curly hair. There&#x27;s no need for any additional products unless you like finishing sprays</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for your hair - I can&#x27;t live without it!  Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I used the old version and this, the new one for about 2 years now.  It does exactly what it says it will:  block humidity from hair.  I&#x27;m really surprised with the poor reviews here.  I think the thing with this product is you have to follow the directions EXACTLY or you don&#x27;t get the results promised.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you get it right, you can&#x27;t live without it.  I have very thick curly hair that I flat iron straight.  This stuff keeps my hair stick straight, shiny and healthy...even on 90 degree rainy days.  The company is very helpful if you can&#x27;t figure out how to use it; Victor Sabino himself will talk you through it.  All in all, I&#x27;m very impressed with both the product and the company who manufactures it.</li>
    <li> I knew the product would be great.  I have similar products which are too heavy for long fine hair.  This doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  A previous stylist favored the product, but I never purchased it.</li>
    <li> There are no instructions on how to use this product!!  Wet or dry hair?  Adorable bottle.  Was this an omission?</li>
    <li> Ugh.  Talk about block.  What a greasy blockage on my head!  It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Yeah I have to agree with a comment made regarding a 1 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarification is the answer. You do have to find a decent shampoo to clean the sabino out of the hair at each wash. I&#x27;ve been using Sabino  for about 3 years now and still have long hair down to my bra strap! However I discovered that  that if I don&#x27;t shampoo properly it can feel dry.  And this is the reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to clarify to really clean the hair. Clean hair allows water into the hair shaft. Sabino only works when it has a layer of water for it to trap. [that magical 11% that Sabino talk about]So if the hair isn&#x27;t clarified and subsequently  blocked by old Sabino [or any other silicone product that you may have used] this nourishing water layer isn&#x27;t let in then you get dry feeling hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash once a week clarify each time and do a deep palm oil moisture condition each and EVERY time. The key is to use any conditioner or shampoo that DOES NOT have silicone in it or else you will get build up + water will not penetrate the hair shaft properly when you wash it. It is the build up that is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I don&#x27;t even straighten my hair using irons all the time I just use the sabino, comb through  and put in a French plait. I then just curl the end of the plait. That way when Its dry it comes out in silky loose  waves. I may then just straighten the roots to give my hair more lift and body and movement.&lt;br /&gt;I had very thick long hair when I started using Sabino and I&#x27;ve still got long thick curly hair, but thanks to Sabino its manageable!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> this stuff is a LIFE SAVER for Naturally curly/frizzy hair!! I originally purchased this product at Ulta.. and could no longer find it. I highly recommend going to YouTube to check out their vid on the product demo... it does EXACTLY as claimed!! Cant beat it!!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely the best for curly, frizz prone hair. I could not find it anywhere for purchase. Did not rate 5 stars since I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to decide if it is the same formula as the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Moisture block since it seems thinner.</li>
    <li> Great product, one bottle lasted me for over a year. The hair is movable, soft, frizz free, stays straight or curly for days and blocks humidity!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, in fact, I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle right now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten keratin treatments but they don&#x27;t last long enough! I was in the misty rain last weekend and my hair didn&#x27;t frizz and barely moved. This product is awesome! There is a learning curve on how to use. My first time not as good, but now I&#x27;ve got the amount for my hair down and results are good!</li>
    <li> I used this product the first day that is arrived and was satisfied at the initial results, but then my hair automatically reverted since I live in rainy Portland, Oregon. Anyway, I decided to go on youtube to see other people&#x27;s results and found out this isn&#x27;t even the original formula. IT&#x27;S A KNOCK-OFF!!! So I emailed the company and they are going to replace it for me free of charge, thank goodness. I don&#x27;t want this to happen to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 5 years and it&#x27;s the best for my type of hair (fuzzy and curly)</li>
