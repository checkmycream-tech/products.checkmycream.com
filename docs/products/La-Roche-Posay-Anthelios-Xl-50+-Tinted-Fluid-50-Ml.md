<ol>
      <li>No US sunscreen comes close to this level of uva screening, with at best a ppd of 15 sold in states.</li>

      <li>This Anthelios product is wonderful for the face.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with it and will continue to use it, but it can be greasy.</li>
      <li>excellent product by La Roche-Posay  </li>
      <li>This product is the best of the best and it blends wonderfully with my fair skin.  </li>

      <li>Great to wear in summer time while doing outdoors workout.</li>
      <li>If it were more matte, then this could be the best sunblock on the planet.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is perfectly tinted for my olive skin and gives me a warm color, so that I can just use mineral veil powder on top.</li>
      <li>Provides great coverage and goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>This is tinted to match your skin and will match most very nicely.  </li>
      <li>I may still have laser treatment, but for sure I will always use this product, and avoid the sun like Edward Cullen!</li>
      <li>The light tint gives a nice healthy glow to fair skin tone without looking like makeup</li>
      <li>But this works and feels very light weight.</li>
      <li>It goes very light and does not make my face oily.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens on my face</li>
      <li>but I find most of them are too greasy.</li>
      <li>but you must try it :)</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products for sun protection.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the La Roche Posay 50 tinted sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and this sunscreen makes the oilier parts break out especially in hot and humid weather.  </li>
      <li>So glad I decided to splurge on this over-expensive product.</li>
      <li>and I have tried too many to keep count (embarassingly).</li>
      <li>I apply my daily SPF 15 under it, it is so wonderful</li>
      <li>There is NO SHINE or GREASY sheen on my skin, which I love.</li>
      <li>Best facial sunscreen I have ever used</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the best sunblocks available.</li>
      <li>Porduct was as described and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It gives me a nice color, protection,  and allow my skin to breath under the hot climate.  </li>
      <li>The tinted fluid melts right into your skin - excellent for people who have more oily skin, but not so great for people, like me, who have fairly dry skin.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen looks fine on my face despite the discrepancy in tone between me and it.</li>
      <li>The drier spots on my face were fine.  </li>
      <li>Overall Im happy with this product</li>
      <li>Perfect for wearing everyday to work or going to the pool.  </li>
      <li>Light formula and non greasy..feels like a BB or CC cream.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your trip.</li>
      <li>The coverage is very light, but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation feeling, this is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>The texture is super light and feels like nothing on the skin.</li>
      <li>The product does a nice job covering skin imperfections with a very natural finish...</li>
      <li>She was right on!  </li>
      <li>Your face won&#x27;t look oily, and I love the natural color because it works as light make up.</li>
      <li>My derm highly recommended this brand of sunscreen and encouraged me to search Amazon for a better deal.  </li>
      <li>but i started mixing it with a pore refining shine free lotion from Dr Brandt and that goes pretty well.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this, I have super sensitive skin that just hates the sun</li>
      <li>The price is well worth the product.</li>
      <li>Love the natural tint.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d consider it as close to an ideal facial sunscreen as I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of different ones.</li>
      <li>This product is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is recommended by all dermatologists and THIS particular line of La Roche Posay is fantastic for someone traveling and or sightseeing who does not want greasy globs of sunscreen to blend in.  </li>
      <li>Provides light coverage, its amazing i wear it everyday</li>
      <li>I used it on the top of my regular routine skin care, and touch up during the day, like one time around 11:00 am, then reapply at 4:00 pm.  </li>
      <li>looks natural and gives light cover .  </li>
      <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>This guy didn&#x27;t do anything of the sort even after a scorching hot day.</li>
      <li>, now it looks clear and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good sunscreen - thin and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it is to liquid and does not cover properly, I know it is a good product, but this is not  my standard</li>
      <li>took off a star because the tint/coverage is pretty much nonexistent.</li>
      <li>This has a very high uva protection factor at ppd 34.</li>
      <li>The product arrived within a reasonable time.</li>
      <li>I do think it gives a bit too much shine</li>
      <li>It stays well put on the face unless you are really exerting/sweating.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Although it feel light but enough to protect me from dryness and sun damage.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>This will certainly not substitute for foundation, or even offer the cosmetic coverage of most tinted moisturizers.</li>
      <li>The only problem with it is that the liquid is so light and fluid, it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin so quickly that you wonder if you&#x27;re using enough of it to sufficiently cover the face.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for those with oily skin, as compared to La Roche-Posay&#x27;s other tinted sunscreen, Anthelios XL SPF 50+ Tinted Melt-in Cream (which I&#x27;d recommend to those with dry to normal complexions).</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love la roche posay anthelios products and usually use the spf 50 tinted cream.</li>
      <li>I am going to try the tinted cream next time to see if it is a little more matte but</li>
      <li>It gives a much more matte result than the cream versions, but expect to get a little shiny in the face, especially if you reapply throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I go ( I travel frequently)</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of sunscreens because I have had 3 MOHs surgeries on my face from early years on the beach and abusing my skin in the sun.  </li>
      <li>I have combo skin, with real greasies in t-zone, but no increase in oiliness and moiturizes where my face can be dry.</li>
      <li>I blend through throat and decolletage and it just barely tints my skin.</li>
      <li>I live in California now and have had to change a few products from the PNW weather I used to live in.</li>
      <li>I have melasma (dark spots) on my nose, I needed a high SPF sunscreen and I wanted a tinted version.</li>

<li> Isn&#x27;t oily or makes me look pasty like other sunscreens.</li>
<li> The tint is a medium tan shade, with a slightly pinkish undertone.</li>
<li> Give it a few minutes to sink in.</li>

<li> I tried using it few times during summer and ended up with inflamed forehead.  </li>
<li> Looks like I now have 2 versions of sunscreen I can only use in cold weather months.</li>
<li> Over 50, and  tired of sun spot on cheeks under eyes....</li>
<li> In humid climates I would probably hate it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best facial sunscreen I have ever used and I have tried too many to keep count (embarassingly). Blends seamlessly, no white chalky cast to it. I have combo skin, with real greasies in t-zone, but no increase in oiliness and moiturizes where my face can be dry. It one of those products you hope will never get discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for those with oily skin, as compared to La Roche-Posay&#x27;s other tinted sunscreen, Anthelios XL SPF 50+ Tinted Melt-in Cream (which I&#x27;d recommend to those with dry to normal complexions). The only problem with it is that the liquid is so light and fluid, it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin so quickly that you wonder if you&#x27;re using enough of it to sufficiently cover the face. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend it. It has powerful sunscreens, but it&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, and it has just enough tint to even out your skin tone without giving you an artificial, \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; look. I&#x27;d consider it as close to an ideal facial sunscreen as I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of different ones.</li>
    <li> Use it instead of foundation for ultimate sun protention, feels like silk on your skin. Provides light coverage, its amazing i wear it everyday</li>
    <li> I love la roche posay anthelios products and usually use the spf 50 tinted cream. But, being a product junkie, I wanted to see what the tinted fluid was all about. The tinted fluid melts right into your skin - excellent for people who have more oily skin, but not so great for people, like me, who have fairly dry skin. The coverage is very light, but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation feeling, this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I have melasma (dark spots) on my nose, I needed a high SPF sunscreen and I wanted a tinted version. I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens on my face but I find most of them are too greasy. \\&quot;La Roche Posay Anthelios Xl 50+ Tinted Fluid\\&quot; is not greasy, I do like the color of the tint as well, it blends well into my skin. With shipping I paid a total of $25 and I think this product is enough to last me through the summer. Overall Im happy with this product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My derm highly recommended this brand of sunscreen and encouraged me to search Amazon for a better deal.  She was right on!  The sunscreen is perfectly tinted for my olive skin and gives me a warm color, so that I can just use mineral veil powder on top. There is NO SHINE or GREASY sheen on my skin, which I love. I wear it all over my face, neck and decolletage.   I will always buy this brand of sunscreen!</li>
    <li> excellent product by La Roche-Posay  Anthelios XL  non perfume  Paraben-free  tinted moisturizer and bonus ! water resistent!  it is 50+ SPF  UVB &amp; UVA  I take it everywhere I go ( I travel frequently) container is 50 ml which is great for travel as well.  looks natural and gives light cover .  definitely recommend to people who like quality products that work.</li>
    <li> it is to liquid and does not cover properly, I know it is a good product, but this is not  my standard</li>
    <li> Porduct was as described and is easy to use.  The product arrived within a reasonable time. I would use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This Anthelios product is wonderful for the face. Love the natural tint. Quality SPF was approved by my dermatologist. Will buy more in the future. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very fluid.  Felt like I didn&#x27;t have anything on my face, but made my skin look even and beautiful with great protection.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t oily or makes me look pasty like other sunscreens. I hope they never stop making this!! I have Melasma and it has helped keep it away.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of sunscreens because I have had 3 MOHs surgeries on my face from early years on the beach and abusing my skin in the sun.  This product is the best of the best and it blends wonderfully with my fair skin.  The only one I will use from now on!</li>
    <li> Although it feel light but enough to protect me from dryness and sun damage.  I traveled to highland, above sea level 3750 Meter and came back without any trace of sun tan, a must have for travel.  I bought it somewhere costed me $50.00.  I used it on the top of my regular routine skin care, and touch up during the day, like one time around 11:00 am, then reapply at 4:00 pm.  It gives me a nice color, protection,  and allow my skin to breath under the hot climate.  So if you have dry skin, you still use your regular cream under it.  I apply my daily SPF 15 under it, it is so wonderful, I just would like to share with it with everybody.  Enjoy your trip.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, I have super sensitive skin that just hates the sun and I have tried everything, either the sun got through or it gave me a rash.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t run and get in my eyes like everything else and i have not gotten one sunburn or reaction to the sun in the months I have been using. I do think it gives a bit too much shine but i started mixing it with a pore refining shine free lotion from Dr Brandt and that goes pretty well. I wish they had different shades, my skin is ultra pale and this is a bit too dark/orangey. I am going to try the tinted cream next time to see if it is a little more matte but either way i will probably use this brand for the rest of my life..</li>
    <li> This has a very high uva protection factor at ppd 34. The texture is super light and feels like nothing on the skin. It will not make your skin greasy, shiny or sticky. It will not leave a white cast to the complexion. The tint is a medium tan shade, with a slightly pinkish undertone. I am fair-med in hue with a yellow undertone. This sunscreen looks fine on my face despite the discrepancy in tone between me and it. I blend through throat and decolletage and it just barely tints my skin. If I was to use self tanner or have a tan, it would totally disappear. This will certainly not substitute for foundation, or even offer the cosmetic coverage of most tinted moisturizers. It stays well put on the face unless you are really exerting/sweating. The price is well worth the product. No US sunscreen comes close to this level of uva screening, with at best a ppd of 15 sold in states.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the La Roche Posay 50 tinted sunscreen. Provides great coverage and goes on very smooth. The product does a nice job covering skin imperfections with a very natural finish...Thanks.</li>
    <li> The light tint gives a nice healthy glow to fair skin tone without looking like makeup but I wish the constancy was thicker and easier to apply. I like the regular lotion with SPF 55 or something. It has a nicer consistency. But this works and feels very light weight. Give it a few minutes to sink in. In humid climates I would probably hate it. I live in California now and have had to change a few products from the PNW weather I used to live in.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money.  A little goes a long way.  The product blends well with skin tone and is not greasy at all.  Perfect for wearing everyday to work or going to the pool.  I have used it while being outside in 100 degree weather at the pool and beach all day, and I never burn on my face.  It prevents that leathery look you get from sun exposure.  I absolutely love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a beautician while i was overseas...Back home I search amazon.  I have been using the product for the last year, every morning and I have notice a big improvement on my skin, now it looks clear and smooth.  Definitely I will recommended it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen - thin and easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t make me shiny which is great!&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because the tint/coverage is pretty much nonexistent. If you&#x27;re looking to even out your skin tone with this, I&#x27;d look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Very good protection, but if you sweat a lot, remember to reapply.  I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with it, only use this and mineral powder.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products for sun protection. It goes very light and does not make my face oily. Great to wear in summer time while doing outdoors workout.</li>
    <li> Well, tossing this into the trash. I am a 40 yo with combination skin that still breaks out. I had 3 zits this morning- now? I&#x27;m covered. So glad I decided to splurge on this over-expensive product.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this sunscreen makes the oilier parts break out especially in hot and humid weather.  I tried using it few times during summer and ended up with inflamed forehead.  It was covered in red bumps for few days.  The drier spots on my face were fine.  I specifically bought this sunscreen to use in hotter weather because it&#x27;s lighter than Anthelios melt-in version which I use in the winter.  Looks like I now have 2 versions of sunscreen I can only use in cold weather months.</li>
    <li> Your face won&#x27;t look oily, and I love the natural color because it works as light make up. I don&#x27;t like the price and that is why I don&#x27;t buy it as often as I would like to do it but you must try it :)</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is recommended by all dermatologists and THIS particular line of La Roche Posay is fantastic for someone traveling and or sightseeing who does not want greasy globs of sunscreen to blend in.  This is tinted to match your skin and will match most very nicely.  Light formula and non greasy..feels like a BB or CC cream.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this guy was tinted, but still used it. Works great and it didn&#x27;t cause any changes on my skin. Sensitive skin runs in my family and we&#x27;re known to break out a little when we put anything on. This guy didn&#x27;t do anything of the sort even after a scorching hot day.</li>
    <li> Over 50, and  tired of sun spot on cheeks under eyes.... my doctor told me i had to use sunscreen for a few months before she would do a laser treatment to remove them. After 4 months of faithful use, the spots seem lighter. I may still have laser treatment, but for sure I will always use this product, and avoid the sun like Edward Cullen!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best sunblocks available. I am very happy with it and will continue to use it, but it can be greasy. It gives a much more matte result than the cream versions, but expect to get a little shiny in the face, especially if you reapply throughout the day. If it were more matte, then this could be the best sunblock on the planet.</li>
