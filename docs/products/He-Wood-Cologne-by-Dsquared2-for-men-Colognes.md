      <li>I first bought some of this for my husband at Sephora, and we both looooove it.</li>

      <li>i have received multiple comment and my girlfriend love, she said &#x27;&#x27;</li>
      <li>I first smelled it at nordstrom...</li>
      <li>ship fast !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great cologne for fall or winter, but a bit too heavy for the spring and summer months, which is when I wear the standard.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first bought some of this for my husband at Sephora, and we both looooove it. It has a very earthy, clean smell without being too chemically or overpowering. It&#x27;s subtle and lasts all day long. This price on Amazon is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen anywhere. Great deal for a great product.</li>
    <li> I picked this scent out online without ever having smelled it. I was not disappointed. It smells beautiful, light, and I think it&#x27;d please a large array of people. It comes in a very unique wood frame. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfumes I have used and gifted. Looks great too and amazon carries it for a whole lot less than Nordstorm.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off. You aren&#x27;t getting the real scent, but it costs the same as if you bought it at a store. I have two small tester vials of heWOOD, and they smell very different from what I got through Amazon. It&#x27;s not even a subtle difference. I AM ANGRY, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!    - angry shopper</li>
    <li> First off, very impressed with the price from Amazon.  I picked up a 1.7oz bottle of this from another store, and it was $20 more than what I paid for the 3.4oz from Amazon.    This cologne has gotten rave reviews from a variety of sources, and it&#x27;s for good reason.  It&#x27;s one of the more original scents to come out in quite awhile, and it manages to walk that fine line of being masculine without being overly musky.  I have both the standard HeWood (tan bottle) and the Rocky Mountain (dark brown bottle), and they&#x27;re both fantastic.  The Rocky Mountain is definitely the \\&quot;bolder\\&quot; of the two, with the vetiver and cedar scents being much more pronounced.  It&#x27;s a great cologne for fall or winter, but a bit too heavy for the spring and summer months, which is when I wear the standard.  Apparently there are also Ocean Wet Wood Silver Wind Woods varieties as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.    Bravo to DSquared2 for coming up with bold new men&#x27;s scents; this one is sure to become a classic.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this is a very woody smell, which is very manly. I have gotten so many comments on this scent it&#x27;s ridiculous, and I love it myself as well.   All in all, out of my 13 full sized colognes that I own, this is my #1 most used.   I definitely recommend this to anybody and everybody.</li>
    <li> I received good compliment using it</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on this cologne all the time.. Ive bought it like 4 times.. I first smelled it at nordstrom...amazing !!!!</li>
    <li> Smells Awesome definately worth the mone</li>
    <li> I found this stuff while traveling in Italy, smells amazing! I have a hard time telling how strong it is, even with 4 sprays it wnt give you a bubble. Would still by again it smells that good</li>
    <li> The scent took some getting used to, because it&#x27;s unlike the colognes that I currently use on a regular basis (Cristobal, John Varvatos, Polo Double Black, Marc Jacobs). I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it seems to be long-lasting and fresh.A descent casual cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He was very pleased and so was I.  Very manly fragrance.  I would recommend to someone else.</li>
    <li> good scent musky, not overpowering , smooth</li>
    <li> I only wear this cologne  Great small and I never find anyone else wearing it.  Soooo what can I say?  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Incredibly intoxicating spicy and sweet with an edge.  A lot of attention with this as it smells so different from the norm.  YOu will be glad you got this and will get it again.</li>
    <li> Best cologne purchase ever. This scent in sexy, musky, spicy &amp; clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong with wood. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other colognes.</li>
    <li> I came across this fragrance by coincidence, I love that it&#x27;s such a sweet smell.  People have asked me time and time again the name of my frangrance and I tell them I don&#x27;t know what I put on.  It&#x27;s my secret weapon.  Also, I love that a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s not overwhelming to the person wearing it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for my husband. Smells very earthy and manly. I LOVE when my husband wears this stuff..</li>
    <li> Great smell and great price. Can&#x27;t get enough of it!!! Bought for my husband as Christmas gift, very content with it.</li>
    <li> ship fast !will buy again! ship fast buy again ship fast buy again ship fast ..buy again ship fast buy again ship fast ..buy again</li>
    <li> No exaggeration, I get asked daily what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> lovely parfume, the bottle is very unconfortable to use, very hard and sharp edges but the smell, well, that something just amazing, so perfect for the summer time, beach and sunny days, fresh and simple, unfortunatelly do not stays on the skin for so long but still a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Never had a complaint and more compliments than I can count.  Probably not for everyone, but works with your body chemistry well.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this parfume. This is the original product with the same scent as being sold at the department stores, but you can buy it at amazon for less and without tax. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The perfect woody cologne.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Amazing yummy great price&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift&lt;br /&gt;Smells like citrus n woody&lt;br /&gt;2 for the price of one sold in stores</li>
    <li> I love this scent was disappointed when Sephora stopped carrying it and I could not find it at other outlets...not even duty free stores! So I was happy to find it on Amazon. It is a a clean, manly scent and just what I remembered it to be. The only challenge I have is the large bottle with the wood casing and its hard edges is a bit clumsy to handle at times. This doesn&#x27;t detract from the He Wood scent itself though and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product was excellent and received it on the mentioned time which was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This scent got me back into wearing a fragrance after 25 years.  A friend of mine from Canada turned me on to it.  It was like pulling teeth to get him to tell me what it was, but since we live in different countries, he was willing to give me it&#x27;s name.  It has become my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and now I find myself hesitating to reveal to people what I&#x27;m wearing...which I get asked every time I do.  Unlike any other scent out there.  It lasts all day and night but never overbearing.  Very sexy stuff!</li>
    <li> A smooth clean scent.  Warm and inviting notes that promote closeness. Worthy of all seasons. Add to your collection soon.</li>
    <li> Great price for this bottle. If you like woodsy scents and know this coast more at other stores. Buy it.</li>
    <li> What can i say about this fragance? Its simply the most beautiful manly smell i have ever smelled. It is by far better than any other perfume and nobody has told me that (s)he has ever smelled a better one. Moreover i simply feel amazing when i am wearing it. Trust me - do not look for any other perfume for winter. Its simply the best.</li>
    <li> I wanted a more masculine scent and took a chance and bought this without smelling it somewhere. It&#x27;s a complex scent that changes a bit after being aired out.  I really enjoyed it but I can&#x27;t seem to keep it on me so I apply it again after a while.  I liked it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cologne is comfortable and pleasant. It has a distinguished and casual presence about it. If you work with your hands and read books, this might be your signature scent. If you&#x27;re &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; but shower daily... this is for you. Fantastic every day.</li>
    <li> Unique scent that is perfect for just a casual day out. At times i wish it was stronger but overall I am very pleased, I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> Nice light scent that I always get compliments on.</li>
    <li> Very, very manly yet exquisite smell; it lasts incredibly long as well. I usually only use 3 or 4 sprays of it and I&#x27;m good. The wood surrounding the bottle is a bit tacky, but whatever. The packaging was nice also.</li>
    <li> Such a great winter cologne!!!! My most favorite cologne for the Winter time!! get it every year and still love the smell of it</li>
    <li> Got it again for my husband. Distinctive scent which sets him apart from the other dudes. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the second time i buy this product from you guys and i&#x27;ll keep doing it, i&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with it..!!!!</li>
    <li> For some reason, the cologne doesn&#x27;t have nearly the strength that other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased had; almost like it had been watered down or something.</li>
    <li> I love the woodsy smell!  So does my lady!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend only to use this for casual use like go to school, work or etc. This isn&#x27;t a cologne for fancy dinners because to me its smells more manly and you should something more smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cologne is very good i have received multiple comment and my girlfriend love, she said &#x27;&#x27;You smell like a lumberjack&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful... I bought it for me (female) and get soooooooo many compliments! It&#x27;s different and can&#x27;t find it in US</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my hubby</li>
    <li> Compliments after compliments.  They no longer sell it at any department store not even sephora.  It&#x27;s amazing.  These two brothers are genius.</li>
    <li> Lady&#x27;s this is a great gift and it smells absolutely delicious.  End of story. You will not regret getting this for your significant other.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly. packaging looked official. product smells great, just as I remember. a few years back I went into sephora and made a bunch of samples for future cologne purchases. Hewoods stood out as my favorite; because of its earthy, woodsy, cool autumn scent. It does tend to smell a bit like dr pepper after most of the scent wafts away at the end of the night, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint that nobody else seems to notice.</li>
    <li> amazing scent worth every penny</li>
