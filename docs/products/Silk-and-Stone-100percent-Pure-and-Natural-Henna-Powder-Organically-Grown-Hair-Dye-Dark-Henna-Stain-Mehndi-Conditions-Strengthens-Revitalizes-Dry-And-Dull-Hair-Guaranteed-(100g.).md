<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Henna for many years. This is a very high quality henna.  It is very fine so it rinses easily.  A deep red with orange highlites on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is beautifully packaged!  It&#x27;s smooth and not gritty and made my hair super shiny!  I mixed it with a several tablespoons of coconut oil right before I put it on my hair. Left it on about 4 hours. I will buy again. Here&#x27;s a picture of what my dark brown hair looks like with henna the day after I applied.  It did deepen in color after about a week so now the reddish tones are not as bright, but I like it darker anyways. It&#x27;s really affordable too and easy to do. I love this henna!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for henna tattoos</li>
    <li> Henna was the right color and did exactly as expected.  We used it for Henna tatoos.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and has lasted for a very long time!</li>
    <li> I used this henna powder to make dye tattoos on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used the &amp;#34;Kiss&amp;#34; recipe that I found online. The recipe I found on the Silk and Stone website seemed a little excessive to me.&lt;br /&gt;This powder stains very well. At first after taking the paste off it shows as a bright orange, but in just a day it darkens and creates a very lovely deep ochre shade.&lt;br /&gt;I keep my excess powder in the freezer. I&#x27;ve had it in there for a few months, and it is still just as fresh! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product because not only did it color my hair, but it also taimed my fryzziness. I have curly hair and after using this product, my curls were more defined. I trully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> came as shown and has instructions. I have yet to use this but when I can I hopefully can still say this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Worked great! I just switched to this brand, so wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d turn out, but it worked wonderful and gave my hair a lovely color and feel.</li>
    <li> Awesome henna powder. Only thing that can make it better is if they printed the date it was packaged. Clearly it was fresh but because we&#x27;re working with something that degrades overtime it would be nice to KNOW it was fresh.</li>
    <li> The Henna didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; very well for me.  Also, very &amp;#34;fibery.&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t expect so much fiber in the mix.</li>
    <li> I used this henna for my fiances hair and it turned out wonderfully. Great product!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work, spent all the day with the henna on my head and there was no changes in my hair color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She is always drawing on her skin with permanent markers and really wanted to try Henna. She followed the instructions she found on several youtube videos and was able to use this Henna Powder to create temporary tattoos and designs that looked really cool. This turns her skin a brownish orange color. She didn&#x27;t want to use black henna because she had heard it had additives that were bad for you.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Have already purchased it again. Great color, all natural. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was great for the vibrant red color. It evenly dyed my whole head, I used about 1 and a half boxes (I have shoulder length thick hair) the only thing is my hair was dry and tangled for about a week.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected</li>
    <li> I do henna tattoos professionally and I&#x27;ve now been using this powder exclusively for almost a year. I love it! It comes very finely ground and make a very smooth mixture. Shipping is also great with this company, always on time and not a long wait time. Will continue to use this powder in the future as long as they continue to supply it!</li>
    <li> too runny and can not be applied well...</li>
    <li> If you follow a good set of directions (you have to look them up, this only comes with instruction for using on hair), and let it set for 24 hours after mixing, it turns out great! I&#x27;m sporting 3 henna tattoos now actually. It will be a brown stain, and does last about 2-3 weeks on me.</li>
    <li> This thus far the best henna I have ever used! This, though, is the first time I&#x27;ve made a point to purchase BAQ henna. I smelled both this and some left over Rainbow Research henna side by side and there&#x27;s no comparison! This makes the Rainbow Research henna smell grody!&lt;br /&gt;Mixed very easily and applied smoothly (for henna lol). The color faded fairly quickly, though....the strong reddish hues have faded after 2.5 weeks. But I&#x27;m still noticing the conditioning and strengthening benefits. I&#x27;m guessing that this henna&#x27;s thickening perks will only increase as I continue using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, love that it&#x27;s a local company! Will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> For henna art, it&#x27;s amazing. Long lasting dye, in me opinion better than Jenna henna.</li>
    <li> It was a great product for using it on your hair or even for tattoos!</li>
    <li> This is the first henna powder that I have used for doing designs on the skin. I can assure you with a proper preparation, you can get a very dark brown stain on the skin. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and your experience may vary. My henna paste was a mix of henna powder, water, lemon juice, and eucalyptus oil.&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s did not stain nearly as dark as mine and hers maxed out at a dark orange/medium brown color whereas mine was a pretty dark brown, even from the same batch and bottle.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I bought this for doing my own henna tattoos, and the color is beautiful. This is my first time ever trying to do this myself. So, the photos are just so you can see the color! Not for you to judge my unskilled work! Haha;) The biggest hand and smallest hand are both on day three. The mid sized hand was done not even 24 hours prior to photo. So, it did get darker. I used a &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; recipe that was super simple. As for the essential oil it called for, I used tea tree oil. Hope this helps! And that cute piece of dog is Stan.</li>
    <li> The box was full of hundreds of carpenter ants. Is this a joke</li>
    <li> I love this brand henna -- great product that is highly effective.  I mix this with the indigo for a darker shade (and better coverage of my greys).  This is my go to brand moving forward!</li>
    <li> We have used this for many tattoos. It is easy to use and the stain is pretty dark once you get the consistency correct.</li>
    <li> Make sure you buy an applicator as well. I didn&#x27;t have one and tried using a medicine dropped... It worked but didn&#x27;t look as nice. The lines were much thicker and not as smooth. Overall this product was awesome!</li>
    <li> Lasted WEEKS. Most potent Henna ever. It&#x27;s the best. A little sticky but that might be what we mixed it with.</li>
    <li> Wrapped simply, and in a cute box. Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to use it for my designs! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I wanted to state that I am a natural redhead becouse when I was reserching using hennaI I couldn&#x27;t find many reviews by red headed people.  I had read that this brand had a orangier color than some henna and that is why I tried it. I had used another brand befor and got a much more wine color, not at all what my natural color is.  I mixed this henna with herbal tea, lemon, honey and cinnamon, it had good dye release.  I first used it on my roots, and got a floresent orange color that mellowed in two days. I then froze what was left. I was going to use it a few weeks later after I had about 10 inches of hair cut off but didn&#x27;t use it. To be more clear I thawed it and refroze it two times.  When I finnally did dye all of my hair, it did not look florecent at all, it looked very natural and not very different from my natural ginger color. So if you have natural red hair that is more orange than dark red this may be a good choice for you.  I will be ordering this henna again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was alittle slow, but the product is good. My daughter and her friends love it!</li>
    <li> Used this with their Indigo. It was instant, quick &amp; easy to mix and apply. Wrapped my hair in plastic for about 5 hours. Mixed 2 tb Henna &amp; 1 tb Indigo with hot water to make a nice brown for my grey coverage. My first time using any Henna product so it was a learning experience. The few gray strands came out more like orange highlights - will need to adjust for next time.  Have lots left over - stored in fridge.</li>
    <li> Is the best one that I have used. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am African American and this worked wonders for my hair. My hairvwas much more hydrated and smoother than before. This product does not change the type of hair you have, but will slightly loosen the curl pattern just a bit. If you want to keep your curl pattern the way it is, then please don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This powder has gone a long way, the color is great its easy to use, just awesome! I will def buy from again, in fact I just did!</li>
    <li> Used this brand after not using henna for a while. Great dye release after the first use! Clear directions in box. Definately would buy again.</li>
    <li> Do I just mix the powder with water? Or is there something more suitable?</li>
    <li> If you are using this for your hair color it is fabulous ! because hair takes henna wonderfully well .</li>
    <li> Still working on a perfect recipient for tattoo art</li>
    <li> good quality henna. it smells so good, texture when mixed with water is very different than other cheap henna powders I tired in te past, very dense like dough and it stays on your hair not spelling all over your face like water. makes my hair soft , well conditioned, gave it a rich color, and smells so good like fresh Henna. I love it so much, might repurchase again soon. I still have some henna mixture on the fridge for a third dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;natural hair color: dark brown&lt;br /&gt;hair type: curly&lt;br /&gt;purchased 2 boxes</li>
    <li> Great henna for hair so far. Will try for mehndi/henna tattoos at some point, but the consistency looks great.</li>
    <li> I made a Henna tattoo for the first time using this powder... the color on the skin came out really good.. lasted for about a 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Really liked this, have used it alot. Color seems to hold and darken nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product specifically for doing henna tattoos. It worked great! I followed the recipe on the sellers website for mixing. The powder was very fine, mixed up easily and is the right color green. Those who use henna often know what I mean. Not vibrant green to suggest dying and not brown green to suggest old product. The tattoos turned out very dark even without wrapping them up as is the tradition when doing henna tattoos. The tattoos lasted over 3 weeks on my hands with frequent washes when I took care of them. Will definitely be buying from them in the future! If you are doing henna tattoos I would recommend splitting up the batches and not mixing the total 100g. I made a small batch of 1/4 the package and it did about 10 medium size designs total.</li>
    <li> It didnt dye right at all. The worst i have ever used</li>
    <li> The product was  exactly what I expected. It arrived earlier than i thought. And It worked according to what I needed to do with it</li>
    <li> I used it for henna and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed ! Nice , pure henna !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Nothing I tried could get the henna to release the dye.  Lemon juice, vinegar, grapefruit juice... nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may as well be ground up cardboard.  Follow the recipe, let it soak in the acids for 24 or 48 hours and... nothing.  Doesn&#x27;t dye the skin at all no matter how long it stays on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it is great! it came a day early which was a bonus, and the stain is awesome. It sticked well to the skin and worked very easy to work with. I definately think you shoud buy it if youre debating whether or not too, because it really works good. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff. I use it for henna tattoos, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil, a little sugar, and add lemon juice until it&#x27;s the consistency of toothpaste, you&#x27;ve got a really nice henna tattoo.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions exactly to mix it to make tattoos. Left it on my hand for 5 hours, and when I wiped it off it was such a light orange you can&#x27;t even tell I spent so many hours on it. So annoyed, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love.  Sifted very well. Made a henna paste,  lasted about 2 weeks.  Also put some in my hair. My natural hair is dark brown,  my bottom half was dyed a medium blond color. The henna turned the blonde a pretty Amber color.  You can see the red tint on the dark hair as well.</li>
    <li> I mixed the pure henna with coffee and warm tea and after leaving it on only one hour I now have flaming orange hair.</li>
    <li> havent used it yet but looks legit. Shipped quickly! My only downsid is that its a lot smaller than what i expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff kicks the crap out of Lush&#x27;s!!!! I dyed my very fine, mousy brown/ dark blonde hair with chemical dyes for a few years, but it absolutely destroyed my hair, so I decided to switch to henna. I started out with Lush&#x27;s product, and I saw little results, so I decided to try this. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t get shipped right from Amazon the first time, so I talked to customer service and they sent it to me directly from their company. Their customer service team responded to my emails so quickly, and even gave me instructions on how to color my hair with this stuff. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;When I used the product, it was super no-fuss. You just add warm water (no need to boil it with this stuff :) until you get a yogurt-like consistency, and then apply with a brush (I have a friend do it). Leave it on your hair for a few hours, under a shower cap, and rinse with NO SHAMPOO. Don&#x27;t shampoo for a couple days after. At first, the color is a little darker, but over the next few days it cures and turns really bright and pretty! I love this stuff. It lasts a long time, is easy to apply, and it actually shows wonderful color results. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Great quality henna, finely ground, fresh, properly packed and produces great rich color! I was a bit apprehensive at first to purchase from a vendor I&#x27;m not familiar with but I&#x27;m glad I did! I have been buying henna for years and know good quality! Very satisfied with product and price and it arrived fast! Earned a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> Easy to work with. Smooth when mixed. Washes out so much faster than other henna products I have used. The smell is not bad at all compared the other products. Very happy customer. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is real henna powder. I tried others, and they just aren&#x27;t quite the same consistency. When I mix this in water, I get just the right type of product to put into my squeeze bottles and make really cool, long-lasting henna tattoos.</li>
    <li> Best henna! Excellent quality 👌🏼</li>
    <li> But it would have been nice if the bag full of powder was re sealable. Used with tea, lemon, and tea tree oil to make a very long lasting henna tattoo</li>
    <li> On time. Love the color and the smell...the real deal.</li>
    <li> Makes a great smelling and lovely reddish brown henna stain. I&#x27;ve had 6 month old henna stored in the freezer mixed from this powder and after thawing and everything it still smelled and stained nicely. Would definitely buy again! (also the website has a great recipe and instructions for henna prep and care)</li>
    <li> I love this product and am about to order more to have on hand for next month.  I enjoy that it is chemical free and is so good for my hair.  I mix it with the indigo to make it a darker red color but do not mind the orange red either its fun.  I look forward to using this product for many years.  I wonder if I can buy in bulk, hmm.</li>
    <li> I really like this to do my henna tattoos and to highlight my hair. Muilt-purpose good quality.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for her bday.  It took about three weeks to arrive....maybe four.  I have no idea why and I was not happy about that.  Once it arrived, my two girls carefully read instructions and used this to create henna tattoos.  (They also had some little squeeze pens to make the designs and a book on henna tattoos for inspiration on designs, helpful tips, etc.)  In any case, this product was just not very potent.  Their henna tattoos came out very, very pale and washed off fairly fast, even after they let it sit on their skin to dry for over an hour. We will troubleshoot with it but to be honest, our first impression was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I try to use it in different ways and didn&#x27;t work how I expected&lt;br /&gt;I try for tattoos with water, lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;even for my hair kinda disappointed</li>
    <li> Ordered this for henna tattoos. You can tell the powder is fresh. I followed the recipe on the website. Was wonderful and easy. The color came out incredible and lasted for a week. I will always buy Silk &amp; Stone since it is affordable, fresh and makes good color. Was shipped immediately and got it sooner than I thought. I love S&amp;S Henna.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how happy I am that I discovered this product. Super easy to use and beautiful results. I have thin hair and this all natural, non-chemical alternative is dream come true. Great coverage!</li>
    <li> Terrible experience with the product and the company: Silk &amp; Stone Inc. I followed the instructions and then used it to find that the color bleeds!  What a horrible mess.  I contacted the company and we had to write several emails back and forth and all Silk &amp; Stone had to say was keep it, do not return it just adjust the recipe and continue to use it.  Believe me, I could not find one volunteer to allow me to use this product on them after seeing the color bleeding problem on the other two!!  For example here is one of the emails they sent me:  Another thing to keep in mind is that on a hot or humid day, you should make your paste a little drier and on a dry day, just a little runnier.  On hotter, humid days or when the body is quite warm, the henna can run just a little bit more since there is more moisture.  The company is not interested in CUSTOMER SATISFACTION!!  Buyer beware,  your buying this product at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please know I purchased a lot from Amazon over the last decade and this is the very first time I have ever had to write a review so that must tell you this product has issues and the company Silk &amp; Stone Inc are not customer friendly!!</li>
    <li> Turned out orange not dark brown when I used it on my skin.</li>
    <li> not as dark as I would like</li>
    <li> THIS CRAP! Did dye on my skin but barely. What a complete waste of my money never again! Next time I want henna I&#x27;ll just take that 45 minute drive. Silk and Stone doesn&#x27;t have to worry about me throwing away my money EVER again!</li>
    <li> Did not work on skin after 90 minutes</li>
    <li> It does work as a tattoo but it did have some trouble staining/lasting a long time</li>
    <li> I really like this allot.  Everybody should get this.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from this seller and I will continue to repurchase.  The henna is finely milled and of good quality.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last in my hair very long, I let it sit for a good amount of time to process, maybe because I didn&#x27;t let it sit in my hair for long.. Haven&#x27;t tried it since</li>
    <li> I use it to do Henna Body Art. It last for a while. It&#x27;s really nice quality. I tested it on my a bit of my skin to make sure nothing happened. I have sensitive skin, and I was fine. I would test it out before doing Body art, but I was fine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this henna! It came 1 day early! The application was smooth and my gray strands a beautiful auburn! I will always order silk &amp; stone!</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected. Will order again.</li>
    <li> In an effort to prepare your hair for the Indigo, you must use the henna, first. I put this in for, 7 - 8 hours, rinsed out; then air dried my hair. After my hair was dry and free of conditioners, I applied the Indigo for 5 hours and it came out perfectly black. Will buy both Henna and Indigo again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> by far some of the best henna we&#x27;ve purchased. it arrived on time and it has made several great batches.</li>
    <li> Its two months later and I still have beautiful red hair! My roots are needing a bit of a touch up, but the rest of my hair still has a solid color to it, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed with water and let it sit in my hair (covered) for 6 hours and repeated this process again a week later just to make sure the color would stay. Turns out I probably didn&#x27;t need to repeat.</li>
    <li> I received it very early. And I loved the color, but it really didn&#x27;t last long specially on the grays.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating only because i have not used it yet. But it came promptly, and seems to be as described. Packaging looks exactly the same. Will update when I use in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I used this henna powder for my tattoo designs and they turned out stunning! The color is beautiful, and long lasting, and further more,  I get plenty of compliments (and requests) for the designs! (tehe) I most definitely recommend this henna powder for anyone looking to do their own long lasting temporary tattoos!</li>
    <li> Nice henna.  Has a red-brown-orange stain.  However, depending on recipe and length it sets, Henna stain can get darker.  Bought as a gift.  Arrived timely.  Person enjoys the quality of it.</li>
    <li> I plan on continuing to buy this henna from you. I brought one at a beauty supply store,  oh my goodness was it bad. It had a lot of sand texture to it and I had to continue to wash my hair, and I didn&#x27;t see no change in color or texture. with this Henna everything was smooth and it did it purpose. Its natural alright.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality henna. Mixes smooth and rinses out easily. This made my hair very soft and shiny. I highly recommend this brand of henna.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how happy I am to have found this henna. It&#x27;s  affordable, easy to work with, and effective, plus it provides long-lasting color even over grays. I use this henna with this company&#x27;s indigo to achieve my perfect shade: a rich brown with a hint of auburn. That&#x27;s right: your hair does not have to be bright red if you dye your hair with henna!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years I used Lush Cacas and a couple other powdered hennas, but this brand is by far the best. If you are reading this and currently use Lush, you are in for a pleasant surprise. No more melting cubes on the stove, no more making a huge mess while applying, and no more coffee grinds all over your shower. Instead, this henna mixes easily and simply glides onto your hair. I apply mine at the bathroom sink and there is no mess to clean up afterwards. It&#x27;s a total relief after all of those sloppy sessions with Lush. This henna&#x27;s color also lasts much longer than Lush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, unlike other &amp;#34;BAQ&amp;#34; hennas online, Silk and Stone henna does not need to be mixed and set out overnight. This is because the henna is fresh. So just mix it with indigo, apply it immediately, and let the henna sit on your hair for a couple of hours. The process could not be easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair, for the first time in years it is noticeably shiny. The strands are glossy and strong - it&#x27;s very rare that my hair breaks when using rubberbands or being brushed. In fact, I even lose a lot less hair in the shower since switching to this henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve my color, I use 3 parts henna + 1 part indigo. I touch up my roots as needed and then occasionally do an all-over application. This process keeps my color even-toned and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am sorry to say that I&#x27;ve stopped using indigo/henna all together. As my grays became more numerous, I was having to do my roots more often (3 weeks) and I could not handle the time commitment. I also noticed that the indigo caused my hair to become darker and darker, almost to the point of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to stylist who tried to bleach out the indigo/henna and it was a nightmare! My hair turned green and became so brittle it broke off several inches. The stylist had to dye my hair black to cover the discoloration and I&#x27;ve been growing it out since then. Right now my hair is light brown on top and pure black on the bottom. If I could reverse time, I would not do indigo/henna again. I think it&#x27;s great for younger people with little gray, but not for older people with grays.went to stylist who tried to bleach out the indigo/henna and it was a nightmare!

    <li> Just make sure you wear gloves.</li>
    <li> Works great for henna art on hands, arms and feet</li>
    <li> Very good product. Wish I had known which terpes I was allergi to before I used this powder :)</li>
    <li> This was amazing.  I had tried other types of Henna, but this powder was fantastic.  I didn&#x27;t have to sift it and the quantity, when mixed, was just enough to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also mixed it and used it with the scouts for body art, and it worked well there too.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos!  Lasted ages, very fresh henna!</li>
    <li> Awesome for dying hair.  I combined it with black tea and oj and let it soak overnight to get the best color for my brown hair. I only wanted a touch of red,  so only left it in for 2 hours.  Turned my grays a brilliant copper and lightly tinted the rest of my hair. Used about half the bag for my long (mid-back length) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely look up several sets of directions before you do henna since this comes with no directions. I read the guides at crunchybetty.com and hildablue.com beforehand and had a much easier time than friends who&#x27;ve used henna. It&#x27;s much different than regular dye, and will actually react with other hair dyes sometimes.  Read up first and you can&#x27;t go wrong :-)</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! I bought it to use on my hair and this is the henna I will continue to buy! This gave my hair a really bright copper color that I have been trying to achieve with chemical dyes. I didn&#x27;t think it was extremely messy to apply.! It had a very earthy smell but by no means did I think it smelled bad. If you are used to dying your hair with lots of chemical dyes this will be a breath of fresh air! No more toxic fumes!&lt;br /&gt;I mixed my henna with chamomile tea and a squeeze of lemon juice. I kept it on for 6 hours and then followed it up with an overnight mask of olive oil. I cant remember the last time my hair has ever felt this soft or healthy. My ends are usually always dried out and I end up with a tangles mess when I try to blow dry. Now I was able to blow dry with ease!&lt;br /&gt;My color is bright and bold. This is the color I have been searching for!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am beyond thrilled with this product and will continue to purchase it! Price is great and shipping was fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two more packages of this and have done a second all over application a week or so ago. This time I put it on in the evening and slept with it overnight. I love how soft and shiny my hair is after using this! My color is still really great, slightly deeper than the first time. I will probably do one more full application in the next month or so to get an even deeper color. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else on my hair. If you are looking to get your hair some shade of red.... DEFINITELY try this! (Though, I cant imagine it showing up great in extremely dark brown or black hair). And again, I was surprised with how fast it was shipped!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand. I usually use Lush cacao.  As a previous poster said before; this henna is far different from the Lush henna. It is much easier to use and a lot less messy. I mixed my henna with lemon juice, honey and olive oil. It went on smooth as silk and was very easy to get out. I mixed it the night before and let it sit. You could see the dye release the next day. Application was a breeze and after sleeping on my henna head; washing out the next day was completely painless and easy. At first I didn&#x27;t notice any color change. I was going to give it three stars because of the fine sift and ease of application,  but after 24 hours I did see color. I suppose it needed time to cure. I am African American with dark brown hair.  Usually with the Lush line, I do see color right away even in low light, but I didn&#x27;t see anything with this henna. I was disappointed but decided to see if the color needed a little time to set. Sure enough I could see the color in the light the next day. It&#x27;s a nice dark auburn/mahogany looking red that as the days pass is easier to see. My hair feels fantastic! Soft shiny and full. I used half of the original package and I&#x27;ll use the other half later this week. I already purchased another box for when I henna next month. Belive me. This henna is very good, easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t have a really bad smell and leaves your hair feeling and looking amazing! I would definitely buy again ! As a matter of fact I already did!</li>
    <li> I created my own henna paste out of this and it works fabulously.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the outcome.  It&#x27;s given me a new, cheap hobby.</li>
    <li> Great high quality henna for your hair... with silk&amp;stone you can achieve a much deeper red compared to a more orange with general henna. Great for those who thrive on all natural beauty</li>
    <li> No instructions period although it said to read the instruction.. .....the color barely was there..... no good disappointed with product</li>
    <li> I love love love the quality of this henna powder. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or the skin of my clients when I&#x27;m doing henna. I keep it in a clean container and store it in the freezer to keep it fresh. Very fast shipping also! I will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now to dye my hair since I&#x27;ve been pregnant. I think the outcome color it good,  I&#x27;ve been dying my hair a deep red for many years and it came close to what I have used in the past. It is quite messy though and I needed to have a friend help me apply it. Do yourself a favor and buy some disposable gloves, something to cover your neck and shoulders, and a cheap shower cap from the dollar store for after. Also be aware that you have to leave it on your head for a long time, 2 hours I think.</li>
    <li> definitely would buy again! and WILL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great bang for your buck, amount is terrific, though I&#x27;d always want more, and quality is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than expected and worked well on my natural african american hair. I am growing my blonde colored hair out so that portion of my hair took to the red really well. The dark brown hair still looks dark brown but it feel so much stronger. The powder was fine enough to mix and didn&#x27;t have sticks and large pieces in it. I would buy from this seller again !</li>
    <li> Purchased the indigo and the henna together, but only received the henna. Contacted the seller received my merchandise several days later problem solved. I was disappointed because I had planned to apply the henna &amp; Indigo during my days off. Oh well. The product is easy to work with. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair extremely dry not sure if i did something wrong or not.</li>
    <li> Got it in 4 days and was very pleased with the care of the package and fair pricing. Will update once henna is applied.</li>
    <li> Used for Henna, turned out great.</li>
    <li> It was very nice and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this with a little bit of trepidation since it did not say that it was exclusively for dyeing your hair.It worked really well however.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this.  She&#x27;s been doing tattoos on herself and her friends every night this week.  They are having a blast with it.  She&#x27;s quite the artist.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get disappointed if you don&#x27;t see results right away.  After you wash it of the color starts to appear several hours later.  My daughter likes to apply hers in the evening and wash it off before bed so that when she wakes the next morning the images are nice and dark.</li>
    <li> This is my go to henna for coloring my natural black hair. It basically just covers my grays obviously doesn&#x27;t lift anything. It gives great coverage and yes it does make your curls more elongated but that wears off in time and for me isn&#x27;t very dramatic. It gives me a nice deep red tint that is visible under the sun. The stuff works even better when you use the frozen leftovers later. I am actually currently processing with it now. If I had time I would have frozen it before using because I like the quality post freezing that much!</li>
    <li> Loved it, and it came fast</li>
    <li> Love the texture of my new bright red hair. Did darken up a little after a couple days. My grays are especially bright orange but I hope more applications over time will help with this. Younger hair could pull off the bold color for sure. I like that it&#x27;s all natural. Smells like tea.</li>
