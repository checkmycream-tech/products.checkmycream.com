<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great buy!  And.so much fun!  I can use all of these colors (probably because my skin coloring is neutral).  The colors are very pigmented but it still works for me even though I am fair (NC15/NW20).  I use a light touch to apply.  This would also work for much deeper skin coloring (maybe yes maybe no for very, very dark skin).  Doesn&#x27;t last all day.  Needs to be reapplied.  But for the price - wonderful!</li>
    <li> Came broken and i have to pay for send back :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected, I have so much blush now. So much</li>
    <li> Great affordable blush palette with great pigmentation. This palette have great dark color blushes that work great on my medium/dark skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love all the different colors!!! The blush stays on and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird make up smell like some blushes. It was a great price and I would definitely recommend this blush palette.</li>
    <li> This palette is the absolute best it lives up to it&#x27;s name beautiful colors and total matte</li>
    <li> When I saw the price I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much but when I got it I was surprised at how pigmented and easy to blend these were. Buying it again for a Friend&#x27;s birthday</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the color payoff from this blush palette. It&#x27;s not chalky or powdery at all, and it is matte as advertised. I love the variety of colors offered, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price (I paid $7 with free shipping). My only complaint would be that they are so pigmented that they can be slightly difficult to blend. Still very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Beautiful on dark complexion!</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM! Way bigger than I expected the kit to be. I attached several different photos. I wanted everyone to see how big the pack is.&lt;br /&gt;~In the pictures with the white t shirt I believe I am wearing the bottom one, second from the right. (bright orange coral)&lt;br /&gt;~In the picture with the brown shirt and red lipstick I am wearing the top middle color. (light coral)&lt;br /&gt;~The picture with the white lace shirt I am wearing is the second color from the right. (lighter pink)&lt;br /&gt;~The color I am wearing with the scarf is the bottom left (lightest pink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these so much! They brighten my face a ton! I also love the darker red- mauve colors. They look more dramatic and bold, matched perfect with a nude or clear lip. I definitely recommend this kit to any girl looking for beautiful, exotic blush colors. Don&#x27;t put too much though because it will look overpowering. I normally use a Kabuki brush but it is too compacted to use for these colors. So keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> I have been on a makeup buying binge for the last couple of months or so. Most of the higher the makeup pallets like Clinique and Too Faced that have eyes shadow, contouring and blushes always seem to have blush colors that are to light or pale or orange for my skin tone. I&#x27;m a dark skin black woman. I was looking for a blush pallet that have deeper darker richer colors. I ran across this one and I liked what I saw in the photo. When I got it it was very well packaged and MUCH bigger than I thought it would be. The colors were a little lighter than what they look like in the photo but, they are more of what I had been looking for. I can blend and play with these colors and I really like that a lot. It leaves a nice matte finish and blend well with both my collection of different types of foundation, powders and bronzers. It was a really great deal for a product I can be really be happy with and last a good long while because the pallet is so large.</li>
    <li> too pigmented.  Very cheap looking, does not blend at all. I&#x27;m surprised at all the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Wonderful blush palette for women of color. It is difficult to find affordable blushes that work well with dark skin tones. These blushes are highly pigmented and blend really well. My package came to me intact which I was very grateful for. There is a beautiful orange blush in this palette that makes my brown skin glow! Would definitely recommend this product to other persons.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This palette exceeded my expectations far and beyond the low price, wow! I am so glad I stumbled onto this palette while looking for blushes - I almost went with coastal scents but wasn&#x27;t feeling the color options. This matte powder palette is pretty large and the colors are quite pigmented so you only need a very light dusting on your brush. I have dark golden tan skin and this shows up amazingly well. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Worst blushes I have every bought. They are FAR too pigmented. That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, except for these do not blend AT ALL. Try blending the color in, and you will rub off any sort of makeup underneath. I do not recommend this to anyone. I have settled for just using these over my lipsticks to tint them different colors.</li>
    <li> Previous comments regarding size are accurate!  The colors are vibrant and I would definitely purchase this or other shades again - a very exciting and pleasant experience with this particular product &amp; seller!</li>
    <li> Good! Yo get what you pay for it!</li>
    <li> Very pigmented. Every blush color you&#x27;d need for your collection. No animal testing is a plus!</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Full sized blush palette, and its gorgeous. Its super pigmented so if you have a lighter skin tone don&#x27;t rub in your brush too much. Very nice shades. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best blush ever. VERY PIGMENTED. i am a light skin, i don&#x27;t think i can use the 2 colors on the right side of the box. but for $7, it&#x27;s an amazing blush. stays on. beautiful color. i only tap lightly on the blush to pick up the color. it takes practice not to paint your face with this blush. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Pigmentation is amazing! So many beautiful colors! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> All shadows were in tact, great bright colors with a wide range both shimmer and flat. Too big to pun in makeup box but that was expected. The colors stay on great just use primer and setting spray to really maximize the length on. Very happy with the pallet. It&#x27;s a great price and well worth it</li>
    <li> This is a great find.  I was browsing for an add on item to ad to my makeup brush set order for free shipping and i came across this blush palette by Beauty Treats. the blushes are definlatly big very and pigmented so you only need a little to get a lot of pop. and they are matte so you could apply bronzer or highlighter without having to worry about being a shimmer bomb. thhe colors are pretty close to what you see online. I am a african american woman like a deep caramel complexion. and they work really well so women of color don&#x27;t be afraid to get this because the color selection is great for our skin but and I&#x27;m sure they would look good on lighter skin tones as well. I won&#x27;t be purchasing blush for a long long time with these and then when i run out i just might purchase this again. great blushes shipped very fast and everything was intact.</li>
    <li> Love this blush great colors</li>
    <li> These colors are great for my dark complexion. A little goes a long way. The product came on time, and well packaged. The pallette was a lot bigger than expected. 😏</li>
    <li> OMG...THESE BLUSES ARE INSANE...!!&lt;br /&gt;I m American Indian and Chocolate and these Blushes are so beautiful and pigmented...!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again...!!</li>
    <li> GREAT for darker complexions, because it is very pigmented, not glittery and cheap looking, and easy to apply. Gives a very &#x27;high end&#x27; cosmetic, professional makeup appearance. Would definitely recommend, and good value for cost.</li>
    <li> The colors are perfect for women with dark skin tones</li>
    <li> This is great blush. It goes on fairly dark so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, but it&#x27;s also easy to blend. I had doubts about buying a cheap blush palette, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed.  Spills inside the case all over when I received this. Worst quality colours. Not recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great set. A lot of bright colors and different choices.</li>
    <li> very colorful and easy to use</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors!  I&#x27;m an African woman with a caramel complexion.  Colors go on smoothly and can be layered however you like as the pigment is strong.  The palatte is BIG, but I love it!  I carry mine in a tote, but it can easily fit in a large purse.  The pans the colors come are a good size so it will definitely last a long time.  Well worth the very reasonable price.  Buy it! You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented, not chalky a little goes a long way. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Was perfect All colors to contour with and was cheap fast shipment!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its very nice to have for women that loves makeup! But I refuse to carry it around all day to keep reapplying to make it last. But I look good when I go to work lol!</li>
    <li> Awesome great colors inexpensive</li>
    <li> Super love the shades of this it was exactly what I was looking for. Love the colors and the matte blush look it has. I am a dark skin female and the pop on my face. Came on time and packaged very well. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best choice on Blushes!! im in love!!!</li>
    <li> I love that I can chose colors depending on my mood, or mix my own.  For the price this is unbelievably good.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my kit but was a bit weary prior to receiving it. The color payoff is pretty good though! The non-brown colors show up well on dark brown skin--which is a plus. The consistency of the blush is a bit odd to me-it&#x27;s very silky feeling. I&#x27;m not quite used to such a texture of blush. But for my beginner MUA kit, it&#x27;s found a home.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good palette, the order arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I have a medium skin color and it looks so natural! Great pigmentation and the colors are beautiful!</li>
    <li> I believe this product is more for dark complexions, I am more a medium complextion.  For example, Black Opal&#x27;s Nutmeg is slightly too dark for me, but I can use it anyway with a highlight shade under my eye area.  Black Opal&#x27;s Nutmeg shade matches my more tan areas in my face quite well.  As you probably already know, people are not just one shade, but a combination of shades are present on skin.  I still use the product since I purchased it, but I find even the pink shades are way to pigmented for me.  I tone them down with a more nuetral shade I purchased separately from this product, and use a very faint amount, and it helps.  I will not be purchasing this again, and I will be looking for less pigmented blushes.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will last you forever because it is so pigmented and you don&#x27;t need to use too much. Plus it&#x27;s huge!!</li>
    <li> I love it so much I have a medium skin color and it is so natural looking and it came in in less than a week.</li>
    <li> The lid came a little bit cracked but thankfully the products are intact. Beautiful colors and pigmentation. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> heavily pigmented, BE CAREFUL! avoid clown look! but wonder range of shades, amazing for everyday or stage makeup.</li>
    <li> The colors look so much prettier on line but wen i received it i was not to happy it goes on like the 99 cent store make up really cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this blush palette. The colors are very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this! The rounds are big and the colors bright!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect to like this so much but the colors are actually really pigmented and the sizes are so large I think I will have it for a while. :)</li>
    <li> Great, vibrant, pretty colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just building my make up collection, so wanted an inexpensive blush to experiment with. These are all matte shades, highly pigmented and wear well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, fun shades and super pigmented! Great for spring and summer! Nice variety of colors to create different looks to match with any lip color!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how to feel about it used it a few times but umm write an update I guess later on as of now it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love it.</li>
    <li> Omg! This is beautiful. . I love it</li>
    <li> Just received my blush pallet and I am very pleased with this blush set! I recommend this pallet to everyone,  it&#x27;s a must buy product! They are so pigmented and feels great. Perfect size, this is definitely gonna last long, packaged well, and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing. I am a honey/carmel color and the pallet works for me. It has really beautiful colors. The bottom row is my favorite. The colors are very pigmented and last all day. I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The color is very pigmentation but I receive mine all broken to pieces</li>
    <li> You have to use little product as the palette is very pigmented. Love the variety of colors!</li>
    <li> Good shades easy to travel with</li>
    <li> Amazing. When I saw it, I was like &amp;#34;no way, this blush is crazy Big&amp;#34;&amp;#34;. I love it! The colors are great. Will not disappoint. Definitely get this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS palette!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is amazing. VERY pigmented great for all skin tones soft smooth great color selections. Best thing of all its under $9</li>
    <li> I am absolutely 100% amazed at the pigmentation in this inexpensive palette. Every color is genuinely matte, and most of the colors are super super super pigmented....to the point where I have to be really careful when applying. But in my book, that&#x27;s a good thing. I have never gotten this kind off color payoff without spending $30 on one color. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that this blush kit was so large. Definitely not ideal for travel but I have come to really like about half of the colors. I&#x27;ll probably never use all the colors but for the price I am pleased. I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase this item but I don&#x27;t regret giving it a try.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is worth it.  It shipped really quickly but I have prime.  In person, the colors are a lot brighter. In the picture, the colors look more muted. You do get a lot of  colors that you would not normally buy...even blush colors that I have never seen before. They are very pigmented and little goes a long way...so go easy on the brush and blend well.  It will definitely last you a long time.  There are a lot of shades of pink (very bright, unusual shades....this seems more of a palette of pink blushes). There is one blush that seems like a cross between peach and pink. There is one dark color...dark ginger color which is pretty. I can only see myself wearing 4 maybe 5 shades....just because the colors are so unusual and bright.  However, for the price, this is a great deal.  Drug-store or name brand blushes will at least cost you the amount of this palette.  If you need a pink shade, this is for you. I would buy again and I do recommend.  What i really like about this palette is that i do not have to reapply my blush more than once to get it to show like some blushes that you have to constantly reapply on your cheeks to even get the color to show.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for vacation purposes as I didn&#x27;t really want to take my more expensive MAC products with me because they tend to crack and crumble from a lot of movement. After reading all the reviews I decided to order and to my amazement the package is a whole lot bigger than what I was expecting!! A lot BIGGER!! I right away pulled out my brush and put some on mixing colors and so on, VERY VERY NICE! It was packaged in a box with bubble wrap and also came in a bigger box very securely packaged! Our vacation was a mere 2 weeks and it came home all in one piece! I use this on a daily basis and has a lot of product in each individual pan. I would definitely recommend to anyone, you can&#x27;t beat the price! Btw~ I sometimes have a bad reaction because I have acne prone skin and this didn&#x27;t even break me out, so I will definitely continue to used</li>
    <li> Beautiful, bold, long wearing, blendable colors!</li>
    <li> The purchase wasn&#x27;t bad, but I receive it with three blushes broken.they should take more care of stuff because this somehow money  we&#x27;re spending it&#x27;s not fair.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing and so is the application.</li>
    <li> Surprised how big the pallet is. Colors are all very nice. Also delivery was very quick, ordered on Sunday got it by Monday.</li>
    <li> This is a great palette! The colors are great and pop sufficiently. It is NOT like some palettes I&#x27;ve purchased where the colors are illuminated but are different once the palette arrives to your home. Some palette colors are lighter once applied or do not apply well for that &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. It was a great buy! I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love this blush set!!! The colors are amazing and I highly recommend buying this especially since it&#x27;s so cheap. 😀</li>
    <li> Totally not what I was expecting. First of all, I will mention that the individual compartments that hold the powder are about one inch in diametre, and the actual case is the length of about 5 or 6 inches. I was expecting it to be a lot smaller so that was a pleasant surprise! Secondly the blushes are a true matte: they havr no shimmer whatsoever (this is important to me because some blushes I have purchased in the past claim matte, but are not). And thirdly they are amazingly pigmented (which makes for a lot of cover for a small amount of the powder) and they don&#x27;t clog my pores up, something I am always careful about when testing makeup. Overall I absolutely love it and I probably don&#x27;t have a need for anymore blush for a while. Great pallete!</li>
    <li> Love this palette very rich colors.</li>
    <li> I am a blush lover, and I have tried many brands from high end to low end. This blush palette to me from a personal and professional experience can give these high end MAC included a run for there money. Very pigmented, don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheap looking plastic casing, these blushes are the amazing and are large sized compared to the size of other palettes and pan blushes. Give them a try, I doubt if you are disappointed and for less that 10 dollars for a palette. What is there to lose really?</li>
    <li> A very good blush palette for stage makeup. Crazy pigmented and all are matte, as stated, but sometimes brands will call something shimmery matte, but these have NO shimmer. They kind of smell like old lady makeup, but you&#x27;re getting 10 blushes for $8! Also the case is very sleek.</li>
    <li> Great !!! Highly pigmented ...came quickly .lcolors go well with dark skin</li>
