      <li>Have used this for years and love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Glad it is still being made!</li>
      <li>NICE CONCELER.   </li>
      <li>I mostly use it to cover up breakouts and it is really good at minimizing redness while blending in to my foundation (I use a Neutrogena liquid foundation).  </li>
      <li>I Ordered &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; because am fair skinned (Austrian - Blonde Hair/Blues Eyes) and it covers well and matches perfectly.</li>
      <li>I use it to cover acne scars and blemishes and it does it fairly well and blends in easily.</li>

      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out which is a huge pro!</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more greasy?  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t need smooth orange erase!</li>
      <li>Nice  and smooth concealer.</li>
      <li>Glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>Not the most flattering makeup</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
      <li>The coverage is OK.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m okay with it as is.</li>
      <li>Blends right in with my fair skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to this product for many years and will remain so for many years to come!</li>
      <li>EAsy to order online instead of paying a bit more at the store.</li>
      <li>This shade (fair, 705) is actually a reasonable match for my skin tone, so sometimes I use this with no foundation.  </li>
      <li>It is very quick to apply and it blends well.</li>
      <li>Provides fair amount of coverage, doesn&#x27;t leave a white rings, blends nicely.  </li>
      <li>problem is it can settle into fine lines if used too soon after moisturizer</li>
      <li>Love how smooth goes on and the concealer properties, very natural looking, but I like a lighter shade around my eyes, so if you prefer a more skin tone look, this might be too light for you!</li>
      <li>It went on smooth and creamy and did a fabulous job covering my skin where I needed it.</li>
      <li>I give straight honest reviews.</li>
      <li>But just for comparison I dug out my old tube of CoverGirl Concealer in the shade Fair, and gave it a try.</li>
      <li>I love the fast shipping and the items are just what I was expecting in all ways.</li>
      <li>So I ordered a nice new fresh tube.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t cover up all blemishes, but adequate for under-eye concealer.</li>
      <li>Great for pinker complexions but not for those of us who genuinely have an orange-ish tint, even when you&#x27;re super pale.</li>
      <li>It is the best concealer for pimples are dark circles under the eyes and beats others by far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is basically the same product I loved so much before.  </li>
      <li>The older concealer seemed to be more dense and really did the job for those pesky imperfections.  </li>
      <li>So to get it just right</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and dark purple bags under my eyes that tend to dry out very easily despite using a hydrating eye cream twice every day.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well for me.</li>
      <li>I rarely rave over drugstore brand cosmetics, but this is one product that really works for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely give this product a higher rating if it matched my skin tone better.</li>
      <li>I tried many products including Benefit Bo-ing and various MAC concealers and couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for my issues.</li>
      <li>Since I can no longer find my color in my old concealer (Max Factor), I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a decent replacement that won&#x27;t settle in fine lines/dry out/or flake under my eyes but can still cover.</li>
      <li>I think this warms up the product and makes it much easier to blend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this concealer off and on for years, but I have to say it really doesn&#x27;t have the coverage it used to have.  </li>
      <li>This is very shimmery and looks very unnatural under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the newer concealers thinking that since the 70&#x27;s concealer formulas must be well advanced and perfected.</li>
      <li>What I do know is that it works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>--  Thanks.</li>
      <li>It covered up flaws okay, but it was waay too dark for my skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the same full and even coverage as before.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that it&#x27;s more creamy than my previous concealer brand so be careful if you&#x27;re in warm places especially during summer.</li>
      <li>highly recommend for anybody wanting for having orange skin but not for anybody else.</li>
      <li>It blends OK, but leaves little streaks if you&#x27;re not paying close attention with blending.</li>
      <li>I do wish the coverage was a little better, but I still recommend it.</li>
      <li>It looks very cakey and old lady like.  </li>
      <li>, for blending this - it helps me to press my fingers into where I&#x27;ve dabbed the concealer and let them sit for a second before trying to drag or dab more for blending.</li>
      <li>and it actually works pretty well as a concealer that also brightens the area without being overly drying.</li>
      <li>The combo really is great, and it allows me to still use my moisturizer on my eyes and then do a little sheer powder at the end without ruining the look of the concealer; I just have to wait a little bit in between steps.</li>
      <li>I had an old Cover Girl concealer stick</li>
      <li>Think, delicately jiggle more than dab, for the sake of your skin.</li>
      <li>Sort of like MF (old stick makeup of Max Factor</li>
      <li>I was really surprised by this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t crack dry out too much but the coverage fades a bit halfway through a normal work day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely ditch the high end for this</li>
      <li>I finally decided to try something new.</li>
      <li>I first apply a small amount of a peach-toned corrector to neutralize (Pixi) and then press (not rub) this on the remaining discoloration gently with my fingers.</li>
      <li>Mine is in a dark blue plastic tube with a cover that has large, shiny, turquoise areas on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pink in color. Not the most flattering makeup</li>
    <li> It covers dark under-eye circles and small imperfections well.</li>
    <li> This concealer does what it says it is going to do!  Just that simple.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by this. Always on the hunt for the perfect concealer and it&#x27;s almost perfect. Great creaminess, good color in that it has a peachy quality which counteracts the bluish-purple tones of under-eye circles. Blends right in with my fair skin and I don&#x27;t wear any face foundation, just a little blush and/or bronzer. And the price!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is it can settle into fine lines if used too soon after moisturizer and/or take on a chalky look if you use powder. So to get it just right, I layer it over L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic Perfecting Base which is a fluffy mattifying primer that seems to give under-eye circles just the right texture for application of this concealer. The combo really is great, and it allows me to still use my moisturizer on my eyes and then do a little sheer powder at the end without ruining the look of the concealer; I just have to wait a little bit in between steps. Maybe try this if concealer textures are giving you trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for blending this - it helps me to press my fingers into where I&#x27;ve dabbed the concealer and let them sit for a second before trying to drag or dab more for blending. Think, delicately jiggle more than dab, for the sake of your skin. I think this warms up the product and makes it much easier to blend.</li>
    <li> Have used this concealer for probably 12 years. It is the best concealer for pimples are dark circles under the eyes and beats others by far. Not to mention the price is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried expensive concealers to see if coverage was any better, and it was actually worse! I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to this product for many years and will remain so for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I had a very hard time getting this color down here in Central Florida anywhere near me.  Had to order by mail.  I have used this color in this product for years. Glad it is still being made!</li>
    <li> Priced perfectley and was just what I expected. Cover Girl has a good reputation for quality make up and this was certainly a good choice for me.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> does not cover well...</li>
    <li> I use this product with CoverGirls&#x27;s Smoothers BB cream. They are great together! I expected the color to be a tiny bit darker but I&#x27;m okay with it as is. I use it to cover acne scars and blemishes and it does it fairly well and blends in easily. I noticed that it&#x27;s more creamy than my previous concealer brand so be careful if you&#x27;re in warm places especially during summer. This product didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out which is a huge pro!</li>
    <li> Provides fair amount of coverage, doesn&#x27;t leave a white rings, blends nicely.  Won&#x27;t cover up all blemishes, but adequate for under-eye concealer.</li>
    <li> This concealer doesn&#x27;t cake or crease. It stays on long, like six or so hours. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This product provides good coverage.</li>
    <li> I had an old Cover Girl concealer stick and I finally decided to throw it out.  It had served me well for literally years, but you&#x27;re really not supposed to keep makeup for years.  I went looking for the same item as a replacement and couldn&#x27;t find it, so I just bought another Cover Girl concealer stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically the same product I loved so much before.  Whether it&#x27;s identical, or whether all Cover Girl concealer sticks are similar, I can&#x27;t say.  What I do know is that it works very well for me.  I mostly use it to cover up breakouts and it is really good at minimizing redness while blending in to my foundation (I use a Neutrogena liquid foundation).  This shade (fair, 705) is actually a reasonable match for my skin tone, so sometimes I use this with no foundation.  I can put finishing powder over this and my concealer and you can hardly tell the difference between where the concealer is and the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not irritate my skin and it lasts all day (with foundation).  I rarely rave over drugstore brand cosmetics, but this is one product that really works for me.  It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; heavy-duty concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: the packaging on mine (bought recently) may have changed from the picture.  So do not be alarmed if you get different packaging.  Mine is in a dark blue plastic tube with a cover that has large, shiny, turquoise areas on it.</li>
    <li> Works good, good cover and creamy. would buy again. Sort of like MF (old stick makeup of Max Factor thar u cant buy anymore at stores).</li>
    <li> Quality concealer which I have used for years for under the eye. Creamy and doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. What came out of the package was not was pictured. The actual&lt;br /&gt;color was way to dark. Get one lighter than what you need.</li>
    <li> I love the fast shipping and the items are just what I was expecting in all ways.</li>
    <li> I have no issues, it works great. EAsy to order online instead of paying a bit more at the store.</li>
    <li> I have grey circles under my eyes and I have bought this for years, it does the trick, so I love it !!!</li>
    <li> Best drugstore concealer out there! I&#x27;ve tried high end concealers but they were too heavy for my taste and I noticed heavy creasing. I finally decided to try something new. I ended up with this miracle product that doesn&#x27;t crease and glides on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll definitely ditch the high end for this gem!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. It dries quick so after applying make sure to blend!!</li>
    <li> I get pretty bad purple circles under my eyes. This concealer does a good job covering them, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it creasing or drying out my skin. It is very quick to apply and it blends well. I would consider this a medium coverage concealer. I do wish the coverage was a little better, but I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> It covered up flaws okay, but it was waay too dark for my skin. &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; concealer shouldn&#x27;t be dark and orange tinted.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I had tried Dermablend, but it did not stay on.  CoverGirl has great staying power and is a perfect match for my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order this again. The coverage is OK. It blends OK, but leaves little streaks if you&#x27;re not paying close attention with blending. I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this concealer off and on for years, but I have to say it really doesn&#x27;t have the coverage it used to have.  The older concealer seemed to be more dense and really did the job for those pesky imperfections.  However, CoverGirl seems to have changed the formula... It&#x27;s more greasy?  It doesn&#x27;t have the same full and even coverage as before.  I&#x27;ve ordered a different concealer to try out.  This one just isn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s job. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me.  It seems companies are always &amp;#34;improving&amp;#34; on what already works.  It&#x27;s sad. --  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for me. I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it!</li>
    <li> Nice  and smooth concealer.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> I give straight honest reviews. I especially like to do reviews on things I&#x27;m really pleased with. No one is paying me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Concealer has been around at least since the 70&#x27;s when I used to use it to cover spots and for contouring my face and you know what! It&#x27;s still the best concealer ever. I have tried several of the newer concealers thinking that since the 70&#x27;s concealer formulas must be well advanced and perfected. But just for comparison I dug out my old tube of CoverGirl Concealer in the shade Fair, and gave it a try. It went on smooth and creamy and did a fabulous job covering my skin where I needed it. So I ordered a nice new fresh tube.  Love love love it! In my opinion CoverGirl Smoothers Concealer WAS the Best and STILL is the Best concealer you can buy.</li>
    <li> Goes on Orange.  Strange because it is so beige in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for anybody wanting for having orange skin but not for anybody else. It goes on Facebook but I don&#x27;t need smooth orange erase!</li>
    <li> good price for the money</li>
    <li> I will buy this again, it covers well and lasts all day.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;- I Ordered &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; because am fair skinned (Austrian - Blonde Hair/Blues Eyes) and it covers well and matches perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is very shimmery and looks very unnatural under my eyes. It looks very cakey and old lady like.  It did not cover my acne at all.  It also came damaged.</li>
    <li> WORKS WONDERFUL AND CONCEARLER WHAT YOU WANT</li>
    <li> I find this always provides complete coverage of my undereye circles, without feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> NICE CONCELER.   Love how smooth goes on and the concealer properties, very natural looking, but I like a lighter shade around my eyes, so if you prefer a more skin tone look, this might be too light for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely give this product a higher rating if it matched my skin tone better. Great for pinker complexions but not for those of us who genuinely have an orange-ish tint, even when you&#x27;re super pale.</li>

I don&#x27;t wear foundation since I have freckles too. Since I can no longer find my color in my old concealer (Max Factor), I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a decent replacement that won&#x27;t settle in fine lines/dry out/or flake under my eyes but can still cover. I tried many products including Benefit Bo-ing and various MAC concealers and couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for my issues. I tried this in Fair and it actually works pretty well as a concealer that also brightens the area without being overly drying. I first apply a small amount of a peach-toned corrector to neutralize (Pixi) and then press (not rub) this on the remaining discoloration gently with my fingers. It doesn&#x27;t crack dry out too much but the coverage fades a bit halfway through a normal work day. It&#x27;s not perfect but it performs just as well as many high-end products for a lot cheaper.</li>
