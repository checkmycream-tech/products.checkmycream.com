      <li>Used it at the beach for low maintenance style, and it was perfect.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, which is great.</li>
      <li>I also would have enjoyed it more if there was a lingering scent.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I am hoping my input has helped you out with your product and being an organic solution I am sure it will be a winner.</li>
      <li>This mousse is ok.</li>
      <li>My male coworker recommended it, since I was using the awesome (and pricy) MoroccanOil.</li>

      <li>There aren&#x27;t areas or chunks of my hair that are more treated or stringy (like with serums).</li>
      <li>how many stars.</li>
      <li>This product smells great, but mine was very watery.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Organix Coconut Mousse.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great and good for your hair at the same time!</li>
      <li>Its more like a leave in conditioner-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, holds well, smells AMAZING, and really seems to give my hair a nice shine.</li>
      <li>So far using this product has been great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. Blow dry for about 2 minutes just to set the curls and really does well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and after curling it and putting this product in, it goes limp within 30 minutes and loses the curls. One pro is that it smells good</li>
    <li> This product smells great, but mine was very watery. I expected it to be more like a mousse. If it had the consistency of a regular mousse I would have loved it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that tangles easily.  I searched for a \\&quot;weightless mousse\\&quot; that was gluten free and would de-tangle my hair.  This product smells absolutely scrumptious (just ask my husband) and detangles, gives lift and makes my hair feel wonderful!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine, blond hair. Styles hair without leaving stickiness or stiffness.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product for wavy or curly hair I&#x27;ve ever found. This mousse is so amazing and light, it will smooth and define your curls when applied to wet hair to really bring out your natural curls. Most other curl definers aren&#x27;t as light and weigh your hair down and give you that brittle and crunchy feeling. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mousse for over a year now, and i LOVE IT!! my hair is so soft, never sticky or stiff. it smells wonderful. its so easy to use and work through your hair! i have tried other mousses (when i couldn&#x27;t find this one) and i hate them. once you&#x27;ve tried the best its hard to go back to the rest.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t know what I would do without this product. I have naturally curly hair and it really defines my curls instantly and effortlessly.  Love it.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this weightless mousse, sometimes after I wash my hair I will put this mousse through my hair and let my hair air dry.It leaves my hair so bouncy and I love the way it smells! I use everything from the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk line.</li>
    <li> This mousse is awesome!  It is very light and fluffy, and leaves my hair feeling mostly natural.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or film or greasy feeling at all.  And it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like other mousse.  The point of mousse is to fluff up the hair, not weigh it down and make it flatten out!  It smells wonderful for quite a while, and it works in really easily!</li>
    <li> A favorite of mine. I use it daily and the bottle still lasts me a long time. I&#x27;m a guy, but a small amount covers a lot of ground.</li>
    <li> I bought this mousse after reading all the great reviews and figured for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Oh MAN, I was thrilled with the results. I have curly/wavy moderately fine and dry hair that frizzes (mixed mexican and white), and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from two dollar to sixty dollar products: lotions, serums, sprays, mousses, leave-in conditioners, but no matter what my hair would look gorgeous right after application (like with pricey moroccan oil), but hours later the product would dry out and my hair would frizz again. Additionally, I&#x27;ve had trouble with product distribution and this one is INCREDIBLE in that regard. There aren&#x27;t areas or chunks of my hair that are more treated or stringy (like with serums). And it makes my hair look SO healthy, super shiny and bouncy, and full of volume, which I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve. And when I apply it just to the lower portion of my dirty hair, it makes me get away with another day without washing. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m envious of my own hair now. The consistency did weird me out a little at first because it&#x27;s kind of wet, but it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t give an oververtly wet look like most products, I walk right into work after applying it, not worried that it looks unprofessional. Applying it to damp hair or dry hair yields almost the same effects, just a little curlier when I apply it after a shower. Seriously, BEST HAIR PRODUCT I&#x27;VE EVER USED. I also got the organix shampoo and conditioner, the smoothing shea butter one, and it works really well too. Makes my hair clean but not dry, and does a REALLY good job of defrizzing for a long time. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t distribute very well though so I have to use a lot of it. Using the mousse with it though makes my hair look awesome, as it adds that shine and volume. I&#x27;m a super devotee now to the Organix products. Thanks to everyone else who convinced me to try them! :)</li>
    <li> Organic is one of those words that gets throws around to attract consumers looking for less toxic products. Even though there might be some organic ingredients, this coconut milk mousse appears to contain more DMDM hydantoin, a formaldehyde releaser that&#x27;s used as a preservative, than actual coconut oil or coconut milk. So disappointing that the three featured ingredients are listed last - meaning there are only trace (read: insignificant) amounts in the mousse. Note, however, that fragrance is the fifth ingredient - maybe that&#x27;s why it smells so darn yummy? If anyone has a good, healthier alternative, feel free to recommend in a comment. :-)</li>
    <li> Not as much of a hold as I would have liked but it did the job and it did not dry my hair out like a lot of products with alcohol in them.</li>
    <li> Great on hair! This product does provide nutrients and strengthened my hair. When I use it with Organix Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair is much healthier.</li>
    <li> This is a really good light mousse if you don&#x27;t like your hair stiff and plastered down.  It leaves my hair light and it holds the curl well.  I have to use a lot of it but it works good and smells great.  The price is good too and it is natural.  I like that it isn&#x27;t under pressure like the other mousse&#x27;s so you can put it in your purse while traveling.  I really like the Organix line of products and the fact I can buy them at CVS.  I don&#x27;t buy expensive conditioners or shampoos anymore.  I can&#x27;t afford them #1 and secondly I really don&#x27;t see a difference.  I think that marketing is hype and it brain washes.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Organix.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything and has zero hold. You put it in your hair and it basically makes it smell like coconuts and that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good texture but it makes my scalp itch :( I must be allergic to something in it.  Smells very coconut-y.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, makes my curls look good.  But can&#x27;t keep using it due to the itching.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the mousse I was amazed by the coconut scent. It was very easy to press a nice amount of mousse into my hair. The texture however was watery/foamy. After rubbing in between my hands I then applied it to my roots and out to the tips. It dried into a loose hold which is nice. However the coconut scent disipated and I was a little disappointed about that. Because I like that scent in hair products. Although the name of the product does speak true about the mousse being weightless, having thick wavy hair I would have liked a little bit more hold. I also would have enjoyed it more if there was a lingering scent. All in all I will continue to use this product because I do find that it actually makes my hair feel soft and slightly bouncy. I am hoping my input has helped you out with your product and being an organic solution I am sure it will be a winner. Are there any other hair products in this line? I would be willing to try them. My hair is going through that every 7 years change and I am actually leaning towards this softfeeling but stronger hold for my aging hair. Thank You so much for being able to use your product and allowing me to share in the opinion of it. Keep me informed of any other products in the line and any changes in the present product. A Happy Customer :) Sincerely, Dolores.</li>
    <li> I tried to find a substitude for Fekkai, this one didn&#x27;t work out for me. Too liquidish. The smell is super faint. I&#x27;d prefer more coonut</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very sad to say that this didn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair smell good. I have tried every type of curly hair product and nothing ever works. My hair is super curly, and pretty frizzy and it didn&#x27;t help at all. Maybe it works for other people, but just not me!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a mousse that leaves your hair naturally soft (not stiff) you will love this product.</li>
    <li> This helps manage my long hair and keeps it in place.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves much residue.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> at first i thought the mousse was amazing.. it did exactly what it advertised it would do, weightless curls with no crunchiness. After 2 weeks or soi noticed my hair getting really brittle like straw.. it wasnt dry and damaged but it did not feel soft at all like it did when i first started using this. It felt kinda like iv been washing my hair with lemon juice. as soon as i stopped using this my air went back to normal. and to make everything worse, nothing in this product is actually organic despite the brand name.</li>
    <li> I love love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It actually tightens the under eye skin and firms up your whole face! Very good product.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel very waxy. When it arrived the lid was duck taped shut and that also seemed off to me.</li>
    <li> I wish there were truly natural products that smelled this good. This mousse is ok. Weightless is a good description, because it&#x27;s hard to tell it&#x27;s even in my hair. Doesn&#x27;t kink up my curls like a lot of mousse.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t hold my hair in place, and to make matters worse, it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well, so by the time it arrived in the mail, the cap had come lose and some of the product was wasted. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouse for several years for my curly hair and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy plus people compliment me on the coconut small all the time!!&lt;br /&gt;Target and everywhere used to sell it but now I can only find it online.</li>
    <li> this makes my hair super soft and shiny my curls are defined and leaves me with no frizz would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to say this is the first Organix product i don&#x27;t like. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. I was excited when I saw this mousse, because I have never seen it in the store. I only use Organix shampoo and conditioner, but from now on I will stick with my usual mousse because this one did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes and holds my hair and gives it a wonderful coconut smell.  Is truly weightless and helps me create soft smooth curls.</li>
    <li> This mousse isn&#x27;t like any other mousse I use before, it&#x27;s really light so if your hair is straighten and you are a natural like myself. Your hair won&#x27;t go back to its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an all natural mousse, which is what I was looking for. However, the consistency comes out as a foam, but as you rub it into your hair, it becomes almost sudsy, as if you haven&#x27;t totally rinsed your hair. It works fairly well at providing some volume on blown-dried hair.</li>
    <li> A lot of reviews I saw said it made hair soft to the touch.  In my case it felt a bit sticky.  My hair holds a curl a little better with it but does not give a bounce that I was hoping for.  The smell is great though!  I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the safer ingredients. I am a bit disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling all that good, and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of providing lift for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product but vendor lakestoregift2014&#x27;s packaging is terrible. 4 bottles put on their side in box without a cap so the shifting of the box caused some of the product to leak. Pump style bottle so I hope they work</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight, fragile hair that likes to fall flat. This mousse provides great lift, without being sticky or stiff, and I don&#x27;t need to use a blow dryer with it (though I get even more lift when I do). It smells like toasted coconut, but the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. It takes a few tries to get used to the texture, but I have yet to use so much or so little it caused a problem. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be disappearing quickly, so probably lasts awhile. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I had to order this on amazon because they seem to have stopped selling it anywhere local to me.  This is a great product and I hope they make it forever!  It prevents my curls from separating and frizzing up while leaving them plenty of volume. Most importantly does not change the texture of my hair.  It still looks and feels soft and bouncy, not crunchy and wet.</li>
    <li> After searching all over the place in vain for more Organix Coconut Weightless Mousse, I found it here on Amazon and could have kicked myself for not looking here first.  I&#x27;ve been hoarding the last of a bottle I bought in a Kroger grocery store ages ago.  Anyway this stuff is wonderful.  I have medium-long naturally curly hair, a mix if white, silver and gray.  The texture of my hair with this mousse is very good, the curls dry soft and more bouncy than stiff.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products for curly hair and the Coconut Weightless is definitely my favorite.  I usually work it in thoroughly, squeeze and scrunch the curls, go outside and shake my head pretty hard, lightly finger it back off my face and let it dry on its own. However, at times I&#x27;ve applied the mousse and combed it through before rolling my hair on the big ones - old fashioned yes, but a great way to have smooth or bigger curl without a brush and a blow dryer.  It really gives good texture and softness to the (longer) style, not stiffness.  A shaping hairspray (that you can mess with after you spray it on,) protects from high humidity here.  Done this way it looks a few inches longer than when it dries curly.  Weird.  I&#x27;ll keep on using this until it disappears forever, like so many favorites over the years.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft which I like!</li>
    <li> So far using this product has been great. I styled my hair with this product and I woke up the next day with hair just as smooth and nice as when I first did it. I&#x27;m most impressed by how non-greasy it is. I put it on my dry hair and a lot got right in the first spot. With most other products that would mean having to take an emergency shower to get out all the product before you could style your hair again and go out. With this though, I did a few hair flips to dry it out and it was not only completely not greasy, but had beautiful shine and hold. Very impressive product. Invariably the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick, wavy hair. I also hate styling products but know that I need them to keep down flyaway and frizziness. I also have allergies, so heavily scented products are out. This stuff is just perfect for me. It has a nice coconut scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering--very subtle. It keeps my hair wavy but not frizzy, and I can&#x27;t feel it once it&#x27;s in and dry. The texture is a little surprising if you are used to other mousses--a very light, slightly watery foam--but do not think that means you need more of it. It isn&#x27;t for people looking for a tight hold, but I like my hair to move and not look or feel like it has any product in it, so it is perfect for me.    I put one or two squirts of it (depending on how long my hair is at the time) in my palm, rub it on both hands, and run my fingers through my wet hair. It distributes evenly very easily. Then I style/dry, and go. Nice waves, no frizz.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was not what I thought it was going to be as per the reviews that it got and how many stars.My hair is thick and curly. The only thing this product did for me was take away the frizz. I needed something that would help shape my curls out of their hot mess. I would not reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Leaves my hair silky, smooth and soft. I always let my hair air dry use it with the coconut anti-breakage serum and get soft and silky hair results.</li>
    <li> this product has no alcohol and is great smelling, foamy mousse.  i would definitely recommend this.  it&#x27;s great and good for your hair at the same time!</li>
    <li> Not Good leaves hair sticky!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I only pay $7.49&lt;br /&gt; for mines at  Publix  you are over price. I will continue to get mines from Publix.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the CurlyGirlMethod because it is water soluble. I wish it had a stiffer foam, but it probably can&#x27;t be good for the CG method and be a perfect mousse. I am still figuring out how to use it to full effect, but it seems to achieve a fluffier/fuller-bodied look than gel would.</li>
    <li> Okay this stuff is just great! for one the smell is awesome, I&#x27;m in love with it and it made my ethnic hair so soft, smooth and manageable. I even got a few curls in my relaxed hair :) But by far its the best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product if you&#x27;re thinking about it. And it looks so much bigger than the picture lol</li>
    <li> This stuff feels like nothing in your hand and on your hair, but it does the job.  My hair is not sticky and actually behaves when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this! I couldn&#x27;t find this locally anywhere, so I finally found it where I find EVERYTHING else. (Why didn&#x27;t I do it here in the first place?) Great product for fine hair. It also provides enough lift to not make it necessary to wash daily. Double yay!</li>
    <li> I love it. Highly recommended for natural looking curls. My male coworker recommended it, since I was using the awesome (and pricy) MoroccanOil. Leaves the curls feeling naturally soft and still bonds the curls so the style looks neat.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this mousse several times and I don&#x27;t know how I would do my hair without it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Sometimes hard to find, so I ordered some for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This product arrived leaking and made my hair feel sticky, I did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> I have been having a hard time finding this product in stores lately and I don&#x27;t know why.  I have very thin hair and this is perfect because it is so light weight and smells great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in over 18 months, I&#x27;m like 95% fully naturally and this product came just in time before I gave up on this life. My hair is extremely frizzy and I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for the ultimate product that would help but I always failed. This time I&#x27;ve got it right. Thank you Jesus. This product is beyond amazing. It moisturizes, and tames my hair. I barely have any frizz left after I use this and it smell so damn good. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have waist length 2a/bfii/iii hair (wavy/curly, fine, and very thick) and this is my favorite hair product. It smells amazing, cuts down on frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or crunchy. I use this several times a week and a bottle of this usually lasts me a year or so (and I have a LOT of hair). This is my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> Really liked this mousse very light, smells great and my hair didnt stay crunchy like all other mousse that i have tried before and so for a natural beach look this was GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Smells good. It&#x27;s very lightweight, which is great.</li>
    <li> Found it locally and loved it on my hair which is very fine.It is a coconut milk product and it seems to work better for me. The smell is subtle and fresh and a little goes a long way . The foam is very light and gentle and works well on damp hair..</li>
    <li> Mousse works great for my fine wavy/curly hair. Have used when air drying and blow-drying with a paddle brush. Recommend to anyone with similar hair. Rated 4 stars due to product packaging. Does not ship or travel well. Liquid leaks out of product. Thankfully Amazon ships the mousse in a sealed plastic package.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my 92 year old mother who says it&#x27;s the best!  She was a hairdresser until she was 75 years old--I beieve her.</li>
    <li> My very, very favorite mousse!  I curl my hair with hot rollers every day.  I live in Colorado where it is dry, especially in the winter.  This mousse really helps to tame the fly-aways, make my hair feel soft and helps hold the curl without my hair feeling crunchy and hard.</li>
    <li> I feel like there is no hold happening here. But it does smell good.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s not too sticky in my hair.  Most products like this contain some type of wheat to which I am allergic.  This does not and it hadn&#x27;t caused any problem for me.  The manufacturer cautions that it isn&#x27;t gluten free because some of their other products do contain wheat.  But no problem for me so far.</li>
    <li> Smells great but just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I have thinner hair and this just seems to weigh it down. Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for my hair type. I honestly bought it for its great smell. Going back to my tried and true.</li>
    <li> This product is great for frizzy hair. It calms it without weighing it down. Used it at the beach for low maintenance style, and it was perfect. gave me that wavy carefree beach look. I purchased my first bottle at a local store, and when I went to buy another bottle it was gone,  I could only find it online. Great price too. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Have trouble finding this at my local stores so was happy to find it at Amazon.  I have curly hair and it does a great job for me.</li>
    <li> Nice light mousse does not leve hair feeling heavy like it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Organix Coconut Mousse. I discovered it by accident, and mourned the empty bottle when I ran out. I was relieved to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of frizz and \\&quot;lazy curls,\\&quot; or curls that don&#x27;t quite kink and don&#x27;t quite curl. They&#x27;re sort of near a middle ground. Plus, my hair is fine and prone to breakage. When it comes to mousse and other styling products, I can&#x27;t handle anything overly heavy, or it will drive me crazy.I hate the crunchy mousse feeling (plus the accidental ripping of hair when you run your fingers and catch a mousse-glued snag), and most anti-frizz products are naturally heavy and oily. I&#x27;ve been through a rotation of products, but none of them work like this one. Organix mousse is lightweight and wears well. I can put this mousse in my hair wet and get beautifully formed curls, or dry to help keep hair locked into a style, or-in a time crunch-quickly blow dry my hair and use it to tame the frizz that inevitably follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curly-haired girls, you understand this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used lightly, this stuff will hold for two or three days without becoming gummy. Used a bit more heavily, it will provide control without looking like you&#x27;ve used a styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent, while definitely coconut, isn&#x27;t overpowering. It leans heavily toward vanilla notes, as well. If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, this one is clean and fresh...not assaulting. My hair falls midway between my shoulder blades, and it takes about three or four pumps to get full coverage for a quick blow dry. It usually takes about 8 if I&#x27;m letting it air dry and want those pretty curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $4-$6 price range I&#x27;ve seen is more than fair. I can&#x27;t possibly tell you often enough how happy I am to have a lightweight mousse that actually works as well as this one. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This mousse didnt make my hair soft, it made my hair a little rough/ I have tried better mousse that is weightless but makes your hair very shiney and soft.</li>
    <li> It smells awesome and it gives my wash-n-go style lots of nice curl (although I do combine it with aloe gel). Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s an individual thing. It&#x27;s difficult to buy something when I can&#x27;t smell it and feel it beforehand. It will be something I use sometimes. Not a daily thing.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d found this mousse sooner. It&#x27;s nice and light, holds well, smells AMAZING, and really seems to give my hair a nice shine. I put the tiniest bit in my damp hair before blow drying with a diffuser, and my hair looks and feels much softer than it ever did with other products.</li>
    <li> First of all it smells soooo good! But best of all it is weightless and makes it easy to style your hair and doesn&#x27;t look like you have a bunch of gunk on your hair. And a little goes a long way...my bottle has lasted much longer than expected. I was hesitant to purchase at first due to the small size of the bottle. It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores...I think it just sells very quick.</li>
    <li> I like it, it smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff &amp; can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere local!</li>
    <li> Great foam. It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue. It is a great leave in conditioner. This stuff is expensive but worth the purchase. I use it on my daughters hair and her hair is wavy curly.</li>
    <li> I had bought this at a local store and liked it. It was the only bottle they had and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I found a lot of other Organix products but not this so I went on Amazon to look.  Hurrah, I found it there.  I don&#x27;t usually use mousse but I loved this product and use it each time I shampoo my hair. I also found an Organix conditioner that I love- pomegrante-green tea and I use it after every shampoo. As I have aged and my hair has turned gray and, believe it or not, become curly, I have had to find new products that work better than those I have been using and Organix products do the trick for me.  I think the medications I am on have had an effect on my hair also and it is a blessing that I have been able to find products that make my hair look and feel good.  Thank heavens for Organix and their different hair products.</li>
    <li> The item arrived with the cover off, about a quarter of the product was leaking all inside the package.  Also, the front of the bottle looked old and used.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice- but the sent is very light and does not last. It does not offer any hold. Its more like a leave in conditioner- it leaves my hair soft but I will have to find something else for volume. I wont be buying this again.</li>
