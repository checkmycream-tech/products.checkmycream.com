### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Im usually very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>This is the best eye cream I have ever used, for those who have taken care of their skin over time but</li>
      <li>The product is awesome</li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, I got a very nice customer service person who immediately without any fuss gave me the return number and instructions on how to return the unused product.  </li>
      <li>I used to order this product and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The product could be good</li>
      <li>Now I learned my lesson and I&#x27;m trying to find a good under eye wrinkle cream by reading reviews before buying.</li>
      <li>Find yourself a good concealer.</li>
      <li>bottle that I just received was no..... good.  </li>
      <li>I loved the way it felt, but I cannot say I loved it because I do not believe it did what it claimed it could do.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Good thing we got it free through a promotion.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there.</li>
      <li>this didn&#x27;t do the magic it claims to do.</li>
      <li>I have used better products.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I love it and swear by it.</li>
      <li>I expect at the most it will moisturize my eye areas.....</li>
      <li>As an actor, if it had worked, I believe it would have helped me book more and better roles.  </li>
      <li>And I didn&#x27;t want to spend even more money on a lawyer....which they count on....</li>
      <li>I purchased this product from Amazon.com because the price was much lower than purchasing it from the manufacturer and was extremely satisfied with the immediate results I experienced.  </li>
      <li>love, m.</li>
      <li>Hydroleyes helped with all of those conditions, not 100%, mind you, but let&#x27;s say 65%, much better than nothing.</li>
      <li>This time when I ordered, I ordered two containers and the first one I opened was good, and I&#x27;ve been using it with no issues.  </li>
      <li>and I got rid of all the packaging because the first container was good</li>
      <li>Nothing has changed and i kinda notice more fine lines under my eyes</li>
      <li>This is an okay moisturizer, but nothing special in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>The packaging was pretty and nice.</li>
      <li>It helps reduce my puffiness and fine wrinkles, too.  </li>
      <li>Not once anywhere in the ad did they state that you would get the product for free.  </li>
      <li>They make it sound that way by saying that they want to \\&quot;send you a RISK FREE trial\\&quot; of the product.  </li>
      <li>this is an honest, unpaid for review.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product using the free 30 day trial.  </li>
      <li>I have light to medium circles under my eyes and have been using this product for 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>but don&#x27;t bother to even call for a free sample.</li>
      <li>If you order the free sample, be prepared to pay $260 if you don&#x27;t return the jars within 30 days.  </li>
      <li>The voice asked me if I wanted this or that, and when I said &#x27;no&#x27;, the voice cheerfully said \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if we only got honest reviews -- maybe I&#x27;ll put that on my Wish List.</li>
      <li>I have found much better moisturizers at a more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re better off going to CVS or your drugstore for a good eyecream around 20 dollars than believing these liars, not to mention that man speaking about his wife looking 10 years younger, what a crock of s****&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
      <li>This does not mean FREE!!  </li>
      <li>I received this as part of a set of products for a special price.</li>
      <li>Hope that this is true and I won&#x27;t have the problems that some of the reviewers mentioned.  </li>
      <li>I understood this product to be a good back up.  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>i love hydralyze and it is cheaper online than through company that produces it i will purchase more in the future</li>
      <li>The website shows an image of a jar filled with a nice creamy white substance.  </li>
      <li>but I do notice a lightening of my dark under eye rings and its a great moisturizer for the eye area.  </li>
      <li>The dark circles under my eyes have greatly improved.</li>
      <li>He even reminded me that my future orders will be cancelled and I won&#x27;t be charged or receive more product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not mad that this product is just a cream</li>
      <li>So much for a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am not done yet, but so far it is OK</li>
      <li>It is well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>I received a golden brown wax.</li>
      <li>I no longer have dark circles and lines are remarkably diminished.  </li>
      <li>I think its worth it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised I did not see more complaints like this on the internet</li>
      <li>it just wasn&#x27;t worth $100 per month.  </li>
      <li>Great product and really helps with my dark circles.  </li>
      <li>So, I decided to try month #3 by using Hydrolyze under my right eye and my favorite eye cream, MD Formulation Antioxident Moisture Defense, under my left eye.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks consistently</li>
      <li>and this is the first anti-aging product he/</li>
      <li>Would love a total refund!</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was her mascara...</li>
      <li>first 100 callers...\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Best kept secret if you ask me!</li>
      <li>Plus this cream looks and smells exactly like the \\&quot;cocobutter\\&quot; I can buy at the drugstore for about $3.99 a jar.  </li>
      <li>I first ordered this, by calling the 800 number, I got a recorded voice.</li>
      <li>Because they send you so many containers month after month, and bill you out the butt, I finally cancelled the delivery &amp; charges.  </li>
      <li>I had the same experience as most of you with customer service.</li>
      <li>Finally, somehow, I was able to cancel, after spending over $400 on this crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Haha, funny they hanged up on before before giving me the info</li>
      <li>It appears to kind of puff up the skin in the treated area, which reduces wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
      <li>I have used Hydrolize in the past and feel that the product was quite good.  </li>
      <li>The other benefits is this cream is soft and smells good.  </li>
      <li>Use the product, it really does work after prolonged use.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much it helps with this.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
      <li>It is all about expectations and keeping it real-</li>
      <li>i tried this straight for 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Dealing with the company has been an absolute nightmare.  </li>
      <li>I opened the second container and it looks like someone filled it with butter flavored Crisco.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over a year and can really tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>, I USED THIS FOR 4 WEEKS STRAIGHT, TWICE</li>
      <li>I just read this reviews as I was getting ready to call and cancel</li>
      <li>This product really works for me.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I literally lost a part of my eyebrow near the end of my eye!!!</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone who wants relief for their dark circles and would not purchase any more.</li>
      <li>I am 57 years of age and am consistently told I appear to be in my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Ok people, after 2 months of using Hydrolyze twice a day, I still had dark circles and was unsure if the product was helping at all.  </li>
      <li>I did see some results from vita-K which is less than $20 and sold in many drug stores.</li>
      <li>I will not pay a single dime or even for free.</li>
      <li>As far as the product, it smelled nice and felt soft but did nothing for the dark circles I have.  </li>
      <li>If there is nothing else you can do,  I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
      <li>This product makes your eyes young again, it really works</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Has not worked yet, been using it for a month. Jar was not factory plastic sealed.  I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my undereyes.</li>
    <li> I received this product a few days ago. When it arrived and I opened the container the product was very liquefied and spilled everywhere, I was not aware that it would be so runny. As for product effectiveness, I have not had it long enough to rate it.</li>
    <li> Two reviewers:  (1) All positive reviews for same manufacturer. (2) Only one review. It would be nice if we only got honest reviews -- maybe I&#x27;ll put that on my Wish List.</li>
    <li> It is all about expectations and keeping it real- I wonder if those people who place bad reviews on this cream have wrinkles which cannot be removed otherwise but with plastic surgery anymore, because this cream DOES work for moderately deep wrinkles and fine lines- they are almost fully gone after a week of use. If one is 45-50 y.o. and this is the first anti-aging product he/she uses and there are wrinkles size of a military trench developed over the years of neglect so one could hide in it, no point to hope that any cream will fix it- it is time to go to a plastic surgeon. This is the best eye cream I have ever used, for those who have taken care of their skin over time but other skin care products fail to deliver desired results any longer.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it claims to do!  I purchased this product from Amazon.com because the price was much lower than purchasing it from the manufacturer and was extremely satisfied with the immediate results I experienced.  I didn&#x27;t have to use my eye concealer for the dark circles and the puffiness under my eyes was reduced by 85-90 percent.  I hope Amazon will bring this product back ASAP.  It is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The item came in a box that stated it was the item I ordered, however, inside the box it was a different product.  I did not realize this until using it for over a week.  I guess I believed the party sending the product was honest....and apparently was not. Will never order from this party again.</li>
    <li> i tried this straight for 3 weeks.  nothing.  i like the creaminess of it but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my circles/bags.  i&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 weeks and saw very little change. I had a slight bit of lightening but no reduction in puffiness. And, it&#x27;s pretty expensive for a little bit of impact.</li>
    <li> Ok people, after 2 months of using Hydrolyze twice a day, I still had dark circles and was unsure if the product was helping at all.  So, I decided to try month #3 by using Hydrolyze under my right eye and my favorite eye cream, MD Formulation Antioxident Moisture Defense, under my left eye.  Well, when the month was up, guuess what??  My left eye which had the MD Formulations cream had less dark circles than the Hydrolyze eye!  So there you have it! Hydrolyze doesn&#x27;t work on dark circles!  You can buy Md Formulations for $35 as opposed to spending $80 on a product that doesn&#x27;t work!  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve had dark circles for decades.  I used it on one side only so that I could compare.  It took over a month to see a difference but the dark circle faded dramatically and the fine lines diminished, which I wasn&#x27;t even expecting.  It was a noticable improvement over the other eye.  My husbands dark circles were worse than mine.  He felt it helped a lot and now we both use it.  It works.  You need to give it time and I would highly recommend using it on one side only so that you can really measure the results.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product using the free 30 day trial.  As an actor, if it had worked, I believe it would have helped me book more and better roles.  However, after using it for nearly 30 days, there were literally no visible results.  I called the \\&quot;800\\&quot; number to get return instructions so that I could return the product.  It was very difficult, but I finally wrestled the return instructions and codes out of the representative and returned the product.  (They also shorted me one jar in the initial order.)  Three months after the fact, out of the blue, I get a bill in the mail and after a very disagreeable phone call, maybe it&#x27;s resolved.  I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath though.  I would NOT do business with these folks again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks consistently and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. In fact, I feel as though the dark circles are even darker. Is that possible? Good thing we got it free through a promotion.</li>
    <li> I received this product just a couple days after I ordered it.  I&#x27;m currently using it and will compare the results.  My doctor said to take a picture before I start using it and then take another one six weeks later to see if there&#x27;s any improvement.  That&#x27;s currently what I\\&quot;m doing but so far I think it helps.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. If you&#x27;re looking to try it, buy it off here or ebay, otherwise they will trick you into paying it despite the 30 day trial. I&#x27;m very young, but my dark eye circles and puffiness are hereditary. This product just gives you a burning sensation, and it just doesn&#x27;t work. I noticed that I have actually developed darker portions of skin under my eyes after trying this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hydrolyze for 1 year &amp; 3 months and there is ABSOLUTELY No difference! I am a male, apply it as directed EVERY SINGE DAY, and it has done NOTHING for my dark circles.  Because they send you so many containers month after month, and bill you out the butt, I finally cancelled the delivery &amp; charges.  Needless to say, I had SEVERAL of unopened boxes of this garbage that I put up on ebay and sold.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on Hydrolyze.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as most of you with customer service. It took my bank getting involved to block further billing, and they also signed me up for some type of discount clubs without my knowledge, and it took me a total of 6 months to get all of that finally stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much worse than the customer service, not only did the product do nothing for my dark circles, but after using it for about a month, it started to burn my skin, then one day a tiny bit gotin my eye and caused a severe infection. The chemicals in this product actually burned my eye and caused a permanent condition called trichiasis where my eyelashes in that eye now grow inward into my eye, causing constant irritation. If i could figure out how to prove it and pursue it, i would sue this company for permanent eye damage. Dangerous product, do not buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this in Ulta and paid around $90 for it which turned out to be an utter waste. I&#x27;m leaving a review here so that hopefully others will save their money. I used hydrolyze every day consecutively until the jar was empty and it did nothing for me. I&#x27;m 32 and at the time had only very minor puffiness on some days and minor dark circles. I also used hylexin a couple years ago which was also a waste. I did see some results from vita-K which is less than $20 and sold in many drug stores. Something containing vitamin K seems to be key to breaking up the discoloration under the skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend, who has had dark bags under her eyes ever since having her first child (probably from lack of sleep). She used it every day and night for 6 weeks, and saw NO improvement at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have light to medium circles under my eyes and have been using this product for 3 weeks.  This product simply does not work.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because with the amount of advertising this company does, you think they would have a product that produces results.</li>
    <li> It is no miracle but I do notice a lightening of my dark under eye rings and its a great moisturizer for the eye area.  It helps reduce my puffiness and fine wrinkles, too.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement until I was into the second month of use. I said its no miracle but I do look more rested, no one has told me I look tired in quite a while.  I think I look a few years younger. (I&#x27;m well into my 40&#x27;s) I tried hylexin a few years ago, I gave that 2 months and noticed no improvement.  And considering it contains no appreciable moisturizer it just wasn&#x27;t worth $100 per month.  I buy hydrolize direct from the producer, the bottle is different than pictured here but the ingredients seem to be identical.  By the way, its no cheaper there than here. Its half the price of hylexin and works twice as well.  I think its worth it.</li>
    <li> I found the same problem as few other reviewers.  The \\&quot;new\\&quot; jars of hydrolyze are thick and yellow, not white and creamy, like the previous ones. I ordered directly from the Hydroxatone company. They subsequently sent me 2 more orders, all had the same problem, they must have changed their formula with disastrous effects. I was surprised I did not see more complaints like this on the internet and there is nothing about the problem on their website. Too bad, a previously good product, gone sour.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and can really tell a difference.  The dark circles under my eyes have greatly improved.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with this product. I have been using this in good faith for a few weeks and it has not worked on the dark circles under my eyes at all! (As it is claimed on TV.)  I would not recommend this to anyone who wants relief for their dark circles and would not purchase any more.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few weeks ago and have been using it everyday. Nothing has changed and i kinda notice more fine lines under my eyes then I had before :(. I bought it for circles and puffiness and didn&#x27;t have any change in either area. I&#x27;m not mad that this product is just a cream but it does make me sad that i was so excited for nothing. Now I learned my lesson and I&#x27;m trying to find a good under eye wrinkle cream by reading reviews before buying.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s sister went for the \\&quot;Free Trial\\&quot; of Hydrolyze after looking at a few websites. Unfortunately, she only found the phoney websites purporting to represent testimonials from real uses. She didn&#x27;t dig far enough into Google results to find the THOUSANDS of Complaints about this company and the product. The \\&quot;Free Offer\\&quot; is a total scam an should shut down by the FTC. The product is a waste of money that doesn&#x27;t work. This is an example of sophisticated Bernie Maddoff type con-artists investing big bucks in websites and TV ads to rip off vulnerable women.</li>
    <li> I just read this reviews as I was getting ready to call and cancel so I can returned the unused products.  As far as the product, it smelled nice and felt soft but did nothing for the dark circles I have.  Surprisingly, I got a very nice customer service person who immediately without any fuss gave me the return number and instructions on how to return the unused product.  He even reminded me that my future orders will be cancelled and I won&#x27;t be charged or receive more product!  Hope that this is true and I won&#x27;t have the problems that some of the reviewers mentioned.  I will use a delivery confirmation service just in case.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and with a strangely soupy texture, this did nothing for my undereye situation.  Avoid the hype and visit truthinaging.com.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs to listen to the words on the commercial.  They advertise \\&quot;RISK FREE\\&quot; trial.  This does not mean FREE!!  Please don&#x27;t be confused by this.  Not once anywhere in the ad did they state that you would get the product for free.  They make it sound that way by saying that they want to \\&quot;send you a RISK FREE trial\\&quot; of the product.  Please don&#x27;t fall for this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and used it for over a month with no change in the appearance of my under eye dark circles. I contacted the company about returning it, never a response. Save your money before you think about buying this product.</li>
    <li> Not only did product not work, but it gave me a horrible allergic reaction.  Dealing with the company has been an absolute nightmare.  I should have known it was a scam from the TV commercials.  \\&quot;The first 100 callers...\\&quot; \\&quot;If lines are busy, keep trying...\\&quot;  Please.  If you look at the \\&quot;caller counter\\&quot; on the commercial, it&#x27;s the exact same in every airing of the commercial!  Makes sense, because the only way they could be giving an actual count is to have a \\&quot;live\\&quot; commercial every single time.  Would they really need to use such a ploy if the product actually worked??</li>
    <li> I am not done yet, but so far it is OK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hydrolyze for a while and it does work.  This time when I ordered, I ordered two containers and the first one I opened was good, and I&#x27;ve been using it with no issues.  I opened the second container and it looks like someone filled it with butter flavored Crisco.  It is thick and yellow, not Hydrolyze that&#x27;s for sure.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I got rid of all the packaging because the first container was good, I trusted that the second one would be too.       I&#x27;ve always felt that ordering through Amazon.com was safe, but now I&#x27;m a little skeptical.  Lesson learned, I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.      If I were rating just the product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but because I feel that I was scammed, I&#x27;m only giving 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HIDEOUS DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, AND WRINKLES. THIS WAS DUE TO WEARING GLASSES AND ALSO HEREDITARY, I USED THIS FOR 4 WEEKS STRAIGHT, TWICE A DAY. I DID SEE MY DARK CIRCLES LIGHTENED AND MY PUFFINESS WAS GONE, MY WRINKLES BECAME SOFTER. BUT I DIDNT USE IT AFTER THE 4 WEEKS AND EVERYTHING CAME BACK WITHIN A MONTH OR SO.... I WILL TRY A DIFFERENT PRODUCT NEXT TIME THOUGH. I BOUGHT IT FROM THE HYDRALIZE WEBSITE AND PAID DOUBLE FOR IT THERE.</li>
    <li> Save your money! The worst product on the market! There are better products out there. Save your $50.00. Would love a total refund!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, over a year ago, off the TV. Little did I know the price, as it was \\&quot;free\\&quot; at first. But can I tell you \\&quot;I&#x27;d pay anything!\\&quot; The minute you dab it around your eye area, being very careful not to get in the eye, you will notice that it will \\&quot;take out the puffiness!\\&quot; Also I noticed my circles and lines going away. I have olive skin and dark eyes and am 47 years old. This product is great. I put a little (use sparingly) around my eyes , certain spots on my face, daily. I love it and swear by it. Best kept secret if you ask me!</li>
    <li> DANGERRR!! my 16 year old lost the majority of her lashes by using this \\&quot;harsh product\\&quot;!!! I did not know up until i noticed her eyes were missing something...Yes...her EYE LASHES!!! At first, I thought it was her mascara...but then I decided to use it to see...and then I experience a horrible BURNING sensation that raced up to my eye!!! Then as horrible as that was...I literally lost a part of my eyebrow near the end of my eye!!! Horrible Product and Horrible customer service that would not reimburse and cancel my shipments as soon as possible!!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t purchase it--doesn&#x27;t work!!  I tried getting my money back &amp; they wouldn&#x27;t refund me damn liars!&lt;br /&gt; No Stars from me!! Well I had to give them 1 star or it wouldn&#x27;t submit my review</li>
    <li> It idid not work for me. I wanted it for under eye puffiness.  Perhaps it would work for dark circles. I do not have them. So would not purchase this again for what I need.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a set of products for a special price. I&#x27;m glad I did because paying full price for this would have been disappointing to say the least!  This is an okay moisturizer, but nothing special in my opinion.  So buy it if you want to pay top dollar for something that is relatively mediocre.  I have found much better moisturizers at a more reasonable price.  As far as dark circles go, forget about it!  Find yourself a good concealer.</li>
    <li> I have bags under my eyes, and dark circles, and I have seasonal allergy that makes my eyes even puffier. Hydroleyes helped with all of those conditions, not 100%, mind you, but let&#x27;s say 65%, much better than nothing. And I started to see the results after maybe a week and a half after starting the product. Better than I expected. The jar last me at least 4 months. When I ran out of the product and didn&#x27;t use anything for a while, my eyes returned to their puffy dark look again. Now I&#x27;m using several products in combination Hyaluronic acid Serum, Vita-K, and Neutragena Radiance Boost all combined. Not bad at all. But I&#x27;m ordering Hydroleyes again because I hope that it&#x27;ll work well in combination with hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t do the magic it claims to do. I have used better products. The packaging was pretty and nice.</li>
    <li> I will purchase from this distributor again!  The product is awesome and I receive what I paid for! I love it!</li>
    <li> It is the only product that for a day makes my dark circles under my eye and puffiness actually seem to disappear</li>
    <li> I used to order this product and loved the results.  Something was wrong with my last two orders.  It would not blend in under my eyes and left a yellow color that soon peeled off.  Not good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but it has made a difference for me and one container lasts me about 6 months, which makes it a little easier to pay that much for it.</li>
    <li> The Product does not work!! The customer service is even worse. We called after returning everything and they basically said we were lying and never sent it all back!!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this product is over rated and over priced.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews- but this product appears to be a well managed, and carefully worded internet campaign to separate you from your money on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;  Un-like other creams ( like Nivea/Breirsdorf ), there are no published peer reviewed articles on PuBMed, where you can verify that the parent company actually did some research on their ingredients. Plus this cream looks and smells exactly like the \\&quot;cocobutter\\&quot; I can buy at the drugstore for about $3.99 a jar.  DO NOT waste your time on this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
    <li> Was not worth the money did not work at all big FAIL  FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars I would.  If you order the free sample, be prepared to pay $260 if you don&#x27;t return the jars within 30 days.  It doesn&#x27;t work and their marketing practices are fraudulent.  don&#x27;t fall into their trap!</li>
    <li> Ive purchased this product before from another site and it seems as though it has been changed. The consistancy is different and doesnt seem to work as well. I dont know why.May try to order from another company and see if its the same there. Im usually very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I wish I never saw the misleading ad on tv claiming that it could get rid of dark eye circles. These people lie over the charges (made extra ones without letting me know) And the nasty product was really thick and burned! Calling the company? Haha, funny they hanged up on before before giving me the info I needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even charged for shipping (that was way over-priced!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that is thick, nasty, burns and stings with a company that doesn&#x27;t answer questions and promotes lies this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, AVOID THESE JERKS!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 1-1/2 years now.  I no longer have dark circles and lines are remarkably diminished.  No, I am not employed by the maker of this product.  I am 57 years of age and am consistently told I appear to be in my early 40&#x27;s.  Just like with anything else, you&#x27;ve got to be patient.  Use the product, it really does work after prolonged use.  If you&#x27;re searching for a 3-6 month miracle, go to a plastic surgeon - you&#x27;ll spend 100 times over the cost of this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was rather disappointed to received this jar which appears to be old and was thick.  Needless to say, that makes applying to the area under the eyes a bit difficult.</li>
    <li> The product was not white in color but dark beige and texture like play dough . I think I got a defective bottle but it was too late to return it so I&#x27;m stuck with it and its too clumpy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product could be good and maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong , but isn&#x27;t this supposed to be creamy and white? Mine is amber and solid. Still using it but  very disappointed in it. I will probably end up throwing it out .</li>
    <li> I loved the way it felt, but I cannot say I loved it because I do not believe it did what it claimed it could do.  My eyes definitely felt and seemed more hydrated, but I cannot say it did anything to diminish dark circles.</li>
    <li> It was a dirty yellow or a dirty off white in color.  Just looked and felt like it was old product nothing like the one I had previously.</li>
    <li> works as it says it does. I&#x27;ve noticed dark circles slowly disapearing after thre weeks. This product really works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time, 3 times a day with no change. If anything, I look worse !</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me nor anyone I know. Another gimmick, don&#x27;t waste money on purchasing it. Waste of time.......</li>
    <li> The company that sells this is a sham, and they are scam artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered this, by calling the 800 number, I got a recorded voice. The voice asked me if I wanted this or that, and when I said &#x27;no&#x27;, the voice cheerfully said \\&quot;okay\\&quot;. Little did I know that my answers were not recorded, so I ended up getting shipment after shipment that I did not want. When I called the company, they said I had ordered automatic shipments of the product. I said I had not, and asked them to prove that I had. They said they&#x27;d call me with my recorded statements, but I never heard from them, and in the meantime received another shipment. Finally, somehow, I was able to cancel, after spending over $400 on this crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the product does not work. Zilch, nada, nothing. I couldn&#x27;t prove that I hadn&#x27;t ordered the additional shipments...how would I prove that? And I didn&#x27;t want to spend even more money on a lawyer....which they count on....so I&#x27;m out that money that I couldn&#x27;t afford. So much for a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came upon the unopened product tonite and decided to try it again....I expect at the most it will moisturize my eye areas.....but don&#x27;t bother to even call for a free sample. As they say, there is a sucker born every minute, and I am, evidently, a sucker.</li>
    <li> It effective at doing the job as advertised, but is an expensive solution to the problem.  It appears to kind of puff up the skin in the treated area, which reduces wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
    <li> This product makes your eyes young again, it really works</li>
    <li> used it for 2 months nothing worked.  I still look the same no changes a waste of money and time</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s more expensive than living, eating and sleeping properly.  However--there are a lot of reasons, including genetics for dark circles under the eyes.  Mine was inexhaustible on going stress.  It worked well.  When I realized the problem was ME-- I understood this product to be a good back up.  If you have problems with dark circles--check with your M.D. to rule out medical or genetic reasons.  If there is nothing else you can do,  I highly recommend this cream.  It worked.  love, m.</li>
    <li> Great product and really helps with my dark circles.  I use it along with a retinoid product to reduce the look of lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week and my bags were reduced by 80%.  I wish I could post the pictures.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before.  I have tried every eye cream under the sun and nothing has worked for 3 years.  I even got an estimate from an eye doctor for surgery to remove the eye bags.  The other benefits is this cream is soft and smells good.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes so I don&#x27;t know how much it helps with this.  I did read all the bad reviews but still decided to try it.  I&#x27;m assuming it may not work on all skin types and that&#x27;s why it got bad reviews.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m 77 years old  my eyes are not wrinkled  or have dark shadows  under them  seems to work for me</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have been using it for a few years now.  Without it I would look like a raccoon!</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised. I think it is all a marketing gimmick. I will not pay a single dime or even for free. I have been using it but no visible results can be seen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this eye cream int the morning. It gets rid of puffiness quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel it working.</li>
    <li> I have used Hydrolize in the past and feel that the product was quite good.  For me it smoothed small lines around my eyes and because of that I used it around my mouth where those nasty things appear.  It worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle that I just received was no..... good.  It had set on the shelf way too long.  Bad Bad Bad</li>
    <li> i love hydralyze and it is cheaper online than through company that produces it i will purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> I bought this product 1 month ago because I saw the commercials on tv.  I have very dark circles under my eyes and I thought this product would work. Not only did it NOT work, but I felt like I was putting on a placebo.  I tried several under eye creams with no luck.  This one was bad too.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  I wish I could find a product that does work for dark circles under eyes.</li>
    <li> honestly, the commercials make me sick and this is the first review i have ever written but i must write to say that this cream is total BS.  i bought 5 jars at once, at the time i had the money so why not.  well, i didnt notice any change at all, not even in the slightest!!  you&#x27;re better off going to CVS or your drugstore for a good eyecream around 20 dollars than believing these liars, not to mention that man speaking about his wife looking 10 years younger, what a crock of s****&lt;br /&gt;save your money, ladies.  this is an honest, unpaid for review.  if i could give a negative star, i would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sincerely&lt;br /&gt;a 46 year old female.</li>
    <li> The product I received was NOT Hydrolyze. I&#x27;ve been ordering it for years and was shocked when I opened the jar and found a flat sticky gelatinous blob of glue. It was like a dried out fried egg. I&#x27;m ordering another container from the manufacturer. Forget this bogus site!</li>
    <li> I have been usung it for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any noticible results. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meets what I expected by all the hype it&#x27;s being given.Ii thought I&#x27;d see at least a little improvement after 3 weeks. I won&#x27;t give up on it yet. It&#x27;s too expensive not to stick with it longer. I figure if I don&#x27;t see an improvement after a couple of months I&#x27;ll just add it to the collection of other products i&#x27;ve tried that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
    <li> The website shows an image of a jar filled with a nice creamy white substance.  What arrived is a jar of yellow almost solid substance that just crumbles when you try to apply it around the eyes.  Returning it today.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just received it. I should have read the reviews before purchasing. The pictures show a white cream. I received a golden brown wax.</li>
