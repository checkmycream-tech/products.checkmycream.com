### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Although this shampoo leaves my hair and scalp feeling great, I do not like the smell of it at all!</li>
      <li>Before they changed, it seemed like the \\&quot;one\\&quot; without sulfates and the perfect combination of ingredients.</li>
      <li>After trying the Soap Nuts Soap I was not all that impressed for the price.</li>
      <li>This used to be the best dandruff shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>: Worked as stated, good scent</li>
      <li>This was once a good product, but they removed the ketoconazole.  </li>
      <li>so I could be fair with the results.</li>
      <li>I still believe this is a good product</li>
      <li>we love this product!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects, the scent was pleasant, and even the packaging was appealing.</li>
      <li>Fortunately for me, the bottle I bought was the original formula and it works beautifully; my son&#x27;s tortured scalp was in great shape after just a month or so of using this once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>The smell is still kind of like a men&#x27;s deodorant--but fades soon after use.</li>
      <li>shimmery flowed nice.</li>
      <li>I can effectively address this with exfoliant wash and added moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Dandrene worked great when I first started.</li>
      <li>You used a small portion, it lathered nicely, smelled good, and best of all it worked.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>yes I got the newer version that many are not liking.  </li>
      <li>I love both of these shampoos.</li>
      <li>all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Love it:)</li>
      <li>This used to work great for me, but the last two bottles I purchased were not any better than &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; off the shelf shampoos.  </li>
      <li>DS Laboratories have completly ruined this once fine product.</li>
      <li>I will probably buy this again because it seems to do a pretty good job with my itchy scalp and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth, even without conditioner, but I wish it smelled better!</li>
      <li>I am dandruff free after 5 years.</li>
      <li>it must be fantastic for them to charge so</li>
      <li>It lathered great during the second wash.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, 6 months ago I stumbled upon Dandrene.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Original</li>
      <li>I noticed immediately how clean it was getting my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I also have finally settled on a good soap too,</li>
      <li>Very fancy for a shampoo, smells good and makes my hair feel very soft and no dandruff.  </li>
      <li>I came upon the original formula after a long search and loved it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it cleared mine.</li>
      <li>I read lots of reviews before I bought this item, many complaining about the new formula that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>Amazon Prime seems to change which seller it works with, but it&#x27;s worth skipping Prime to get the correct formula.</li>
      <li>Its worth it to me just for that.</li>
      <li>All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good.</li>
      <li>so I went in for a good haircut with high quality products and loaded with questions about ridding myself of a dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I think the first bottle I got was the old formula, which I have to say worked better, though it smelled intensely like men&#x27;s deodorant (musk-scent).</li>
      <li>, then rinse, which my hair did not lather at all in first wash...</li>
      <li>For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene.</li>
      <li>well that must be broke, so the push button top can work properly.  </li>
      <li>So while this has helped with conserving my $[...] supply, it takes quite an effort first thing in the AM to get my shampoo fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first bought it on a recommendation from an employee who cut my hair there</li>
      <li>The Dandrene worked very well- at least better than most anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Cannot find Nizoral at all, except at VERY HIGH prices.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apparently DS Labs and their re-sellers don&#x27;t care about their customers and are more concerned about short term profits rather than delivering a high quality product--or as they advertise \\&quot;high performance\\&quot;--which</li>
      <li>I just got this, I bought it because nothing really fights the sebum on the scalp problem.  </li>
      <li>So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me.</li>
      <li>in all this products performs well and arrived fast with Prime.</li>
      <li>Still, the appearance of the small white flakes has been *greatly* reduced.</li>
      <li>I could see if it was a very special salon brand, or made with ingredients found in some remote corner of the world..</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months</li>
      <li>I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap.</li>
      <li>When I got the shampoo I noticed that the color of it is a light pink color.</li>
      <li>I complained to Amazon and got a refund (from Amazon, not the seller), and reordered from the seller that I originally used -- and got the original formula.</li>
      <li>The oily film that  has been a constant on my scalp seems to be gone after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really want to comment on is people saying it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
      <li>He has tried several prescription shampoos, salon tea tree treatments, etcetera, without much success.  </li>
      <li>My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap.</li>
      <li>So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more.</li>
      <li>Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then.</li>
      <li>If you peel back the label you discover that it used to be the advertised, and much higher quality ingredient, ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>because it is my first use, I will have to see how I am liking this after some regular use.  </li>
      <li>although after I dropped it in the shower, I saw that there the TOP has a small plastic</li>
      <li>as for now I am just happy the thick sebum seems to b gone off my scalp at long last!  </li>
      <li>Because nizoral is impossible to find, the next best option is to seek out DS Lab&#x27;s Revita Hair Loss Shampoo which (as this is written) still has the Ketoconazole.</li>
      <li>I started using \\&quot;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair\\&quot; the first week of</li>
      <li>Now it uses the one of the old discount store dandruff control elements - either the s. acid, zinc, or tar.  </li>
      <li>B000Y8SJCO Theraneem Gentle Therape Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], followed by a second wash with Dandrene, and leave on the Dandrene for about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>and they both don&#x27;t foam up enough to feel like they are doing much of anything.</li>
      <li>As far as dandruff control, neither provided me any improvement.</li>
      <li>Thus far this works for me.  </li>
      <li>They really should go back.</li>
      <li>After using this shampoo once or twice he said the scaling and itching had improved dramatically, and within a week had cleared completely.</li>
      <li>I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of.</li>
      <li>After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights.</li>
      <li>While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
      <li>May. I also began using \\&quot;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo\\&quot; at the same time.</li>
      <li>I now only have to use it once a week to keep my scalp clear!!  </li>
      <li>I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it.</li>
      <li>I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time.</li>
      <li>I use the \\&quot;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair\\&quot; every day and only use the \\&quot;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo\\</li>
      <li>The new formula only knocks out the layered patches of yellowish flakes, and my scalp is still itchy--but nothing like before.</li>
      <li>The old formula knocked out both types of dandruff, and left me completely itch-free.  </li>
      <li>far the results are the same.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, one was a green bottle with a strong but decent odor and had greenish shampoo in it, the other was gray with a slate blue/gray bottle and a severely over-fragranced product within.</li>
      <li>: Seller Plentycosas sells the ORIGINAL formula, the one that actually works and is a thick shampoo.</li>

<li> So I called DS Laboratories and was told that it would never come in that pink color and that none of their distributors sell on Amazon so it is most likely a fake product.</li>
<li> The green product would receive closer to 4 stars but this grey substance I received more recently is not so good.</li>
<li> I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue.</li>
<li> As stated in a previous review I hope they come to their senses and return to the old formula.</li>
<li> Especially in the dry winter months, my itchy scalp persisted.</li>
<li> It smells a little like old man&#x27;s cologne but it works wonders for dandruff.</li>
<li> the other formula which was the same name was liquidy and made suds.  </li>
<li> Actual Review is August of 2011 (see my other review of the Soap Nuts Shampoo to verify the date written).</li>
<li> , I can switch to using other brand of shampoos (not the dandruff one) and still don&#x27;t get the dandruff back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle!  Even my hubby uses it and it also works for him.  we love this product!</li>
    <li> The product description says it contains climbazole but the bottle I received says it contains ketoconazole. I bought this specifically because I wanted an alternative to ketoconazole, so I&#x27;m a dissatisfied customer and would give this a zero star rating if I could.  Also, the shampoo is dark moss green / muddy green and smells terrible.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Even if you have used it before. DS Laboratories have completly ruined this once fine product. Now, it does not work. I came upon the original formula after a long search and loved it. You used a small portion, it lathered nicely, smelled good, and best of all it worked. Now that they changed the formula it is a bitter disapointment, unfortunately I did not discover this until I had already purchased 4 bottles. As stated in a previous review I hope they come to their senses and return to the old formula. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman who has struggled with serious dandruff all of my life, and like others I&#x27;ve tried every over-the-counter product out there. I have seborrheic dermatitis which results from a combination of an over production of skin oil and irritation from a yeast called malessizia. On my scalp I had both the characteristic layered patches of yellowish dry skin flakes which could be the size of a dime, as well as the small white flakes that are the size of small seed (picture quinoa or mustard), but can rival a blizzard in number--wearing black was a study in vigilance! Plus my scalp was *always* painfully itchy; sometimes I scratched so hard that the sound of my fingernails on my scalp would actually attract attention from people nearby. Fortunately, 6 months ago I stumbled upon Dandrene. I think the first bottle I got was the old formula, which I have to say worked better, though it smelled intensely like men&#x27;s deodorant (musk-scent). The old formula knocked out both types of dandruff, and left me completely itch-free.  The new formula only knocks out the layered patches of yellowish flakes, and my scalp is still itchy--but nothing like before. Still, the appearance of the small white flakes has been *greatly* reduced. I&#x27;ve never been this confident about my hair&#x27;s appearance before, and wearing black (or any other solid dark color) is far less anxiety-producing. The smell is still kind of like a men&#x27;s deodorant--but fades soon after use. Plus I use a leave-in conditioner and moisturizing hair spritz and they seem to block the remaining Dandrene scent. I use Dandrene between 2 - 3 times per week. Because it doesn&#x27;t lather well, and it&#x27;s expensive, I tend to do a first wash with a neem-based shampoo (I was using a neem &amp; tea tree oil based shampoo but it was too harsh on my scalp) by TheraNeem [[ASIN:B000Y8SJCO Theraneem Gentle Therape Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], followed by a second wash with Dandrene, and leave on the Dandrene for about 5 minutes. Thus far this works for me.  One note: the seborrheic dermatitis on my face (eyebrows and sides of my nose) which had almost disappeared in the past 10 years, has returned since I started using Dandrene. I can effectively address this with exfoliant wash and added moisturizer. But if you have serious skin sensitivities (rosacea, etc.), this may be something for you to consider.</li>
    <li> I had to delete my previous 5 star review. This used to be the best dandruff shampoo on the market. But it has been recently reformulated, and has gone way down hill. It&#x27;s now more of a paste than a liquid, and is very difficult to even get out of the bottle. It has very little sudsing action, and it feels pretty worthless as a result. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An e-mail to the manufacturer went unanswered.</li>
    <li> Actual Review is August of 2011 (see my other review of the Soap Nuts Shampoo to verify the date written). I started using these products in May of 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Original Review\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months so I could be fair with the results. I started using \\&quot;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair\\&quot; the first week of May. I also began using \\&quot;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo\\&quot; at the same time. For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene. I did this for 7 days using both. After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights. Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then. I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time. The build-up on my scalp was thick and you could feel the scabs and ridges as you rubbed across my scalp. I forget the actual medical condition I had but it was bad and has been that way for the past 18 years, probably longer. I have tried every store brand I could get my hands on and started using products found at Trader Joe&#x27;s (Jason&#x27;s, Tea Tree Oil and Citrus Shampoos) all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos. I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue. I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it. So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me. The only itch I have now is sweat from throughout the day, but by the time I wash my scalp at night I finallyhave relief again. Now if only I can find something to stop me from sweating? \\&quot;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of. I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap. All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good. My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap. While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little. I cannot wait to try the soap Nuts Soap to see how this works. I hope this review helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of 05/25/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the results are the same. I have not had one flake of dandruff for over a year and not one scab on my head. I still wash the same way. I use the \\&quot;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair\\&quot; every day and only use the \\&quot;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo\\&quot; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s. I love both of these shampoos. I also have finally settled on a good soap too, that does not leave my skin flaky and itchy like all the other soaps I have tried. After trying the Soap Nuts Soap I was not all that impressed for the price. It did work, but no more so than the olive oil soap I have resorted to. So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more. I now use this soap only and it seems to be working quite well with no skin irritation after using the soap. Again, I hope my brief comments are of use to others.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out...Can&#x60;t judge product yet.</li>
    <li> Works well for dandruff. Only have to use for a couple of weeks and then you can switch back to your regular shampoo. Only have to use when needed. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells like aftershave and shows ketoconazole in it still on the label and it doesn&#x27;t lather that well.&lt;br /&gt;I did add 5 200mg keto to the shampo</li>
    <li> i have ordered this product before and this formula seems completely different.  it comes out as a thick brown blob.  the other formula which was the same name was liquidy and made suds.  this does not.  i am completely disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Sometimes you just have to take a chance.. but [...] bucks for a bottle of shampoo? I could see if it was a very special salon brand, or made with ingredients found in some remote corner of the world.. it must be fantastic for them to charge so much.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it; virtually all of the over-the-counter shampoos (and even a couple prescription ones) that I&#x27;ve tried have had mixed results. Especially in the dry winter months, my itchy scalp persisted. The Dandrene worked very well- at least better than most anything else I&#x27;ve used. It didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects, the scent was pleasant, and even the packaging was appealing. About the packaging, though.. perhaps I had a bad bottle, but each time I used it I needed to apply 40-50 LB FT of pressure to the bottle to get even the smallest trickle of shampoo to come out. So while this has helped with conserving my $[...] supply, it takes quite an effort first thing in the AM to get my shampoo fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Worked as stated, good scent&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Weird dispensing mechanism, super-expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy it again, but no more than once or twice a year. If it were $14.95 I&#x27;d have one shipped every other month, but at twice that cost I can&#x27;t justify the expense. YMMV.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks. I have tried everything you can imagine. Before they changed, it seemed like the \\&quot;one\\&quot; without sulfates and the perfect combination of ingredients. They really should go back. Makes no sense.. at all.</li>
    <li> Being one whom has had issues with dry scalp, due to oily hair.  I use this product 3X a week and my flakes have almost gone away.  I would shower and within an hour, I would have flakes on my shirt.  This product has helped a TON, again coming from someone who has visited 3 Dermatologists, tried numerous prescription shampoos, ointments, tonics, OTC shampoos. This stuff WORKS!!!!!   Some people complain about the difficulty of squeezing the product out.  Well... I did too, although after I dropped it in the shower, I saw that there the TOP has a small plastic well that must be broke, so the push button top can work properly.  I would have never realized that, and I&#x27;m an engineer.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, the ingredient list on my bottle had a sticker over it indicating that ketoconazole was no longer part of the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad this was NEVER stated in the description on order webpage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tough to get a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peculiar smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive and misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells a little like old man&#x27;s cologne but it works wonders for dandruff. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it cleared mine. I had such bad itching and flaking and right away after using it the itching went away and within a few days the amount of flakes had decreased immensely. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Update*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I have ordered another bottle of this from Payless Beauty on Amazon. When I got the shampoo I noticed that the color of it is a light pink color. Not the same as the greenish grey color of the previous shampoo I had ordered. So I called DS Laboratories and was told that it would never come in that pink color and that none of their distributors sell on Amazon so it is most likely a fake product. I still believe this is a good product but you take your chances on whether or not you&#x27;re buying a fake product if you buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> They have reformulated the product and have chosen not to update the description on the product page. The way you can tell is that when you receive the product the ingredients listing is pasted over with a sticker that tells you that the active ingredient is now salisylic acid. If you peel back the label you discover that it used to be the advertised, and much higher quality ingredient, ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently DS Labs and their re-sellers don&#x27;t care about their customers and are more concerned about short term profits rather than delivering a high quality product--or as they advertise \\&quot;high performance\\&quot;--which this is not. Stay away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I can return the product since I discovered the fraud before I opened the package.</li>
    <li> I like it but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.  Very fancy for a shampoo, smells good and makes my hair feel very soft and no dandruff.  I cant stand the consistency of the shampoo though, kinda spendy too so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews before I bought this item, many complaining about the new formula that didn&#x27;t work as well. Fortunately for me, the bottle I bought was the original formula and it works beautifully; my son&#x27;s tortured scalp was in great shape after just a month or so of using this once or twice a week. When I ordered our next bottle, however, we got the dreaded &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; formula. The seller claimed no refunds (not mentioned when I bought it). I complained to Amazon and got a refund (from Amazon, not the seller), and reordered from the seller that I originally used -- and got the original formula. So here&#x27;s what I learned: Seller Plentycosas sells the ORIGINAL formula, the one that actually works and is a thick shampoo. The seller BeautyAnd sells the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; formula, liquidy brown ick, and refuses returns. Amazon Prime seems to change which seller it works with, but it&#x27;s worth skipping Prime to get the correct formula.</li>
    <li> Cannot find Nizoral at all, except at VERY HIGH prices. That is only product that works! What is going on with Nizoral?</li>
    <li> and I swear I received two completely different products. They had a few things in common, such as, the bottles are both really difficult to squeeze shampoo out of and they both don&#x27;t foam up enough to feel like they are doing much of anything. On the other hand, one was a green bottle with a strong but decent odor and had greenish shampoo in it, the other was gray with a slate blue/gray bottle and a severely over-fragranced product within. The green product would receive closer to 4 stars but this grey substance I received more recently is not so good. As far as dandruff control, neither provided me any improvement.</li>
    <li> As other reviews have stated, the formula must have changed.  This used to work great for me, but the last two bottles I purchased were not any better than &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; off the shelf shampoos.  Performance doesn&#x27;t justify the cost anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle of Dandrene I have purchased for my nephew, who has severe seborrheic dermatitis of his scalp.  He has tried several prescription shampoos, salon tea tree treatments, etcetera, without much success.  After using this shampoo once or twice he said the scaling and itching had improved dramatically, and within a week had cleared completely.</li>
    <li> This was once a good product, but they removed the ketoconazole.  Now it uses the one of the old discount store dandruff control elements - either the s. acid, zinc, or tar.  Because nizoral is impossible to find, the next best option is to seek out DS Lab&#x27;s Revita Hair Loss Shampoo which (as this is written) still has the Ketoconazole.</li>
    <li> I just got this, I bought it because nothing really fights the sebum on the scalp problem.  everything I have tried still leaves the thick oil on the scalp and I can feel it there.&lt;br /&gt;So thought I would try this.  yes I got the newer version that many are not liking.  I noticed immediately how clean it was getting my scalp.  The oily film that  has been a constant on my scalp seems to be gone after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really want to comment on is people saying it doesn&#x27;t lather.  Mine did.  HOWEVER there is tiny print on the bottle that you need a magnifying glass to read and after you read it you see you have to wash your hair once, then rinse, which my hair did not lather at all in first wash... then you wash again and leave it on a few minutes.  It lathered great during the second wash.  Note: we do have water softener so that always helps soaps and shampoos to lather.&lt;br /&gt;I only give three stars on this review because it is my first use, I will have to see how I am liking this after some regular use.  as for now I am just happy the thick sebum seems to b gone off my scalp at long last!  Its worth it to me just for that.</li>
    <li> Dandrene worked great when I first started. I&#x27;m not sure if I used it too often but I started to notice flakes coming back after a while. I changed up my shampoo and go back and forth to Dandrene and my scalp is currently flake-free. I first bought it on a recommendation from an employee who cut my hair there (I know-but hear me out). I was having a pretty bad dandruff problem so I went in for a good haircut with high quality products and loaded with questions about ridding myself of a dry scalp. They also recommended conditioner and that I change the hair gel I use so I will be posting a similar story under those items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this products performs well and arrived fast with Prime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my scalp cleared up for months...  Spent tons of money then came across some reviews for this product and decided to try it!!  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I now only have to use it once a week to keep my scalp clear!!  Love it:)</li>
    <li> Tried different products for 5 years (Apple Cider Vinegar shampoo, Head&amp;Shoulders,Neutrogena T-Gel,Selsun Blue, Nizoral,Tea Tree Oil...you name it!!!).  All did not work for me. After finishing up 1 bottle.. I can tell you I am dandruff free after 5 years. It has been 3 months now since I haven&#x27;t use Dandrene.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can switch to using other brand of shampoos (not the dandruff one) and still don&#x27;t get the dandruff back.  Dandrene is not just a shampoo to me but it felt like the medicine that cured my scalp. I just bought this just in case it comes back.</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo leaves my hair and scalp feeling great, I do not like the smell of it at all! Not only is it a fairly unpleasant smell, but it&#x27;s quite overpowering...and it seems to last even if I wash my hair with a different shampoo the next day. I will probably buy this again because it seems to do a pretty good job with my itchy scalp and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth, even without conditioner, but I wish it smelled better!</li>
    <li> the shampoo was completely different than the one a bought at a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;it was like green gelled mud.the one i bought at the hair salon was green shimmery flowed nice.</li>
