      <li>Easy to zip and stuff items inside.</li>
      <li>good product, nice to have it especially travel time</li>
      <li>This little bag is a perfect fit to hold all my lip gloss and lip liners.  </li>
      <li>All of mine fit inside</li>
      <li>My regular hooks fit very nicely and I can see them through the mesh which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>so is a perfect size for the few items she wants to take with her.</li>

      <li>The quality of the bag is nice, however you can&#x27;t get much in it because it&#x27;s very narrow at the bottom and not an inch like the desccription states.</li>
      <li>Quality bag but only good for holding a few brushes or pencils.</li>
      <li>I love this little bag.</li>
      <li>I am able to fit 5 Mac brushes without disturbing the shape of them--powder brush, blush brush, foundation brush, and 2 eye shadow brushes.</li>
      <li>For other purposes, you could probably fit a couple lipglosses, but not much more if you were looking to use this as a makeup bag.</li>

    <li> This make-up bag was a gift for my daughter; she loves it!  She is a make-up minimalist so is a perfect size for the few items she wants to take with her.</li>
    <li> I like this bag.  However, one of the larger make-up brushes I purchased will not fit.  Be sure to check dimensions on your brushes prior to ordering.</li>

    <li> This is a great make-up brush bag. It holds my sigma brushes great. It will not hold my biggest make-up blush brushes tho.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This a very nice mesh bag.  It is well made, the zipper works smoothly and would do the job it&#x27;s advertised for, make up brush holder, very well.  I bought it to hold/store my regular crochet hooks and it is working very well for my purpose.  My regular hooks fit very nicely and I can see them through the mesh which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Prefect size for my makeup bag holds all my pencils and brushes. Good price and product</li>
    <li> Perfect makeup bag. Well made, great color, good zipper.  I love this little bag. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this for my makeup brushes. It&#x27;s so much easier to find the brush I want. This little bag fits inside my make up bag.</li>
    <li> this has been a life saver for me with my fingernail files...</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect for carry what you need in your purse. It also is great for traveling. I recomend it very much.</li>

    <li> I ordered this to put all my cords, headphones chargers etc for my iphone in my bag. It&#x27;s nice and slim. For other purposes, you could probably fit a couple lipglosses, but not much more if you were looking to use this as a makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Quality bag but only good for holding a few brushes or pencils.</li>
    <li> Nice basic makeup bag - easy to see items -perfect for traveling with makeup brushes.  It&#x27;s small but just what I needed.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, do you have any or colors or sizes</li>
    <li> Overpriced for what it is, but perfect for makeup brushes.  All of mine fit inside and it keeps them from getting messed up in my makeup bag</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I like the mesh itself as well as the color and how well it&#x27;s made. I will probably by another one.  Surely wish it came in other colors. I carry it in my purse for my pens, pencils and eraser. Would like the same one for makeup.</li>
