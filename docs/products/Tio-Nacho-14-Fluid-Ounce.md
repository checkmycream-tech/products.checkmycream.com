      <li>One thing that nobody else has mentioned is that is safe for sensitive people.</li>
      <li>Leaves the hair clean, soft, easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Smells ok, like natural honey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and have noticed a distinct improvement in my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>But, worth you $$</li>
      <li>Within a week my hair looked fuller and it made the white hairs I have look kind of blondish</li>
      <li>which is not what I expected, but a good byproduct, too.  </li>
      <li>I love the honey smell, have to wait for aa few more washes to see if it works on my thinnig hair</li>
      <li>I felt I had to write a review about this shampoo because it really works!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She thinks there is more in it than the one that is measured in English</li>
      <li>This is the only one that worked for me, it really gives my hair volume, and it is so much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite shampoo and the only one I&#x27;ll use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a good, effective natural shampoo in general and this just wasnt the one for me.</li>
      <li>I am really please, and now buy it two at a time.</li>
      <li>and he said absolutely</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>I was talking to a friend on the phone and asked if he thought I should &#x27;treat myself&#x27; to this cool looking Mexican shampoo</li>
      <li>and I was tempted to try it, even though it said for older hair</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not that old..  </li>
      <li>I am 41 years old, I do not color my hair at all</li>
      <li>After one was my hair was unbelievably soft and I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner.</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft, silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>I use but only think I really don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
      <li>It actually looks like I haven&#x27;t lost as much as I have.  </li>
      <li>Am I that old, I asked?</li>
      <li>, the fine print on the back of the bottle says that it is &amp;#34;aging due to prolonged exposure to UV rays&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>showed her on the internet that they are exactly the same da-- size with the same ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so far, but my boyfriend has even noticed the change in my hair.</li>
      <li>Before I got used to and desensitized to the smell, I would get really nice whiffs of honey smell throughout the day at random.</li>
      <li>but I will continue to use it simply because I smile after I dry my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it, and that hadn&#x27;t happened in a long time.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does, however, leave my hair so clean (without stripping it dry) that I can shampoo every other day rather than daily as I had to before.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Went by the good tv adds, but I wouldm&#x27;t continue using it, can always blame my rebel salt and pepper hair of mine. But since I sticking with Joico products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a month.  I do notice that my hair feels thicker and less of it falls off.</li>
    <li> I am on my forties and loosing hair like crazy. Am I that old, I asked? I have gone through one bottle which lasted for ever. It does smell like honey while you are in the shower but it fades away rather quickly. Hair feels soft, silky and shiny. I am still losing hair hair but much less. One thing that nobody else has mentioned is that is safe for sensitive people. I have a hard time finding shampoos that won&#x27;t make my scalp itchy and this one doesn&#x27;t. All the other products out there smell terribly, are quite expensive and packaging is always smaller. Give it a try, worst can happen is someone telling that you smell good enough to eat!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  it smells like honey -- really strong -- so you might be tempted to taste it.  Within a week my hair looked fuller and it made the white hairs I have look kind of blondish which is not what I expected, but a good byproduct, too.  I am really please, and now buy it two at a time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this product is good or bad, I have not used it for a long time. Leaves Hair like any other shampoo, no difference so far. I use but only think I really don&#x27;t like is the smell. It smell like honey, but the smell is very strong. I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the honey smell, have to wait for aa few more washes to see if it works on my thinnig hair</li>
    <li> Thry srnt me erong shampoo.... Sent them a photo of wrong product... they sent the correct product promptly and told me to keep the other one as a gift...</li>
    <li> Smells like honey. Before I got used to and desensitized to the smell, I would get really nice whiffs of honey smell throughout the day at random. Dogs like it. Like... they&#x27;ll eat your hair.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am growing hair, but definitely it stopped falling, and that is the claim I am making about this product. It has a nice soft honey scent. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Tio Nacho is the best shampoo for the money!  Further is one of the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve try in a long time it just works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used half a bottle so far.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed a change in the gray hairs sprinkled among my blonde but I&#x27;m not to worried about those.  This shampoo does, however, leave my hair so clean (without stripping it dry) that I can shampoo every other day rather than daily as I had to before.  My hair is also shiny and full.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again--it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos and they run the gamut in price from inexpensive to very expensive.  I saw this at Target and picked it up for $8.00.  I have very fine hair and lately it&#x27;s been thinning due to illness.  This shampoo is great...hair has more body and just feels fuller and even looks better.  Was looking on Amazon to see if it was cheaper but will have to go back to Target for it because it is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Finally something that DOES work.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was actually something of an impulse buy...I did need some shampoo and I went to the econo brand I typically buy when I saw Tio Nacho Anti-Aging...I was talking to a friend on the phone and asked if he thought I should &#x27;treat myself&#x27; to this cool looking Mexican shampoo and he said absolutely and so I did...I love it! It smells great, has a great lathery texture, and my hair is full and wonderful smelling!</li>
    <li> this is good product, it feels amazing on your body,</li>
    <li> I found this at Walgreen&#x27;s, but no conditioner, so I ordered both from Amazon. Might as well kill two birds with one stone!</li>
    <li> Gennoma Lab is widely known in MX for deceptive advertising. This same product is advertised is Mexico as &amp;#34;anti-caida&amp;#34; (anti-fall); yet in the US the box reads &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; instead.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the fine print on the back of the bottle says that it is &amp;#34;aging due to prolonged exposure to UV rays&amp;#34;. In other words, it protects from UV rays as long as you wear a hat.</li>
    <li> Smells ok, like natural honey. I have long, thick, relatively &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair type for a 2o year old and I didnt think it cleaned well and left my hair with a residue feeling. Also seemed to leave some sort of residue on my roots, making my head itchy and more prone to dandruff. It&#x27;s currently sitting in my shower cady, untouched. It&#x27;s really hard to find a good, effective natural shampoo in general and this just wasnt the one for me.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this shampoo.  My hair had been falling gradually for the past year and a half.  They say hair thins with age but I&#x27;m not that old..  It has devastated me so I have been looking for a shampoo that will help stop the falling and make my hair look fuller.      I looked up Tio Nacho because I remember getting some from a friend who traveled to Mexico.  It was a small bottle with very dark shampoo and smelled like medicine.  It worked so well for me but I was unable to get the shampoo after I ran out. :(   This does not look, smell or feel like it so I was skeptical... maybe it was just a totally different shampoo with the same name...  Well, even if that&#x27;s the case, this shampoo has made my hair look at it&#x27;s fullest.  It actually looks like I haven&#x27;t lost as much as I have.  As the other reviewer, I haven&#x27;t been using it long but I will continue to use it simply because I smile after I dry my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it, and that hadn&#x27;t happened in a long time.</li>
    <li> Not very healthy for the hair</li>
    <li> great shappo, bought several bottles, still have more to enjoy, as soon Iam done , will buy more... thanks</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Left hair shiney and smells great.  Added a lot of body to my fine, straight hair so I use less styling product.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and quality product</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite shampoo and the only one I&#x27;ll use. I love the scent and it gives my fine hair fullness. I wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to find!!! Will be stocking up on it again soon!</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair clean, soft, easy to manage.  Smels great. Restores health and shine to hair, No more hair loss.</li>
    <li> love it my hair felt like when i was younger great product</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and I am very happy with its results. It leaves my hair clean, healthy, and with a very nice smell.It does very good for my hair.</li>
    <li> I felt I had to write a review about this shampoo because it really works!  I had been loosing a lot of hair lately, and especially noticed it in the hair drain after shampooing.  I had been using Aveda shampoo for close to 4 years before I started using this shampoo.  The only reason why I started using it was because when I flew home I noticed my mother&#x27;s hair was nice, shiny and she had a full head of hair, this had not been the case before when I had seen her a year before; she had noticeable thinning of hair on top of her scalp.  My mom told she had started using this shampoo and had been using it for almost a year.  This was motivation enough to get me to try it out for myself. I noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair in the shower drain since using this shampoo.  It does have a strong honey smell, but it&#x27;s not too bothersome after it&#x27;s rinsed.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so far, but my boyfriend has even noticed the change in my hair.</li>
    <li> I found this product at my drug store for 8 dollars and I was tempted to try it, even though it said for older hair and I am in my 20&#x27;s. After one was my hair was unbelievably soft and I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner. My hair was easy to style and super shiny. I had just stripped my hair two days prior and I was shocked to find something that repaired the damage this quickly. Not a huge fan of the smell, so yeah, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Left hair shiney and smells great. Added a lot of body to my fine, straight hair so I use less styling product.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted it!  Ask her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO ME, it is NO different than the one with the English on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks there is more in it than the one that is measured in English sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I showed her on the internet that they are exactly the same da-- size with the same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English version is two dollars cheaper!</li>
    <li> Tio Nacho is a new and  wonderful asset to anyone who wants to improve the look, texture, volume  and shine of their hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and have noticed a distinct improvement in my hair. I have received several compliments and would highly recommend it for anyone who wants the best products for their hair.</li>
    <li> It did what is said... Volume and lots of it. Very nice. Had many complements every time I use it. Just a little too expensive. But, worth you $$</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos to try to help the appearance of my thinning hair, from top end market ones (the expensive name brands) all the way down to the economy/value shampoos and everything in between with poor results from all of them except this one.  This is the only one that worked for me, it really gives my hair volume, and it is so much more manageable.  I bought mine at target for 8.00.  Has a smell that is somewhat like honey with other herbs mixed in, some folks may not like the smell but I do, and even more I love what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair looks healthier, stronger and more abundant. I am 41 years old, I do not color my hair at all and I only have a few gray hair. My family has used it for years. Another very powerful shampoo that helps with prevents hair loss is the one that contains &amp;#34;Cacahuananche&amp;#34;</li>
