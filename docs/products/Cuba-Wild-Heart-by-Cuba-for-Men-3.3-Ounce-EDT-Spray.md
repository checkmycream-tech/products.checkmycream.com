      <li>Cuba Wild Heart by Cuba for Men  Cologne Spray , has been one of my favorites, it is smooth not strong ,receive many compliment when I use it, the one thing people dont believe the amount and quality you get for the price, and best of all this will cost more than twice in many perfume store.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, you would be better served saving your money and buying the real thing.</li>
      <li>IT IS BETTER THAN SOME OF THE MAJOR BRAND COLOGNES !</li>
      <li>such a man fragrance love to smell it reminds me of the out doors on a fresh winter day the nature of it</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price.</li>
      <li>The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future.</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good and seems to last several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice scent, not long lasting.</li>
      <li>I really like it, would buy again.</li>
      <li>the real thing one squirt</li>
      <li>rather spend the money for the real thing</li>
      <li>this is not the real thing. ...</li>
      <li>to admit I like the smell of Gold a tad bit more, but not much.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny as a no frills present.</li>
      <li>THIS HAS A CRISP CLEAN SMELL THAT IS NOT OVERWHELMING !</li>
      <li>I was pleasently surprised</li>
      <li>so I tried (Wild Heart)</li>

    <li> this is not the real thing. ...have you used this Cologne for the past 4 Years ..the real thing one squirt you are good. ..THIS 6 squirts and you are good for 1 hr. rather spend the money for the real thing</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good and seems to last several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on Cuba (Gold) without smelling but the price was good so I figured what the hell. I was pleasently surprised, I really liked it so I tried (Wild Heart) again good smelling......Will reorder both when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Have to admit I like the smell of Gold a tad bit more, but not much. This is more fresher smelling.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. He would rather me buy these colognes than the expensive department store name brand colognes.</li>
    <li> bought this for my grandson who is 23 and it has a very clean smell....</li>
    <li> Smells okay while it lasts! Maybe I received a dud or it just wont mix well with my chemistry; because it fades after minutes of applying. I like to go light with the sprays (3 @ max) , however this took 5 just to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap as dirt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- lasts minutes&lt;br /&gt;- bottle looks like something my dog makes on the lawn.</li>
    <li> The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future. I personally like all of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased. The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price. Packaging is very cool and unique as well and it&#x27;s compliments my perfumery/cologne display collection.</li>
    <li> Smells great..... has this kinda energizing smell to it. I purchased this for my dad, and when he first put it on I would just follow him because it smelled soooooo good.  I really like it, would buy again.</li>
