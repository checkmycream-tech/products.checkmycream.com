      <li>Scientific studies indicate that it is an effective aborifacient in rats, and also appears to cause infertility in rats when taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective or not..</li>
      <li>Extract - what kind of bark?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw</li>
      <li>, it’s very strong.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, the company&#x27;s own website does not claim that this product kills demodex mites.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the lather.  </li>
      <li>I think that more research needs to be done on rosacea as there was never any discussion about Demodex mites at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>Palmetto (Serenoa Repens) Extract - best known as a supplement for prostate health in men, although the most recent studies suggest no benefits.</li>
      <li>Top notch product.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Lemongrass Oil - there are many species of lemongrass</li>
      <li>it is drying so use a good moisturizer right after.</li>
      <li>Just want to tell you all that I am so extremely happy and pleased with Demodex Control products and this cleanser in particular.</li>
      <li>Once you get past the antiseptic smell, and give it a fair trial, you&#x27;ll be convinced this is the best.</li>
      <li>The drainage from my eyes has greatly improved is not vanished completely.</li>
      <li>really natural and pleasant, skin-friendly :)  just to add..</li>
      <li>but I actually get compliments now on how good my skin looks!  </li>
      <li>I had a full beard and my dermatologist suggested that I shave it and gave me some ointment and lube - DIDN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
      <li>Chemical investigation of the rhizome mucilage confirmed the presence of histamine.</li>

      <li>Do your own research and be your own medical advocate because if you don&#x27;t take a proactive approach to your own medical care, then you could end up misdiagnosed.</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t judge me or what I say until you know the full story.</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t judge me or what I say until you know the full story.</li>
      <li>But amazingly, the mask, cream &amp; facial wash cleared up the flare-up</li>
      <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I still have residual redness but rarely have any acne since I started using the products</li>
      <li>I notice right away that my itchiness was gone, don’t feel any irritation for a while now.</li>
      <li>So, what I like the most that the cleanser does not dry my skin.</li>
      <li>The anti-demodex cream does sting/tingle a bit when you first use it</li>
      <li>Scanning electron micrographs supporting this conclusion are presented.</li>
      <li>first I used the product, as suggested, once in the morning and once before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am willing to be patient with this stuff</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s all organic</li>
      <li>but I was willing to try anything.  </li>
      <li>Scanning electron micrographs supporting this conclusion are presented.</li>
      <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;It smells funny</li>
      <li>Very fresh and natural.  </li>
      <li>your skin feels clean and healthy but this wash doesn&#x27;t dry it as many other products do.</li>
      <li>You will notice a HUGE difference after the first month and, after the second month, people will start saying, &amp;#34;Hey</li>
      <li>, I have sensitive skin, if you&#x27;re looking to this as a quick fix, step away.</li>
      <li>I also had 1 or 2 large sore pimples.</li>
      <li>Very beneficial</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cleansers, but this one really works.</li>
      <li>I think there is really something to this mites and rosacea link.</li>
      <li>Very drying, didn&#x27;t see any difference after using for a month.  </li>
      <li>I have been battling my rosacea for over 7 years very unsuccessfully until now.  </li>
      <li>I found it very drying to the skin.  </li>
      <li>It balanced just right leaving the skin soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>There are many other products you can use for that which are gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your skin feels so clean and same for the shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, I bought this product and, after a week or so, I started noticing the redness becoming pink</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far after 1 week of consistent use (2x/day) in combination with the anti-demodex cream (2x/day),</li>
      <li>highly recommend trying it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend but</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has demodicosis.</li>
      <li>And one last thing; I think this product makes your skin sensitive to the sun because I got a couple of mild sun burns rather quickly since I started using this facial wash so get some sun screen and use it!</li>

      <li>I have been struggling with acne rosacea and this helped to completely clear my skin!</li>
      <li>so I had to be better than usual about moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>clear the flare-up</li>
      <li>but my forehead is clear</li>
      <li>and my skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my pre-teen years.  </li>
      <li>I found the Ovante products on a Google search for natural rosacea solutions.  </li>
      <li>I am completely amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the facial wash is very drying</li>
      <li>Would not recommend it to anyone who has rosacea or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Works well and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>Never having a complexion problem as a teenager, adult acne was a surprise.</li>
      <li>The abstract for a National Institute of Health paper on this plant includes the remarks &amp;#34;The dermatitis produced on human skin after gently rubbing in either the berry juice or the rhizome mucilage was found in both cases to be a result of mechanical irritation, being produced by penetration of the skin by minute needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate.</li>

      <li>I had red bumps (not white heads) start popping up on my right cheek soon after my daughter was born.</li>
      <li>seems to have helped , I also shampoo with it, very concentrated lasts long time</li>
      <li>stuff does dry out your face and the anti cream that I use with it dries it out a bit more but from what I have read, that is typical the first few weeks.</li>
      <li>However, birch is a major allergenic tree pollen, and may cause allergy reactions in people who have pollen allergies, including hay</li>
      <li>I would be cautious about using these products if you have a sensitive skin, and immediately cut way back on any treatment program, that they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;Still have the current Rosacea flair, but fortunately it is calming down after stopping all of the products including the facial wash, hair shampoo, conditioner, and the demodex control cream.</li>
      <li>Also, keep it as far away from your eyes as possible.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using natural products &amp; eating cleaner for several years, I did not want to use antibiotics or prescription creams again.  </li>
      <li>dried out face but works a bit more than other products!</li>
      <li>I flat lined on the operating table and bled so much and was on the operating table so long they had to bring in a second surgical team.</li>

    <li> Very drying, didn&#x27;t see any difference after using for a month.  It&#x27;s OK but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective or not..</li>
    <li> Yes, my skin is much better now.  I do recommend this product.  Your skin feels so clean and same for the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought this 1 week ago and have been using in the morning and at night. Being frustrated with rosacea diagnosis for over 10 years and using prescriptions that would work at first and soon after lost their efficacy, I was willing to try anything to cut out the excessive oil and redness that the medicines could not.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this my face was broken out with tiny pimples redness and larger raised pimple-like dry patches/blotches. I also had 1 or 2 large sore pimples. My &amp;#34;rosacea&amp;#34; was on my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;So far after 1 week of consistent use (2x/day) in combination with the anti-demodex cream (2x/day), my nose, cheeks and chin are still a little red but my forehead is clear (wasn&#x27;t prior) and my overall face is virtually pimple free. The raised red dry patches are red but feel like young healing skin and are no longer raised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does dry out your face and the anti cream that I use with it dries it out a bit more but from what I have read, that is typical the first few weeks. I use jojoba oil as a moisturizer after I wash and then a spray facial oil combination that has tea tree oil, grapeseed oil, etc  that I picked up from a vendor to counteract this through out the day. (It is a meant for facial/skin repair and can be purchased at jscents@aol.com)--this stuff is great for on-the-go. I am willing to be patient with this stuff so I will update my review as I progress. The anti-demodex cream does sting/tingle a bit when you first use it but that seems to lessen over prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I have been battling my rosacea for over 7 years very unsuccessfully until now.  I have been to several dermatologists about my condition and have been prescribed Metrogel and Oracea.  I&#x27;ve been told to avoid foods that promoted inflammation.  Nothing worked.  The flare ups continued with redness and small pustules on my cheeks and forehead.  In desperation, I researched alternative treatments and came across the theory that Demodex mites may be the cause on my problem.  After I got over being totally grossed out (have you seen the pictures of those little guys?) I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I purchased this facial wash along with the facial cream and shampoo.  After 1 week of using the products, the pustules are completely gone and only a little bit of redness remains.  I am completely amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is the mites or there&#x27;s just something in the products that is working on my type of rosacea but this is the best that my face has looked in years.  Some advice...the facial wash is very drying so I had to be better than usual about moisturizers.  I used a Clinique moistuzier morning and night.  Also, I put the Demodex facial cream only on my problem areas (not my whole face) and it burned like crazy for a few minutes after every application.  I started out using the cream twice daily but switched to just nighttime because I couldn&#x27;t take it (I&#x27;m just a wimp I guess.)  Also, keep it as far away from your eyes as possible.  It made my eyes burn pretty badly as well.  Since I wasn&#x27;t using the facial cream in the morning I started using my Metrogel in the morning after using the facial wash.  Oh, and these products do not smell great.  You just get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews but am doing this one with the hope that this helps anyone who is suffering with the same skin issues as me. This has been such a frustrating process for me.  I think that more research needs to be done on rosacea as there was never any discussion about Demodex mites at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Again, I hope this helps!x mites at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Again, I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> OK,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dealt with rosacea for 4 years now. I went on Oracea and that helped a lot, but a little while ago it stopped working for me. I had been using the facedoctor medicated soap along with their beauty cream and seemed to keep the redness and bumps at bay ( I guess), then I see this product on amazon. I order it, use it with the anti cream and after 2 days broke out in hives, then the bumps came on worse than EVER. It has now been about 4 days and the hives are still coming and going, my face feels like its crawling. It is absolutely awful, this is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever written because I&#x27;m so angry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this is the demodex die off, but I was not ready for this at all. I mean have $#it to do! Do not be mislead by it saying non irritating it will make your skin really bad while the demodex die off. I quit using it as I&#x27;m not willing to wait a month or however long it takes for my skin to clear up. It is absolutely cruel that they don&#x27;t include a warning with this product. I have rosacea, I have sensitive skin, if you&#x27;re looking to this as a quick fix, step away. See a dermatologist, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> I had red bumps (not white heads) start popping up on my right cheek soon after my daughter was born. It started spreading and turned into overall just redness on my cheek. Then it spread to my forehead, then to my other cheek, then my left eyelids, then my nose. Seriously this was starting to worry me BIG TIME. I had a full beard and my dermatologist suggested that I shave it and gave me some ointment and lube - DIDN&#x27;T WORK! My regular doctor diagnosed me with IMPETIGO and gave me an ointment - DIDN&#x27;T WORK. I tried sulfur soap, african black soap, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, expensive Burt&#x27;s Bees acne treatment kit, expensive rosacea treatment ointment,... NOTHING WORKED! I stopped eating dairy and wheat - NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought this product and, after a week or so, I started noticing the redness becoming pink and I noticed less breakouts (whiteheads). FINALLY, after about 2 and a half years of worsening skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Once I noticed this improvement I also decided to shave my beard only leaving the sideburns, mustache, and beard on my chin (I shaved my cheeks clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I began to shave about once a week using OLIVE OIL then showering and washing the olive oil off my face with OVANTE DEMODEX CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I stopped eating cold cuts (sliced ham, turkey) and shrimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed a bigger improvement after a month so I bought another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-At first I used the product, as suggested, once in the morning and once before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Now I use it in the morning, in the middle of the day, and before bed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I also use it on the front half of my scalp every time I was my face (I&#x27;m thinking about getting the shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product works extremely well if you use it consistently at least twice a day. You will notice a HUGE difference after the first month and, after the second month, people will start saying, &amp;#34;Hey you&#x27;re skin looks better! It&#x27;s not red anymore.&amp;#34; Dont give up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had to add my dietary changes because they might have had something to do with the flare ups. Nevertheless, I sometimes do eat shrimp, cold cuts, soda, chocolate, and candy and do notice a tiny bit of breaking out (mini whiteheads here and there) but they don&#x27;t last long because OVANTE DEMODEX CONTROL is such an effective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think it smelled like sulfur soap but now I think it smells more like Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub. And one last thing; I think this product makes your skin sensitive to the sun because I got a couple of mild sun burns rather quickly since I started using this facial wash so get some sun screen and use it!ont give up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had to add my dietary changes because they might have had something to do with the flare ups.

    <li> I seemed to never outgrow acne/rosacea but recently had a flare up (lasting several months) on my cheeks that was painful and my husband begged me to see the doctor.  Since I&#x27;ve been using natural products &amp; eating cleaner for several years, I did not want to use antibiotics or prescription creams again.  I found the Ovante products on a Google search for natural rosacea solutions.  They were pricey, especially since I didn&#x27;t know if they would work.  But amazingly, the mask, cream &amp; facial wash cleared up the flare-up and my skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my pre-teen years.  I still have residual redness but rarely have any acne since I started using the products but I actually get compliments now on how good my skin looks!  It&#x27;s almost been a year since the flare-up and the acne is limited to ~1/-2mth that clear up in 1-3days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clear the flare-up, I used the mask religiously every other day for a 2-3 weeks and slowly increased to every 3 days and then not at all.  I bought a 2nd jar of the mask but only use it to spot areas when a blemish appears (~1/mth).  I use the wash &amp; cream 2x/day.  The facial wash lasts 3-4mths using a small drop each time &amp; the small jar of cream only lasts 1mth.  I finally starting purchasing the larger cream jar after buying the small one 7xs!  Wish I had known about these products earlier!!</li>
    <li> This product worked well. Relieved the itching.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thank you,</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne rosacea and this helped to completely clear my skin! Thought it was a fluke so I stopped using and I flared up again a day later with really bad itching!! I will keep using this and I am also starting soolantra. I think there is really something to this mites and rosacea link. Highly recommend but it is drying so use a good moisturizer right after.</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> Never having a complexion problem as a teenager, adult acne was a surprise. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cleansers, but this one really works. Once you get past the antiseptic smell, and give it a fair trial, you&#x27;ll be convinced this is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had server facial breakouts and didn&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m on Medicaid and am disabled from an accident back in 2010 with a severe spinal injury. I am on SSDI and limited income. My Medicaid will not cover going to a dermatologist and I can&#x27;t afford to go to a dermatologist. My Medicaid only covers me seeing a general practitioner and I never get to see one of those either. I&#x27;m always with a PA (physician&#x27;s assistant). I live in a rural small village in the mountains and this clinic I go to is the only place that takes Medicaid within 100 miles. The PA has no idea why my face keeps breaking out. I&#x27;m an older woman, so not a teenager and well past the age for acne. However, I tried acne medicine, medications for rosacea and antibiotics. Nothing work until I tried this product. I went to Google and typed in skin rash and when I looked a pictures, I found one that looked like my problem. I went to that web page and it said the patient was suffering from a  demodicosis problem. I had no idea what demodicosis was and so I looked that up and then did another Google search to find out how to treat it. That search brought me to this wonderful product. I took this product to my PA and showed him and he was amazed at the results and a bit embarrassed because he had never heard of demodicosis. I hate to say this, but don&#x27;t always trust your doctor or PA. Do your own research and be your own medical advocate because if you don&#x27;t take a proactive approach to your own medical care, then you could end up misdiagnosed. Anywho...this product is a miracle and I love it. I highly recommend it to anyone who has demodicosis. And another thing...can&#x27;t always trust hospital staff either. I had an ovary burst and was having internal bleeding. My stomach was turning purple and I was having severe pain and fever. My husband found me unconscious on the bathroom floor and called 911. The doctors at the hospital couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong with me and sent me home even after seeing my purple stomach and even though I was in excruciating pain. The next day the pain got even worse and I was rushed back to the hospital. Finally, they did an ultrasound and MRI and found out what was wrong. I had to have emergency surgery and be treated for septicemia. I flat lined on the operating table and bled so much and was on the operating table so long they had to bring in a second surgical team. One of the doctors came out and told my family what was going on and my family panicked and thought I was dying. Afterwards, they put medical tape on my incision and I&#x27;m allergic to medical tape. it says so in my medical chart. But they didn&#x27;t look at that. I broke out in a painful rash on my surgical scar and it felt like I had been burned. This added to my extreme post-surgical pain. So my point is with this unrelated story is that to prove my point that doctors can&#x27;t always be trusted. The reason I posted this is because I got several messages from people reading this review criticizing me for saying doctors can&#x27;t always be trusted. I have good reason why I said this. Now you all know. So don&#x27;t judge me or what I say until you know the full story. Enough with the mean, critical comments people!ple stomach and even though I was in excruciating pain.

    <li> expensive, but it works, not a miracle either but helps more than others</li>
    <li> I found it very drying to the skin.  I stopped using it since I saw no improvement.</li>
    <li> seems to have helped , I also shampoo with it, very concentrated lasts long time</li>
    <li> I used this product and all it did for me was make me break out in a rash and irritate my skin.  Researching the ingredients makes it seems like snake oil to me.  The black bryony ingredient in particular is contraindicated for topical use, as it is known by both herbalists and scientists to irritate skin and even cause blisters.  Interestingly, the company&#x27;s own website does not claim that this product kills demodex mites.  It only suggests that this product helps keep your skin in a condition that does not encourage mite growth.  There are many other products you can use for that which are gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer lists the ingredients as: Birch leaves (Betula species), Neem oil, Lemongrass Oil, Black Bryony (Tamus communis), Borage (Borago officinals) Seed Oil, ProteolTM, OlivenTM, Horsetail (Equisetum Arvense), Bark Extract, Saw Palmetto (Serenoa Repens) Extract, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid), Vitamin E (d Tocopherol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s review some of these ingredients one by one to see what effects they might have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birch leaves (Betula species) - specific species are not given, so it&#x27;s hard to evaluate this ingredient.  Birch has traditionally been used to treat skin conditions, but there is no scientific research on it.  However, birch is a major allergenic tree pollen, and may cause allergy reactions in people who have pollen allergies, including hay fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neem oil - neem oil is used in industry as a biopesticide. Traditional herbal uses include treating eczema, scrofula, and acne.  Scientific studies indicate that it is an effective aborifacient in rats, and also appears to cause infertility in rats when taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass Oil - there are many species of lemongrass so this ingredient cannot be evaluated, although many species are commonly used in cooking due to their citrus-like scent and flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Bryony (Tamus communis) - known even to herbalists to cause skin irritation and even painful blisters.  The abstract for a National Institute of Health paper on this plant includes the remarks &amp;#34;The dermatitis produced on human skin after gently rubbing in either the berry juice or the rhizome mucilage was found in both cases to be a result of mechanical irritation, being produced by penetration of the skin by minute needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate. Scanning electron micrographs supporting this conclusion are presented. Chemical investigation of the rhizome mucilage confirmed the presence of histamine. The role of histamine in the production of skin irritation following contact with the rhizome mucilage is discussed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Borage (Borago officinals) Seed Oil - a flowering plant with edible leaves, cultivated commercially as an oilseed source.  The plant has traditional use in treating gastrointestinal ailments.

    <li> If you have Rosacea, then you need to try this soap.  First of all, it&#x27;s all organic so there are no ingredients to irritate your skin.  Whether you think you have mites or not...it calms the skin and soothes without inducing more redness.  I didn&#x27;t think I had an over abundance of mites that were causing my redness...but I was willing to try anything.  It has made a difference in the overall redness, and eliminated any acne I had.  The smell takes a little getting used to but isn&#x27;t overpowering nor long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying it.  It is the ONLY face wash I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells really bad and I don&#x27;t notice any difference...gimmick</li>
    <li> A godsend. This it all you need for this type of issue.</li>
    <li> Top notch product.  Very beneficial</li>
    <li> great product.. and definitely worth the money. it smells strange but you get used to it soon and the results are surprising. your skin feels clean and healthy but this wash doesn&#x27;t dry it as many other products do. really natural and pleasant, skin-friendly :)  just to add.. the flacon seems to be so small but it lasts for a lot of time even when using it every day.  I&#x27;m going to order it again even if I&#x27;ll have to wait for it for months due to the crazy italian customs. I wish Naama ltd. had a reseller here in Europe!</li>
    <li> to soon to make comment</li>
    <li> I purchased several Demodex items to help with a current flair of Rosacea. All of the products were way too harsh for me, except for the body wash. My face turned a livid red all over, and suddenly loads of pustules were breaking out all over. I stopped using it, and called the manufacturer for some advice, I left a message ...no return call.&lt;br /&gt;I called the following day for some advice, as sheets of skin were peeling off my face, and also had deep stinging and aching. I couldn&#x27;t leave the house. I left a message with a woman, who told me that I would be receiving a return call from a Mr.Irvine,  but never heard a word. I would be cautious about using these products if you have a sensitive skin, and immediately cut way back on any treatment program, that they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;Still have the current Rosacea flair, but fortunately it is calming down after stopping all of the products including the facial wash, hair shampoo, conditioner, and the demodex control cream. These products were not helpful for me, needless to say....nor was the company.</li>
    <li> Smells really bad. Seems toxic to me! Waste of money! Still have the rash!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the lather.  Very fresh and natural.  Can&#x27;t tell if it helped with my rosacea or not.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed tried everthing to get my face to stop breaking out Demodex did the job.</li>
    <li> Have had acne problems from age 16 to 36... this is the only product that seems to control the Demodex and reduce sebum. A lot of people commented on how my face looks better. I am so glad I found this... I also use the shampoo and let it soak in on my face too while showering.</li>
    <li> dried out face but works a bit more than other products!</li>
    <li> I went to my eye doctor because I kept waking up with extremely red eyes in the morning and green drainage. I had already been on several doses of ophthalmic antibiotics at this point, so we knew it wasn&#x27;t pink eye. I was dx with demodex (small parasite that live in your eye lashes. Tx: Tea Tree oil, an active ingredient in this product). I ended up purchasing “Demodex Control”. If only needing a small amount to wash your eyelashes (and according to my research, patients also need to wash their eyebrows, seeing as they can also be infected), this $25 can go a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;It smells funny and if they have sensitive skin, they want to be careful, it’s very strong. The instruction on the bottle say use it twice a day. According to some research I did, it said to use it twice a day for 4-6 weeks (about how long I’ve been using it), and then once a day for 2-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t woken up with red eyes the last couple of weeks like I was. The drainage from my eyes has greatly improved is not vanished completely.</li>
    <li> Just want to tell you all that I am so extremely happy and pleased with Demodex Control products and this cleanser in particular. I have demodex and I think the mites started causing some rosacea as well. So, what I like the most that the cleanser does not dry my skin. It balanced just right leaving the skin soft and refreshed. I notice right away that my itchiness was gone, don’t feel any irritation for a while now. Use it morning and evening. Definitely give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very harsh on the skin.  It actually enlarged the veins on my face.  I was going to return the product but was to late since it has a 30 return policy.  Would not recommend it to anyone who has rosacea or sensitive skin.</li>
