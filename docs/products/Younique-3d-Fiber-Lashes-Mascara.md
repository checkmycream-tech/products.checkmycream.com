<li> Dont waste your money.</li>
<li> You just put on a small amount of the fibers after putting on the mascara and keep repeating that process until you achieve your desired look.</li>
<li> I could hardly believe it.</li>
<li> Yes, there are some drawbacks - sometimes the little fibers can get in the eyes and it takes a little practice to learn how to apply it so it don&#x27;t look clumpy or fake.  </li>
<li> No more glue on lashes for me!</li>
<li> it from.a rep with the 14 day guarantee for less!!!.</li>
<li> unfortunately by the time i buy here with tax its kinda expensive.</li>

    <li> Some of the fibers get into your eyes throughout the day but overall i do like the product.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. These lashes look horrible. They are clumpy and look like spider legs. And no, i didnt apply them wrong because you can see the sellers pictures on facebook trying to promote it and it looks just as bad! 2 weeks after I tried them once they were STILL stuck to my lashes. They damaged my eye lashes and i regret using them</li>
    <li> AMAZING product.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara that would really lengthen and thicken my lashes and THIS IS IT.  Yes, there are some drawbacks - sometimes the little fibers can get in the eyes and it takes a little practice to learn how to apply it so it don&#x27;t look clumpy or fake.  However, I found this to be the answer to my prayers for a mascara that really does what it claims it will do and I had no problem removing the product with my normal eye makeup remover.  I didn&#x27;t have to pull or tug it just takes a little longer to remove because there is more product on the lashes than with mascara alone.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will buy some more</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING!  I used them almost every day.  Buy from a Younique Presenter for $29! Get your LASH on [...]</li>
    <li> fiber comes off very easy bothers inside the eyes.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as claimed. It really did make my lashes look false. It was easy to remove with two swipes of makeup remover and it did no damage to my lashes. It takes no longer to put on than your regular two or three coats of mascara. Great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE This product. Always you the gel, and then fiber and gel again. (Do one eye at time) I choose to blow dry my lashes so it drys quicker. They looked beautiful. Also be careful not to use to much fiber, or it will could look clumpy just like regular mascara. P.s. I don&#x27;t use any other mascara with this product.</li>
    <li> love love love this mascara! it gives me the best false lash look without all of the hassle of false lashes. plus i love the fact that the fibers are natural green tea fibers! makes me feel so much better about wearing it so i know I&#x27;m not damaging my eyes or anything. i will definitely re-purchase when i run out. unfortunately by the time i buy here with tax its kinda expensive. if you buy from a rep you also get the 14 day money back guarantee even if you have tried ur tubes. you can get it cheaper from my friend [...]</li>
    <li> Great product but you can get it from.a rep with the 14 day guarantee for less!!!.[...]</li>
    <li> Lashes are fuller and longer as promised but little feathers constantly get in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Wow, is all I can say. I got this 3D Fiber Mascara for Mother&#x27;s Day! I Love mascara&#x27;s and I have tried so many it&#x27;s not even funny. I applied it as soon as I opened it up...Before my eyes, my lashes were growing in front of me. I could hardly believe it. I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more. I love this 3D Fiber Mascara. I paid months for lash extensions, until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies. I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it! I have since had several family and friends try it as well at my home, and they are blown away how it just pops their eyes open. All you can do is try it, if you don&#x27;t love it, with this mascara there is a 14 day return policy. I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers, it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant and lasts all day long!!! I have always used make up removed pads and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water. Try it, and what I like best, you order today, and you will recieve in 3-4 days via the mail. It truly is the best mascara I have ever used, I am being sincere! It works!!! I ordered mine from [...] ; for $29 mine has lasted 3 1/2 months...if you apply it correctly it won&#x27;t flake off...always apply the gel, fibers then the gel to seal the fibers, and apply a second coat, depending upon the look and length you want. I heard the 3D Fiber mascara saying it was Younique, that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beward..to get the real deal I ordered mine from [...]</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Read the instructions, and take your time and you should get great results. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months now and I won&#x27;t go back to regular mascara. I really like the ingredients compared to conventional mascara as well. This is not one of those sticky mascaras, or the kind that melts off your lashes if you go near a hot oven. You just put on a small amount of the fibers after putting on the mascara and keep repeating that process until you achieve your desired look. If you put on too much, you can easily correct it with a mascara comb without ruining the whole lash. No more glue on lashes for me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! However, only purchase through a Younique representative to ensure quality!  - Tiffanie Tvaroch  [...]</li>

And no, i didnt apply them wrong I tried them once they were STILL stuck to my eye lashes and i regret using them I got An allergic reaction cause rash and irritation of my eyes to swell , went to see a physician for medical treatment. Even if it say is all natural ingredients u never know u could still have a bad reaction</li>
    <li> Love them.If you want your eyelashes curled a bit, try your hair dryer. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have tiny lashes and even with mascara, they are hard to see.  One of my girls&#x27; teacher was selling this and I decided to give it a try.... I was amazed at how big and full my lashes were!!  Even better, sometimes I don&#x27;t wash off my makeup when I go to bed and this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave you with raccoon eyes!  I am a faithful customer now!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  My lashes are lush, something I never had and so,  wanted.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and last until you easily remove it at night. Best thing to happen to my lash ever.</li>
