      <li>Great product, excellent customer service and timely</li>
      <li>it does a great job</li>
      <li>lol but</li>
      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased it.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>All in all, it is a good cap</li>
      <li>I feel I&#x27;m getting a good conditioning with this cap.</li>
      <li>It is the best way to do a hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>I was glad I did!</li>
      <li>This heating cap is amazing.</li>
      <li>, it takes it awhile to warm up.</li>
      <li>Also, when on the highest setting this product heats to its max temp ( barely warm) then turns off ( I guess this is a safety feature?).</li>
      <li>Makes a better improvement on the hair condition when you apply heat.</li>
      <li>but I really enjoyed the difference it made when it did work.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>i love this cap.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will for you.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It heats perfectly and fits just the same.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  </li>
      <li>Better to save and buy a hooded dryer.</li>
      <li>I apply it to my scalp then put on the cap for better penetration of the medicine.</li>
      <li>All-in-all, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love Amazon.</li>
      <li>Easy to operate then having to pull a hooded dryer out and trying to find somewhere to set it up.</li>
      <li>that its wonderful even comes with a cap which I use over my plastic disposable cap and love it mess free</li>
      <li>feel if you use it more often is better to buy a standing steamer as it will last longer, but if used sparingly this is a good alternative.</li>
      <li>I preheated the cap so it was nice and hot when I put it on.</li>
      <li>It fits comfortably and can get pretty warm.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend had ordered one of these caps awhile back and kept talking about how great it was, so I decided to see for myself.</li>
      <li>Only top and sides got warm.</li>
      <li>It does not get full of fingerprints being shiny as I was concerned about-pretty resistant on that.</li>
      <li>I use it as deep conditioner  twice  a month and does a good job at penetrating the conditioner into my strands.</li>
      <li>Overall good product and price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>I use the high setting and it does not seem over or underdone, it works well, easy to clean.</li>
      <li>After 30 mins the front of my head is warm and the back is completely cool.</li>
      <li>However, the cap just doesn&#x27;t get hot?!  </li>
      <li>I love soft hair and it does just that</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>The cap gets hot (not burning your ears off hot, but salon treatment hot) in all the right places.</li>
      <li>Hot &amp; Works</li>
      <li>but sadly my first cap stopped working two weeks out</li>
      <li>At 1st I didn&#x27;t use this much, but now I use it 2x&#x27;s a month for hot oil treatment before I style my hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have an issue with heat distribution because I put the long parts of my hair on top of my head to be conditioned.</li>
      <li>Works really well with sebastian cellophanes; cleans up easily after use, seems to be of construction that will last  with monthly use.</li>
      <li>I love the different settings and the way my hair feels after deep conditioning and hot oil treatments!</li>
      <li>and it penetrates very well, whatever your reason for using it, it works</li>
      <li>you need to really tighten strapes to get the cap to cover all areas of the hair.</li>
      <li>Works very well for me</li>
      <li>To really get the full effect make sure you have at least an hour or two to sit there.</li>
      <li>The lower back portion of the heat cap does not get hot, even though none of the other heat caps out there do this, this is easily fixable...</li>
      <li>The heat cap was defected, it was brand new in the wrapper in box, but when I plugged it in, nothing, did not work.</li>
      <li>it gets hot and really deep conditions.</li>
      <li>I use it for max 30 min on my textlaxed hair, I would leave it longer if I was natural</li>
      <li>After applying my oils and putting my hair in a soft pony tail I put the plastic cap on.</li>
      <li>It heats up very well and stays heated for as long as yu keep it on, just don&#x27;t go around any fans or a.c. because that will cool the cap down.</li>
      <li>Does get hot but not to much, but the back is always a little of an issue as it does not really get hot</li>
      <li>Was totally surprised that this is the same one my hair stylist uses on me.  </li>
      <li>For something that is not bulky or expensive and gives you a nice amount of heat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. I just wish it got slightly warmer, as I have very thick hair. All-in-all, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and long hair (goes down to my butt). After applying my oils and putting my hair in a soft pony tail I put the plastic cap on. I preheated the cap so it was nice and hot when I put it on. Conditioned great! I didn&#x27;t have an issue with heat distribution because I put the long parts of my hair on top of my head to be conditioned.</li>
    <li> i love this cap. it gets hot and really deep conditions. definitely recommend this product for those who dont like sitting under the dryer</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had ordered one of these caps awhile back and kept talking about how great it was, so I decided to see for myself. I was glad I did!</li>
    <li> Overall good product. I use it as deep conditioner  twice  a month and does a good job at penetrating the conditioner into my strands. Does get hot but not to much, but the back is always a little of an issue as it does not really get hot that well. I use it for max 30 min on my textlaxed hair, I would leave it longer if I was natural but it all depends on type of locks. Overall good product and price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel if you use it more often is better to buy a standing steamer as it will last longer, but if used sparingly this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Works great.</li>
    <li> Works really well with sebastian cellophanes; cleans up easily after use, seems to be of construction that will last  with monthly use.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the product. It does not heat up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this heat cap for about two weeks now, i have alopecia and i am currently using minoxidil to help with the hair falling out and shedding. I apply it to my scalp then put on the cap for better penetration of the medicine. It heats up very well and stays heated for as long as yu keep it on, just don&#x27;t go around any fans or a.c. because that will cool the cap down. Since doing this regimen, i have less hair shedding and it&#x27;s getting a little thicker in spots. All in all, it is a good cap and it penetrates very well, whatever your reason for using it, it works</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my ears and works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> dies after 5 mins of using.</li>
    <li> It is the best way to do a hot oil treatment. Easy to operate then having to pull a hooded dryer out and trying to find somewhere to set it up. With this cap you can sit anywhere.</li>
    <li> I use the high setting and it does not seem over or underdone, it works well, easy to clean. It does not get full of fingerprints being shiny as I was concerned about-pretty resistant on that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Thought it would have been hotter though.</li>
    <li> This cap does not heat up at the back. It essentially doubles my conditioning time as I have to condition the front then put the front of the cap at the back of my head to get some heat. Even with a conditioning cap the heat does not distribute! After 30 mins the front of my head is warm and the back is completely cool. Also, when on the highest setting this product heats to its max temp ( barely warm) then turns off ( I guess this is a safety feature?). I then have to switch it off and on for the cap to heat up again. You definitely get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and this is one of few products like this still available yet the quality is absolutely POOR but it can get the job done with a little patience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  Was totally surprised that this is the same one my hair stylist uses on me.  It heats perfectly and fits just the same.</li>
    <li> Looks like the heat cap used in salons and works the same way. Excellent product, excellent seller!</li>
    <li> This heating cap is amazing. I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased it. I love the different settings and the way my hair feels after deep conditioning and hot oil treatments!</li>
    <li> Bought this for me girl and she loves it and for the money after checking them out on here, it was the best deal. works great!</li>
    <li> The cap has different temperture settings but only one tempeture.... low.  HATE IT! Don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S. Brown&lt;br /&gt;Phoenix, AZ</li>
    <li> Great product! The cap gets hot (not burning your ears off hot, but salon treatment hot) in all the right places. The lower back portion of the heat cap does not get hot, even though none of the other heat caps out there do this, this is easily fixable...I simply turn the cap around...does the trick perfectly. Works very well for me and I&#x27;m sure it will for you.</li>
    <li> It fits comfortably and can get pretty warm.  I feel I&#x27;m getting a good conditioning with this cap.</li>
    <li> Makes a better improvement on the hair condition when you apply heat. Silkier hair but sadly my first cap stopped working two weeks out and I ordered another and got it yesterday and it stops while I&#x27;m using it today. I&#x27;m so bummed out. I need to return two and afraid to buy again but I really enjoyed the difference it made when it did work.</li>
    <li> I brought this heating cap recently I think it&#x27;s worth the price and it does the job..  I love it</li>
    <li> It is not the best but it gets the job done, it takes it awhile to warm up. I leave it on the highest setting every time I use it. To really get the full effect make sure you have at least an hour or two to sit there. For something that is not bulky or expensive and gives you a nice amount of heat. If your looking for that salon heat, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Better to save and buy a hooded dryer. This was a waste of money. Not even distribution of heat. Switches off by itsel after a few minutes and I have to unplug it, plug it again and switch it on again. I regret my money</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find any of the problems I&#x27;ve read about.  The cap works well all around, even in the back!</li>
    <li> Purchased heating cap from MayaBeauty. Cap did not heat up in the back. Only top and sides got warm. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> This product is great it does a great job&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is I wish the tighting string was around the lining of the cap not under my neck lol but other tgan that its wonderful even comes with a cap which I use over my plastic disposable cap and love it mess free</li>
    <li> At 1st I didn&#x27;t use this much, but now I use it 2x&#x27;s a month for hot oil treatment before I style my hair. It gets the job done! I love soft hair and it does just that and I style with gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hot &amp; Works Well&lt;br /&gt;Con: Kitchen area (nape) not really getting heated.</li>
    <li> The heat cap was defected, it was brand new in the wrapper in box, but when I plugged it in, nothing, did not work. Also, they made me pay for shipping which Amazon so graciously gave me back. I love Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this product last month. Have been using it every week since then.  Great product!  Saving me the hassle of getting to the hair saloon.  Saloon result with little investment on this \\&quot;Wonder Cap\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent customer service and timely delivery.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best way to get Salon hair treatments at home. This heat cap makes my weekly deep conditioning a breeze.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I&#x27;ve waited 3 yrs to replace my old pink beat up heating cap with the two annoying rings to pull strap through and secure cap.  However, the cap just doesn&#x27;t get hot?!  And what is the deal with the boxy shape that is simply wasted space and because of the strange shape... you need to really tighten strapes to get the cap to cover all areas of the hair.</li>
