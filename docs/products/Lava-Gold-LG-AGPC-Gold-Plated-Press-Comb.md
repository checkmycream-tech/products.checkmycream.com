<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A waste of money. It&#x27;s in a drawer collecting dust.  Maybe I can give away or sell it in a yard sale. Lol</li>
    <li> I love this hot comb. Works on my hair perfectly! &amp; for the price it&#x27;s great! I have thick course hair so I use the 400-500 setting cause my hair needs high heat. Keeps it straight for a nice length of time.</li>
    <li> It will get hot, but you had to let the iron heat up for 10 - 15 minutes to get the real benefit of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, it does get the hair straight. I find the placement of the temperature dial to be a little annoying as I constantly change the temperature while using the comb.</li>
    <li> not good for kinky hair.</li>
    <li> The comb itself is fine, but the stand and handle are somewhat awkward. The stand is not tight, which causes it to move and the hot comb drops and rests on the rubber stand. The portion of the handle with the cord pivots and moves quite a bit while handling.</li>
    <li> I GAVE IT TO A GIRL FRIEND WHO IS TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH IT WORKS GOOD SHE SAID</li>
    <li> I have short hair that looks like crap unless it gets straightened.  Used to chemically straighten it about every 2 weeks.  Would have to avoid getting it wet and annoying stuff like that.  Too short to use a regular flat iron.  This works great, heats up fast, and won&#x27;t burn your head if you use the guard.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times since i bought it over a month ago. The results are great and I would definitely recommend this product to others (and have done so already). I use it mainly to go longer with my relaxers. I see of the other reviewers referred to it being cheap but i believe it depends on the use. It&#x27;s a very lightweight product. I could see if it is not gently used could eventually die or give out. Overall, my experience has been great. The guard is amazing and allows me to get really close to my edges without burning. I never remove the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that I travel often and it does travel well.</li>
    <li> it brought back memories of the old hot comb except without the potential fire hazard amazing product and well worth the price</li>
    <li> I love this comb.  The guard is absolutely the best creation ever.  I am telling all of my family members with little ones about it.</li>
    <li> What I am saying is I used this thing and my hair has no tangle and it is long, it just slide real quick, this thing should have a holder so you can clip your hair from the start and move slowly up to the end, it his thing will have a clip you can control and move slowly so you can apply heat on your hair to straighten it, but if it will just slide quick it you won&#x27;t even feel the heat so it is useless to me.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I bought this solely for my edges because it has the hair guard.  I use this to straighten my edges when I wear my hair flat iron straight and when I need to blend my hair with my weaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought this, I really loved it.  After several months of infrequent use, the guard now falls off of the comb.  I initially used this probably once a week.  Now, my use is less frequent because of the hassle of the guard.  Also, one of the combs on the guard broke.  The guard is just really hard plastic and there is nothing really secure about it to keep it attached to the comb itself.  The comb has two sides.  Because I mostly use this for my edges, I use the back side (the smaller side).  When I use this side now, the guard presses forward and comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you intend to use this as a traditional pressing comb I think you will be fine.  If you intend to use this for edges only, please keep this in mind.  I would buy this again because it does the job but this little defect is disappointing.  Also, keep in mind that it takes a while to heat up to a good temperature to straighten the hair.  I&#x27;m used to my quick heating flat irons that take less than 1 minute.  You need about a 5-7 minute lead with turning this on depending on how straight you want your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good.  Would recommend.  But keep these things in mind.  If any of this annoys you, don&#x27;t order.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair and braided it in sections days before use to make it easier to part because I have thick hair. So I gave it five stars because it was delivered on time, it described as pictured, and the temp control is one of the better features. I opened package plugged it in about 3 min it was hot, it came set to 500, and I left it on that. I section a part and combed it from end to root(about 3 pulls) and it straightened it out without breaking hair and burning scalp. The only way I see you could burn or feel heat is if you leave it close to you, and with the temp control you can lower it to whatever degree your comfortable with. The root attachment works great  especially since i cant see in the back and have to do my own hair, yeahhh no neck burns. It is built from hard case plastic so try not to drop and the handle is not heavy but sturdy with lever. It does move around if lever is not down when not in use. The cord does swivel but with practice you will appreciate that feature especially if your right handed and need to do the left side with right hand.</li>
    <li> I love the guard that attaches to the comb for your edges.  My first one stopped working and this one is even better than the first.</li>
    <li> it worked great !!! considering I only got to use it once and I plugged it in to use again and it no longer heated up,i,m very disappointed I threw out package or I would return it for exchange or refund.</li>
    <li> This comb works wonderfully for my hair.  It has heat settings so you can control the temperature.  It also has a barrier for protection from burns.  I never remove mine and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting burned straightening the hair at the back of my head.  For this price, you can&#x27;t find a better quality comb.</li>
    <li> Even though it says it gets up th 450 i dont really feel that it does. It served the immidiate purpose on my edges but it was spongy by the end of the day. (I have curly corse latina/black hair)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. They look &amp; work cheap. They take a very long time heating up &amp; when they do it&#x27;s not hot enough. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am white with natural, curly hair (not afro) but I wanted less frizz at my roots, so I thought the press comb was a good idea. First of all, it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair/roots. It didn&#x27;t straight it or smooth it. It did nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: the on/off switch is not safe. It&#x27;s very poorly made, very loose and it switched on on its own inside my hair tools box. Very dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give zero stars if it was possible...</li>
    <li> It works amazing on my hair the bumper helps so I don&#x27;t burn my scalp and fry my hair. It heatsup and cools down amazingly</li>
    <li> I have recently started going to college last year so I couldn&#x27;t use a stove hot comb.  Wondering if I would get the same results, I brought this hot comb and I have to say it works just as well as the stove hot comb!! There are temperatures you can chose from and I usually put mines on 450.  I am African American with thick hair and I usually blow-dry my hair, hot comb, and then flat iron.  Unfortunately my blowdryer broke a few weeks ago, I was disappointed and worried if I would get the same results. I put my hair in braids and let it air dry and then I went over my hair with the comb section by section and got the same results!! My hair was shiny and my roots were straight with no kinks.  This definitely is a good electric hot comb and worth the cost and saved me a step in my wash day routine!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for my hair. I have really thick hair. If I didn&#x27;t have this I couldn&#x27;t braid my hair. Thanx</li>
    <li> This press comb is very cheap in every way.  I had to tape down the hot dial to use it because dials kept moving.  Im african american and my hair is coarse.  The teeth on this press comb is close together and doesnt press my hair out like it should.  I wasted my money on this product.  My mistake I should of stuck with the press comb that I know will work.</li>
    <li> The comb broke the first time I used it which just happened to be outside the return window. Because of the swiveling plug it just kept moving uncontrollably. I couldn&#x27;t keep the bottom, where the plug is, straight. I started hearing popping sounds and then there was a burnt rubber smell. Since then, it won&#x27;t heat up anymore. So long story short, the swivel is actually a disadvantage because it messes with some wiring or something in there that ruins the heating mechanism.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars which was generous.  This did not live up to my expectations. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did...</li>
    <li> It is OK and the reason why I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is that it is impossible to use the little piece which is supposed to straighten the roots while protect the scalp. It comes out anytime you try to use it so it is useless. But the comb by itself works great.</li>
    <li> Eeh..just ok--seriously nothing to write home about! Unfortunately--I think I&#x27;ll just keep it and still buy a better one for my main one and this one will be an emergency stand-by...</li>
    <li> The Lava Gold Press Comb heats up quickly.  it also came with the comb guard which is so easy to attach and remove. If looking for a pressing comb this is should be the one.</li>
    <li> It is good.  it got the ends pretty well. I  needed  something that really worked well on thick,  natural,  long, semi  coarse  hair. I would buy it again. not perfect  but close.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the shield so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp. The only down side is that after a while you have to get a new one because the thermostat doesn&#x27;t hold the temperature. It will start off hot and then cool down to warm &amp; it won&#x27;t straighten your hair. I have to turn it off for a while &amp; restart it, which is inconvenient. I would buy another one though.</li>
    <li> The guard on the comb kept coming off and burning me. Without it, the hot comb worked just fine. I&#x27;m a 4c natural and it got my hair straight enough.</li>
    <li> I can almost use it as a comb. The guard works great. I really like this pressing comb. Nice work.</li>
    <li> Nice hot comb I love the fact that the power button is located on the handle end. Heats up pretty fast as well. I world highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Waste of money.  The comb does not glide through my hair.</li>
    <li> This hot comb is great!! I was a little skeptical at first but it works wonderfully. I can go a few days without pressing. This and my edge control lays my leave out for when I use extensions as if I have a perm! Even my stylist was shocked.. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the attachment to protect the hair broke soo easily.. However its a great product overall!</li>
    <li> This press comb straightens your hair very well. I like the multiple heat settings. I wish they made one that curled your hair when you reached the end of the strands... a girl can dream right?  :)  One caution... it gets very hot!!</li>
    <li> My daughter was only able to use the comb one time before it fell completely apart.</li>
    <li> Although the comb works extremely well, the root straightener could do a better job of ironing out the frizzy kinks in the front of my hairline</li>
    <li> I have natural, 4c, thick, coarse hair. While there is an &amp;#34;anti heat&amp;#34; movement in the natural hair community, I use heat frequently on my hair which is healthy and flourishing. In fact, without heat my hair has single strand knots, tangles, and breaks badly. I digress... on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W/ Amazon Prime .. 2 day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging ... standard clam shell&lt;br /&gt;Heats up super quick...&lt;br /&gt;Goes up to 500 degrees if you need that bone straight look. I use it on 400 degrees myself.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft with no burning or no sizzling of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute best part is the guard!!! No fear of scalp burning of the &amp;#34;oh thats just steam&amp;#34; routine. To all the mothers who press your little girls hair, I am telling you as the embodiment of that little girl all grown up, get this comb and use the guard! Your daughter will thank you.</li>
    <li> I like the convenience. I also like the variable heat settings. I have both the old-fashioned hot comb and this one.&lt;br /&gt;When I have untamed hair in the front it has a heat guard that protects you from burning your face.. That is clever!&lt;br /&gt;If that protector comes off just leave it off until you need it to work on the front. I was afraid of breaking the plastic&lt;br /&gt;protector so when it came off I just left it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I bought a second one in 2014. The first one still worked but was taped up. So with the second one I keep it at 400 degrees and no higher. It is holding up much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lava Gold Pressing Comb a few days ago. I&#x27;m here to say, it is one one of the best purchases for hair care, that I&#x27;ve ever made! Our youngest daughter borrowed it and she too was pleased. Thank you Amazon for having this item in stock!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006LXPRBW Lava Gold LG-AGPC Gold Plated Press Comb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pg10711</li>
    <li> The guard is wonderful, and if you have fine hair it&#x27;s a bonus not to scorch yourself. The heat is great, finally someone understands how much heat it takes to straighten stubborn hair. Thanks</li>
    <li> Pros: Quickly heats up, love the scalp guard&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Easy to burn our fingers if you are not careful, temp dial is where your fingers sit. That is the biggest complaint i read on here but i didn&#x27;t bump it much. I notice it only moved a little bit but it was still around the same temp i was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I have to get use to using it as I always used a flat iron but it def got the job done. Afterwards I just curled the ends with my flat irons. It works great on edges too if you just need them to lay down in between relaxers</li>
    <li> I loved this item up until it snapped in half while I was straightening my daughter&#x27;s hair one morning. I had it for almost a year. Just wish it&#x27;d been constructed a bit sturdier.</li>
    <li> I have natural, short, black hair.  I use this comb to straighten the hair in the back of my head. Good for quick touch ups.  However, I wish this comb was hotter. The specifications say it goes up to 500 degree but I don&#x27;t believe it.  I have flat irons (450degrees) hotter that this electric hot comb.</li>
    <li> Overall, this iron gets hot enough and I like the barrier element against the back so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
    <li> The product works great. i am so glad I got it!! Thank you for the hot comb! Highly recommended. Good job</li>
    <li> The product itself is ok, it didnt really do anything for my hair. But when I received the package in the mail I couldn&#x27;t believe the condition in which it came in. It was packaged with a semi-thick paper like covering. The package was wet and was torn to pieces you could tell exactly what it was without even opening it.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t last long before it spoilt, i used it just once</li>
    <li> I have only used this hot comb maybe a dozen times and it already stopped working....smh...You can tell how light wieght that it is that it is made very cheaply and is not durable.  I have natural hair and when it was working it did a good job straighting my hair though.</li>
    <li> I like it.  My hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is relaxed and I bought it to touch up our edges between relaxers.  I love the saftey guard because it really does prevent you from burning your scalp.  And I found we get pretty close to the scalp with the guard on.  I have not found that I run into the on/off button while using it.  It stays on.  Now, I have unknowingly adjusted the temp. w/o meaning to so I have to check it from time to time.  As my hair is relaxed, I don&#x27;t go above 300 degrees.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice safety features.</li>
    <li> I got this pressing comb after my last one gave out. It was inexpensive and worth a try. This Pressing Comb straightened and smoothed my really Coarse hair. It&#x27;s also lightweight and not so heavy like my last pressing comb. It also makes way for my flat iron to make luscious curls. I&#x27;ve never felt any more happier to have a better hair style and could never do anything without this lucky charm.</li>
    <li> I really like the guard that&#x27;s included, however I need to work on my technique because I can&#x27;t get the hair as straight as I would like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to have an electric pressing comb.  I use it between perms just to touch up my new growth.</li>
    <li> I am writing the review because after straightening my hair twice, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart like the other brand I bought from Sally&#x27;s.  That said, I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> This iron heats up to the desired temp and keeps it well. But, do not expect it to happen instantly. It takes about 3-5 minutes for it to reach the programmed temp. I tried the edging comb but it is not working for me. The attachment keeps popping off. The comb tines are close enough together that I don&#x27;t need it anyway. That is another point. If you think you are going to take a large section of hair and press it right the first time, think again. My hair is thick so I know to do 1 inch sections but at times I try to go thrugh a little more and that combs tines are just too close to allow this without pulling your hair out. I have no problems with my thumb placement  changing the temp either. My thumb rests on the temp window and not on the sides where the dial is. I gave this one a four stars because my old comb heated up in 60 secs to full temp and the tines were farther apart to account for thicker sections.</li>
    <li> Presses very well, love the edge straightener. The heat guard is great because I am a novice at straightening my own hair.</li>
    <li> This electric comb was delivered to me, April 17, 2013. I started using it about 3 weeks later. Well, yesterday July 26, 2013 it just stopped working. It wont even heat up to warm.... I left it plugged in for 30 minutes, and its cold as ice. I wont buy from these people again!</li>
    <li> the comb it self is abit heavy it heats up really fast tho great for thick hair would recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works well and the safety features make it even better. The temperature is warm enough to actually straighten hair.</li>
    <li> Burns my hair out...but; could be up too high!  Use with caution.</li>
    <li> Love mine , just hope Amazon carries the  guard. I tell everyone that asks this is what I use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess the temp dial is in the way of the handle, as I use it my fingers are turning the temp dial. I have to leep checking the temp. I like the way it has the guard to wear you can use it as a edge straightner without burning yourself.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. It is smart that it has scalp guard which works great. It can also be removed but I prefer to leave it on.  I highly recommend this comb. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
