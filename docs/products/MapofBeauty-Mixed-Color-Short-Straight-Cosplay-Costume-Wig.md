      <li>Its not as good as I expected.</li>
      <li>At fist I had bought it for fun-</li>
      <li>This wig is super soft and strong.</li>
      <li>and it is full like real hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t ruin when I go out in hot weather and its soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>Its a great wig its hardly sheds at all,looks EXACTLY like the picture,and</li>
      <li>Overall pleased with this wig.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a big shorter (length) as I expected, but wow: very beautiful.</li>
      <li>It would have been better if the red had just been streaks instead of layered.</li>
      <li>Fits my large head well.  </li>
      <li>It fits really well</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really matter</li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t part them much without seeing the under cap.</li>
      <li>it fits my head very well and</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;wig shine&amp;#34; and it looks like it is my real hair</li>

      <li>Even though it took a long time to be delivered, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s already styled, a bit shiny but that can be fixed.</li>
      <li>Not bad for price, but if you rush order it not worth it.</li>
      <li>I have long black hair, so I used this wig on top of my natural hair...</li>
      <li>The wig cap fits a bit small but it&#x27;s fine on my friend (who has a small-ish head anyway).</li>
      <li>Extremely thin, and my wig came curly, but came with a free wig cap &amp; shipping was fast</li>

<li> /&gt;Anyways when I did get it, it came earlier then expected.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t take long to come</li>
<li> The black is layered over the top of the red which unless combed a certain was looks stupid.</li>
<li> The only thing was that it was mirrored, and a little too long.</li>
<li> A little hair came out as well when I got it, but not a big deal.</li>
<li> dosent shed at all but shorter than i expected</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really Soft and Thick.</li>
<li> A little long, but you&#x27;ve always got to restyle a wig before wearing it.  </li>
<li> the low price is unbelievable.</li>
<li> A bit difficult to style at first</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle hardly at all (probably because it&#x27;s short).</li>
<li> a little shiny</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ve had it know for a few months</li>
<li> material is really very soft and shiny, yet, not too artificial looking.</li>
<li> I even swam in a chlorine pool with it on accident and still it hardly sheds.</li>
<li> and it hardly shed when i combed it.</li>
<li> only bad thing about this wig is its a little thin-</li>
<li> The wig is slightly thin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s basically just wadded up in a thin plastic shipping &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> thats actually a bad thing since I bought this item months ago.</li>

    <li> dosent shed at all but shorter than i expected</li>
    <li> I love it. I love the style.</li>
    <li> Super nice wig! I ordered it in red/black for a friend. The wig cap fits a bit small but it&#x27;s fine on my friend (who has a small-ish head anyway). The fibers are really great and heat-resistant. It&#x27;s perfect for Ruby from RWBY. It almost doesn&#x27;t need styling!</li>
    <li> I like the amount of hair and the color is spot on but i just don&#x27;t like the netting but thats just my opinion</li>
    <li> Extremely thin, and my wig came curly, but came with a free wig cap &amp; shipping was fast</li>
    <li> The wig was easy to work with and fit very well.</li>
    <li> Its a great wig its hardly sheds at all,looks EXACTLY like the picture,and its comfortable&lt;br /&gt;I FOUND A GOOD WIG,MAPLE SYRUP BE PRASED!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice wig it fits my head very well and it looks like my hair was always this color! It doesn&#x27;t tangle hardly at all (probably because it&#x27;s short). I will need to style it just a bit though to fit my face but this is a good buy for the costumes that I&#x27;m doing!</li>
    <li> I want to wear this wig all the days of my life! Just bought it for a character transformation and didn&#x27;t wanna take it off!</li>
    <li> This wig is AWESOME! it fits my giant head because the inner cap is adjustable and fits like a dream. I will buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> it is a very nice wig i recommend it</li>
    <li> The wig is soft, full and the colors are great. There isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;wig shine&amp;#34; and it looks like it is my real hair</li>
    <li> Its not as good as I expected. The black is layered over the top of the red which unless combed a certain was looks stupid. It would have been better if the red had just been streaks instead of layered. But it will do. Hair is good quality, wig fits comfortably.</li>
    <li> Wig is nice for price but biggest problem is bangs are right in the face and you can&#x27;t part them much without seeing the under cap. Not bad for price, but if you rush order it not worth it. Over all a nice wig. A little hair came out as well when I got it, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is not bad considering the price. Even though it took a long time to be delivered, it was worth it. A bit difficult to style at first but you get used to it and it hardly shed when i combed it. I would buy it if you like it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality. Glad we chose this brand.</li>
    <li> a little shiny but i got it to work</li>
    <li> I have to rate this 4 stars because I&#x27;m happy with the wig itself and the low price is unbelievable. However, the packaging could use some work. It&#x27;s basically just wadded up in a thin plastic shipping &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34;. I guess customs thought it looked suspicious because when i got it the package had been ripped open and part of the wig was all teased and poking through the hole. Managed to smooth it out so no big deal for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter hasn&#x27;t worn it yet but it looks like the quality is good.</li>
    <li> I bought the black and white one for a cosplay of my OC, and it is amazing! Didn&#x27;t take long to come and it is full like real hair. I even swam in a chlorine pool with it on accident and still it hardly sheds. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> The wig is slightly thin. The colors are nice, feels soft. There was a slight problem with my shipment, but the seller was kind enough to contact me to tell me that there would be a delay with my parcel, but I did not mind. Overall pleased with this wig.</li>
    <li> This wig is super soft and strong. I styled it fine with my flat iron and it wasn&#x27;t damaged by the heat at all. It fits really well and it&#x27;s super cute</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t ruin when I go out in hot weather and its soft and easy to brush. It&#x27;s already styled, a bit shiny but that can be fixed.</li>
    <li> I really love this wig way too much! It&#x27;s really Soft and Thick. People ask if it&#x27;s my real hair and the color is extremely vibrant. Also, It can handle the straightener!  (In my picture I styled visual kei style)</li>
    <li> Perfect in every aspect.  Looks real and is a good price.</li>
    <li> Bought for Ruby Rose cosplay (RWBY).  A little long, but you&#x27;ve always got to restyle a wig before wearing it.  Fits my large head well.  I always turn to MapofBeauty for inexpensive but good quality cosplay wigs.</li>
    <li> It was amazing. The only thing was that it was mirrored, and a little too long. The quality was excellent and it fitted my big head.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and went will my features. Well made and worth the price paid. Thank You</li>
    <li> Soooo beautiful! And wow, it feels great! It looks even prettier in person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is really very soft and shiny, yet, not too artificial looking. I have long black hair, so I used this wig on top of my natural hair... People did not know where my hair started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a big shorter (length) as I expected, but wow: very beautiful. Great price too! :-)</li>
    <li> I actually felt I needed to &#x27;re write my comment- because Yeh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways when I did get it, it came earlier then expected. (yeah!) At fist I had bought it for fun- and for my human Marionette cosplay- not even knowing that technically it&#x27;s a Rwby red wig (according to my friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ve had it know for a few months and it&#x27;s still super Comfy. Although the shine started to bother me so I put a few products in it to calm down the shine...&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this wig is its a little thin- but it doesn&#x27;t really matter ((I&#x27;ll have to add the pic when I do my Marionette photo shoot))</li>
    <li> In all honesty I forgot all about this order when it FINALLY arrived....thats actually a bad thing since I bought this item months ago. When I opened the package the wig was so pretty :) Absolutely gorgeous</li>
