      <li>I am very excited to have found these.</li>
      <li>At that point I wasn&#x27;t real sure I would get good results, I thought the final results would be clumpy.  </li>

      <li>My eye lashes were much longer without looking like I had a lot of mascara - and no clumping, which I thought was surprising.  </li>

      <li>Easy to remove.</li>

      <li>But each time after that and the fibers have been coming out of the container in huge clumps.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So simply to use and what great results.  </li>
      <li>This is a fun product and much more affordable than others I have seen.</li>
      <li>It works great and my results are better with this lash extender than my previous one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still in shock at all the wonderful reviews because I love trying new things and am pretty open minded</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive the Prolash + Fiber Extender.</li>
      <li>and my lashes were significantly bolder.  </li>
      <li>Super quick and easy</li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews I purchased this ProLash Mascarra.  </li>
      <li>They are very easy to put on, simply brush them on like you&#x27;re putting on mascara and then put on your favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cool.</li>
      <li>The last time my lashes looked that good</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much in lenght, but it sure did deliver in fullness and thickness.  </li>
      <li>What I did get was irritated eyes because they were full of lint.  </li>
      <li>Can all these good reviews possibly be on the up and up or are they staged?</li>
      <li>You simply apply a coat of your mascara, then coat your lashes with the fiber lash extender and then one more coat of mascara and voila that easy!</li>
      <li>Luckily, it was sold and shipped by Amazon so they are refunding my money.</li>
      <li>I now have FULL Pretty eye lashes!</li>
      <li>She gave me this information: These little fibers from Prolastdo a great job in extending my lashes without fussing around with gluing on extensions.</li>
      <li>What I did notice was that removing it was problematic (eyes got very irritated and &#x27;gunky&#x27; filled).  </li>
      <li>Great for everyday.  </li>
      <li>Comes off easily when washing your make up off, and certainly easy enough to apply even for those people that are not make-up savvy!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using this on a daily basis but will be saving it for special events, for sure.  </li>
      <li>It washed right off with my mascara at the end of the day too.</li>
      <li>I  love how easy they are to use  with very simple and concise instructions included.  </li>
      <li>Put the first layer of mascara and them use this applicator and the fibers extend your lashes.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is put on your regular mascara that you always use then put Prolash on then your mascara again and the magic begins.</li>
      <li>My mascara dries fast!  </li>
      <li>I only apply two coats but you can apply as many as you need to.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, but it does provide that added ooomph and emphasis on those days I do use it!  :)</li>
      <li>Despite all of my concerns, it really does work well!  </li>
      <li>It took a youtube video to figure out how to put it on (one coat of mascara, one coat of fibers on top and bottom of upper lashes, then one coat of mascara)</li>
      <li>I have very fine, short, straight eyelashes, and i get compliments on my eyelashes all the time when I use this.</li>
      <li>You can save yourself some money if you just take an old mascara brush, twirl it around in the lint trap of your dryer, making sure the brush head is completely encapsulated in lint.  </li>
      <li>The tube is just like a mascara once you pull it out is is white little fibers on a brush that you just easily apply between mascara coats so easy!!</li>
      <li>I just love how long and glamorous my lashes look now.  </li>
      <li>The Prolash+ Fiber Lash Extender seemed easy enough, so I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I applied a coat of mascara, followed by ProLash and followed up with another layer of mascara and saw no dramatic difference</li>
      <li>This product certainly make your lashes look longer and thicker.  </li>
      <li>This is great for a little extra oomph on a night out!</li>
      <li>but the prices were to much.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone looking to make their lash really stand out.</li>
      <li>My eye lashes were much longer without looking like I had a lot of mascara - and no clumping.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just very wasteful.  </li>
      <li>my lashes are fuller and much longer and there are no stragglers sticking out of place.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fiber lash definately made my lashes thicker and longer. Would recommend this to anyone looking to make their lash really stand out.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts that this would work because I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a dry fiber.  I already have long lashes so I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much in lenght, but it sure did deliver in fullness and thickness.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my lashes looked after using it.  It was very easy to use, once I found a Youtube video explaining how to do it.  This is great for a little extra oomph on a night out!</li>
    <li> My eye lashes are pretty thin and short, but I have very little time for a &amp;#34;high maintenance&amp;#34; make up routine, so I don&#x27;t even think about messing around with false eye lashes.  The Prolash+ Fiber Lash Extender seemed easy enough, so I thought I would give it a try.  The bottle looks like a regular mascara bottle but has tiny white fiber pieces on it and applies just like mascara (some of these fly around a bit when applying, so apply slowly).  Per the instructions, I put on a single coat of mascara, brushed some of the fibers on my eye lashes and followed up with another coat of mascara.  My eye lashes were much longer without looking like I had a lot of mascara - and no clumping, which I thought was surprising.  I tried another coat of Lash Extender and then mascara again and they got a bit longer, and still no clumps, so it seems like you can do as little or as much as you need for your desired look.  I also have contact lenses and the Fiber Last Extender hasn&#x27;t bothered my eyes at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited to have found something that makes my lashes look longer without adding any extra time to my morning ritual!</li>
    <li> OMGosh I now have FULL Pretty eye lashes! I have blonde almost invisible eyelashes and would have to apply atleast 6 coats of super black mascara for them to look OK, now one coat of mascara one coat of prolash fiber lash extender the a final coat of mascara and I am good to go! They look GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have Very Thin eyelashes. I have used eyelash extensions for a long time. Although I like the extensions, they can be very expensive. I am 63 years old and I enjoy looking my best. Eye makeup for me is essential. I was so excited to receive the Prolash + Fiber Extender. No more expensive eyelash extensions for me. Although it took me a few applications to get the hang of it, I kept on getting the fibers in my eyes. I started to apply them from the middle of my lashes upwards. That did the trick. I just love how long and glamorous my lashes look now.  First I apply my regular mascara and then I follow with the Fibers. After I apply the fibers I apply another coat of my favorite mascara.  I only apply two coats but you can apply as many as you need to.  It all depends on how long and thick you want your lashes to be. I was also amazed how long they last. I have left my mascara on a couple of days. No smudges at all. They wash off easily with my face soap. Love the product! I give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This product certainly make your lashes look longer and thicker.  Make sure you follow the directions of putting a layer of mascara on first and then following with the lash extender and then a second coat of mascara.  The fibers will get in your eyes otherwise and it is painful and hard to get out once that happens.  When applied as directed, my lashes looked fantastic and I really liked it.  It washed right off with my mascara at the end of the day too.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve seen this product first hand, I find it difficult to believe the positive reviews.  As others as have mentioned, when you pull the wand from the tube, it is covered in some type of dry white stuff.  It looks like someone shredded a cotton ball and then rolled the mascara wand in it.  I was afraid to use this product on my eyes but I tried it out anyway. It left a combination of mascara and white \\&quot;fibers\\&quot; on my eyes. I washed the mess from my face and threw the product in the trash.</li>
    <li> Not sure if  I received an old tube.  The contents were like spun cotton candy and did not adhere to my lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed . . .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it that much. Irritated my eyes, had to return it but seller was good about it.</li>
    <li> It was not lash fibers. It was a tube of white cotton fuzz! Do not waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> Not as good as others but works.</li>
    <li> This product has dried up and is flakey.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> was not satisfied with this purchase at all. I would like a refund Please!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and so easy to use I love it</li>
    <li> Can all these good reviews possibly be on the up and up or are they staged? After receiving this product today that is what I am asking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this. When you pull the brush out of the tube it comes out covered in white fuzz. There is no moisture at all on the brush -- just the white fuzz. It makes your lashes look thicker -- if the kind of look it gives you is something you would be happy with. NOT ME!! I tried to be real careful not to get this too close to my eyeball and I&#x27;m still trying to clear my vision of little fibers in one eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All sarcasm aside, as far as the appearance, I could get the same look by taking a clean mascara brush, rubbing it across dusty furniture and then applying it to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thank you ... I will keep my skimpy lashes if this is the only remedy. I&#x27;m still in shock at all the wonderful reviews because I love trying new things and am pretty open minded but I feel like I really got rooked by this product. Luckily, it was sold and shipped by Amazon so they are refunding my money.</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom trying to recover from stay-at-home-so-no-need-to-do-my-hair-or-makeup-or-change-out-of-yoga-pants-itis....and I don&#x27;t have the time, inclination, or knowledge (honestly) for a complicated make up routine.  My lashes are skimpy and could use some help, so I looked online and ordered this lash extender, but I won&#x27;t lie - I was concerned because a lot of eye make up irritates my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  It applies like regular mascara, except you do need to apply slower (white fibers).  I was very surprised that my lashes DID look longer and didn&#x27;t clump like I expected.  I don&#x27;t use it daily, but it does provide that added ooomph and emphasis on those days I do use it!  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible; I just didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference between using it and just regular mascara. What I did notice was that removing it was problematic (eyes got very irritated and &#x27;gunky&#x27; filled).  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> My home sales friends are always raving about a different brand of these, but the price scared me off.  I decided to try these and they are a home run.  One layer of mascara, brush a layer of these on and one more layer of mascara and my lashes were significantly bolder.  I was afraid it would give a clumpy look, but it really does look like my real lashes are just longer than they actually are.  I wore them all day and they didn&#x27;t flake off or shed mascara.  I am very excited to have found these.</li>
    <li> This fiber lash extender is really awesome! I never leave the house without mascara on and now that I am using the pro lash fiber extenders I am getting so many compliment son my eye lashes and how long they are!  The tube is just like a mascara once you pull it out is is white little fibers on a brush that you just easily apply between mascara coats so easy!! great product I will be recommending this to all of my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I did not notice a big difference in the fullness of my lashes as I had read in other social media reviews. The white like &amp;#34;cotton ball&amp;#34; product that is on the applicator was weird and never sure if when you swiped it in your lashes if it was supposed to stay on your lashes. Hard to tell also when product ran out.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is not what I expected! I was nervous to try this BUT when I did it looks awesome. Put the first layer of mascara and them use this applicator and the fibers extend your lashes. It works really well. Then you seal it with a second layer of mascara. I want to use this every day now that I see how great it makes my lashes. This is very easy to use and extends those lashes like they are fake!</li>
    <li> This is a fun product and much more affordable than others I have seen. The paperwork in the box says the fibers will be black but they weren&#x27;t. They were white but it didn&#x27;t effect the efficacy of the fibers. I applied my mascara, like the instructions said, then applied the fibers then applied another coat of mascara. WOW. THEY ARE LONG. Yuppers. Long long long. I could barely wear my sunglasses.</li>
    <li> Not being familiar with this type of product, I thought it was kinda odd... until I used it. Whoa!! This stuff is cool. It certainly extends and fills in your natural lashes. I brushed on one coat of my favorite mascara followed by a few swipes of the Prolash fibers (careful to not get in your eyes) and ended with another coat of mascara.  No denying the results. Comes off easily when washing your make up off, and certainly easy enough to apply even for those people that are not make-up savvy! (unlike false eyelashes!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn, in all honesty.  I ordered this thinking it was mascara with fiber extenders already in it.  As I look at the ad now, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever thought that because it&#x27;s quite clear!  But despite my obvious misunderstanding, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  You&#x27;re supposed to put a coat of mascara on, follow with the Fiber Lash Extender, and finish with another coat of mascara.  Only one problem. My mascara dries fast!  So I end up doing small sections at a time because otherwise the fibers don&#x27;t have anything to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to.  The first time I took the wand out of the container, it worked great.  But each time after that and the fibers have been coming out of the container in huge clumps.  I have to remove them from the wand with my fingers before I can apply anything to my eyes.  It&#x27;s just very wasteful.  The one time I didn&#x27;t remove them from the wand, I ended up with fibers in my eyes all darn day and it was extremely irritating.  This review probably sounds pretty negative so you might be wondering why I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars, right?  Why?  Because the Fiber Lash Extender works!!  I have thin lashes but they&#x27;re long.  I like to use products that will help them bulk up, as well as make them longer but that&#x27;s hard to find.  Many products (with the fibers in the mascara) get super clumpy, or they don&#x27;t work at all.  This product allows me to enhance my lashes with both length and volume!  Despite all of my concerns, it really does work well!  I won&#x27;t be using this on a daily basis but will be saving it for special events, for sure.  It&#x27;s a whole lot easier than false lashes and looks better, in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the product is actually tiny, sweater-like fibers - no conditioner, or anything to help adhere the fibers to your lashes. Consequently, the fibers tend to fall into the eye, causing irritation. I&#x27;ve used them several different ways; after 2 coats of mascara, as recommended, before applying mascara (lashes are feeble, which is why I bought the product to begin with), and adding the fibers to my mascara. The latter works best, but if one has to go through all the trouble of mixing two products, it would be less expensive and aggravating to buy a product that already has the fibers in the mascara.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Eyelashes definitely look thicker and longer. Easy to use.... but the packaging and instruction are crap.  Apply one coat mascara, then apply the Prolash, then another coat of mascara!  LOVE those lashes!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t what you might expect....it basically looks like fuzz in a mascara tube...so I was skeptical.  However, I was pleasantly surprised because when I applied the fibers to my lashes over my mascara and applied another layer of mascara it definitely thickened and lengthened my lashes!!  Super quick and easy which is important because I am always rushing out the door!  This product doesnt make you look like your have false eyelashes on, but it definitely helps.  Great for everyday.  Washes off when you take your mascara off.  Would recommend it that everyone give it a try!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me - complete waste of money</li>
    <li> Well i was shocked that this Fiber Lash Extender worked !!!! I have always wanted to try something like this but the prices were to much. Wow what a good deal !!! All you have to do is put on your regular mascara that you always use then put Prolash on then your mascara again and the magic begins. Your lashes are longer. Easy to remove. And lasts all day. Amazing i really didnt think it would work LOL</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So simply to use and what great results.  When I opened the bottle it kinda looked like a mascara brush had been dipped in white cotton candy like tiny fibers.  I followed the directions and applied my regular mascara, then applied Prolash + Lash Extender.  At that point I wasn&#x27;t real sure I would get good results, I thought the final results would be clumpy.  But gee when I applied my second coat of my regular mascara what a big difference.  My lashes looked incredible, no clumps. The last time my lashes looked that good they weren&#x27;t mine, they were false lashes and I had spent considerable time trying to get them glued on correctly.  This in my opinion is so much better than false lashes. No worry of coming unglued.  Prolash + Lash Extender stayed on all day with no problem with mascara or the fibers smudging.  When I was ready to remove, I used my normal make up remover and had no problem removing.  I am truly impressed how easy this is to use and what a difference this makes in my lashes.  It&#x27;s fun to have a product that looks good on and makes you feel good about your appearance.</li>
    <li> I have barely there lashes without mascara. I typically use the ProLash lengthening mascara, but got the fiber lash extender for when I want to feel EXTRA flashy... you know, like when I wear my eye glasses. haha It took a youtube video to figure out how to put it on (one coat of mascara, one coat of fibers on top and bottom of upper lashes, then one coat of mascara) but I REALLY love it now. I have made it a part of my daily make up routine.</li>
    <li> I have never used fiber lashes before, so i was unsure of what to expect.  I  love how easy they are to use  with very simple and concise instructions included.  I have used them for about a week now and I can totally tell a difference every time i put them on,  my lashes are fuller and much longer and there are no stragglers sticking out of place. I also love that it is very simple to remove, it was no more difficult to remove my mascara than before using this product.  I would highly recommend this product if you want an inexpensive way to have fuller and longer looking lashes with very little effort.</li>
    <li> This is the best fiber lash extender I&#x27;ve used! I was skeptical at first when I received it that the fibers were white. My last one was black and I thought maybe some of the white would show if you weren&#x27;t careful. I was completely wrong and I actually like the white better because you can use brown or black mascara and it covers and coats the fibers whatever color you choose. It works great and my results are better with this lash extender than my previous one.  You simply apply a coat of your mascara, then coat your lashes with the fiber lash extender and then one more coat of mascara and voila that easy! It comes off easily when you wash your face at night. No eye makeup remover necessary.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with having long and thick lashes, that is, until had children.  I was left with super thin, short lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried many different types of mascara that was supposed to thicken and lengthen but just ended up with a clumpy mess.  The fiber lash extender works wonders!  You MUST make sure that your lashes have no trace of previous mascara or the fibers will not go on evenly!  Just brush on your favorite mascara after applying the fibers and you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews I purchased this ProLash Mascarra.  You can save yourself some money if you just take an old mascara brush, twirl it around in the lint trap of your dryer, making sure the brush head is completely encapsulated in lint.  Apply a layer of mascara then brush the lint on your lashes, then follow with a second layer of mascara.  Just a little tongue in cheek humor but in reality the effect would be the same.  This product is a joke and I can&#x27;t believe the rave reviews.  After seeing that it was not much more than lint on a mascara brush I skeptically gave it a try.  I applied a coat of mascara, followed by ProLash and followed up with another layer of mascara and saw no dramatic difference so I applied another coat of ProLash followed with another layer of mascara still with no better result.  What I did get was irritated eyes because they were full of lint.  Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I got this Fiber Last Extender for my fiancé because she loves to accentuate with her eyes with makeup. She gave me this information: These little fibers from Prolastdo a great job in extending my lashes without fussing around with gluing on extensions. They are very easy to put on, simply brush them on like you&#x27;re putting on mascara and then put on your favorite mascara. Repeat a few times and the fibers blend in to your lashes like they&#x27;re natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note from me: My lady looked amazing. I couldn&#x27;t tell she used any fibers as her look looked gorgeous as always (and natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to fuss around with gluing on lashes and want the all natural long eyelash look, definitely get the Fiber Last Extender by ProLash.</li>
    <li> This product arrived dried out.  The fibers were like cotton stuck to the wand.  I will not order this product again!</li>
    <li> Not  that good it extended  my  lash a little  but not worth  it</li>
    <li> The Prolash worked better than I thought it would.  I put on a single coat of mascara, brushed some of the fibers on my eye lashes and followed up with another coat of mascara as directed. My eye lashes were much longer without looking like I had a lot of mascara - and no clumping.  The fibers don’t flake off on your face . Application is easy and they look great, my lashes are longer and fuller after using Prolash.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - works great!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted this to make a difference.  I read many of the reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I found it to be very dry and not easy to apply.  I did read that this was to be somewhat expected.  I just did not find the end result to be worth the effort of applying and trying to keep little pieces out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! The best product I have used to add volume and length to eyelashes. It is the difference between night and day when I use it. I have very fine, short, straight eyelashes, and i get compliments on my eyelashes all the time when I use this. I like to pair it with maybelline illegal lengths mascara.</li>
    <li> These work better than the I thought! The fibers do not flake off on your face through out the day like other brands. Application is easy and they look fantastic!</li>
    <li> I am genuinely surprised at how much I like this! Recently I have noticed that the eyelashes on my left eye are not as long as the ones on my right eye. I used to use a high end $30 mascara to get longer lashes, but it was getting too expensive to continue. I got these fiber lashes for half the price &amp; they do an even better job of lengthening my eyelashes. It really seemed weird putting these on for the first time. You put your regular mascara on, then you apply the fibers, then a second coat of mascara. The fibers are white &amp; like stretched cotton. They don&#x27;t seem to last all day, but they don&#x27;t smear either -both of those could be related to the mascara though and not the fibers. When I apply them in the morning, I can barely tell that I have them on when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - I have really liked these a lot. I just ordered another bottle. Before I ordered, I looked at some of the other products out there and most of the fiber ones came with a separate gel too. But what was disturbing is that there were lots of reviews about how people were losing some of their lashes with it. I have NEVER had any troubles with that with the Pro-Lash ones. I&#x27;m a happy repeat customer!</li>
