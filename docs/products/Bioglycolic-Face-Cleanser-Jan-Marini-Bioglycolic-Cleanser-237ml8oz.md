<li> My wrinkles are not gone, but I think they are much less noticeable.</li>
<li> ; I&#x27;m seeing a little difference week after week.</li>
<li> Higly reccomend it if you have issues with acne, acne scars and uneven skin tone.</li>
<li> I had no idea what I was missing in my skincare regime until a friend made me try this product.</li>
<li> Being disappointed by a lot of facial product, i had low expectations from this one too.</li>
<li> Made my face breakout even worse than other products.</li>
<li> It really is a game changer.</li>
<li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> That&#x27;s what I do, except I substitute the washcloth with baby wipes as I can&#x27;t be bothered to wash a dirty washcloth every time I cleanse my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years and my skin has never been better. It was suggested to me after I was complaining about my skin not being clear. I was in my mid 20s &amp; was still breaking out a lot. This cleanser has glycolic acid, which is an exfoliant but it&#x27;s not abrasive like other exfoliants. The wash is smooth. I use this face wash and always follow it up with an oil free moisturizer. It works great!</li>
    <li> Powerful cleanser, does not remove makeup but I use it in the morning so it fine, it feels very strong, not for someone who has never used glycolic products before. The glycloic % is not given but its high, maybe 25% based on MD Forte cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works very well at preventing breakouts and unclogging pores when used with a complexion brush.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomended. A good buy at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser works wonders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jan Marini prodcuts for months and decided to order this product.  During the first use I experience some burning.  However, if you use this product you MUST wash it completely and ensure the product is off.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my skin without drying it out or making it oily.  With continued use, improves dark spots and overall complexion.</li>
    <li> Being disappointed by a lot of facial product, i had low expectations from this one too. I can say that i&#x27;m pleasanly surprised. I saw an immediate improvement after one use and it keeps getting better as i use it every day. Great product! Higly reccomend it if you have issues with acne, acne scars and uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> TRIED THIS FACE CLEANSER BECAUSE IT WAS &#x27;JANMARINI&#x27; DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT ALL THE HYPE IS ABOUT, SAW NO DIFFERENCE IN THIS CLEANSER,</li>
    <li> I leave it on a minute before washing off. I think it helps my acne.</li>
    <li> Great product line. I have used this cleanser through out the years. It is great for all skin types and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Plus you don&#x27;t need to use that much so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Part of a regime learned through a program called Faces Plus  that my daughter uses to keep her face clear.  It&#x27;s the only regime that&#x27;s worked for her after trying, literally everything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked that well that I&#x27;ve actually spent more than double what I usually would for a facial cleanser and I&#x27;ve done it 3 times. I&#x27;m a 35 year old African American and I&#x27;ve had major problems with acne since I was 14. My skin has been rough since then and I get lots of small bumps on the sides of my nose that I usually tried to remove with facial scrubs. This cleanser hasn&#x27;t cleared up my acne -- I&#x27;m on medication for that -- but it has made my skin so much smoother that I no longer use scrubs to get rid of the smaller bumps. It does sting a bit sometimes, but I&#x27;ve also been getting chemical peels so its nothing I can&#x27;t manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state to massage it into dry skin and remove with a wet washcloth and then splash face with water. That&#x27;s what I do, except I substitute the washcloth with baby wipes as I can&#x27;t be bothered to wash a dirty washcloth every time I cleanse my face. I usually massage it in really well, and may even leave it on for a couple of minutes for a little more exfoliation. I also use it on my neck for a more even, smoother complexion in that area and am thinking of also using it on my chest. It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any means, but I&#x27;ve been able to go without using facial scrubs for months and for me that&#x27;s a big improvement. I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness at removing eye makeup as I don&#x27;t wear any. Overall, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleanser for years. I have combination skin and this product leaves my face feeling hydrated and clean. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and does an excellent job at removing dirt and oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through just about every face wash and still had pimples. My plastic surgeon recommended this one so I tried it and my face looks fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Happy to get at a cheaper price here than everywhere else.</li>
    <li> I recently strted using this cleanser again and am wondering why I ever stopped, it does a great job and I can feel it working to exfoliate my skin gently.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; Excellent  price</li>
    <li> I am a skin and hair care product addict, and feel that for facial cleansing, this is a must have, and beats everything I&#x27;ve tried, from high-end to low-end. I skin is supple and dewy and feels freshly scrubbed. It really is a game changer. Note, you really need to wear sunscreen when using this, I found. My skin usually isn&#x27;t sensitive to sun (I&#x27;m Hispanic), but when using this, I tend to burn more easily.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I use this as my cleanser, along with Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide 10% gel. Also use Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with aloe vera and rose pedals, plus moisturize with Olay&#x27;s beauty lotion. Never had clear skin, until I started this regimen. Secure packaging and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is just part of the Jan Marini line. To see results you must try the series. I was not a believer of any &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; facial products until a friend who&#x27;s skin I had remarked on how beautiful it is, told me about it. I started by purchasing the kit from an spa. Amazon has much better prices! After using the kit I continue to order whatever I am running out of on Amazon. This cleanser has glycolic acid in it. It can be a bit drying. I am only using it once a day. I do have to say that my skin has never looked better. I also use the Jan Mariini c-esta toner (my fav) and the Bioclear cream. I top it all off with either the Age intervention moisturizer or sometimes the Transformation moisturizer. They are both great. This stuff is pricy. But I think it is worth it. A bit of this stuff goes a long way. My wrinkles are not gone, but I think they are much less noticeable. I am very happy with this product line and will continue to use it. My friend who uses this product did so due to some acne issues. She said this is the only product that has worked for her. Of course, you have to order accordingly to what your skin issue is.</li>
    <li> Jan Marini products are awesome. Your skin will improve so much. If you suffer from cystic acne the bio clear gel works wonders, it kills the cyst and its gone within a couple days. I&#x27;ve had such great results with bioglycolic  cleanser as well.. You just can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> this is the only face cleanser i&#x27;ve ever used that was not  a waste of money, its soo effective, it cleared my skin in like two days. i actually just purchased more to ensure i wont run out and plan on continueing to do just that</li>
    <li> this is always on my bathroom counter.  i use it right after my face wash.  this if the foundation for my skincare regime.</li>
    <li> the product work just as described and work very well with my daily regiment. i will definitely reorder from the same company.</li>
    <li> Great smell, foams up nice, great feel on the sking!</li>
    <li> This has helped control breakouts and treat existing ones. It also makes my face feel smoother and seems to help treat existing scars/dark spots.</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout even worse than other products. Also I have never had an allergic reaction til I used this.</li>
    <li> I use this, the c-esta serum and I take a beta-carotene supplement. That is my cystic acne regimen and it is amazing. I went from ten cystic pimples on my cheek and chin any given moment and now I rarely have ONE - I rarely have any pimples. I think this and the c-esta have been helping me get rid of the acne scars too; I&#x27;m seeing a little difference week after week. I have recommended this product to my sister-in-law and two colleagues. There is a semi-buzz or sting at first while rubbing it in but it goes away. Also, the way you use his product is different than what we&#x27;re used to - You are supposed to rub it into dry skin - then use a damp cloth to remove it - THEN splash your face with luke warm water 10 times. I don&#x27;t know if you HAVE to do it that way... but I do and it&#x27;s been working well.</li>
    <li> Cleans your skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It doesn&#x27;t form any suds so at first I was skeptical, but nicely surprised at how well it worked.</li>
    <li> I use this when my regular cleanser is either too expensive or not available and this is great if you need a glycolic cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and wish there were coupons for it.  I also love the other products that she has. I use an benzoly peroxide cream of hers also.  That stuff gets rid of acne right away- I can get some acne the day before and put it on and it is gone by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I really love the Jan Marini line.  My skin does great with it.  And it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy here than in a spa.</li>
    <li> I must start off by saying I love almost anything Jan Marini has on the market. All her products work for what they are meant for. I have oily hormonal skin, and combined this wash with the bioglycolic serum and c-esta serum and have found that after a week any signs of acne has vanished. Unfortunately, my financial situation has changed, so I can no longer afford her products.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is a great option for those who have cystic acne.  I have been using this and other bioglycolic products for years and it keeps my cystic acne under control.  So far it is the only thing that have worked for me.  Use it with the bioclear lotion and benzoyl peroxide 10%, with the jan Marini antioxidant SPF face lotion.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is like a smoothing product for your skin. It will keep it super clean, smoothe and unbelievably soft</li>
    <li> I had no idea what I was missing in my skincare regime until a friend made me try this product. It instantly changed the look of my skin. I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and my skin looks amazing! People have been telling me that I look like I&#x27;m in my mid/late 20&#x27;s-- I&#x27;m 37!! I have no more blotchy spots, no more huge-random-break-out-zits, it&#x27;s helping to minimize the look of my sunspots and fine lines, and my skin consistently looks good even during &amp;#34;that time of the month.&amp;#34; I cannot say enough good things about this product!! For the price, you have nothing to lose!</li>
