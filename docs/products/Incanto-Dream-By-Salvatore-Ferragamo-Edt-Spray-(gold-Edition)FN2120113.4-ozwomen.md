      <li>Prior orders of discount perfume from other Amazon venders were totally fine though.</li>
      <li>All the local perfume shops wanted at least 50 or more for a smaller size</li>

<li> The only thing that I would like to have different is the spray, it leaks a little bit, but it has nothing to do with the seller.</li>
<li> It smelled a little different than the sample</li>
<li> It just runs down the side o bottle and coats my hand.</li>
<li> Update--- after a couple days, the sprayer is now broken and the perfume just leaks out of the side!</li>
<li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the smell.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> Very annoying</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything but every time i spray it the spill all down the sides from the top.  But like all Ferragamo scents, it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I received the product, I really loved the fragrance, but there is a problem with the spray because it is broken. About the rest, is very good.</li>
    <li> Great floral, but clean scent, so glad I gave it a try! I gave it for the holidays, and everyone loved it!</li>
    <li> Smells like flowers and tropical fruit all at once.  I wear this one summer-early fall.  Plus I got it on a GREAT sale.</li>
    <li> Like all the Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto line, this fragrance is very good. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only thing that I would like to have different is the spray, it leaks a little bit, but it has nothing to do with the seller. The product came in wrapped up in its original plastic and box. I would buy it again anyway.</li>
    <li> Incanto Dream Eau de Toilette Spray for Women is as all the other products of Salvatore Ferragamo, great  !!!! Wow!</li>
    <li> Smells very fresh just wished it would last longer but my middle of day I spray some more and that works.l</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!!!! It was a Christmas present. It arrived on time, the packing was excellent. Everything about this purchase was just fine. I bought several fragances for my family they were all very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> It smelled a little different than the sample but I still like it.  I just wish it had more of a fruity scent to it.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite scents, I was very surprised to see it so cheap on Amazon. All the local perfume shops wanted at least 50 or more for a smaller size so I had to pick this up when I saw the price.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this spray, it has a light floral scent and lasts for hours. I would put it on one day and still smell it on my body when I woke up the next morning. Definitely get this while it is so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the seal on the nozzle, it leaks a bit when you use it, but other than that I haven&#x27;t had any issues and will probably buy another to store for later.</li>
    <li> Incanto Dream Is a beautiful fragrance ! I wish it had a bit more staying power so I would not have to refresh during the day. All in all it is a wonderful fragrance and I would highly suggest trying it out.</li>
    <li> The bottles leak a lot and do not spray out. It just runs down the side o bottle and coats my hand.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this fragrance I fell in love with it. Very light but noticeable.  I get complements all the time.  To all ladies give this product a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My one and only fragrance. Always get compliments. Has a clean crisp smell.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit like insect repellant (deet) to me, especially when I first put it on. Needless to say, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the smell. I will definitely stick to something I&#x27;ve smelled in person from now on. I smelled Amity in person and really liked it, but &amp;#34;dream&amp;#34; was cheaper so I decided to go for it. 😐 Update--- after a couple days, the sprayer is now broken and the perfume just leaks out of the side! Very annoying and now I have a full bottle that I can&#x27;t use.  But, I asked a couple people and they said it doesn&#x27;t smell like insect repellant to them, so that is good at least</li>
    <li> I am almost positive I received a bottle of hairspray. Barely the scent I love, mixed with rubbing alcohol. Prior orders of discount perfume from other Amazon venders were totally fine though.</li>
