    <li> I really wanted to just love this, I did. But I just didn&#x27;t. It works exactly like any other hair oil you put in your hair except this one is just slightly more drying than the rest. Probably won&#x27;t use the rest of it. But it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this oil!</li>
    <li> Best coconut oil by far.  Just a few drops makes my hair soft and supple.  It has never been easier to manage my hair.  I am so hooked on this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product came quick !!</li>
    <li> It moisturizers my hair very well and leaves it smooth and shiny, right down to the tip. Good hair product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil it&#x27;s great for all hair types but especially natural hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and very moisturizing. Leaves the hair feeling great and healthy.  I also use it on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and how it leaves my hair but im cleaning my hands for 5min afterwards, i really dont like that. plus if i use it two days in a row it looks like my hair hasnt been washed in a month even though i only used less than a quarter size drop...weird</li>
    <li> Great product great investment</li>
    <li> very good hair oil,truly recommend .</li>
    <li> Always with me for my hair, yep cannot lived without it, no matter where i travel. Make my hair get thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this product it make my hair so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! I WISH THEY HAD A LARGER BOTTLE FOR LONG HAIR FOR WOMEN.</li>
    <li> Just excellent, no complaints at all, recommend to anyone!  have read so many &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; about having to warm it up...it being thick, etc.  But most women of color do not complain about the petroleum, mineral oiled based, gooky oils that really damage the hair, why complain about this oil, that is coconut oil based, (that will get thick but softens in the heat of your hand!) excellent for your hair, not to mention the other herbal benefits.  -very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> This product smells so good! I expected it to be an oil but this product becomes solid in colder temperatures. It can be warmed in your hands or microwave if needed, although I don&#x27;t know if the bottle is microwave safe. It leaves my hair silky and soft. I will buy this again and again and again!</li>
    <li> The product is a five. I prefer the 10.14 ounces size.It has a long shelf life. It lasts for at least over a year before the product develops tiny lumps. I give it a five with the stopper since it liquifies in warm to hot weather.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like coconut at all. I was looking for that fragrance. I understand there are a couple of other ingredients included but overall the coconut is the smell that&#x27;s missing. Other than that it did take away the frizziness especially at the ends of my hair. Worked well flat-ironing my hair also and it was a great price for free shipping.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair. I use it the day before shampooing. Mix with castor and almond oil. Put conditioning cap with turban towel. My hair is soft shiny. My curls love it. The only reason I gave it four stars, skin breaks out by forehead. But my hair is definitely healthier.</li>
    <li> It is really obnoxious to open and I end up spilling it all over my self every time I use it.</li>
    <li> i color my hair a lot and is straight so is damage so i did not belive to much in this product wow i was worng i put oil at nite in VERY loosly french braid and next day wash it omg wow everyone ask me what i do with my hair  :-)  me encanta mi pelo</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Fell in love the first time I used it. And will recommend for every one to buy</li>
    <li> Used this as soon as I got it turned my hair into a nasty mess will never use this product again very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> this product is very good! i love what it does for my hair,as i only use it for my hair purposes, but i will definately repurchase this again!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and everything about it</li>
