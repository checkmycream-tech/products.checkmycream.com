<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this!  I have received many compliments on how great this smells.</li>
    <li> Awful smell.  The sample in the department store smelled totally different.  You only need to put one spray on, if you can tolerate that!</li>
    <li> This perfume smelled nothing like a sample I had smelled in store. I am still extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift but picked it out at Ulta. Smells amazing and expensive.</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipment</li>
    <li> With pink pepper, strawberry, and tangerine top notes, to a white floral center and a powdery dry-down, this scent sounds intoxicating. However, the top notes combine to smell vaguely like sweet-tarts (several friends mentioned it). The dry-down IS nice and powdery, but nothing I would deem special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be how it reacts on my particular skin. Every fragrance smells different on everyone. I usually do really well with with white florals with a woodsy base, however. I was just hoping for more of that Jimmy Choo sparkle! :( Wanted to like this.</li>
    <li> Love this one so much when i first smell it i was so much in love with the smell.is like fresh clean smell not too much over powering smell just right</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume at a great discount. the best deal you will find for this size bottle. i just hope i can get more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments.  Every time I wear this perfume someone stops me and ask about the name of the perfume that I am wearing.  It smells delightful on me and last a very long time.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and the best part is that lasts Very long! I feel so sexy when I wear it. My fav</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great fragrance</li>
    <li> Stinks smells horrible my worst purchase by far</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother completwly satisfied, shes loves it and wears it constantly and has absolutely no complaints. The box was solidly squeezed but perfume intact, thats my complaint!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged awesome price! Smells great, what more could a girl ask for?! Looked for this perfume at other places and it retailed for over $100 for this size. Will be ordering more if still available when I run out.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  This perfume was the Same size as the one in the department store and $30 cheaper!!!!  I smell delightful! So says my co-workers and church members. :-)</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this scent! Great value for the larger bottle! Arrived 5 days after ordering. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ve been a prime member for 3 years and I&#x27;ve always had a great experience. Most of my items were delivered in 2-3 days, but this item took 8 days! This was sooooo infuriating as it was a prime item. I don&#x27;t know if was Amazon&#x27;s problem or the seller, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again. Also, a few days after I ordered the perfume it went down four dollars, grrrrr. That said, the item was packaged well and was still a great price when I purchased it(40 dollars less than department stores!). Also, the quality is excellent, it smells rich and glamorous, and is exactly what I hoped for. I am pleased now that I have my perfume, but it took way too long to receive it. I would definitely recommend buying this product, but you may be in for a long wait.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so beautiful!  Will wear everyday! The scent  Seems to be long lasting. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I smelled inside of a magazine and loved it. So I bought it and I love it still!!!the bottle is pretty ad well.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and it last for a long time. This would be a nice summer scent for you.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Jimmy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance they sent, but they did take the return and refunded my shipping too.&lt;br /&gt;While the fragrance bottle was great, the fragrance itself didn&#x27;t match my memory of this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the time involved in the turn - around, and instead of crediting my credit card, they gave me Amazon credit, which I was less than thrilled about, but have since used.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume I get a million compliments of how great I smell !! I have problems with a lot of perfumes giving me headaches but this one has never given me a headache !! Several of my friends have asked what I&#x27;m wearing and they have ordered it ASAP they all love it !!</li>
    <li> Smells great and you cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and its a bargain thru this site.</li>
    <li> It is a great perfume. Shipping speed was great but there was a leak at the neck of the bottle. Due to that problem  I cannot carry it while traveling. That makes me sad.</li>
    <li> Caught a sample of this in a magazine while getting my hair done - had to have it.  Price through Amazon was almost 50% less than department store.</li>
    <li> Fragrances are personal but this one makes an excellent gift. You will definitely get compliments wearing this one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and cheaper here than in the stores I looked at.</li>
    <li> This product is authentic and it smells so great.  It also has wonderful staying power.</li>
    <li> I smelled this in a magazine sample and LOVED it, went crazy for it.  When it arrived, it didn&#x27;t seem like the same product at all.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but for what it cost and compared to the sample, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this parfum for my wife and decide to see if I could get a better price on line.  She loved it and I purchased it for less than half the cost at our local store.  Delivery was fast and accuracty@</li>
    <li> I would reccomend buying this for your wife or a girl friend.  Will make them feel sexy whe wearing it!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, long lasting, vanilla top notes but in a mature enough base to not be childish. I call this my &amp;#34;27-year-old perfume&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s perfect for a 27 year old woman; not too young, not too old-lady-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t choose Amazon Prime and decide to purchase from the Marketplace instead, I will advise against buying from Perfumeland Megastore. Ordered it on 2/11 and shipping took almost 2 weeks; when I finally got it on the 21st, the package label indicated that it was shipped to the post office first, then from there to my own address. I don&#x27;t even want to know what mail service operates that way, but it&#x27;s probably the cause for the delay. Not a huge deal in the end but still the longest shipping I&#x27;ve ever had from an Amazon seller; even international shipping from UK sellers is faster than that.</li>
    <li> Great Scent.... Always receive compliments when wearing this fragrance... Unfortunately, Jimmy Choo has discontinued this</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in the major department stores for almost twice the price.I Love it!! I get a lot of compliments every time I wear Jimmy Choo Flash!!!</li>
    <li> I love the original Jimmy Choo. I had several friends tell me I would love Flash.  But it is not for me. It smells like a old lady perfume to me.  I don&#x27;t like it at all!! I wished I did because perfume.  I hope the Exotic by Jimmy Choo is better than Flash</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, rather on the light side.  But stays on throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and a great price!</li>
    <li> I received Jimmy Choo, not bad product but Flash did not receive as requested.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take because the paperwork for shipment from Paraguay would be a waste of time.</li>
    <li> I loved it the only thing I would have like is other samples to be able to purchase other scents I go to retail store to find what smells nice and then purchase online I do recommend but depends on what you purchase at retail stores give gifts thank you</li>
    <li> I have been buying small bottles of this for months bc it smells incredible and lasts all day ! I was told it left a lasting impression when I left a room even. I splurged on this big bottle and have been nothing but disappointed !!! It does smell like the the other but only if someone has their face an inch from my skin ! It doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use either :-(</li>
    <li> gave this to my wife, she loves it, and I really like it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance before from Macy.  This is a pretty powerful and noticeable aroma.  Needless to say the fragrance aroma did not last long at all.  You forget you are wearing it because it fades pretty quickly.  I believe it to be a knockoff.  I feel ripped off.  Should have known better because of the price.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Product as expected😊. Packaging: inadequate padding. Regardless product fine. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very different from the original Jimmy Choo which is one of my all time favorites.  But I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells vibrant n exciting  a cool  mixture of spicy n floral musk. Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Love the scent and receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> This fragrance  is wonderful I  bought this perfume for myself and  would buy it for a gift  , the price was good and I would order it again</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipment.  I first bought this perfume in Bloomingdales very expensive and I loved it.  When I went back to get another one they told me it wasn&#x27;t a good seller, don&#x27;t know why because the scent is delightful.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells amazing! love it</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my parfum!!!!</li>
    <li> This  odor was that I&#x27;ve been looking for long time. I could smell some warm, fresh and light odor on other women but couldn&#x27;t ask what perfume they wearing. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As advertised fast delivery</li>
    <li> I smelled this scent in a sample from another store and fell in love with it...but not the price tag.  Found it on another website and actually thought I ordered it...only to find out that I&#x27;d ordered the wrong thing (returned it)...THEN I found JC Flash on Amazon...HALLELUJAH!!  And at the right price.  I&#x27;m in heavan.  Can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive!!</li>
    <li> Smells just like at Macy&#x27;s. So much more inexpensive. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy this perfume!!! I originally bought this at kohl&#x27;s. The tester was 3oz. I assumed the one in the package in the security case was the same size. When I got it home after paying $68.00 I found out the bottle I purchased was only 1.3 oz. I then searched amazon and found this full size for half the cost. Nice try kohl&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Half the price of Sephora!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift, it smells great.</li>
    <li> Ok I went to Dillards to purchase this for my Sister for Christmas and it came in a little box for 102$$$, I then looked on my Amazon App on my phone for a Barcode scan and found it for half the price. Lets just say i ran out of that Dillards with a smile on my face</li>
    <li> As I mentioned about the body lotion, this is not sophisticated enough for me. This Flash is now TRASH!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume but it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I knew this buying it from the pervious sample I had but it seems like its lasting even less now that I bought the full bottle.  Smells great when you can smell it get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell of this perfume.  I highly recommend it. The woman in your life will love you even more.</li>
    <li> Authentic, smells amazing at a wonderful price. A must buy!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! Bright, floral, feminine and yummy...It arrived fairly fast and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> Something young and fresh about this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> It came packaged properly. Not sure if its the real deal or not,says made in Paris France but the boyfriend says it smells soapy so its a fail for me since I read reviews and they all gave rave reviews that this was a sexy fragrance. I got this at a steal for $30 so cant be upset he doesnt like it, I will still wear it and see if the fragrance changes on me, it will smell different just smelling it from bottle compared to on your skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! Great price too!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after she put on the sample found in a magazine. It made a great present and I enjoy the smell. It catches me off guard every time she wears it because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife.  I received it very quick and as promised.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the bottle</li>
