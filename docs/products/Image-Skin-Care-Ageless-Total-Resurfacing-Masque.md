      <li>It feels so good on, and leaves my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The girls at the place where I used to get my facials (I say used to because now I do most of my own treatments at home)</li>

      <li>Have tried many.  </li>
      <li>I love this mask.</li>
      <li>Love to dab in on my breakouts before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>I love this masque.</li>
      <li>use it weekly, love it</li>
      <li>so I love the way my face feels after using this product</li>

      <li>I love the results.  </li>
      <li>It as ok, but does not meet the expectations I had.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite face scrub.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased that I ordered more</li>

      <li>I really love this product.</li>

      <li>This is still one of my favorite skin products.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this product on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>After about a month of use, I found using this more than 1-2 times a week</li>
      <li>and it still makes old skin feel great.  </li>
      <li>I feel comfortable using it 2-3 times a week because I tend to get breakouts if I don&#x27;t stay on top of exfoliating, etc.  </li>
      <li>Feel very clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
      <li>I pair it up with the Ageless cream and together they work pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>I bought GlamGlow a couple of years ago and it was effective at first, but since then it has been sitting on a shelf...</li>
      <li>Scent also different: not quite as pleasant or refreshing as it used to be.</li>
      <li>When using acid (alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids), and enzyme exfoliating products, make sure to ALWAYS protect that freshly exfoliated face with a SPF 30 during the day.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I get great results by using this product 2-3 times per week followed with a vitamin-infused serum/moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin bright and soft.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to shrink pores and have a nice glowing skin.</li>
      <li>If the companies that I purchased my product from on Amazon would like to make a statement and prove that they have the authority to sell  genuine Image Skin Care products</li>
      <li>Even my makeup foundation applies so much better and stays fresh looking longer.  </li>
      <li>Ive use this product, salycic face wash, medicated lotion and bleaching serum gor two weeks and my skin looks and feels great, alot of acne scars are 80% gone, I would definitely continue to use!</li>
      <li>Love this masque, worth every penny</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Image Total Resurfacing Masque does just that, it gently resurfaces your skin to smoothness. When I first received it I used it every other night for 2 weeks. Since that time I&#x27;ve used it 1-2x a week to maintain that flawless quality. The morning after I use the masque make-up goes on seamlessly. It&#x27;s like magic in a tube for times when you want to look really great and need some magic to make it happen. I&#x27;ve never had any reaction to the product (even when I used it 3x a week) which I love because my skin can sometimes be sensitive. I purchased this the first time with the Image Total Lightening Serum but found the masque to be a better overall lightener for me so I won&#x27;t be buying the serum again, I&#x27;ll stick with the masque which definitely works.</li>
    <li> skin feels soft, less flaky and dry looking.</li>
    <li> I use this once or twice a month to freshen up my complexion. It always makes my skin clear and fresh, even though I&#x27;m over 40 years old :)</li>
    <li> I used this product for years when I worked for Coldwater Creek the Spa. Loved it.  I know it is a masque, however I use it 2 ways.  I cleanse my face and warm the product in the sink in it&#x27;s container in warm water.  I then apply to my face in a scrubbing motion with my fingers and then leave on 10 minutes as a masque. So I use it as a scrub and a masque. I then remove with a warm wash cloth.  I love the results.  It tightens my pores, gets rid of dryness and my skin seems so bright!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Image Vital C products (all of them, cleanser, serum, cream, scrub and mask).  AWESOME PRODUCTS.  my face has never looked better.  Very smooth and even and no breakouts.  I used to breakout with anything else.  GREAT PRODUCT LINE and good investment for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, love the result!  My skin was so soft!!</li>
    <li> use it weekly, love it</li>
    <li> Helps clear up break outs. It arrived quickly and intact.</li>
    <li> Totally changed my skin.  I look younger and have less skin issues.  I love it!  I use it 3 times per week.  Even clients and co coworkers have noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Sunday night and it was in my mailbox Wednesday! The seller packaged it correctly. The item was as described and was sealed and unopened. Thank-you. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great creamy consistancy with exfoliating texture, interesting smell (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;I get regular microderm treatments every other month and a facial every month, this product is perfect for in between treatments. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin beat to crap and damaged, it gently exfoliates just enough! Follow up with a great moisutrizer!&lt;br /&gt;My face feels extremely smooth.</li>
    <li> very refreshing mask!</li>
    <li> This mask is great!!  I love the exfoliating beads in it!  It gives you a deeper cleansing &amp; smoother skin when you wash it off.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and product exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> Product is very different from all the prior ones I have bought over the past several years. Product consistency is different: granules are much smaller and more painful to use than the micro-beads of the former formulation. Scent also different: not quite as pleasant or refreshing as it used to be. Not sure if I will re-order product if this is a permanent reformulation as opposed to a one tube anomaly. It&#x27;s too bad - I always loved using this product.</li>
    <li> I just love this Image product!  It goes on so smooth!  Can really tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Update: This is still one of my favorite skin products.  After about a month of use, I found using this more than 1-2 times a week will over-dry my skin, plus, my skin doesn&#x27;t really need it as often now.  My complexion is brighter, softer and around my eyes and upper lip is visibly smoother, no more fine crepe lines! The 2oz tube goes a long way.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin care needs have changed a bit over the past few years.  I wish I could remember who told me about this masque so I could thank them, hopefully I&#x27;ll remember. I use this 2-3 times a week even if I don&#x27;t really need it more than once per week, just because it makes my skin feel so wonderful.  After just a few uses my skin is smoother, softer and my skin-tone is more even in color.  It exfoliates nicely without being too harsh for mature skin...I highly recommend it for mature skin. I didn&#x27;t realize my skin had grown a kind of dull until after I used this, now my face has a brighter glowing texture to it. After rinsing, my face is shiny clean and firm but without that tight dryness. Even my makeup foundation applies so much better and stays fresh looking longer.  I was so pleased that I ordered more so I wouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s well worth the price. There&#x27;s so many skincare products out there that end up being a disappointment but this product really does deliver and perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, you only need a small amount, shake well before you use. Only need small dime size amount. I wash my skin first then apply this scrub. I then let it set like a mask for several minutes then wet my fingers and use my moist fingers to re wet the scrub before I rinse it off. When you rinse off your skin feels amazing. This product has some glycolic acid so if you have sensitive skin it may seem irritating. I have tolerant skin but even my sensitive skin friends find that if they use this once or twice a month followed by a nice moisturizer they love the refreshed feel it gives them. Avoid sun right after using this mask or any extreme weather which can also be irritating.</li>
    <li> I have slowly started to fill my skin care regiment with this line of products but this by far is my favorite!  My dermatologist recomened this line after a treatment and gave me a few samples.  I like them and decided to try this one based on several of the reviews.  I have used this product  three times a week for about 30 minutes in conjunction with the Vital C Hydrating Enzyme mask (about 30 minutes too) as others have mentioned.  I have been doing this for about two weeks within three treatments, my face was smoother much softer and the dark spots on my face seemed to have lessened.  My face feels tighter and even my husband has commented about how good it looks.  This will be a permant part of my routine.  I would highly recomend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I&#x27;ve used so far. After using, i felt my face is extremely cleaned without that tightening effect. My foundation also stays &amp; look better the next day &amp; I attribute that to this mask.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to everyone.</li>
    <li> Super mask. I have used this for the first few times the last week and have noticed a difference in tone and texture of skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face scrub. A bit expensive but a little bit lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> However since I have oily skin there really wasn&#x27;t that much of improvement for me. I would not recommend it to someone with oily acne prone skin</li>
    <li> This arrived early.  Great service.  I loved the fact that the tube had a seal over the top.  My mailman would have made a mess out of it other wise!! I used it today and it made my skin feel so clean and soft. I&#x27;m over 50 and it still makes old skin feel great.  Pricing is good too.</li>
    <li> This is a facial scub and mask in one. I do like it, smells good and will burn a bit if you have any open skin areas.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of the Image products and have seen a big difference in my skin. I have very oily skin and the Image Ageless Masque takes a lot of the oils out of my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff that always gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! Ive use this product, salycic face wash, medicated lotion and bleaching serum gor two weeks and my skin looks and feels great, alot of acne scars are 80% gone, I would definitely continue to use! Use lots of mosturizer though!</li>
    <li> wesome. Love it, great cleanser and face wash trusted name brand and product I totally recommend it to face washers</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Use it in the morning before applying makeup for a great facial appearance.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to shrink pores and have a nice glowing skin.</li>
    <li> This product came with high reviews and when I got it, it smelled funny.  It smelled like it was old or expired.</li>
    <li> Love to dab in on my breakouts before I go to bed. Helps clear them up</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to acid masks, this will burn the first time you try it. I could barely keep it on my face for 2 minutes the first time and had to wash it off with cool water. That said, it was only a sensation and didn&#x27;t make my skin red or gave me a rash. I use it now about every 3-4 days before bed and love the way my skin feels the next morning. I pair it up with the Ageless cream and together they work pretty nicely. For the price, I think it&#x27;s well worth it. Unlike the other readers, I like the beads. It helps to wash it off completely. I can leave it on now for the full 30 min. Although, I do get a slight burning sensation after I rinse and apply the cream, but not enough to make me wash it off. The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t put the cream either because it intensified the burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My skin feels really refreshed and clean and balanced with moisture. It is well tolerated by my sensitive skin and does not seem to cause any break outs.</li>
    <li> Have tried many.  This is finally THE PRODUCT for my skin. Use it as directed and you will feel and see results in a very short time.</li>
    <li> I 1st purchased this product at a MedSpa in Orange County years ago. They stopped carrying this line but I like it so well I&#x27;ll continue buying it online...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for a few years, starting at age 24. The word resurfacing is the best word. My skin can be in rough shape, and one use makes it feel completely new. And not just for a day, it feels amazing continuously. I use sparingly, not necessarily even weekly, just as needed when my skin needs a boost.</li>
    <li> I love this masque. It is also a great exfoliant. It makes my skin smooth and glow! I Love it!</li>
    <li> I get this product from my salon all the time... They filled this bottle with something else!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist, and I use it weekly to exfoliate my aging skin.  It has a refreshing tingle and a minty-fresh smell.</li>
    <li> It as ok, but does not meet the expectations I had.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent exfoliant.</li>
    <li> Feel very clean and smooth.  This is my 3rd purchases.</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;IMAGE&amp;#34; products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mask!!!</li>
    <li> This masque this great for aging, oily, acne, and sun damaged skin.  With both AHAs and BHAs it is a great at home mini peel 1-3 times a week.  At night, I&#x27;ll cleanse my face with the Ageless Total Cleanser, apply a thin layer of the Resurfacing Masque for about 10 minutes, rinse, then follow with a thin layer of the Vital C Hydrating Enzyme Masque for 15 minutes.  Rinse with tepid water, pat dry, then apply a few drops of the Ageless Bleaching Serum onto areas with old acne scars, and finish with the Ageless Total Repair Creme.  Needless to say, I LOVE Image!  NOTE: When using acid (alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids), and enzyme exfoliating products, make sure to ALWAYS protect that freshly exfoliated face with a SPF 30 during the day.  If you don&#x27;t protect your skin from daily sun and environmental free radical damage, no product on the planet will repair damaged skin cells.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Makes my skin soft an removes impuritys.</li>
    <li> The girls at the place where I used to get my facials (I say used to because now I do most of my own treatments at home) would RAVE about this mask.  They sold it there, but I found it cheaper on Amazon.  Boy, is this mask is one that I never plan to be without!  It feels so good on, and leaves my skin nice and smooth.  I feel comfortable using it 2-3 times a week because I tend to get breakouts if I don&#x27;t stay on top of exfoliating, etc.  I wish it came in a jumbo tube!!</li>
    <li> I have been using image skin care products for about a year and my skin looks great.  The resurfacing masque is really nice it is a nice exfoliant and very refreshing.  It leaves your skin bright and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image products for two months &amp; like this masque very much.  I have sensitive skin and this is gentle enough yet effective.</li>
    <li> Great scrub. Smells amazing. Best to use on barely damp skin for best results.</li>
    <li> Great for acne prone/oily skin! I instantly notice after I use this mask, my skin is brighter and cleaner :) I use this mask 2-3 times a week. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Image Skincare products for about six months. Problematic skin has really cleared up. Using the mask a couple times per week really keeps my complexion glowing!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this mask.  Since using it, I have not seen any noticeable change on my face.  I feel it is another product I wasted money on.  I will not recommend.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product on Amazon.  My professional sells the products, but at a much higher price.  The product itself is amazing in keeping my face clean and feeling great.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this product and I purchased it directly from her originally,  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon in a larger size for a better price and delivered to my door.  Can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for several weeks and do notice that my skin is clearer and softer. I have used a more expensive masque before and think this is just as good, maybe better.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My local med spa recommended this product.  They sell it there, but it&#x27;s cheaper through Amazon!  So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great</li>
    <li> Keeps me looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
    <li> the BEST BEST BEST masque!!! Image skin products are the best</li>
    <li> All image C products are great. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have spent thou$and$ over the past 15 years on facials, treatments, and &#x27;miracle&#x27; products.  I bought GlamGlow a couple of years ago and it was effective at first, but since then it has been sitting on a shelf... u$ele$$.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I was introduced to Image products about 18 mos ago and my skin gets great results!  I have found Image products are the best for me.  Personally, I get great results by using this product 2-3 times per week followed with a vitamin-infused serum/moisturizer.  About 3 mos ago, I started using it on my neck, chest and hands.  I am starting to notice fading of scars/spots and brighter skin tone on these areas as well.  Remember to always use sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I am not to pleased, first of all it is very drying and second I was shortened on the product. it is only about half a tube. personally I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Go to Corepower Yoga and Spa MN to talk to a licensed Esthetician to direct you down the right path for your specific skin type and its needs. They sell the IMAGE skin care line there. Don&#x27;t waste money buying something you do not know for sure you need for your skin type!</li>
    <li> Love Image Skin Care products.</li>
    <li> Effective for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Like they say, Buyer beware!!!!!  I purchased a couple of Image Skin Care products from the Amazon website, and unless Image Skin Care has changed their formula and fragrance, this does not feel, smell or perform like the Image Skin Care products that I have purchased from the spas in the past.  I find this quite deceptive and will not purchase this or other items of this type on the Amazon website ever again.  So before I publish this review, I decided to go to the office Image Skincare website and there they make a statement....Be wary of Image Skincare products sold online.  If the companies that I purchased my product from on Amazon would like to make a statement and prove that they have the authority to sell  genuine Image Skin Care products then I will be more than happy to change my review.</li>
    <li> Love this masque, worth every penny and I find Masques for the most part worthless.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Cleaned pores very well</li>
    <li> I totally love this scrub!  I have used it now for a few years and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I think this does a good job of cleansing / exfoliating while not tearing up my sensitive skin.  I have rosacea, so am very careful what I use.  I can use this a couple times a week with no issues.</li>
    <li> My skin feels squeaky clean after using the masque and my skin looks dewy. Really like how it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. I really like this masque and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> The one product I love from IMAGE! Must buy!!!!! Smooth clean fresh face. Only use once a week, or skin will dry out!</li>
    <li> Image skincare line is by far my favorite skincare line. I love this mask. It is light, but gritty enough to gently exfoliate my dead skin cells on my face.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it once a week to get a good deep cleanse.  I work out daily &amp; live in a dusty desert so I love the way my face feels after using this product</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
