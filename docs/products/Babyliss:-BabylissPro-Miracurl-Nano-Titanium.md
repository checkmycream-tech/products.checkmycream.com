      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Not so strong for the type of curls I like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use - it does all the rolling &amp; beeps when it&#x27;s time to release the hair, maybe 3-4 seconds per curl.</li>
      <li>super easy to use and super fast!</li>
      <li>The curls are super springy, adding depth &amp; texture.</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Overall though I love it!</li>

      <li>The shine spray keeps it looking fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not only done my own hair</li>
      <li>The first one I got lasted 3 months.  </li>
      <li>but the curls made by the Nano last for days; I can easily get 3 days between washing (most hair professionals don&#x27;t recommend daily hair washing) &amp; my hair</li>
      <li>, Miracurl came to help me and really did</li>
      <li>If if ever considered buying this product again I&#x27;d buy straight from the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, but my hair looks sooooo much nicer when I curl it with this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I think it got hot fast when i choose the third option, but i hope it&#x27;s normal.</li>
      <li>still looks great the 3rd day: first day, down &amp; curly; second day, up in a curly pony; third day in a messy, curly bun.</li>
      <li>Takes a long time to do my hair as I have too much.</li>
      <li>have straight and thick hair and believe me: i have too much hair.</li>

<li> I believer if you sell something you should you should stand behind it 100% and replace it for the consumer when it doesn&#x27;t work properly!!!!!!  </li>
<li> Works good for about 6 months not sure if I&#x27;ve had bad luck with these or if it&#x27;s just a bad product.  </li>
<li> I have thick, heavy hair</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my miracurl. Its perfect</li>
    <li> Works good for about 6 months not sure if I&#x27;ve had bad luck with these or if it&#x27;s just a bad product.  The first one I got lasted 3 months.  However, if I&#x27;m paying over $160 for this it should last longer!! I contacted the buyer &amp; they did nothing to satisfy the problem.  They said the manufacturer of this product has a one year warranty, but there wasn&#x27;t one in my box.  If if ever considered buying this product again I&#x27;d buy straight from the manufacturer.  I believer if you sell something you should you should stand behind it 100% and replace it for the consumer when it doesn&#x27;t work properly!!!!!!  This company DID not!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that really meets what it promise.&lt;br /&gt;I have straight and thick hair and believe me: i have too much hair. Plus, I have no idea how to use a babyliss.&lt;br /&gt;So, Miracurl came to help me and really did it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it got hot fast when i choose the third option, but i hope it&#x27;s normal. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of times now and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller! Product, price, delivery time and delivery! As announced. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not so strong for the type of curls I like. Takes a long time to do my hair as I have too much.</li>
    <li> Awesome I have a sleek hair it doesn&#x27;t hold any curls I had to do it at the hair dresser everytime now I do it at home and it holds for 2 days and if you leave it for a third day it would have nice waves</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good! I loved...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. But in the photo the seller put a picture with a machine (MiraCurl) and the product to pass in the hair for protecting against heat, but is a lie. I just recived the machine (miracurl) the product don&#x27;t coming.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. That&#x27;s the best one. Hair Safe.!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this curler!! I have naturally curly hair, but my hair looks sooooo much nicer when I curl it with this. super easy to use and super fast!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It lives up to all the hype. Fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Comes with a lot of Babyliss products! Highly recommended! If you know how to use it, it won&#x27;t tangle with your hair!</li>
    <li> BEST CURLING IRON EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously ladies (and men with hair like Fabio), this is WORTH THE $$$. It was recommended to me by three people so I said, ok I&#x27;ll try it. MY HAIR DOES NOT HOLD A CURL. I&#x27;ve tried the fat barrels, the skinny barrels....nothing. I bought this. I&#x27;ve had it for a week. I&#x27;ve not only done my own hair but my daughter&#x27;s (she&#x27;s five and the curl stays throughout her sweaty day), and my friends Christine, Kristine, Rachel, Danielle, Amy, and I have two more requests at work. If I could have a party, like a tupperware party, but for this curling iron, I would. I may quit my job and open a kiosk at the mall. It&#x27;s that good. In fact, I should probably get some sort of commission for referring all these people because they ALL loved it. ALL OF THEM. love love love love. Buy this. Just Do It.</li>
    <li> quick service, great price</li>
    <li> I love this hair curler. I have thick, heavy hair so it takes a while to get all the sections done &amp; I need help with the back but the curls made by the Nano last for days; I can easily get 3 days between washing (most hair professionals don&#x27;t recommend daily hair washing) &amp; my hair still looks great the 3rd day: first day, down &amp; curly; second day, up in a curly pony; third day in a messy, curly bun. The shine spray keeps it looking fresh. The curls are super springy, adding depth &amp; texture. It&#x27;s super easy to use - it does all the rolling &amp; beeps when it&#x27;s time to release the hair, maybe 3-4 seconds per curl. I&#x27;ve never gotten my hair stuck in it or burned my hair. The only downside is it does take a while for someone with a lot of hair. Overall though I love it!</li>
