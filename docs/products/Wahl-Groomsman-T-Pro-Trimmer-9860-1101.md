      <li>works really nice like</li>

      <li>Ok here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
      <li>The Wahl Company is keeping this ideal alive.  </li>
      <li>nose hair attachment is the most challenging to plug-in than any of the others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok....</li>
      <li>Would be better if it just sat in a cradle and charged instead of having to plug in each time.</li>
      <li>and I know for sure my nephew will love it too.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most don&#x27;t work that well or not at all</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping and decent item for its price</li>
    <li> It was awesome! My Dad loved it!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Good product. Very quiet and light, but still powerful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Simply not working, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Challenge to swap pieces. Quiet design. Does not trim beards as expected.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of tools for twenty five bucks. Unfortunately, most don&#x27;t work that well or not at all</li>
    <li> I was a bit reluctant to buy this Groomsman since it&#x27;s a cordless. When I first used it the blades  didn&#x27;t trim/cut well at all. Once I used the oil that was shipped with it and oiled the blades it works perfect and I really get a close trim, cordless is just as aggressive power as an electric shaver/trimmer, great product and I&#x27;m really happy with the accessories like the nose and ear trimmers which works great also, very happy with this product &#x3D;:) and got a great buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> husband uses it that&#x27;s amazing lol</li>
    <li> works really nice like it alot</li>
    <li> great price for a simple grooming kit. i use it every morning no problems smooth and does the job. love it!</li>
    <li> Real nice trimmer. Really like nose hair trimmer. Great product.</li>
    <li> Bought as Christman gift, so don&#x27;t really know yet, but it looks like a nice outfit. And I think if he uses it like the instructions tell him, it will be a very good grooming tool.</li>
    <li> Everything works great.  Its the perfect all in one grooming package.  However, charging is a little tricky.  Once its dead you can&#x27;t use while plugged up.  You have to let it fully recharge.</li>
    <li> What you would expect for the price. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year and it doesn&#x27;t have much juice even when it is plugged in</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and speed of cutting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel is the *rotary nose trimmer. It is without doubt the worst I have ever used. Almost useless. The rest of the tool works just fine, if rather noisily. Too much to deal with the ear puberty - I am thankful to still have my Norelco for that.&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I haven&#x27;t seen another as well built, reasonably priced and (possibly) not made in China.&lt;br /&gt;*I called them about this weak point (it turned out to just be a defective attachment), and they (eventually) mailed a replacement. They forgot to actually send one out to me until I reminded them, but I got a replacement that works from a second call to them.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a good hair trimmer machine in terms of design, battery runtime (I used it for a couple of times and I still didn&#x27;t have to charge it again) and optionals. The only (considerable) drawback is that it comes with only 3 attaching combs (3mm, 6mm and 10mm) and in my opinion there should be attaching combs of 14mm,16mm and even larger, as other hair trimmer machines.</li>
    <li> This is easily the wrist caliper I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s been charging (I&#x27;m assuming since there&#x27;s no led) for a week and its operation at full power is that of my old groomsman when it&#x27;s about to die. It pulls instead of cuts unless you achieve the perfect angle. Returning</li>
    <li> I went to brush the hairs out of the trimmer and for some reason it falls apart on the first day after using it. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper , still not tried it but it sound amazing</li>
    <li> The large blade is too big for my mustache, so I have to be careful not to make an &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; shape in the middle. The smaller blade is too small and sometimes results in an uneven cut.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. It has great battery life.</li>
    <li> no problems, cuts good..</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC SYSTEM for your money! Everything works like a professional! Decided to INVEST in one of these once most of my hair on top was pretty well finished. Got an arial view of my head one day and decided to simply clip it all the same length! Never looked back and love this system!!!! The charging feature is great too! And the attachments are ALL great!!!!</li>
    <li> Low power, bad battery</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a differant brand that had expired. I originally bought a &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; and when it broke I bought the differant brand and that was a mistake! The &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; Groomsman is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. When it wears out, I will buy another Wahl. The seller delivered the product very quickly and properly package. I recommend this product and seller. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I saw the battery dead review in some reviews. I am using this product for 18 months and still working perfect. I dropped it two times and second item it stop working. I could repair it with my soldering iron by connecting back a broken track on PCB. I like this product and so far no problem with it until I drop it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it! He&#x27;s been using it to groom himself for about three weeks now, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Better than the non-T pro models in that it doesn&#x27;t tug.  Better battery and seems better constructed than previous T Pros that I have owned.  BUT, doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as close at my old T Pros.  I  used to be able to use my T Pro as my primary shaver and get pretty darn close.  This one does ok, but not nearly as close and I have to carry a little pen-shaped close shaver to touch up.  That&#x27;s too bad.   Also  after about a year the performance really degraded. The battery won&#x27;t hold a charge and motor does not operate consistently. Again this has been frustrating because my past experience has been much better</li>
    <li> This thing maybe good for some people but I don&#x27;t like it for myself the trimming guards are too long and doesn&#x27;t trim my beard close enough like I want to</li>
    <li> Works great. Very precision. Good power</li>
    <li> Never fully charged, sent it back after 48 hours.</li>
    <li> This thing is cheap. There is no clear way to store the attachments. The tray is not like the amazon picture, nor is it like the picture on the actual product box, nor is it like the picture on the front of the user manual. The detailer doesn&#x27;t detail and shaver doesn&#x27;t shave. Save your money, this is a joke.</li>
    <li> Fast speedy service and delivery, clippers work great. They even shave closes than expected. Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> i bought this because good nose and ear trimmers are very rare because there made so cheap and inexpensive. spend the extra money on this and you wont be disappointed. one thing is its really loud but you get used to it. ive only used the beard trimmer part a couple times and its been good so far.  good product. stop being cheap and buy a good product.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment of quality product.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about 6 months and konked out. I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> I got this for trimming my beard and, embarrassingly, my nose hair.  If you have a thick beard, this is NOT for you; the longest trimming guide is only about 3/8&amp;#34; long, which is way short for me. My beard is thick, but doesn&#x27;t look right at that length.</li>
    <li> Quite working after a few uses. Battery is dead and won&#x27;t recharge. Would not recommend to anyone else to buy.</li>
    <li> Having recently bought this item, I am extremely disappointed in its functioning. It is ineffective for the purpose, does not charge properly, does not have an indicator light to show that it is charging or has fully charged. I think it is defective and will shortly write Amazon to indicate that I wish to return it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has all the attachments needed to clean, trim, shave. Perfect piece to do quick grooming or detailed grooming. Sturdy and dependable.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but switching the heads is quite a chore aggravated by my arthritis.  All in all. you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> Cool little system  . Works great</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting, but I didn&#x27;t look at what I was ordering close enough</li>
    <li> I Would not recommend this item to anyone!  Totally dissatisfied!!!!  I was very displeased with the quality of this product!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for our 16 yo foster son as his first grooming kit. He really likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Worst clippers out. And there made for black people? Lmao don&#x27;t buy👎</li>
    <li> I like this very well.. It REALLY holds a charge but.... one of the plastic clips broke on a guide and of course it was the size I used.  Be careful removing the guide from the clipper head..</li>
    <li> Got this product towards the end of expected delivery. Packaging is good. Opened everything and the picture of the stand on the booklet, that comes with the trimmer, isn&#x27;t the same as what&#x27;s in the box. If you are going to store it in the stand look at the picture that is displayed here on Amazon. First trim with no guard is actually closer than I expected. If you trim against how the hair grows it does pull/pinch. The brush that comes with is great for cleaning after trimming. Overall not bad. Still need to try everything</li>
    <li> I like it but the cord is a bit of a pain. Would be better if it just sat in a cradle and charged instead of having to plug in each time. Other than that works great.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product and will be returning it. The main blade attachment does not seem to be that sharp and constantly pull on my facial hair instead of cutting it.</li>
    <li> Hands down the worst purchase ive ever made on Amazon. The product was defective out of the box. The trimmer would not charge and the actual trimmer had an overall cheap feel. I was surprised that the item had as high of an amazon rating as it did.</li>
    <li> This tool wasn&#x27;t for me. It trimmed the hair but it was very to keep it looking like I shaved.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He is Hispanic with a rather thick, coarse beard and it cuts through it like nothing else!!!! Its also perfect size for travel and holds a good charge! Its an all around great groomer!</li>
    <li> This product is a very high quality product...  Can be used for close shaving and edging...  Two thumbs up! I highly recommend...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older unit. Initially it did as well as can be expected but in about 5 months it started literally falling apart. Definitely do not recommend wasting the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.  He does continue to get his hair cut at a baber shop because he is not a pro yet but he is able to do maintenance in between visits.  This saves us a little money here and there.  He can give himself a lining and trim his beard as needed on his own.  He stated that it was easy to use and the attachements given to clean the equipment were very useful.  He said that it had a lot of power and he was very glad that I had purchased it for him.  Interestingly enough, the last time he got his hair cut, his barber mentioned that he wanted a Wahl and my husband proudly told him that his wife had just bought him one for Christmas and the barber told him that Wahl&#x27;s were good and last long.</li>
    <li> It has a larger head and is great and faster</li>
    <li> Product had high reviews so I purchased for a Christmas gift for my husband. It worked well for 4 months but then started to pull the hair rather than trim.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be dosent cut as close as they clain also the gold flakes off on your skin poorly made would not recommend at all. Wish i would have paid a lil more money for a better shaver grrrr.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!!!! Cuts like a charm and keeps the beard tite</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer, does almost any standard grooming job with ease. Has just enough attachments and requires very little room for storage. Maintenance is a piece of cake. For the money, it would be hard to find a better product.</li>
    <li> Bought this is a gift for my nephew. School just started and his mom is trying to save some money by just doing his hair instead of going to the barber shop. My husband uses Wahl brand forever and I know for sure my nephew will love it too. We love to purchase the same in the future</li>
    <li> awesome piece quality precision all that I needed well made great piece for grooming</li>
    <li> I own several Wahl products and generally think it&#x27;s a great company. That being said I was let down by this product the T Blade is very disappointing it barely cuts any hair even after going over the area multiple times. I&#x27;ve oiled them, tried to give them time to break in and they just won&#x27;t cut. The accessories work fine but I bought the grooming kit to shape up my goatee without having to use my full size Wahl Balding Clippers (Which are the best Clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned). Thoroughly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> too noisy and require many run thru to get clear shave</li>
    <li> A+ this item shipped FAST, works great and has a long battery life. This product is GREAT, every guy should have this!</li>
    <li> Great little groomer for all body parts...not just face.</li>
    <li> Great T-Blade trimmer that gets a close cut for a bald head trimming.  Very light weight and portable for travel.  Battery is somewhat underpowered and cycles fast/slow speed.  The shaver is useless for daily shaving, and perhaps only for touchup of around a grown beard.  The battery is a NiCad, not newer Lithium Ion, so it will keep a &#x27;memory&#x27; unless it is drained all the way down.  Overall okay, but could be better with a more powerful battery.</li>
    <li> Rubbish stuff, never buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is dead after a month and half, I only used it about two times a week. It could not charge anymore. The whole day charging only last 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> Hey these. Gm t-pro are very Good for shaven. men who suffer from ingrown. Hair I thank these. Are the answer to that problem the t bladed cut smooth without leaving bump I thank usesing the mesh head after you shave with the t bladed make.  IT VERY SMOOTH AN PLUS IT AN ALL AROUND GROOMER I try all type of razor. Electric. Shaver none is more effective than the t pro so good jop wahl</li>
    <li> Nice product , blade  needs adjustment or will leave stubble.</li>
    <li> The main shaver head works fine. The \\&quot;dual smooth shaver\\&quot; as well as the precision detailer and ear/nose shaver is useless. I could&#x27;ve shaved my face with a disposable razor 10 times before this wahl shaver finished. On a side note, the tool tray has been updated and the instructions are useless. I had to figure out where the tools are placed by process of elimination. I still never found a spot for the ear/nose trimmer. Weird.</li>
    <li> Cuts the way I like the battery gives a good charge.</li>
    <li> underpowered. pulls hair instead of cuts.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted. Looked everywhere for a good trimmer that does everything. this does everything without breaking the bank for cheap brands</li>
    <li> this product lives up to the description. This was to be a christmas present and  I received it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Pro: almost everything&lt;br /&gt;Con: wish wqll cord attached to base instead of bottom of shaver</li>
    <li> Got it earlier this week - trimming overgrown beard was not a problem. Trimming blade is very good quality - I used Wahl electric hair trimmer for about decade and it was great till the cord got dangerously worn. Glad to see the same quality product. Other attachments worked great too. Only draw back so far - the widest blade guard is for quite short trim - about 1/4&amp;#34;; I prefer about 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This cannot cut hard hairs so don&#x27;t buy if you have thick hair hard to cut.</li>
    <li> Wahl&#x27;s instructions for trimming ear, nose, and brow hair are missing from the general instructions for using the product to cut hair. I emailed Wahl for clarity and have not as yet gotten a response from them</li>
    <li> Great service.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers work great!</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful choice. This equipment is very light making a accurate cutting and easy to use. I&#x27;m very satisfied and I recommend.</li>
    <li> Sending back! Very little power even after full charge. After 2 uses the blades are starting to rust</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  The nostril trimmer isn&#x27;t as effective as the old Norelco this thing replaced.  I&#x27;m less than impressed with a battery life as well.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, both are well within the limits of acceptable, just not as good as I had hoped.  The Clipper blade and guards work well.  Just be sure you remember to oil them.  This thing seems quite fussy about getting enough oil.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price</li>
    <li> It is a very good machine to cut hair and barva, is powerful and the price is related to one of the best, the product arrived in a timely manner</li>
    <li> This machine is a piece of s***. I bout it few weeks ago and now its dead. I tried to charge it several times but still not working.</li>
    <li> works great just charge before using</li>
    <li> IT WAS BOUGHT AS A GIFT.  THE PERSON  THAT RECEIVED IT HAD USED SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;S BEFORE AND LIKED IT SO MUCH, THEY WANTED ONE. I WAS TOLD &amp;#34;IT IS GREAT FOR LINE UPS&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very bad experience with this product. It was fine at first and was very happy with it. About the fourth time of use, it stopped working! It stopped turning when I placed the shaving head. I thought it was not charging enough but even when I charged it for more than an hour it would rotate for a few seconds then stop. Eventhough its not expensive I thought at least I would get months of use out of this product. Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have only used this item twice since receiving it. Non-slip grip is easy to handle, however hair clippings stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the additional attachments yet, so i cannot rate how well the unit works with them. Changing between them is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the perfect gift for my husband.  My main reason for the purchase was to help my husband battle the nose hairs.  I&#x27;m not sure if the other items work for him.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I really expected but it&#x27;s good. I was really for a  trimmer but it didn&#x27;t really do the job I was expecting for it to do kind of disappointed about that. But I paid lots of money for it I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Gets into tight places very tenderly.  An early Christmas present to myself.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR MY NEEDS.</li>
    <li> Small high quality trimmer, can&#x27;t beat it for the price A+++</li>
    <li> My husband loved his All in One Groomsman.  Even though he didn&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;ethnicity&amp;#34; aspect, it works well for his needs.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. Doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
    <li> Made in America used to be the standard for quality products.  The Wahl Company is keeping this ideal alive.  I have bought several of their trimmers and I have been very satisfied with each one.  Product was shipped and received on time and in great working condition.</li>
    <li> I was traveling for business and needed a trimmer. I bought this one and it worked well for a week after that it needed help to continue to trim. It was pulling my hair and not cutting anything the motor was still spinning and the blade was moving but no cutting.  If you buy good luck. I can understand after a few years or even months but this is not how you want a new product to behave.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 34 year old son. He loves the way it trims his beard, mustache and side burns without tugging.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who was hunt for the &amp;#34;black man&#x27;s shaver&amp;#34; or something to that effect after the one he had for year&#x27;s died on him. Product was delivered before Christmas in spite of the crazy holiday shipping season. And, my guy loves his new razor. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This thing is great for getting an excellent shave on all those nooks and crannys on your.... face, yeah face we&#x27;ll go with face.  Great construction and built to last.  My girlfriend really appreciated my really smooth... face.</li>
    <li> Leaves red marks, hurts (scratches) unless you oil it before every use. Very abrasive. I have another electric with smaller blades that doesn&#x27;t do this, but shaves the same. I have only needed to oil that one every couple months or so.</li>
    <li> Ok here&#x27;s the deal. I&#x27;ve been using this model type with the T-shaped blades for almost two and a half years. These clippers have been performing flawlessly. I sometimes go THREE days without a charge (accidentally forgetting to place on charger) with continued use and they still perform great. The only thing that happened is, when I first purchased the clippers and received them one of the blades spring mechanisms broke after about a week of use, but Wahl sent a replacement out right away. So you can&#x27;t beat that. I am happy with this product and would recommend to others. What you are finding in many of the reviews is that SOME of the folks on here don&#x27;t know how to properly give maintenance to the clippers. Like give clean them after each use (that&#x27;s what the brush is for. I use an old tooth brush that&#x27;s been sanitized with bleach, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to dry. Then I use that as my bush as it is sturdier and cleans more effectively) and a little oil.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves it! He has insanely thick hair, and this rubs through it like nothing.</li>
    <li> Charge lasts quite a while. Does not shave as close as my Remington did but it works great other than that  edit: After a few month it starts to seriously slow down even on a full charge. Stars lowered accordingly</li>
    <li> I like my old one better but after 10 years the battery charger crapped out. The base stand is the pits, just a little bump and everything falls out of place. For the price it works fine though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband because he has a problem with razor bumps. It has helped some, but not totally eliminated that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Also i use it for myself too- so both ladies and men can get use out of it! Each of the heads have a different purpose. One for longer hairs and once those long hairs are cut, then use the one for the stubble to get a smooth look. No problems thus far</li>
    <li> Seriously, why is this called &amp;#34;ethnic?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m as white as the driven snow and it works just fine for me. In addition, it&#x27;s virtually identical to other Wahl all-in-one grooming kits and, with that said, it works great. Holds a charge for a long time as well. I like the ease of interchangeability with the blades.</li>
    <li> Get this product . It&#x27;s well built .</li>
    <li> First, I searched a brand I know, and Wahl makes a professional animal sheers I&#x27;ve used previously, and it was excellent quality. I searched diligently to find the best personal groomer in quality, cost and estimated longevity. I find these aspects important to justify a products particular purchase. I purchase nothing without regard to cost verses benefit, longevity, and its return if not satisfied, which to me, go hand in hand. Regardless of product or associated cost, I never fail to research a product for best quality, and others who have personally found that item a good overall purchase because of value in practical everyday use. This personal groomer is an excellent value, big on quality, sturdy, and it&#x27;s interchangeable heads remind me of my father&#x27;s professional barbers&#x27; sheers, that would cost exceedingly more than this groomer did, especially now. This one actually incorporates (think sturdy plastic) guides on each interchangeable head that&#x27;s used to stabilize them where they attach into the base. My father used his shears to cut mine and my bothers hair for years (10+ years) when we were children, and this one has that solid feel to it. Although much lighter, because it is much smaller than the huge clipper my father used on us. This will probably last for years, my previous groomer wasn&#x27;t as near as rugged as this one, and did not have a rubberized sheath like this one does, (very nice feature) it makes for a study grip and keeps it from falling out of my hands, when turning tight angles. It does everything I need it to do, and I have a beard I trim to keep short, and it does without pulling my hair out, that feature is worth the money I paid for these, but these have everything I consider important in a personal groomer, and does not buzz excessively, as I read some do, it sounds like a solid hand held groomer should. I appreciate Wahl manufacturing the; 9860-1101 Groomsman T-Pro Trimmer with the quality, features and solid feel to this product. On thescale of 1 to 10, 1 being the worst, and 10 being the best, I find this product to be a solid 8.9. I am particularly harsh on most products because I do not believe in saying flowery things because I am writing a testimonial, but truth to me is of the highest importance, regardless of what I am commenting on. I haven&#x27;t dropped these, yet, but I would estimate that if I did, I would not be surprised to find it would not break, unless possibly dropped directly sideways on the head piece at the time of drop, and from higher than four feet, and I would not be surprised if it was only superficial, and effected it cosmetically, verses mechanical operation. I like this groomer, it cuts the job down to size with relative ease! If ever this one dies, I would buy another similar groomer, from Wahl. I&#x27;ve had this groomer for approximately 2+ months and I use it on an average of 3-4 times a week, and this is because I have difficulty with mobility, but nothing that has to do with shaving, trimming my beard, mustache, etc. Wahl has been around for years, too, and that&#x27;s something to consider in getting a product serviced, if it&#x27;s ever necessary. I am confident this groomer will last for years, and keep its charge, and continue to give me good trouble-free service. This product was not expensive, (under 20 bucks, bought through Amazon; April 2015) but to me that&#x27;s not the only issue when rating a product, regardless of the cost, if that product is poorly made, it ceases to be a good purchase, because value is rated in cost verses benefit of any product, as in; ease of use, service and perceived value must be factored in to the analysis. Wahl historically makes good, quality products, and this one is no exception. Date of purchase: 04/2015 Date of comment: 06/2015.</li>
    <li> It has stopped working and will not charge anymore, not sure if its a connection issue inside or what wrong but it no longer works.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! More sturdy and performs better than most of the common name brands you find in stores.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair trimmer.  The nose hair attachment does not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. Only con&#x27;s I see is the battery and the grip of the shaver considering its made of rubber and collects hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. My husband is in the Air Force and uses his razor A LOT. Other razors last a few months and eventually get beat up. He has had this for over 6 months and it is still going strong. It looks great too. He leaves it sitting in the charge base in our bathroom. I don&#x27;t feel the need to hide it in the closet like other razors he has had. Definitely recommended for those clean-cut guys in your life!</li>
    <li> Lots of great working accessories!  High recommend for the money.</li>
    <li> Stellar product, great price</li>
    <li> So far the trimmer and the trim heads work great. The shaver head, not so great, but works. The stand is what I can&#x27;t figure out, only the power unit and the regular trimmer head actually fits in it. None of the other slots seem to fit anything that came with it except for the guides.</li>
    <li> Its great. Good qualty.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> What can I say about this? Wahl and a couple others pretty much dominate this market. That doesn&#x27;t mean they make great products. I would say the quality is just so-so. What is key to note about this particular setup is that all the attachments snap in and snap out of the battery-motor unit. Of course they do; obviously. Well, that may appear obvious and consequently easy but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they snap in and out easily. You have to take time, learn and be very patient about learning the quirks of this unit. You have to develop you&#x27;re own technique for coping with how they install. They are not what I&#x27;d call, &amp;#34;plug and play.&amp;#34;The nose hair attachment is the most challenging to plug-in than any of the others. Don&#x27;t like it. In addition, the organizing tray, does not really fit all of this stuff. Even repeatedly looking at the packing picture (doesn&#x27;t match the unit I received), noodling it yourself and you cannot get it all in the tray. The tray slips all over the place and the things fall over over the place. Seems silly but you don&#x27;t want this as a mess on your sink area (the &#x27;boss&amp;#34; won&#x27;t tolerate it-LoL). Next, in my opinion, this package is missing a middle ground in the trimmers. You receive a small one and a wide one. For a variety of situations, you need a middle size trimmer. You just do. Finally, the cutting power is sort of general, not precise. What I mean by this is that when you put the thinning guards on the trimmer and bear down on it, you&#x27;ll trim hair. But when you try to edge the trimmer to get a precise line, you just don&#x27;t quite get it (and this is typical behavior for the trimmers without the thinning guards also). It doesn&#x27;t cut at the tip as well as it trims in its center. You still need to use a conventional shaver to get a clean cut right up to your bead line. With effort, you can still get a pretty decent look using all this but it isn&#x27;t going to be perfect, just good. Last thing, all these trimmer rely on you keepingthem clean, oiled and charged. For some reason, this unit does not deliver with a charging light so you don&#x27;t actually know if you&#x27;re plugged in and charging to 100% or not. Minor, but it&#x27;s there. Another small thing is that I&#x27;ve found that trimmers with a &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; finish are actually harder to aim as they reflect light and can bug you a bit when you&#x27;re trying to aim. I&#x27;d prefer a flat color instead of the chrome the next time around.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST little portable shaved on the market.  It even sounds strong.  It just cuts through some of the four day beard blues in a whiz.  The only draw back as I see is the thin plastic on the attachments.  They can break easily off.  But if your just looking for a powerful, well made shaver, skip the attachments and just use the shaver.  I do recommend this Wahl trimmer T-Pro #9860 very highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Wahl trimmers, usually replacing them every two years. While the blades on this model are sharp and cut hair fairly easily and reliably, the motor is far weaker than other models. In fact I have had the trimmer stall cutting through 1/8 inch whiskers--and I do NOT have a thick beard.</li>
    <li> It does not rechage. I called Wahl and they set me another charger, and it still does not recharge. JUNK</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t shave very well (even though it was very smooth) and it didn&#x27;t come with the beard trimming guides for keeping a low beard.</li>
    <li> The trim clips dont exactly get the trim you want. When i went to the barber shop they could trim alot more with the same size. And if you use a smaller clip it trims way to much. The nose attachment was nice, i needed one of those...But the biggest flaw is the battery charge. There is no indicator for when its charged, you just have to guess.</li>
    <li> Trims like s***,  Cuts fine  It&#x27;s ok....</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
    <li> Good performance,  holds charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer</li>
    <li> Thank you and nice of this.</li>
    <li> Cheap, even for a $30 set.  Blades are not stainless as the rust almost immediately after cleaning.</li>
    <li> product as described, works fine just out of the box. no issues so far</li>
</ol>
