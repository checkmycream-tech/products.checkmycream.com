<ol>
      <li>and when it did both dad and I were very impressed.</li>
      <li>Great!  </li>
      <li>I have received the walking stick, and it is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>This was the perfect one at a great price.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful and sturdy piece.</li>
      <li>It has a rightfully proud place now in the family.</li>
      <li>I would have been happy if it was two or three inches longer.  </li>
      <li>I got just what I was looking for,very well made,very sturdy,looks great.</li>
      <li>The quality is great, beautiful finish, and very strong.  </li>
      <li>I must say I am ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED with the service from this seller.</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and well-made, and it looks good when walking with it.  </li>
      <li>I have a good feeling that I will be buying more of their blackthorn walking sticks for gifts, and am confidant that they will produce quality products!</li>
      <li>What really impressed me more than anything is that Jeff from Choice gifts contacted me via email to track the progress of the shipping and when I explained who and what I had bought the stick for he cancelled the initial order and hand picked a stick out that would best suit my father.</li>
      <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better walking stick!</li>
      <li>Now I wish that I liked the stick better!  </li>
      <li>What I got from my purchase looks like some kind of knock-off that was mass-produced somewhere in Asia.  </li>
      <li>He had been to Ireland with my grandmother when they were younger, they both talked about the great people and the beautiful culture.  </li>
      <li>The walking stick is lovely - I&#x27;m hoping the recipient of this gift will enjoy it!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I suppose I&#x27;m going to have to order a couple more to give as gifts . . .</li>
      <li>/&gt;Customer service is apparently top priority with these folks.  </li>
      <li>I also received an email from the owner as soon as it arrived to make sure the walking stick was acceptable.  </li>
      <li>He has continued to keep in touch with me about the stick and has said that if there are ever any issues he will make sure they are taken care of.</li>
      <li>My son needs to use a cane to walk sometimes and we think the blackthorn stick speaks to our heritage and looks stylish in the process.</li>
      <li>It gives wonderful support, but you will need to purchase a rubber cane tip cap from your local drug store, as the metal cap that comes on the cane can slide on some surfaces.</li>
      <li>Outstanding service from the vendor</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t walk with a stick with a pointed top.</li>
      <li>Overall very happy!</li>
      <li>I had heard years ago about how the best walking sticks or canes were made of Irish Blackthorn.</li>
      <li>It brought more happiness to my grandfather than I could have ever imagined and gave the whole family a night of memories we will never forget.</li>
      <li>rustic, strong, and functional for walking.  </li>
      <li>I have been wanting a Blackthorn cane from Ireland for some time and this is a fine cane for the price.</li>
      <li>Shipped and delivered smoothly.</li>
      <li>Though the first was absolutely beautiful, it was lighter than I had in mind, and the owner of the company contacted me and told me that he would personally search his stock to try to find something more like I wanted.  </li>
      <li>This beautiful piece of wood is not only an asset to stabilize walking but also is, as stated, a true  heirloom.</li>
      <li>The original review was 3 stars because the delay in receiving the item.  </li>
      <li>My grandmother passed away a couple of months ago, and I wanted something that was truly special.  </li>
      <li>Overall the stick was of good quality but not as shown in the ad.</li>
      <li>This will become one of my favorites, currently my favorite is my &amp;#34;Cold Steel City Stick&amp;#34;, but sometimes you are not in an area you can carry a solid metal rod, nor is a black/chrome stick appropriate for all occasions.  </li>
      <li>To be fair the seller was very cooperative in taking it back -- although it did cost a bit to return it.  </li>
      <li>I can see this stick lasting for many years of daily use and looking better with age and wear.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The metal tip is only a band protecting the wood tip, which I was pleased to see.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>B002PG39P0 Genuine Irish Smooth Blackthorn Walking Stick]], he responded back and answered all my questions very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice walking stick, and I decided to keep it just to add to my other walking sticks, but it was not what I was looking for, for my regular use.</li>
      <li>It came quickly, but I&#x27;m surprised that the package contained the stick since it was all opened....</li>
      <li>Had a little damage to it but was able to fix it quickly.</li>
      <li>It is still very servicable, and I&#x27;ll keep using it around the property, but I wanted a new, better looking one of similar design for my trips into town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;nt recommend it if you really need it for support while walking.</li>
      <li>I also expected the top to end in a root knob</li>
      <li>The damage was all cosmetic, with much of the bark being lost.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect that.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have been contacted directly from a seller when purchasing off amazon and really gotten the impression that they really care about the customers satisfaction!</li>
      <li>I finally got around to ordering one, and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It was 35&amp;#34; long which I needed being 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;, and although it is very light in weight and thin in diameter I have not been able to flex the stick much at all.  </li>
      <li>It is not a metal cap that would cause some slipping on smooth surfaces.  </li>
      <li>After a whole comedy of errors including customs holding up the order, and the USPS mis-delivering my stick I finally received my stick which was exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I opened the shipping carton and it smelled as if the stick had just been freshly painted, I&#x27;m letting it sit in an open area to air out.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t just talk a good game, they honor their word.</li>
      <li>The hand knob is not large at all, but comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>However, once this was made know to Customer Service of Choice Gifts the order was rectified with the half hour to more than my my complete satisfaction.  </li>
      <li>great mix of science, history, and fiction for a non stop thriller that can be hard to put t down.</li>
      <li>and I plan on purchasing at least one more as a gift.</li>
      <li>He immediately refused because he insisted it would make him look like a crippled old man, and if he were to have to use one he wanted one with some class and style.</li>
      <li>it is very good quality and stout my only concern is the fish cap on the end seems a little weak but time will tell.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be making this seller one of the first places I look when I am in search of an Irish gift.</li>
      <li>I felt I could have gone out to an mature rose bush in my garden, lopped off a old thick cane, painted it black and had the same thing.  </li>
      <li>Not quite as thick as I expected, but very strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I just received the second blackthorn stick and it is EXACTLY what I was looking for; just as I had described it to the seller and a near dead ringer for the one damaged when it was run over by my tractor.</li>
      <li>I know Irish men are not usually extremely tall</li>

<li> ; long.  </li>
<li> I did notice that there was a small chip missing from the very bottom of the stick and when I mentioned it to the seller he offered to send me another stick in exchange, but since I planned on using the stick for walking as well as fighting classes the chip was not a big deal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some not so subtle hints from friends who \\&quot;could really use a stout walking stick like that.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> I expected a substantial walking stick, what I got was a toothpick.</li>
<li> and it took longer than expected, but it did get here</li>
<li> I was expecting it to have a round, knob-type handle, similar to the one shown in the photo, but the one received has a curved root handle.</li>
<li> Due to the ineptitude of the Post Office, the order was never delivered.  </li>
<li> Before I ordered I contacted the seller asking about the differences between this and the other stick he offered [[ASIN:</li>
<li> In short, it&#x27;s a stick that someone painted &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; and varnished excessively.  </li>
<li> I was shocked I received my item so quickly!  </li>
<li> There should also be a rubber tip-for a little protection against slipping.</li>
<li> I am updating my previous review.  </li>
<li> so I searched long and hard for</li>
<li> tip is barely attached and the shaft is thin.</li>
<li> a waste of time.  </li>
<li> The shaft is not smooth, still has the knobs on it, which is what I would expect.</li>
<li> Meant to be a gift, nothing but embarrassment, sad to be fooled this way, untrustworthy description, cheap metal tip is just plain silly.</li>
<li> It will scratch anything it touches and afford no safe contact/grip.</li>
<li> If I had a complaint it would be the smell.  </li>
<li> but this one ends as thick as the shaft.</li>
<li> they are incredable tough.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t go wrong doing business with them.</li>
<li> SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.</li>
<li> the handle end is very thin and unlike what is pictured.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> present for my boyfriend</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Too short and the handle end is very thin and unlike what is pictured.</li>
    <li> The item I received looks nothing like the picture you see here.  What I got from my purchase looks like some kind of knock-off that was mass-produced somewhere in Asia.  In short, it&#x27;s a stick that someone painted &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; and varnished excessively.  In short, no big thrill here boys and girls.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Thinking about getting 1 for my dad. You may want to think about adding a rubber tip. I would recommend this walking stick.</li>
    <li> great mix of science, history, and fiction for a non stop thriller that can be hard to put t down.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted...rustic, strong, and functional for walking.  Met all of my expectations for a solid walking stick.</li>
    <li> My son wanted one so I searched long and hard for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time.  This was the perfect one at a great price.</li>
    <li> I would have been happy if it was two or three inches longer.  Years ago I had one that served well. This one only sees use as a plaything for my grandsons.</li>
    <li> The walking stick is lovely - I&#x27;m hoping the recipient of this gift will enjoy it!  It came quickly, but I&#x27;m surprised that the package contained the stick since it was all opened.... Irish luck, I guess...</li>
    <li> I know Irish men are not usually extremely tall but, the walking stick should be about three inches longer to accomodate someone about 6 feet to 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;.  There should also be a rubber tip-for a little protection against slipping.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend and she uses it every day.  She hopes to take it with her to Ireland.</li>
    <li> Had a little damage to it but was able to fix it quickly.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased two of these sticks.  Though the first was absolutely beautiful, it was lighter than I had in mind, and the owner of the company contacted me and told me that he would personally search his stock to try to find something more like I wanted.  The second stick is a BRUTE of a stick-- exactly what I wanted.  I absolutely love it.  The only problem I&#x27;m having now is keeping possession of it.  I&#x27;ve had some not so subtle hints from friends who \\&quot;could really use a stout walking stick like that.\\&quot;  I suppose I&#x27;m going to have to order a couple more to give as gifts . . . there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m parting with mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is apparently top priority with these folks.  You won&#x27;t go wrong doing business with them.</li>
    <li> I got just what I was looking for,very well made,very sturdy,looks great.</li>
    <li> This beautiful piece of wood is not only an asset to stabilize walking but also is, as stated, a true  heirloom. It has a rightfully proud place now in the family. Shipped and delivered smoothly.</li>
    <li> I will be returning this. Can&#x27;t walk with a stick with a pointed top. look&#x27;s cheap and fake.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered I contacted the seller asking about the differences between this and the other stick he offered [[ASIN:B002PG39P0 Genuine Irish Smooth Blackthorn Walking Stick]], he responded back and answered all my questions very quickly. I let him know what I wanted the stick for and he said he was expecting another batch in from Ireland in a couple of weeks and he would pick one out that he thought would work for me. After a whole comedy of errors including customs holding up the order, and the USPS mis-delivering my stick I finally received my stick which was exactly what I was looking for and I plan on purchasing at least one more as a gift. I did notice that there was a small chip missing from the very bottom of the stick and when I mentioned it to the seller he offered to send me another stick in exchange, but since I planned on using the stick for walking as well as fighting classes the chip was not a big deal. I will definitely be making this seller one of the first places I look when I am in search of an Irish gift.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted and returned it.  Stick was just not what I pictured a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Irish walking stick to be.  I felt I could have gone out to an mature rose bush in my garden, lopped off a old thick cane, painted it black and had the same thing.  To be fair the seller was very cooperative in taking it back -- although it did cost a bit to return it.  Update:  The seller called and is crediting me the return mailing cost!  Great!  I really didn&#x27;t expect that.  Now I wish that I liked the stick better!  Outstanding service from the vendor and I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> The walking stick is truly of heirloom quality.  It is sturdy and well-made, and it looks good when walking with it.  I am sure it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am updating my previous review.  I have received the walking stick, and it is absolutely wonderful.  The quality is great, beautiful finish, and very strong.  The walking stick was purchased as a gift for my grandfather’s 90th birthday.  He had been to Ireland with my grandmother when they were younger, they both talked about the great people and the beautiful culture.  My grandmother passed away a couple of months ago, and I wanted something that was truly special.  This walking stick brought tears to his eyes and kept us entertained all night with stories.  The original review was 3 stars because the delay in receiving the item.  It did take almost six weeks to get.  However, the owner emailed every couple of days with an update, and once the sticks arrived from Ireland, he expedited the shipping for no extra cost.  I also received an email from the owner as soon as it arrived to make sure the walking stick was acceptable.  I would definitely recommend this seller and this walking stick to anyone.  It brought more happiness to my grandfather than I could have ever imagined and gave the whole family a night of memories we will never forget.</li>
    <li> I ordered this walking stick for my father who was recently told by doctors that he needed to use a cane or walking stick. He immediately refused because he insisted it would make him look like a crippled old man, and if he were to have to use one he wanted one with some class and style. Seeing that my family heritage is almost 100% Irish this was the only choice in my mind. There were some mix ups initially with the stick getting here and it took longer than expected, but it did get here and when it did both dad and I were very impressed. What really impressed me more than anything is that Jeff from Choice gifts contacted me via email to track the progress of the shipping and when I explained who and what I had bought the stick for he cancelled the initial order and hand picked a stick out that would best suit my father. He has continued to keep in touch with me about the stick and has said that if there are ever any issues he will make sure they are taken care of. This is the first time I have been contacted directly from a seller when purchasing off amazon and really gotten the impression that they really care about the customers satisfaction! I would and will continue to buy from choice gifts in the future. I have a good feeling that I will be buying more of their blackthorn walking sticks for gifts, and am confidant that they will produce quality products! You may have to be patient, but in the long run you will get a quality stick from a company that actually cares!</li>
    <li> I expected a substantial walking stick, what I got was a toothpick. The brass(?) tip is barely attached and the shaft is thin. I also expected the top to end in a root knob but this one ends as thick as the shaft. I would&#x27;nt recommend it if you really need it for support while walking.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My aging Dad with balance issues refuses to use a cane, but he takes this shillelagh with him everywhere. It is a beautiful and sturdy piece.</li>
    <li> Stick is as advertised.  Very solid, and about 32&amp;#34; long.  The shaft is not smooth, still has the knobs on it, which is what I would expect.</li>
    <li> I ordered an Heirloom Quality Irish Blackthorn Walking Stick from Choice Gifts.  Due to the ineptitude of the Post Office, the order was never delivered.  However, once this was made know to Customer Service of Choice Gifts the order was rectified with the half hour to more than my my complete satisfaction.  I would give them 5 stars and would definitely order from them again.  Their customer satisfaction is of prime importance to them as I learned today.  They don&#x27;t just talk a good game, they honor their word.</li>
    <li> After some problems with delivery which the seller addressed immediately I received the stick it is very good quality and stout my only concern is the fish cap on the end seems a little weak but time will tell. Overall very happy!</li>
    <li> Ordered this Walking Stick to replace the one I had brfore. I was disappointed in the handle of the cane. I guess that I thought they all had handles  that were about the same size as a baseball. Now I realize that they are not the same. Just another disappointment in life to deal with.</li>
    <li> I asked for the walking stick to be as shown with the ball root. It was not. Overall the stick was of good quality but not as shown in the ad.</li>
    <li> Meant to be a gift, nothing but embarrassment, sad to be fooled this way, untrustworthy description, cheap metal tip is just plain silly. It will scratch anything it touches and afford no safe contact/grip.</li>
    <li> it has been over a 6weeks and I still not have it. the computer said that had 5 in stock and it was on its way. then I got an email saying that they had to order it. if they have 5 in stock why did they have to order it. then they said that had a problem with custom not once but twice. now the coumper says that they have 5 in stock an I have not  gotten a email saying it is on the way. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.</li>
    <li> My son needs to use a cane to walk sometimes and we think the blackthorn stick speaks to our heritage and looks stylish in the process.</li>
    <li> I was shocked I received my item so quickly!  It was 35&amp;#34; long which I needed being 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;, and although it is very light in weight and thin in diameter I have not been able to flex the stick much at all.  Only one knotty area in the lower portion which may in time add some character to the stick.  If I had a complaint it would be the smell.  I opened the shipping carton and it smelled as if the stick had just been freshly painted, I&#x27;m letting it sit in an open area to air out.  The hand knob is not large at all, but comfortable.  The metal tip is only a band protecting the wood tip, which I was pleased to see.  It is not a metal cap that would cause some slipping on smooth surfaces.  This will become one of my favorites, currently my favorite is my &amp;#34;Cold Steel City Stick&amp;#34;, but sometimes you are not in an area you can carry a solid metal rod, nor is a black/chrome stick appropriate for all occasions.  I can see this stick lasting for many years of daily use and looking better with age and wear.</li>
    <li> I had heard years ago about how the best walking sticks or canes were made of Irish Blackthorn. I finally got around to ordering one, and I was not disappointed. Not quite as thick as I expected, but very strong. It gives wonderful support, but you will need to purchase a rubber cane tip cap from your local drug store, as the metal cap that comes on the cane can slide on some surfaces. You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better walking stick!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a Blackthorn cane from Ireland for some time and this is a fine cane for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this blackthorn walking stick as a replacement for one that was damaged. I was expecting it to have a round, knob-type handle, similar to the one shown in the photo, but the one received has a curved root handle. It&#x27;s a very nice walking stick, and I decided to keep it just to add to my other walking sticks, but it was not what I was looking for, for my regular use. After my initial review the seller contacted me and is finding a blackthorn stick of the style I was looking for, but I&#x27;m still keeping the one I initially received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a quality blackthorn walking stick they are incredable tough. The one I&#x27;m replacing fell of the tractor and was run over by the rear tire. The damage was all cosmetic, with much of the bark being lost. It is still very servicable, and I&#x27;ll keep using it around the property, but I wanted a new, better looking one of similar design for my trips into town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just received the second blackthorn stick and it is EXACTLY what I was looking for; just as I had described it to the seller and a near dead ringer for the one damaged when it was run over by my tractor. I must say I am ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED with the service from this seller.</li>
