      <li>Works great with my plastic frames!</li>
      <li>These were the perfect fix.</li>
      <li>My glasses are a bit oversized that they slip off the nose so these are perfect rather than always going to my optometrist to get it sized.</li>

      <li>Surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>The stick realy good.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable and work great!</li>
      <li>Best of both worlds right there.</li>
      <li>how well they work, but the instructions are hilarious: &amp;#34;anti-slip nose pad of glasses&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;loose slide to prevent glasses&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;comfortable, healthy, beautiful, generous&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;the site of increase&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;the site of enhance&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;cleanthe oil of pasted parts before use&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Nice thickness - These are 2.5mm in thickness, giving my glasses the rise I needed.  </li>
      <li>They are alright, but kind of make my nose itch</li>
      <li>Nice design -</li>
      <li>Pads work but needs better adhesive.</li>
      <li>These may be inexpensive, but for me I need something more durable.</li>
      <li>I had one pair on my eyeglass for more then a month</li>
      <li>These just came in and I&#x27;m already in love.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that these came in a pack of 4 and for cheap!</li>
      <li>The color is not transparent like the picture shown here, they look more in cream color.</li>
      <li>but its been a month and seems hold up pretty good.</li>
      <li>These are great, soft and longer lasting..worth it!</li>
      <li>I feel more comfortable with them.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing to have.</li>
      <li>It is easy to install, just peel and stick.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Great anti-slip nose pieces easy to install, wish they were sold locally.</li>
      <li>Better than the first set I bought!</li>
      <li>It amazed me how comfortable it is.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great solution for people with low nose bridge like me....</li>
      <li>They are great for stopping the glass from rubbing against my nose because it makes it very red.</li>
      <li>So far they work fairly well.</li>
      <li>They come in two sizes, so, make sure you get the right size.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>These are also a bit smaller than the others I purchased, so they dont cover the whole nose piece on my plastic frames - which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>These take a while to get you from China, but I can already tell it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>My glasses are acrylic with no separate nose pads of its own, and these aren&#x27;t visible at all, which is a problem I had with locally bought pads.  </li>
      <li>These have some kind of imprint of the manufacturer or brand on the smaller side - they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>They were worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I think this will help them last longer as they cover a nice area to stick to.  </li>
      <li>As an asian with a small nose bridge, these are great for the trendy plastic frames.</li>
      <li>If you line them up right no-one will notice that you have them on.</li>
      <li>I had issues with my glasses sitting right on my cheeks, or if I tried to push them up higher, with my eyelashes hitting the lenses.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of days, it irritated my skin.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I got a different size it would be okay.</li>
      <li>These give a nice height to raise my glasses away from my face and keep them from slipping.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my glasses not fitting good</li>
      <li>simple, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I just put these on my glasses, and while I cannot speak to how long they last (I may edit later when I know), these are far superior - and cheaper!!!  </li>
      <li>Work very well.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>It sticks really well</li>
      <li>Thanks Bryan.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a problem since I really want something between the 1.8 and 2.5 and closer to 2.5.  </li>
      <li>These really help reduce face dents from my glasses.</li>
      <li>I really like it and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The glue/sticky material on the nose pad is really strong and won&#x27;t come loose</li>
      <li>The possible improvement here is the little tab, maybe this will hold that much better!</li>
      <li>Also, the clear design vs white, fleshtone, or black is a nice aesthetic touch.</li>
      <li>It does the job perfectly, but the material sticks to the skin and get s a little uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>That means I was able to put them on a little farther back (which is where I need them) and the pad is not as visible.  </li>
      <li>So far, no complaints.  </li>
      <li>worked really well for our Ray Bans; the silicone is just sticky enough on your nose to help keep the glasses in place, and I like the wraparound nature of the pads to help them stay on.</li>
      <li>So far.. I like them alot.</li>
      <li>Because of my makeup or facial products, the adhesive doesn&#x27;t hold up very well to moisture and the adhesive starts to peel apart from the silicone.  </li>
      <li>So far I have not had to replace any of them.  </li>
      <li>These small enough not being very noticeable and raised the frame just enough to make the glasses fits better on me.</li>
      <li>The nose area is a bit narrow originally without the grip</li>
      <li>My glasses are finally where I need them, they are comfortable (the nose pieces do not irritate my skin at all), and these are actually clear which makes them less visible when you are wearing your glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
      <li>Besides, you only spend half price for this one compared with most similar products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long they last, but the material seems easy to clean with regular lens spray and wipes, so I doubt make-up build-up will be a problem.</li>
      <li>wish it was more discreet, because it&#x27;s easily noticeable when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
      <li>After receiving, I carefully put these on and was pleased at how well they stuck, stopped my glasses from slipping and were not obviously visible unless you were looking for them.  </li>
      <li>It really depends on how wide or narrow the nose area is with your eyewear that these can fit to your preference.</li>
      <li>The only benefit of these are a low price and reasonable shipping time from overseas</li>
      <li>The wrap-around design makes them way more secure on the nose pad, and I just trimmed them down a little with scissors since the wrap-around part was a little bigger than needed.  </li>
      <li>The pads are far too big for the nose guards on glasses.  </li>
      <li>They work very well, with minimal assembly</li>
      <li>If you really want the 2.5 you get in other brands, these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>The others, from a different company didn&#x27;t last, were more expensive, were opaque - not clear, and did not raise my glasses as much as I needed them to.  </li>
      <li>My nose gets pretty oily after a few hours, so this helps a lot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> simple, easy to apply. saved me $$$ to get custom nose pads on my plastic frame sunglasses. doesn&#x27;t raise it as high as the nose pads that come with metal rim glasses, but it gives just enough friction to keep my glasses from slipping down all the time. My nose gets pretty oily after a few hours, so this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Work very well. Surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> Now, these are neat! The stick realy good. I trim off the flap that goes around the nose pieces. They come in two sizes, so, make sure you get the right size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues w/red marks on my nose just from wearing regular sunglasses for years.  Living in Florida, it&#x27;s a must.  Finally, I got the idea to try some stick on foam nose pads to see if it helps the issue.  I&#x27;ve had them for 3 wks. now on two pairs of glasses:  sunglasses &amp; reading glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, it helps reduce the red marks and indentations.  I&#x27;m happy to have (+) answers since sometimes one just has to wear glasses.</li>
    <li> These have some kind of imprint of the manufacturer or brand on the smaller side - they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> They tend to become unstuck.....</li>
    <li> It works by holding up my glasses and not constantly sliding down, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Because of my makeup or facial products, the adhesive doesn&#x27;t hold up very well to moisture and the adhesive starts to peel apart from the silicone.  I have to change out almost every other week.  These may be inexpensive, but for me I need something more durable.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait before writing a review, a few people had problems with them. I have them on my work glasses and two pairs of my home wear glasses. I cleaned my glasses well before putting them on. So far I have not had to replace any of them.  They work well for me. My glasses do not slide down my nose, did before I applied the anti-slips. If you line them up right no-one will notice that you have them on. I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> They are alright, but kind of make my nose itch and it turns red.  Must be an allergic reaction???  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good grip. And discrete so it doesnt show very much as long as you put it correctly. The product may cause itching, but it went away after 2 days. If it continues to itch dont use it!</li>
    <li> These just came in and I&#x27;m already in love.  I had issues with my glasses sitting right on my cheeks, or if I tried to push them up higher, with my eyelashes hitting the lenses.  These give a nice height to raise my glasses away from my face and keep them from slipping.  The wrap-around design makes them way more secure on the nose pad, and I just trimmed them down a little with scissors since the wrap-around part was a little bigger than needed.  My glasses are acrylic with no separate nose pads of its own, and these aren&#x27;t visible at all, which is a problem I had with locally bought pads.  Since I just got them I&#x27;m not sure how long they last, but the material seems easy to clean with regular lens spray and wipes, so I doubt make-up build-up will be a problem. These take a while to get you from China, but I can already tell it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Works great with my plastic frames!</li>
    <li> They work very well, with minimal assembly</li>
    <li> Adhesive strip separated from the nose pad but remained on my frames. These don&#x27;t hold up well</li>
    <li> None of the local stores have anything like this. These small enough not being very noticeable and raised the frame just enough to make the glasses fits better on me. Since I only wear my glasses at night not sure how long they will last but its been a month and seems hold up pretty good. Did I mention its also anti-slipped?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my glasses not fitting good but these have stopped them from sliding down my nose all day. They were worth the wait. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used these with glasses that don&#x27;t have separate nose pieces and it&#x27;s helped keep them from slipping.  I have a flat nose and it tends to get sweaty so my glasses will always slip, but this product keeps me from being too frustrated.</li>
    <li> So far they work fairly well. I will have to wait and see if they remain adherent.</li>
    <li> If surface has wet, no friction.</li>
    <li> I received these a few days earlier than noted. I didn&#x27;t mind the wait. When I got them, I immediately put them on my sunglasses. My glasses are a bit oversized that they slip off the nose so these are perfect rather than always going to my optometrist to get it sized. The grip helps a lot! I feel more comfortable with them. I also put them on my daily eye glasses. The nose area is a bit narrow originally without the grip so they feel a bit tighter on my nose bridge with them. I am going to try them out for a day to see if I like it or not. It really depends on how wide or narrow the nose area is with your eyewear that these can fit to your preference. Maybe if I got a different size it would be okay. I am glad that these came in a pack of 4 and for cheap! Great steal!</li>
    <li> It is easy to install, just peel and stick.  The first couple of days, it irritated my skin.  The adhesive lasted about 4 months and it fell off.</li>
    <li> As an asian with a small nose bridge, these are great for the trendy plastic frames. They are not so obtrusive that they stick out. So far.. I like them alot. They do not irritate the skin either.</li>
    <li> A little hard to install but work well</li>
    <li> Good but doesn&#x27;t stay stick for long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great solution for people with low nose bridge like me.... but it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing to have. It does the job perfectly, but the material sticks to the skin and get s a little uncomfortable. Price to pay for the glasses not to be constantly slipping, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue/sticky material on the nose pad is really strong and won&#x27;t come loose easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was more discreet, because it&#x27;s easily noticeable when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> These are less durable than those from Group Medical Supply (these less only 2-3 weeks), and when the adhesive breaks down, leaves behind difficult to remove, greasy, and tacky residue (remember, since they are on your eyeglass frames, you can&#x27;t use your usual solvents out of fear of harming the lenses. The only benefit of these are a low price and reasonable shipping time from overseas</li>
    <li> I had a pair of Ray Bans that kept slipping.  These were the perfect fix. Now the sunglasses stay on, even with sweat.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Maybe my skin is too moist? These pads felt tacky and when my glasses moved, the pads sort of stuck to my skin and were uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> After trying of several brands of eyeglass nose pads, finally I got this one to try.  It amazed me how comfortable it is.  I had one pair on my eyeglass for more then a month and it still glues tightly.  Besides, you only spend half price for this one compared with most similar products.  I really like it and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I just applied them to my glasses, so I don&#x27;t yet know how well they work, but the instructions are hilarious: &amp;#34;anti-slip nose pad of glasses&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;loose slide to prevent glasses&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;comfortable, healthy, beautiful, generous&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;the site of increase&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;the site of enhance&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;cleanthe oil of pasted parts before use&amp;#34;  I had to look up a photo online to see how they were supposed to be applied.</li>
    <li> It sticks really well and it holds up my glasses too! Best of both worlds right there.</li>
    <li> Pads work but needs better adhesive. Doesn&#x27;t stick for long.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I ordered some frames from Amazon.com.  The bridge of my nose is 15mm...but dumb me I ordered frames with a 20mm nose piece.  These stick-on made the glasses work perfect !</li>
    <li> These are great, soft and longer lasting..worth it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. After receiving, I carefully put these on and was pleased at how well they stuck, stopped my glasses from slipping and were not obviously visible unless you were looking for them.  But after 1 day, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and removed them. I have sensitive skin and the constant friction between my nose and the silicone, left marks on my nose that still feels a little raw a day later.  I&#x27;d rather have glasses that slip, than glasses that rub my nose raw.  In addition, it took several weeks for it to arrive as it is shipped from China (seller should be upfront about how long delivery takes).</li>
    <li> Amazing! It did hold my eyeglasses in place, no slippage! Still intact after months of use</li>
    <li> So far, no complaints.  I hope that I won&#x27;t have to replace too often as with other pads, some don&#x27;t stick well even after cleaning the area with alcohol.  The possible improvement here is the little tab, maybe this will hold that much better!</li>
    <li> It was difficult to see how to position them on glasses from the &amp;#34;instructions.&amp;#34; They did not not stick very well when I did apply them. It took almost a month to receive them.</li>
    <li> They work great!  Better than the first set I bought!</li>
    <li> It does its purpose. Doesn&#x27;t look great but it solves the issue of not having the metal piece grind against your nose</li>
    <li> Shipped from China and they look different than what I bought from other sellers, and they don&#x27;t look like the picture shown here. The color is not transparent like the picture shown here, they look more in cream color.</li>
    <li> These only last a week or two, then the adhesive turns to mush and they slip off.  Maybe longer in cooler weather?</li>
    <li> They are great for stopping the glass from rubbing against my nose because it makes it very red. But it did not last long.</li>
    <li> the small size side is what i used for my nose.  the other side is too puffy kinda works tho on the slipping</li>
    <li> worked really well for our Ray Bans; the silicone is just sticky enough on your nose to help keep the glasses in place, and I like the wraparound nature of the pads to help them stay on. Also, the clear design vs white, fleshtone, or black is a nice aesthetic touch.</li>
    <li> Great anti-slip nose pieces easy to install, wish they were sold locally. Thanks Bryan.</li>
    <li> Price was great.  Arrived quickly.  Only comment is 2.5mm size is less thick than others I have bought.  This isn&#x27;t a problem since I really want something between the 1.8 and 2.5 and closer to 2.5.  If you really want the 2.5 you get in other brands, these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered two different kinds.  The others, from a different company didn&#x27;t last, were more expensive, were opaque - not clear, and did not raise my glasses as much as I needed them to.  I just put these on my glasses, and while I cannot speak to how long they last (I may edit later when I know), these are far superior - and cheaper!!!  These seem perfect!  My glasses are finally where I need them, they are comfortable (the nose pieces do not irritate my skin at all), and these are actually clear which makes them less visible when you are wearing your glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Take home points -&lt;br /&gt;1.  Nice thickness - These are 2.5mm in thickness, giving my glasses the rise I needed.  I have plastic frams with a very narrow bridge and long eyelashes which meant that my glasses were falling down my nose, and when placed at the proper height my eyelashes were constantly streaking up my lenses.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Less visible - These are also a bit smaller than the others I purchased, so they dont cover the whole nose piece on my plastic frames - which is a good thing.  That means I was able to put them on a little farther back (which is where I need them) and the pad is not as visible.  So it is both smaller and clear - making them less visible.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Nice design - The sick to both sides of your nose piece (as you can see from the image).  I think this will help them last longer as they cover a nice area to stick to.  It also makes them easier to put on.</li>
    <li> These really help reduce face dents from my glasses.</li>
    <li> This item is totally worthless.  It comes with no directions other than &amp;#34;past these to you glasses&amp;#34;.  Paste?  To my glasses?  How?  It had a removable backing:  does this make them stick?  The pads are far too big for the nose guards on glasses.  Do you trim them?  After attaching them, they adhered maybe 15 seconds.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 pair that went into the wastebasket.  Go to your local drug store and get 12 nose pads for 99 cents.  This is the WORST item ever purchased anywhere!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. They are easy to apply. They stick well. They are comfortable and work great!</li>
    <li> Looks, works as expected.</li>
