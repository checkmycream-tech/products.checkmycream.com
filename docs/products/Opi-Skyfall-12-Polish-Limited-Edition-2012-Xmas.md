    <li> Beautiful nail polish.  OPI is such high quality.  Love it!!  Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for nice nail polish.  The company was very quick in shipping this product out.</li>
    <li> Great colors from the Skyfall collection. Several textures and finishes means perfect for any occasion - metallic, glitter, shimmer, liquid sand. Love, OPI.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the fact that there&#x27;s a James Bond set of nail polish! I was excited to be able to buy the whole set before it was discontinued! My only complaints are that they only made as many colors as they did (vs one per movie) and that it was a limited edition set!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she love it. She was painting her nails as soon as she opened it.</li>
    <li> The Best collection I have gotten in a long time . No regrets with this collection!  Skyfall is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My wife is doing the comenting on this.  I don&#x27;t wear polish!  She says, \\&quot;For some reason I thought it would be packaged as a Limited Edition, the way the small bottles were.  No box, just bottles of polish individually wrapped in bubble wrap.  Guess I won&#x27;t give it as a present.  I also thought both Goldeneye and Goldfinger would be featured, but there&#x27;s just Goldeneye.  I wish the description had been more specific, and the picture bigger so I had a better idea of what I was getting.  I suspect I would have been better off to pick out specific colors and ordered them separately.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a great collection, there is something for everyone. The stand outs are Skyfall, the hot oxblood color of the winter season, and the Goldeneye polish.</li>
    <li> Yesterday I finally received my order and I was very unsatisfied, it is not what I ordered! There&#x27;s no \\&quot;Living daylights\\&quot;, \\&quot;Golden eye\\&quot;, \\&quot;On her majesty&#x27;s secret service\\&quot;, etc., they are replaced with plain colors, which are not showed on the photo!</li>
    <li> The OPI nailpolish was a gift for my daughter.  This is her first OPI polish and she is very impressed by it.  I appreciate the seller&#x27;s good communication with me regarding shipment.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love OPI, and it&#x27;s my go to nail polish.  I love the colors, variety and the way my nails look when I use it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
    <li> These are supposed to be the Skyfall collection, but all someone did was stick a &amp;#34;white dot sticker&amp;#34; on the bottom of the bottle and print the skyfall color names on it! The sticker on the bottle&#x27;s side reflects the original color.</li>
    <li> it was exactly as advertised and good buy, the colors are amazing, highly recommend as a gift also, thank you</li>
    <li> This collection is awesome!!!! Love all the colors! These  are full size bottles and comes in tbe OPI boxes. So glad I bought this set!!!</li>

    <li> These nail polishes are great quality, OPI is the best. There are a lot of fun, glam colors in here. I&#x27;m not sure if some of these are really &amp;#34;everyday wear&amp;#34; but they&#x27;re perfect for going out.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift and the receiving person loved the colors of the OPI set.  Very happy with gift.</li>
    <li> Every single color is stunning!!! I keep repainting my nails every other day, and I can&#x27;t make up my mind which one is my favorite! This is a collection you need to own every single shade off</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Skyfall Collection. There is such a wide variety of polishes. It gives me so many possibilities. Plus the quality of polish is great. I&#x27;m a big fan of this collection (and not paying the salon price for these polishes)!</li>
    <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
    <li> Ordered this nail polish set before Christmas. Arrived on time with no hassle. Girlfriend was very impressed, loved every color in the set, very elegant and sexy.</li>
    <li> outstanding product. My girlfriend absolutely loved having all 12 colors in one set. She especially loved that they came all together and she could easily replace the broken one.</li>
    <li> The 12 polishes were very nice. The colors are true to the picture and the formula is a good consistency.</li>
    <li> My wife loves James Bond . I got this as a surprise gift . The nail polish is high quality and has a great finish .The only disappointment I has was there wasn&#x27;t a box for the polish to be presented. I was expecting a 007 box with a nice presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were nail polishes wrapped in a brown box. Its not the seller&#x27;s fault. Seller was excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to try out OPI for quite a while and decided to do with this collection. I do not regret the decision. These are really nice looking colors indeed, and the ones that are metallic do not have the problem China Glaze has (where I have the hardest time removing it thus damaging my nails in the way most of the time)</li>
