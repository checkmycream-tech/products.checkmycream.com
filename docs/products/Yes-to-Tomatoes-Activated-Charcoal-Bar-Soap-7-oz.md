      <li>GREAT stuff for a very sensitive face with excema!   </li>

      <li>I applied a moisturizer before going to bed and noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin when i woke up.</li>
      <li>Its been years since I&#x27;ve been zit free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, fantastic choice.</li>
      <li>My face feels super clean after using it and looks all around more glowy.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this soap from target for my boyfriend who has ance prone skin all over and this has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Cleared up my skin gets it really clean and radiant.</li>
      <li>It does make your face and body squeaky clean, but for me, that&#x27;s a plus, not a problem-</li>
      <li>My skin felt clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It feels so fresh but not drying after shower .</li>
      <li>I wish that had been more clear in the product description when I ordered.</li>
      <li>The areas dry up quickly and nicely.</li>
      <li>you should be using a moisturizer afterward anyway, right?</li>
      <li>This leaves your face and body feeling squeaky clean, you can really tell the charcoal is removing all the gunk from your skin.</li>
      <li>and this really helps get rid of it quickly.</li>
      <li>I have adult acne and once I paired this soap with a twice daily gel moisturizer I have to say that this is the best my face has looked in a very long time.</li>
      <li>and it does make it feel a little tight but a nice face cream works great with this.</li>
      <li>so I thought I would try this first.</li>
      <li>and I find it pretty relaxing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Worked really well for 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Very strong perfumes, dried my skin out.</li>
      <li>might add, I have pretty clear skin</li>
      <li>I have a beautiful marble shower and was a little worried about leaving black marks, but no problems there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, big bar and doesn&#x27;t wear down fast in the shower.</li>
      <li>Alba Botanica Hawaiian Coconut Milk Face Wash(it didnt work to clear up my skin but is very moisturizing)</li>
      <li>(I had oil on something and new areas were popping up to my dismay).</li>
      <li>I have super dry skin</li>
      <li>My skin has been ridiculously clear ever since switching to this soap!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any smell so it won&#x27;t irritate sensitive noses</li>
      <li>I have oily skin that isnt sensitive</li>
      <li>This soap is strong enough to remove heavy soils and oils but gentle enough to leave your skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are always people who complain about smells in reviews, but I absolutely love the subtle scent.  </li>
      <li>and it was the only charcoal wash I could find for a while, but it can be pricey especially for guys who don&#x27;t really care</li>
      <li>I have Fibro and am sensitive to a number of different chemicals.</li>
      <li>It is the only product I have found that has *completely* eliminated my acne and made my face super-soft.  </li>
      <li>but I had one little bump of something that also cleared right up unexpectantly.</li>
      <li>I started a new bar after posting the above review and it is just now (in October/6 months later) dwindling to nothing.</li>
      <li>Breakouts have definitely reduced and skin just generally feels cleaner and detoxified.</li>

<li> Breakouts have definitely reduced and skin just generally feels cleaner and detoxified.</li>
<li> At first I thought that the soap left my face feeling very stiff with no moisture.</li>
<li> Since it&#x27;s winter, it will definitely leave my skin dry if I don&#x27;t immediately put on a moisturizer, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
<li> we have white cloth shower liner and curtain on the shower but the black has never stained any those</li>
<li> That&#x27;s not really Amazon&#x27;s fault, though.</li>
<li> I am curious to see how it goes after using it for a week.</li>
<li> Previously I had been using a very expensive cream and the soap worked much better than the cream on both the itch and appearance.</li>
<li> Not soft, just tight and almost plastic</li>
<li> Extremely drying and scented.</li>
<li> Like other reviewers, I can&#x27;t believe I have gone to a drug store</li>
<li> I wanted to explore other soaps, and this one did not make the cut.</li>
<li> I am so picky when it comes to soaps and have always used JĀSÖN Tea Tree soap, but its roughly $8-$15 a bottle!</li>
<li> I do suggest using a moisturizer with it though because it does tend to dry the skin out a little.</li>
<li> I usually purchase this bar in person at the store, but I&#x27;m finding it harder and harder to find.</li>
<li> My only negative comment would be that I find it leaves that weird bar soap tightness and residue on my face and can be very drying.</li>
<li> I am so bummed to say that despite the amazing smell of the soap bar, it leaves a horrible dry residue feeling.</li>
<li> /&gt;You may need to get over the black soap appeal.</li>
<li> I like this soap, but it does &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34;, meaning that little black flakes end up on the tub.  </li>
<li> He did mention his face felt a little tight after using it</li>
<li> A little bonus.</li>
<li> and it worked in just a few days.</li>
<li> and then I broke out with cystic acne on my cheeks and chin that I usually don&#x27;t get.</li>
<li> I purchased this at Walmart and have been using it for the past month.</li>
<li> Our water is abnormally hard, leaves calcium build-up within days.</li>
<li> Surprisingly not to drying either.</li>
<li> When it arrived, I saw the bar contains salicylic acid, which I cannot use because it makes my acne worse and irritates my skin.</li>
<li> and they don&#x27;t want any complicated skin care.</li>
<li> Then a couple months later got poison ivy EVERYWHERE and was so miserable</li>
<li> I tend to get really bad acne</li>
<li> Still shocked I now use a bar soap to wash my face after all these years of gels, foams and scrubs, but here I am.</li>

    <li> Makes my face feel nice and clean. It&#x27;s a nice, big bar and doesn&#x27;t wear down fast in the shower.</li>
    <li> Very strong perfumes, dried my skin out. Tossed it after 3 washes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. Still shocked I now use a bar soap to wash my face after all these years of gels, foams and scrubs, but here I am. This leaves your face and body feeling squeaky clean, you can really tell the charcoal is removing all the gunk from your skin. Since it&#x27;s winter, it will definitely leave my skin dry if I don&#x27;t immediately put on a moisturizer, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Breakouts have definitely reduced and skin just generally feels cleaner and detoxified. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and once I paired this soap with a twice daily gel moisturizer I have to say that this is the best my face has looked in a very long time. Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I have Fibro and am sensitive to a number of different chemicals. This soap is my saving grace. It has salicylic acid in it which helps exfoliate and helps with that dreaded middle age acne along the jaw line. One bar lasts a while if you take care of it and I find it pretty relaxing. I&#x27;ve turned a number of friends on to this product. I usually purchase this bar in person at the store, but I&#x27;m finding it harder and harder to find. Thus I&#x27;m here, price-checking...and hopefully letting the people at YES know that I need this soap....keep it in production, please!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up! I started a new bar after posting the above review and it is just now (in October/6 months later) dwindling to nothing. Granted I used it primarily on my face, shoulders and upper chest, and I babied that bar, but I&#x27;m still very impressed!!</li>
    <li> This cleared up my pores on my back. Great post-workout soap!</li>
    <li> It feels so fresh but not drying after shower . It doesn&#x27;t have any smell so it won&#x27;t irritate sensitive noses and it helps keeping the body acne at bay in summer!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Walmart and have been using it for the past month. I tend to get really bad acne and this really helps get rid of it quickly. I do suggest using a moisturizer with it though because it does tend to dry the skin out a little.</li>
    <li> I am so bummed to say that despite the amazing smell of the soap bar, it leaves a horrible dry residue feeling. I am so picky when it comes to soaps and have always used JĀSÖN Tea Tree soap, but its roughly $8-$15 a bottle! I wanted to explore other soaps, and this one did not make the cut.</li>
    <li> The smell is over powering on this soap. The soap makes your face feel squeaky. Not soft, just tight and almost plastic like. Has not had an affect on my acne problems.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for 2 weeks and then I broke out with cystic acne on my cheeks and chin that I usually don&#x27;t get. Will be throwing this away.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, but it does &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34;, meaning that little black flakes end up on the tub.  Probably best to keep in a plastic, travel case for soaps.</li>
    <li> My skin has been ridiculously clear ever since switching to this soap! My only negative comment would be that I find it leaves that weird bar soap tightness and residue on my face and can be very drying. I just add a squirt of Alba Botanica Hawaiian Coconut Milk Face Wash(it didnt work to clear up my skin but is very moisturizing) and my face feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a clearance rack at a department store just because. Then a couple months later got poison ivy EVERYWHERE and was so miserable I thought why not try the soap. I&#x27;ve never used charcoal soap before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have a beautiful marble shower and was a little worried about leaving black marks, but no problems there. The soap dries poison ivy up wonderfully. I itched for a minute or 2 coming out of the shower and then no itching for about 20 hours. Just short of the 24 hour mark I felt like I needed another charcoal shower and this lasted over a couple of days (I had oil on something and new areas were popping up to my dismay). The areas dry up quickly and nicely. Previously I had been using a very expensive cream and the soap worked much better than the cream on both the itch and appearance. If you have the ivy, I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might add, I have pretty clear skin but I had one little bump of something that also cleared right up unexpectantly. A little bonus.</li>
    <li> love this line of product works great for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the YtT wipes, and when Amazon could no longer seem to keep them in stock on a regular basis, switched to this soap.  It is the only product I have found that has *completely* eliminated my acne and made my face super-soft.  There are always people who complain about smells in reviews, but I absolutely love the subtle scent.  It does make your face and body squeaky clean, but for me, that&#x27;s a plus, not a problem- you should be using a moisturizer afterward anyway, right?</li>
    <li> Our water is abnormally hard, leaves calcium build-up within days. This soap is strong enough to remove heavy soils and oils but gentle enough to leave your skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need to get over the black soap appeal. we have white cloth shower liner and curtain on the shower but the black has never stained any those curtains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, fantastic choice.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I use it as my face wash and it made a noticeable difference in my breakouts within a week.  My boss gave me Clearpoorf by Mary Kay and I broke out again so I went back to this and, like before, within the week I could tell it was clearing up my skin.  I love, love, love this soap! I understand why people say it&#x27;s too perfumey; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering and it&#x27;s definitely not the reason to not use this product but you can smell it as you&#x27;re using it.  Highly recommend! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This was the only thing I&#x27;ve tried of all the acne washes that worked and it worked in just a few days. Its been years since I&#x27;ve been zit free. I have oily skin that isnt sensitive but anything can cause it to break out. This didn&#x27;t. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. Cleared up my skin gets it really clean and radiant. Surprisingly not to drying either.</li>
    <li> Extremely drying and scented. i skipped using this on my face and im going to use it for the body for now. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that the soap left my face feeling very stiff with no moisture. I applied a moisturizer before going to bed and noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin when i woke up. I suffer from acne so I was quite impressed. My face looked overall clearer and even the blemishes had diminished. This was only after one night. I am curious to see how it goes after using it for a week. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this soap from target for my boyfriend who has ance prone skin all over and this has made a huge difference. I was going to order him a body wash from origins, since I use all their products and it was the only charcoal wash I could find for a while, but it can be pricey especially for guys who don&#x27;t really care so I thought I would try this first. Having just one bar of soap that works for his face and body is great considering he&#x27;s a guy and they don&#x27;t want any complicated skin care. I couldn&#x27;t find it at target again so I ordered it here. He did mention his face felt a little tight after using it but once he applied the matching moisturizer he was good to go!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I can&#x27;t believe I have gone to a drug store brand- and a bar soap at that, to wash my face. I&#x27;ve always splurged on skin care but this item feels like a splurge at a steal price. My face feels super clean after using it and looks all around more glowy. I have super dry skin and it does make it feel a little tight but a nice face cream works great with this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing activated charcoal AND Yes to Tomatoes, one of my favorite brands. When it arrived, I saw the bar contains salicylic acid, which I cannot use because it makes my acne worse and irritates my skin. I wish that had been more clear in the product description when I ordered. That&#x27;s not really Amazon&#x27;s fault, though. The Yes to website doesn&#x27;t even list all the ingredients for the bar.</li>
    <li> GREAT stuff for a very sensitive face with excema!   Only soap I will ever use!</li>
    <li> Except for the price, I really enjoyed using this product. My skin felt clean and refreshed.</li>
