<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not your traditional loofa, but feels great.</li>
    <li> love it, does what it says!</li>
    <li> I was having so much pain in my arms  that I could not reach to wash my back. now  I  can easily reach my back to wash it. fantastic idem!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Two thumbs up..</li>
    <li> I use it every morning in the shower.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Holds up well after many washings. My last one was cheaper, and didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> What can I say - it does what I expected it to do. Combined with the Phisoderm Anti-Blemish body wash, this combo is the perfect solution to keep my back clear.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome! I&#x27;m one of those people who never rates something at 10 out of 10 or 5 out out 5. This is five star for sure</li>
    <li> This feels so great on your back, and really works. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I would have preferred the handles to be a little longer... or the fabric longer, either/or. I&#x27;ll just add a little cotton rope pull on each side, for a more comfortable reach for me. Others might find it just the right length though, but I have arthritis now and don&#x27;t bend like Gumby anymore.</li>
    <li> It has a rough and soft side, dry&#x27;s out easily and is very well made. I have used it for the past six months daily and it still looks new...</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to some of the other reviews.  This scrubber is not to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give it the benefit of doubt......there are fundamental differences between this shoe shine buffing style and a long handled brush.&lt;br /&gt;For some, the shoe shine buffer will work just fine on their back.  For me?  Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just don&#x27;t get a good scrubbing action with the coarse terry cloth finish on this Aquis scrubber..  If you are someone with soft dainty skin, you might like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing dainty about the skin on my back. I need a good scrub to feel like the oils, dirt and dead skin have been removed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone to a long handled scrub brush that works well for me.</li>
    <li> I never write product review, but this one is really GREAT!!! I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for years. Highly recommended if you want to clean your back properly</li>
    <li> REALLY CLEANS MY BACK WELL.</li>
    <li> hasn&#x27;t broke on me yet, i been really careful using it tho, but it scrubbs really well and i throw it in the washer machine like once a wek.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;You can get a really good foam with regular soap on the harsh side of the scrubber&lt;br /&gt;It really really exfoliates your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: On the softer side of the scrubber, you can&#x27;t get a good foam so if you want a softer exfoliation, it doesn&#x27;t feel as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I&#x27;m still using the hard side to see what happens.</li>
    <li> FINALY CAN WASH MY BACK WITHOUT MUCH STRECH AND TROUBLE. GREAT AND EASY TO USE. THAT IS IT VERY SIMPLE.</li>
    <li> Got this to make washing my back easier..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; side doesn&#x27;t tear your skin apart, or hurt at all, so i feel like it actually cleans.  As others have mentioned it can turn around at times, but it takes all of half a second to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rather short, and it works just fine.  if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, I would get it.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago to try out.  One side is abrasive while other side is softer.  Great quality and has lasted daily use thus far.</li>
    <li> Best backs crubber I have ever bought.  The cloth is very stretchy and you can tell it is a good material.  One side is rough and the other is smooth.  I like the rough side very much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good scrubber but I don&#x27;t like how they made the middle part of it rigid.  I can&#x27;t just throw it over a rail to dry between showers.  I&#x27;m an older person with physical &amp; health challenges so I need assistive tools to bathe.  This scrubber does the job it&#x27;s intended for and is  worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and she is constantly telling people that it was best gift she got all Christmas. And she got some pretty pricey electronic stuff. She has really sensitive skin, and she says this product has dramatically changed her overall skin health.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Works well and far more comfortable than a loofa.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber a short time, but, so far it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s not as good as the giant loofa that my wife sewed into a terry-cloth backing 2-3 years ago, but finding a replacement loofa of that size has not been possible to date. I was surprised at how rough the exfoliating side of the Aquis is, it is a lot rougher when wet. It could be a bit wider, by say another 50%. In the absence of another giant loofa sewn onto another terry-cloth backing, the Aquis serves very nicely.     I&#x27;ll re-visit this review in the future if there are any significant changes to my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product I thought to my self that this probably will not work &amp; the reason I purchased it was because of the great reviews &amp; star ratings, but after I received it &amp; used it I am pleasantly surprised how good this product actually work&#x27;s. It helped me with my back a lot because I have Lupus &amp; Eczema &amp; those two do a lot to dry out the skin not to mention other things, but it helped with the dry skin on my back because it is sort of scaly which is gross &amp; embarrassing &amp; this thing get&#x27;s area&#x27;s that the normal back brush could not, so after I used this it was gone &amp; I am glad I purchased it &amp; I will purchase more in the future because this thing works exceptionally &amp; I am wonderfully satisfied. Go get one or two, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I love it, works very well. I can not washed my back that good without it. I have 3 of them. Use it every night.</li>
    <li> one side harsh... other side softer... very very good.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a really ruff scrubber.  This is not that.</li>
    <li> So much better than those nylon puff things!  Really scrubs off the dead skin, and reaches my entire back!</li>
    <li> The last back scrubber I had was bad about mildew.  This one works well, and when hung vertically doens&#x27;t have any mildew or moisture problems.</li>
    <li> i am 5&#x27;9\\&quot; tall, armspread 6 feet, this works perfectly for me. has 2 sides, one smooth one rough.  dries quickly, feels good, works well especially on back.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber was just what I needd. Just the right length for ease of motion. I fold it up and use it as washcloth to scrub upper body. Would recommend it and for the price will buy another when time comes. Has rough n smooth side for choice of scrubbing</li>
    <li> good quality but a bit difficult to use as compaired to a back brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this back scrubber for 3 years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. It is the perfect length to scrub your back without having to contort your body like a pretzel. I also use it to scrub my bum and the back of my upper legs, and it exfoliates those places well. Every few weeks I throw it in the wash and it&#x27;s good as new! A top notch product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 6 months ago and I am definately seeing results! I&#x27;ve had different skin issues for some time on my back.., hives, itches, acne.., generally annoyed skin! My girlfriend suggested something like this, so for this price I figured why not? Couldn&#x27;t be happier- use it every time I shower, just use the softer side of the towel, and just lather my regular bar soap to soap it up (I use the Cetaphil Anti-Bacterial bars.) I&#x27;m about 90% improved at this point and getting better every day! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a great product. Scratchy, thin and no Aquis tag. Don&#x27;t think it was the real thing.</li>
    <li> I loved it. This is awesome.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Not only do I use it for my back, it works great on my whole body. Gives a great total body exfoliation. I skin is as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!!! I&#x27;m hooked! HIGHLY recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting this for everyone in family.</li>
    <li> I like this scrubber because it is not as harsh as some back scrubbers. It might be harsh the first time but once you use it a few times it exfoliates your skin well. I also use it on other parts of my body, I fold it up so it is easy to hold. Others have not figured that out yet per the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of right now I am on my third scrubber; I have had a few handles come off from not being sewn on well but it functioned just fine with out the handle. Never had them roll up on me much, hold it all the way out and it works fine. I will continue to use these as long as I can.</li>
    <li> good product ysed it today</li>
    <li> Great scrubber.  Works very well.  It also works great dry as a back scratcher.  I will be buying a couple more so I can always have one in the shower while the other is in the wash.</li>
    <li> This product works well. One side is soft, on the other is much exfoliated type. Overall the package is nice and functional and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine to get the hard to reach places on my back.</li>
    <li> Very good quality bath product. Exfoliates on one side, and is soft on the other. It&#x27;s well made, and feels like it will hold up to repeated use and machine washings. I will buy it again, and it&#x27;s much better quality than the other nylon cheap products that have a similar design.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom as a gift. The first time she used it one of the handles came off. But she said it feels good and works well although now she has to sew the one handle back on. So, if it was more durable it would be great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a police officer and I have to wear a bullet vest every day for work for 12-15 hours. That creates a lot of extra sweat and heat and oils so this really helps to get squeaky clean and keep any bumps from forming or anything like that. Great product!</li>
    <li> This makes scrubbing my back much easier. I like the material. I prefer the rough side but there is a softer side. When I&#x27;m finished I hang it by its handles to dry. It dries completely and hasn&#x27;t attracted mold.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described, however, in my head I assumed it would be wider, but it clearly states 4in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and wrings out easily. The rope handles make the product more effective.</li>
    <li> I like that this scrubber has two sides to it. One side is smooth whiie the other side is good for exfoliating. This is the first time I&#x27;m using a towel material as a scrubber, and it&#x27;s been alright. The downside to this are that it takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> What a simple and great way to get to all those places you never could get to.  Works like a charm.  I&#x27;m sending one to each of my sisters.</li>
    <li> After years of trying different type of sponges and scrubbers, this one is the best one so far. The scrubber clean the back side really good. It&#x27;s a good buy !!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband, who wanted something simple. It&#x27;s very handy and soothing, as the scrubbing action is different on the two surfaces. The more aggressive side is satisfyingly scrubby without hurting the skin, so you can use it every day. Would absolutely buy it again. The price is more than fair, too.</li>
    <li> I just love how this product feels. It has a soft and rough side to it and holds soap well. The quality seems quite durable and I am hoping it lasts a long time. It is also very pretty and feels good in the hands!</li>
    <li> Works great to scrub your back! And I like the dual textured sides</li>
    <li> A little harsh on the rougher side but is nice every now and then. I really like it and it works as expected/designed</li>
    <li> After 2 YEARS of daily use:  GREAT product.  It has NOT deteriorated, and still has all the \\&quot;Pros\\&quot; it had when I first used it.  By letting it hang dry as I suggest below between showers, it has remained mold-free and in essentially the same condition it was in new.  The rope \\&quot;handles\\&quot; are still in great condition, but I don&#x27;t loop my hands through them and pull on them hard; instead, I grip the ends of the \\&quot;cloth\\&quot; part of the scrubber.  Occasionally, if you want you can throw it in the washing machine--or hand wash it.  Just don&#x27;t use real hot water or put it in the clothes dryer!!! It will shrink some, as my college son learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this Aquis scrubber and the similar design Aquabella scrubber at same time based on other reviews.  Immediately returned the Aquabella due to strong, noxious chemical odors it contained [see review under Aquabella].  The Aquis had NO chemical odors at all.  Have been using the Aquis for 3 wks now, and really like it.  Pros:  (1) it&#x27;s long--31\\&quot;x4\\&quot;w scrubber cloth plus 4\\&quot;long rope \\&quot;handles\\&quot; on each end--I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall with long arms, and it&#x27;s plenty long enough to hold easily and scrub it back and forth on my back without feeling it was too short; (2) edges, etc seem well sewn/sturdy; (3) 1 side is an exfoliating rougher surface and 1 side is softer surface--my skin is tender, so I primarily use the soft side; (4) dries out fast if you rinse soap out, wring it out by hand, and hang in shower.  Cons:  none so far.  Other reviewers mentioned that the rope \\&quot;handles\\&quot; come loose over time.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if that&#x27;ll happen with mine; so a few months down the road I will update my review.  A few tips:  (1)  to save wear and tear on the rope \\&quot;handles\\&quot;, instead of hooking my hands inside the ropes, I just hold onto the ends of the \\&quot;cloth\\&quot; part of the scrubber--it&#x27;s long enough to allow you to do that; (2) to prevent mold from growing on it, rinse the soap out before shutting off the shower, wring out the scrubber, and hang it to dry out--dries quickly this way--I just use rope handle on 1 end of scrubber to loop over a shampoo bottle top in my shower caddy, and the scrubber hangs free in the air and dries quickly.  Yes, the Aquis is more expensive than the Aquabella, but the Aquabella has strong, noxious chemical odor.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out. I had already purchased a soap/lotion for my experiment. It was long enough to reach all the way across my back and very quickly relieved the \\&quot;itches\\&quot; to my dry back...was like magic fingers, ...made me happy!</li>
    <li> adequate. main scrubber is fine, good size, but the yard strap broke first day.</li>
    <li> This product really does work. Originally, I had bought a knock off. However, I eventually got the real deal. It works exactly as described and as of now, the handles have not come apart nor has there been any mold or mildew issues. I only use the product twice a week. That seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for back exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I felt it was a little over priced for what I received.  Scratchy on one side which is nice at first, then... Maybe a little too abrasive. Overall I&#x27;m thankful for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it four and a half stars as it could be one inch longer for me [long arms] and it comes with strict cleaning instructions.  Other than that, I can&#x27;t imagine life without it.  Get one if you need to exfoliate.  Get one if you don&#x27;t.  Relax and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it&#x27;s really helped during the dry skin season. My back feels so much better after a scrub with this. It rinses clean and I just hang it in the shower to dry. If you&#x27;re not showing with someone else this will scrub the back well.</li>
    <li> This does a great job.  Scrubs my back really well without hurting my skin.  I have a hard time reaching many areas of my back and this scrubs and cleans it all.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Love it! using it everyday!</li>
    <li> Drizzle some bath oil along the middle of this, and then massage your back. Does wonders for that itchy back. I keep one in my travel bag, one in the guest bathroom and one in my own bathroom. This is one of those items you never thought to own, but once you do, you cannot do without it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother to replace his worn out one.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Very good scrubber, durable and well made, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and was looking for something that would give me a killer back scratching while also getting my back clean.  This does the job perfectly -- reaches and cleans everywhere, and gives me that blessed back scratch relief.</li>
    <li> Ok - so when I first got this I loved it... my opinion changed however...&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt; - It feels great. I felt like a cat using it on my back ... I may have purred&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt; - It really is pretty rough and at one point it was more scratching than exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt; - I tried to dry it out really well after each shower but it grew mold within 2 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall good, but no longevity.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery and the product is just as great as expected. Everything I was expecting and more!!</li>
    <li> had a stroke an I bought this hoping it would work to help me wash my back better an boy what a god send. thanks for making this product</li>
    <li> First one ever purchased. I like it.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for one of these and of course found it on Amazon. Works good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful all that you could ask for. Feels so great on the back makes me feel so clean would recommend for anyone who wants to feel refreshed after a good shower</li>
    <li> Love this , works great !!!</li>
    <li> I bought several of these given the low price, and the reviews that said they have a tendency to fall apart.  I have had mine for a while and have no complaints, other than it doubles over sometimes, being a fabric rather than sisal. Leaves my back perfectly smooth.  Much easier than a brush and infinitely more transportable.  Thumbs up for this one.</li>
    <li> Works well w/o stretching to much</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and it feel so good,i have already started seeing results. It is one of the best products i have ordered from Amazon. It really scrubs the back, waist, heck even my neck...lol...One side is for cleaning and one side is for exfoliating...well worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Good length, it cleans the entire back!  Buy it with [[ASIN:B000Y038CS Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]], and you will get smooth, pimple-free back you can show off!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different types of scrubs none were as good as this. It is easy to reach any part of the back and the materiel feels like it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I found this.</li>
    <li> My back acne had improved significantly since using this and it feels so amazing!  Also helps makes skin smoother since it exfoliates so well! I love love love it!  Highly recommended!  Way better than a loofah!</li>
    <li> The Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber is wonderful,it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to get to my back.I love it.Also, is washable.i would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Exfoliating?  Spa?  C&#x27;mon.  Look, it may be disgusting to talk about but I&#x27;m a guy and I need to wash my back daily or I&#x27;ll get that dreaded &amp;#34;back acne&amp;#34;.  Reality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical back brushes are a pain to use, and you miss spots.  With this, you can quickly and easily get the job done completely, and efficiently.  Well worth the money and holding up well.  I&#x27;m very happy and my back is squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> good length but isn&#x27;t quite course enough.....have had another that scrubbed better.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my back.</li>
    <li> Really scrubs your back good.</li>
    <li> we purchase one to try and found it was very good to use will buy some more.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Super light weight and it lathers up very nicely, soft side and heavy duty exfoliating side perfect for you back.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000I20Q72 Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber]]&lt;br /&gt;This product has two rope handles.  One came apart from the Back Scrubber in the first week of use.  I&#x27;m a little less vigorous in my scrubbing using the remaining handle and a jury rig.</li>
    <li> i like this product very much. two handles at the end make it so easy to use and hang after use. i don&#x27;t know how those could break apart. i had for about two weeks now and no problem at all. simply love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use even if you&#x27;re not very coordinated, cleans my back very well and helped eradicate my back acne.</li>
    <li> I have not tried it yet but I am pleased  with the material and the quality and workmanship.  good purchase</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  Not twisting yourself up trying to scrub your back.  Only knock is that it doesn&#x27;t scrub the middle of my back at the spine.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is perfect. My back has never been happier. Not too rough, not too soft, just right. Arrived very quickly, well packaged, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I like a really good scrub and this 1 is rough!  The other side is not, but then you could use an  Axe puff. Buy it if you like your skin to tingle.</li>
    <li> I got a really bad rash a day after using this. I can&#x27;t claim with 100% certainty this gave it to me, but it arrived on Easter Sunday, I used it on my back, stomach, and neck, and 1 day later only those areas broke out in a bad rash/allergic reaction of some type. The only other thing that could have caused it would have been king crab I ate for Easter, however ive eaten that many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my rash goes away Im going to try it again. I want to like it, but if you get it I recommend washing it before first use, which I didn&#x27;t do. perhaps it has dust/mites etc.</li>
    <li> I HAS TO ORDER MORE OF THESE. EVERYBODY WANTED ONE. GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT</li>
    <li> This is the only one that stays flat on your back and long enough for long arms. One side is rough, the other is soft to give you the choice between the two feelings when toucing your sckin</li>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile.  High quality and a good length.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, really, but too long for my small shower.</li>
    <li> not to bad.  Easy to use. great back drier. great price. quick dry. don&#x27;t recommend. don&#x27;t like the fabric at all.</li>
    <li> This is an effective scrubber.  However, even though it was thoroughly rinsed each day, and machine washed and dried every week it smelled increasingly bad and I finally had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This product is so good! The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the shower! I&#x27;ve used loofahs, glove scrubbers, and poofs. Unlike the other products, this scrubber cleared up my back and felt good doing it. Best back scrubber ever!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this scrubber after having had the brush on my previous back scrubber fall off from the handle one to many times.  I had thought of returning the defective brush but instead just junked it and bought this scrubber which has no way to fall into the shower.  It feels good on my back and I think it&#x27;s a good product and the price is right.</li>
    <li> The rough side is comparable to the burrs of a velcro strap. It works I suppose but the first time I felt it on my back, it felt like someone was clawing my spine!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive, but if you have some back acne it&#x27;s a must. Use it in conjunction with acne wash and some other products and you&#x27;re sure to see some good results. This makes it MUCH easier to wash my back.</li>
    <li> Bought a dozen &amp; sent them along. Nobody had one, never saw one before. Nice when someone can give a gift &amp; it is used!</li>
    <li> This one arrived pretty fast and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. The surface isn&#x27;t as rough as it looks but just enough to clean your back. I hope this one would last, though. I&#x27;m starting to like it too much.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I have very sensitive skin, so we both use Aquis Back Scrubbers to apply lotion to our backs, especially during the cold months.  It relieves the itching  &amp; irritation brought on by dry air, exercising, swimming, etc.  Using the Aquis Exfoliator relieves these problems which results in feelings of exhilaration, exquisiteness, exultation &amp; probably several other ex&#x27;s too numerous to mention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue &amp; Charlie Appleby</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Fast shipping and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Easy to use back scrubber!  No problem with hard-to-reach spots.  It&#x27;s great.  My husband uses it in conjunction with the back scrubbing loofah.  Nice smooth back now.</li>
    <li> I am all for a good back scrubber and this was NOT it for me. It is extremely long which is good in some cases, but I had to angle weird to get my upper back. I have used it three times; once by itself with just water, once with body wash, and once with an exfoliating wash. It kept getting stuck to my skin rather than breeze through. I have semi-oily skin on my back so maye that is the issue. I give it a two star for seemingly being decent quality, but it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> The Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber is well made and does the job it was made for. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Actually allows me to wash my back from stem to stern and I have a 50&amp;#34; chest! So I have a lot of back muscle to wash and these are cost effective enough that buying two or three at a clip is wise as eventually the moisture will rot the rope.....so you open a new one!!</li>
    <li> Amazon wants me to rate gifts, and items that I have not had time to test before I could comment on your product. I have found the back scrubber very nice to use, good length, just rough enough.</li>
    <li> This is the best back scrubber I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve used other scrubbers (both brush and exfoliating sponge/scrubber) that are on a stick and I&#x27;m never sure if I actually clean all of my back. However, with this one, it&#x27;s so easy to use - like drying off your back with a towel. I also really like the two handles and the fact that there is a soft cloth side and a side that is more for exfoliating. The best part, however, is the fact that you can toss it in the wash. I usually put it into a little mesh bag for washing intimates and it comes out fresh and clean. I&#x27;m guessing this will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I live in humid Houston and before this product, it was hard to adequately clean my back without having to dislocate my shoulder. With this product, I can get a good lather going easily, can reach ALL of my back, and feel unbelievably fresh after a shower. My back is starting to look smoother after 2 weeks with this great product AND its machine washable. Fantastic product - I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> How super especially when you can&#x27;t reach all of your back. Scrubber rinses and dries with out smelling which is a plus. Nice product would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest things that I&#x27;ve used for scrubbing my back. It cleans very well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that wants a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; back.</li>
    <li> Love it. Good exfoliation and plenty big. The handles are invaluable.</li>
    <li> Really like this. It scrubs my back without being overly rough. So much better than the &amp;#34;back scrubs&amp;#34;!!!! I finally found one that I really like.</li>
    <li> i got it to reach the hard to reach places and i am glad that i did buy it. it works great so far. my back feels so much better now using this product. no regrets buying it so far. it looks to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> Wanna tear up you back us this! Seriously I don&#x27;t use it every shower but once in a while this thing feels great and makes my feel like a new person.</li>
    <li> this thing is great. I have no idea what it&#x27;s made of, but I went by the reviews, and they are quite corre ct.</li>
    <li> My back has never been so clean.</li>
    <li> Works a described.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  I think it would be even better if it came with some type of handle length adjustment.  Our spare bedroom has a small shower stall and I&amp;#34;m required to open the shower door when using the scrubber to prevent the banging of elbows (probably operator error).</li>
    <li> If you use a long handled brush or a loofah on a stick, you will love one of these.  If you can use a bath towel to dry your back going side to side, then this is what you need to get the dead skin cells scrubbed off your back.  After using one of these, the loofah on a stick will go in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my friends.    As a person with a shoulder injury, it has been difficult for me to comb my hair and clean my back.  This product has alleviated at least one of those problems.</li>
    <li> I got this about two months ago to try out after reading that it has worked wonders on back acne, in conjunction with an acne bodywash (I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000Y038CS Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]), as I suffer from bad breakouts on my shoulders and blackheads along my back. I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;7\\&quot; with long arms, but still have trouble reaching parts of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN DETAIL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very long but its not very wide at all, making it hard to move across my back without it flopping over or scrunching up. It also is hard to move back and forth because it just doesn&#x27;t move across the skin very easily, you really have to pull and tug at it. Using it is a bit tricky until you find a technique that works for you, which is why I use it off and on instead of consistantly because I just don&#x27;t like the hassel of it all. It stores nicely though, just hang it off a shower caddy or even the shower head. Cleaning it is pretty easy too, just rinse off in the shower or wash it in the laundry, then let it hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating side is very rough on the skin, more so than what I was expecting, so the first few uses felt like I was just scratching and tearing up my skin but afterwords it left it beyond soft, smooth and clean feeling. After using it a few more times I got used to the feel of it so it didn&#x27;t hurt as much to use. I really like the way it exfoliates my skin though, so I wanted to use it across my whole body, not just my back. But because it is so long it is incredibly hard to use for the whole body (though it doesn&#x27;t get any stars taken off as its made specifically for the back not the whole body, just a bummer is all though). As for the soft material side I don&#x27;t use it because it feels almost exactly like a wet wash cloth, in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of wet wash cloth on my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for how its worked on my acne, I feel like it does help clear it up in conjunction with an acnebody wash better than the wash with a poof. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on acne alone with regular soap or other body washes though. But because the material is so rough on the skin it hurts when you rub the harsh exfoliating side against any zits or pimples that you might have, especially if they&#x27;re sore on their own (even being super careful around them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to someone looking for a good back scrubber (until I find something better) as it is very good at getting rid of dead skin and cleaning/polishing the new. Just be ready to learn how to use it though. If you are looking for a super hassel free back scrubber you might not want to try this. I think the exfoliating part of this is amazing, even if it is harsh on the skin the first couple of times. Leaves skin amazingly smooth and clean. It has helped me clear up some of my breakouts easier, but be ready for some super pain if you use it against a zit or pimple, especially if its sore. I don&#x27;t like the soft material side, as it feels just like a wash cloth. As for the design I think its an interesting new take on most back scrubbers I&#x27;ve seen and is easy to store but they need to make more size variety with this, I feel, as they only have two different sizes (a 10x34 and a handheld mitt type). I would love to see them come out with just the exfoliating side around some sort of sponge and maybe be able to attach it on a stick, just an idea. :)</li>
    <li> Although very well made, it didn&#x27;t work too well for me personally.  In use, it folded lengthwise making it more like&lt;br /&gt;a rope. Because you use your arms in a way similar to drying your back with a towel, I hit the side of the shower,&lt;br /&gt;so for me, it was awkward.  Maybe for others with a bigger shower, it would be fine, but I went back to the back brush!</li>
    <li> This scrubber has just the right amount of roughness. Your skin feels wonderful after using this product in the shower or bath. Scrubber is long enough so that is it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  It is great.</li>
    <li> When it comes to scrubbing your back in the shower not everyone has the long reach.  This product does the trick.  One side has a textured surface that really exfoliates your skin.  The other side feels like a normal wash cloth cleaning you perfectly.  The width is just right for a normal size back.  The length of the scrubber fits easily from hand-to-hand.  Recommend it highly !</li>
    <li> Wife gives it a thumbs up.  Better than a back brush.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews so I was a tad apprehensive but relieved once I got it. Works just fine for me and is well constructed. I have had several loofah back scrubbers before and the never lasted more than a few uses until it became useless. This solves the issues and shrubs your back well. Good value as well.</li>
    <li> Good product for under $9! I like the fact that it has 2 sides one soft one for exfoliating! I like the handles which makes it very easy to use and hang up when you are not using it. It lathers very well I would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber seems to be working well for my skin.  My big complaint is that it is a little difficult to use because the fabric twists a lot.  I do like the material of the fabric and that it is double sided for different uses.</li>
    <li> Great for getting the dead skin off my back.</li>
    <li> I really like this back scrubber.  I can put my body wash or sugar scrub on it and really do a good job exfoliating and getting the blood flowing!</li>
    <li> I bought this scrubber based on the reviews I read here on Amazon and I was not disappointed.  It it easy to use, has enough length, and does an excellent job of exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now.  It&#x27;s effective, and works much better than back-rubbing brushes.  I hang it up on the shower curtain rod, and it&#x27;s dry in time for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I have washed it once in the washer/dryer in the last 3 months, and it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
    <li> Too short for a person my size to be an effective back scrubber, but other than that it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to get every inch of your back.the exfoliators runs the whole length of the scrubber</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve went my whole life without one of these. considering how cheap this is, if your considering it, just go ahead and get it. it has really cleared my back up. in fact, i can&#x27;t remember the last time i had a breakout on my shoulders, which i used to get fairly frequently.also, it stops breakouts in spots that i had trouble reaching without the scrubber. it&#x27;s really a nice a convenience to not have to stretch and twist trying to wash my back.&lt;br /&gt;and i&#x27;ve had this now for about 2 months, and it feels just as good as new, and i definitely use it every day, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;lastly, let me say that the back scrubber just plain feels good. like getting a good all over back scratch. and leaves your back feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind I have ever purchased! I like you read the reviews and this is the first one I have written but had to on this product. Buy it!!</li>
    <li> Already left a review of this item. Love this item. Please don&#x27;t force your customers to write more than they want just to fill a word quota. It is very annoying.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and works as advertised.  I was just hoping for something a little more course for a deeper cleaning and exfoliating of the skin.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great, but the product isn&#x27;t really useable in a 30&amp;#34;x30&amp;#34; shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great in a bath tub tho.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. It takes a lot of soap to get it to be very effective, but it works fine.</li>
    <li> As advertised, it&#x27;s got a soft side and a scratchy side (the difference is greater when they&#x27;re wet).  Well made, works well.  Too early to tell how long it lasts, but it looks very good so far.</li>
    <li> i believe someone described the hard side as Velcro &amp; it is a soft kind Velcro-like material that will give your back a nice scrubbing when soaked up.. I don&#x27;t use this side on my face.. The other side if you want can be used for that.. It&#x27;s well made I think.. Kind of a strange looking creature hanging in my bathroom &amp; I like it.. I&#x27;m downsizing to eliminate waste.. I&#x27;m on a mission to decrease the amount of garbage one man uses .. It&#x27;s just me in this apartment .. One thing comes in &amp; one thing goes to recycle.. Save the turtles / whales do I sound crazy? My neighbor knows me &amp; she said she&#x27;s learned allot from me.. If you ever buy a six pack of anything/ that plastic ring thing that keeps the cans together.. You MUST cut that horrible plastic into smaller pieces because those plastic dingy things are the culprits of sea turtles ingesting and you&#x27;ll see the turtle with the plastic ring around its body not being able to grow like it should.. We&#x27;re in such a mess / sometimes I think it&#x27;s too late but I strive for the bees and the wonderful Monarch butterflies.. And NO I own no catz yet ?!?  Cheers and please recycle</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product I purchased for my Mom.  It made it much easier for her to bathe.  Comfortable and easy to hold on to.</li>
    <li> As a man who has relied on backscrubbers (handle and brush type) to clean my back, I was suspicious of this item from the start. However, all of my brushes lost their effectiveness (i.e. the stiffness of the brush fibers) over time and many simply fell apart. This is a simple item. The abrasive side of the cloth is surprisingly effective and robust. This is as good as any brush I&#x27;ve used for the back. Unfortunately, the rope handle broke at one end after the second use (4 stars instead of 5). I was able to feed the rope through the loop of cloth and tie it off to avoid the hassle of a return.</li>
    <li> The considerable length makes it easier to use, and the defoliating side may be better than a stiff-bristled back brush. Rinses easily, to remove soap and residue.</li>
    <li> I have a old Austrian back scrubber that is stilll good but is about 15 years old and I needed to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> For those of you not in the know, the heading for this review is a line from The Smiths&#x27; &#x27;Half a Person&#x27;, which always comes into my head, oddly enough, when in the shower. Hey, I do some of my best singing in the shower so why not? ... The Aquis is just &#x27;ok&#x27; in that it meets my requirements for a scrubber that won&#x27;t collect the scuzz and mold of a traditional brusher. But it is not flexible enough for this user, even after it gets soaked with soap and hot water. I also feel as if I&#x27;m pulling too much and torquing my body and arms to get the right angle. I&#x27;m sure the job is getting done, after all, my back certainly feels cleaner, less itchy during the day, most likely from the absence of dry skin and surface dirt. All told, I shall continue looking for an improvement but the Aquis will suffice as a stand-in until I find one.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice back scrubber. The exfoliation side is the perfect texture to scrub well without shredding skin, although you could if you press too hard. The soft side is good for rinsing. Strap is long enough to get around my fat body, and it rinses clean and dries well when hung up. The price is reasonable although the shipping costs could be lower. I would recommend this to others who have trouble reaching parts of their back with a regular scrub brush.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Appears to be durable.  Not too rough on the skin but cleans effectively.</li>
    <li> Works great, product was as described.</li>
    <li> It felt good but unfortunately the rope came off one end the third time I used it. I guess three uses is fair enough for under $10.</li>
    <li> I love this thing -it has a soft side and a scrubby side and its both as long and as wide as I could find useful, I am no pixie so I always worry that things will be too small.  I have some lower body flexibility issues so my intention on purchase was to use this as a bottom of the feet scrubber, but I find that I like it so well it has replaced my back scrubber as well. Good bye contortions! Some reviews have said the item fell apart.  The one I got was as sturdy and well constructed a thing as I could have imagined</li>
    <li> Use it on my back AND my arms AND my legs with Dove bar soap applied to it.  My skin is fair, and my dermatologist told me to exfoliate.  This is perfect.  Never, ever had problems with it twisting.</li>
    <li> This works great to get my back fresh and clean.  The two sides are great.  One for soft clean and one for exfoliating.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use as often since buying the brush above, but It does what it was designed to do. Wash your back.</li>
    <li> So cool!!!  Nice to have one of these hanging in the shower!!  Stick it in the washer when you do your towels and presto, just like new again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for your skin.  Next best thing if you don&#x27;t have someone to wash your back for you.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what you think it would do and does it well.    It&#x27;s simple, easy to use, low cost, and free shipping (when you order other things of course).      Really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this item very much. It is slightly on the coarser side and can be rough unless you like the feeling of having your back scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft side and a rough side depending on how much you need to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as difficult to use as others make it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;It starts to smell real bad. I have tried to rinse it as thoroughly as possible, rung it out, drying it outside of the bathroom, washing it, and there is nothing that can be done to prevent the incredibly strong stench of mildew that will over power the best air freshener on the market. This alone is enough to knock it down to a 1 star rating but like I stated I wanted to like it so I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I am considering purchasing several to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Good service, good product</li>
    <li> ....5 stars in the tub....or the shower. I really like this scrubber and will definitely buy another when the time comes. Just put a little soap on the slightly rough side and you&#x27;re ready to go. And don&#x27;t feel limited to using this scrubber only on your back...you can use it on your legs...or fold it around one hand and use it on the opposite arm...use it on your chest....get creative. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on the face....it&#x27;s a little too rough for that. Like any scrubber, I only use this one at most twice a week...not because this one has irritated my skin or anything, but I just think exfoliating more often would be a bit too harsh on the skin. I know some people recommend just using a long-handled brush as a back scrubber, but I don&#x27;t think bristles can compare to the material on the Aquis for getting that clean exfoliated feeling.</li>
    <li> first, i wet it.   then, i put body soap across it.   rub together, and voila! BUBBLES!    you can either hang it around your neck and hook your 4 fingers on both hands into each side and use gravity to help you go lower as you let go above and re-grab under/behind (which may require some shoulder/trunk/back flexibility, so please be careful!), OR you can hook one hand, then reach around your waist, to grab as if it was a loose belt, and hook your other fingers through, and work your way up. (i KNOW there&#x27;s a few other techniques but i really don&#x27;t know how to explain it. just pretend it&#x27;s a jacket or, actually, a towel with holes at the end!)     since it&#x27;s already lathered up, you don&#x27;t have to limit using it on just your back.. oh, and i LOVE the double-sided-ness with different textures!!    when i&#x27;m done, i squeeze any excess water out and then hang it over the bar part of my shower head to dry.</li>
    <li> See my review about the Aquis cloth. This works really well for me because of the type dry skin I have. My back is the worst, because I can&#x27;t reach it. I use the loofah-like side for scrubbing, and the cloth side for applying lotion. It&#x27;s long enough to do a good job.i&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Best product to use to clean my back.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND REALLY LIKES IT FOR HIS ITCHY BACK!</li>
    <li> I like Aquis products but had not seen this before. It seems to be good quality, like all their products. Perfect addition to my shower accessories.</li>
    <li> This is a good back washer, I only wish that it was a little wider.  I like that is has a exfoliating side and a wash cloth side.</li>
    <li> good quality product. i bought it to scrub my back - one rough side, one smooth side.  my only knock on the product is that it flips over pretty easily from the rough side to the smooth side when you&#x27;re scrubbing back &amp; forth. If you really want a good back scrubber a brush with a long handle is a better bet.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Has helped my dry skin, which is a nightmare to control.  Received quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, ripped after one wash</li>
    <li> This looked like a great idea but the one that I got had such a stiff backing on it that it was difficult to use.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Nice and long so you can actually use it. Strong too. Creates smooth clear skin with the right body scrub.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of a handled brush and I find that it is much easer to use than a brush and provides the same benefits. The scrubber is quite long, or maybe I have a small back? By which I assume this would be a good fit for just about anyone... large or small, as you don&#x27;t have to use the handles if it is too big.  One side is rough and the other is smooth, so it does take some practice to get the grip such that you are scrubbing with the side you want. It seems well constructed as well. Label says &amp;#34;made in Korea&amp;#34; just for informational purposes... I like to know where things are made.</li>
    <li> I wish the width on this scrubber was 2\\&quot; wider for more coverage, but it beats the back rubber handle scrubber.  This product is well suited for women who take care of their personal items.  For men, the stitching may not be tight enough for multiple use.  Thank you seller!</li>
    <li> this is ok for occasional use, but too much work for daily use.  For that I shower prefer a brush</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom. She&#x27;s old and has trouble washing her back. She has a brush and finds it way too heavy. This is lightweight enough to fling it over her shoulder and grasp it at the bottom. This is a good thing when you&#x27;re almost 80.</li>
    <li> The length is perfect making it easy to do your whole back.  It does have a rough and a smooth side but I wish it was a bit more coarse.  I had no problem keeping it from flipping over to the other side.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for one of these so I can scrub my upper back on my own in the shower... this one is just amazing! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is well made, a two-sided scrubber.  The &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side works great for exfoliating hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy a second one when this one ages.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who gives it a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;It can hang from the shower handle to dry.</li>
    <li> So far so good, however I am concerned that the rope might fall off after some time, since it does not seem to be sewn on that well.  It is abrasive enough to be exfoliating.</li>
    <li> The Aquis scrubber is the best on the market that I have been able to locate. The linen fabric is so much better to use than a loofah back scrubber ... I used to have a pair of linen gloves that I used for the same purpose but I accidentally left them behind in a hotel room. I looked &amp; looked for over 5 years to find a replacement, and I have finally found it with this linen back scrubber! In the past year, I had purchased two other back scrubbers - one from Amazon; both gave out on me within a few months. If this one falls apart, I will modify my ratings later on, but I do not think that will happen with this product because it is so well made!</li>
    <li> It was as I expected, easy to use, not too rough.  Like the third bowl of porridge,  this is &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product, a little narrow with a tendency to flip over, otherwise very happy.</li>
    <li> really nice, easy to use, and rinses easily.</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber!  The two handles are large and the length of the scrubbing pad is just right.</li>
    <li> A little body soap and away it goes.  A little hard to control when it gets wet it stretches and - for me - got out of control.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this back scrubber at all. It is too narrow, and it is too flimsy and wants to twist up all the time. This was a waste of money for me and I&#x27;m back to looking.</li>
    <li> This is an item that promises much more than it delivers. The scrubber is much too narrow. It will not stay on one side and frequently rolls or flips. It is a great concept but a fairly poor execution. If it were twice as wide it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Back brushes were always hard for me to use, always changing hands and positions and difficult to hold while trying to scrub back with any pressure. This is great, fling it over a shoulder or around your back and it is long enough to easily pull it back and forth.  It two surfaces give you either a wash cloth like soft scrub or a scotch pad like hard scrub..</li>
    <li> This back scrubber is one of the better ones that I have used. The only complaint I have is (minus one star) before I used it I reinforced the ends where the ropes are attached, it needs to be sewn better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple product that works really well.  It&#x27;s a good width and has a good length of rope handle on either side for easy use.</li>
    <li> This Back Scrubber does everything I expected when scrubbing my back in the shower. It reaches all the impossible to reach areas of my back &amp; it&#x27;s very easy to use...After I finish using it I rinse it, wring it out &amp; hang it up dry until my next shower...I love it &amp; my back loves too!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> See my review on the \\&quot;Swissco loofah &amp; terry\\&quot; backscrubber.  I bought both to compare after a long time of frustration wjth broad shoulders and long arms.  This one far exceeded expectations.  Really scrubs,great length, great contact all over.  The best one I&#x27;ve ever used .  I&#x27;m getting a spare and one for my sis.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating feeling with the Aquis. Much much better than the loofah based scrubber I bought at the same time to compare. Not even close. The Aquis offers consistent texture across the entire length. Feels great, great buy.</li>
    <li> A bit skeptical at first, but it works very well in cleaning that area I can no longer reach.  I&#x27;m talking about my back, folks!</li>
    <li> Feels good when used. Like you can actually feel the dead skin peel away. I tend to use it on my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of fun to use!</li>
    <li> Being a fan of other Aquis bath products, I gave this a try and love it. It&#x27;s thoughtful design does the job better than any other I&#x27;ve tried- the right width, the right length, handles are comfortable, and the dual textures will satisfy the sensitive or the bold.</li>
    <li> Love it...Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> 30 seconds in to the first use the strap/string broke on one side and doesn&#x27;t lather well at all so In the trash it went, yes Amazon you got me again. Complete GARBAGE!</li>
    <li> I figure this varies in intensity from item to item since the scrubby part looks like natural loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping it would be like dragging a running chainsaw or a pack of angry kittens across my back, but the one I got was really pretty tame. It&#x27;s good enough, I was just hoping for more scrubby action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely made, I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars for quality, but 3 stars for how gentle the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side is.</li>
    <li> Beats the old back brush, that&#x27;s for sure!  Remember it needs to be hung so that it can dry properly.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber more than a back bath brush, because back bath brushes, when soapy, become slippery, and are difficult to handle.  The Aquis Back Scrubber is more controllable.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It is very long. Longer than I wanted, but I will keep it.  If you are small in your back area, don&#x27;t both waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  Keep one in both showers.  Husband asked me to order one for him, too.</li>
    <li> Trying to replace a loofah back scrubber.  No comparison!  Cheap imatation and will not be recommended to anyone.  Still searching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 200#&lt;br /&gt;Too small and soft for me. In the trash after one week. I guess I have alligator skin.</li>
    <li> One of the few back-scrubbers I have purchased which is LONG!This one is very generous and very pleasant to use. It seems that all AQUIS products are very high quality, I have many at home and love all of them. This products is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I found a great back scrubber here! rough on one side and soft on the other easy to use and machine washable so it stays clean and like new. It really holds the shower gel too.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for my needs and very easy to use.  I would highly recomend it and not just your back.</li>
    <li> This scrubber works great!  It&#x27;s nice and abrasive, and plenty long.  The handles are nice, especially for hanging it in the shower for easy access.  Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I just got the back scrubber and so far I love it. It seems to be well made and time will tell how long it will last. It&#x27;s perfect for getting to those areas on the body that are hard to reach and even scrubbed my feet. I hope to get many months, or years, of use out of this before I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> It is wholly ineffective on my back - the middle (where the spine is) never gets scrubbed as well as I would like &amp; need (yes - even when bent over) - I&#x27;ve gone back to using brushes.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD FOR AN OLD SENIOR THAT CAN NOT GET TO THOSE SPOTS OF THE PAST.  TWO DIFFERENT SIDES WHICH WILL NOT DISAPPOINT THE USER.</li>
    <li> I was initially concerned about how well the ropes would hold up, but so far, so good!  It&#x27;s doing a very nice job.</li>
    <li> Works nice.. I&#x27;m a fairly big dude and it&#x27;s notice to have something I don&#x27;t have to contort to fit around my back and be able to hold with both hands.  It&#x27;s also very easy to rinse when you&#x27;re finished with it.</li>
    <li> Shorter and thinner than I had hoped for. Also overly scratchy. Not sure I get all the posiive reviews. Definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The scrubber is nice to look at. Easy to use and feels great. Not to rough.</li>
    <li> FAR better than a back brush - durable - To use this you have to have reasonable flexibility in your shoulders - But if you do, and you buy it - you won&#x27;t use a bath brush again..</li>
    <li> Plenty long.  The rough side is not really rough, but it is rough enough to do what I need.  Handy to use--can hang it up by one of the handles.</li>
    <li> This product is an actual Aquis scrubber, exactly as pictured. No complaints. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Does the job. However, the cloth handles broke fairly quick. Taking a look at it again, the handles are poorly stitched onto the main part. However, the scrubber works great.</li>
    <li> I love this scrubber, never thought it would make such a difference but it did. Try it, you would not regret it!</li>
    <li> Nice back scrubber.  Has soft side for sensitive skin.  Is long enough and wide enough to do a good job for me.</li>
    <li> For my son who can&#x27;t get enough back rubs and scratches. He likes it a lot for a soapy DIY back rub/massage right in the shower. Hang it after bathing and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love having this in the shower. The exfoliating side is not too rough, but still gets the skin very soft. It&#x27;s extra long too!&lt;br /&gt;Dries easily and very easy to keep clean. Just run a bar of soap up and down it first, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;Use it on back, arms, chest, and even legs.</li>
    <li> I had a different brand scrubber like this before, but one of the handles broke.  I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks now and seems to be holding up just fine.  Does it job well.</li>
    <li> When you first get married, making love and back scratches are a given. As you get older things change. I bought this whatever they call it for one purpose: to scratch my back whenever my back needs scratching. I can take care of this very well with this product. I have read some of the other reviews . . . trust me, this is well made . . . wet or dry. If you start to miss the back scratches, this one you&#x27;re gonna love.</li>
    <li> Has a nice coarseness for exfoliating.  the handles on each side are helpful and make it easy to use.  Would not recommend to use against face.</li>
    <li> Works great. Has a rough side and a smooth side. Rinses out well and looks like it should go through the wash OK.</li>
    <li> If you shop in the Big and Tall section you might wish this was a little longer, but it feels good and doesn&#x27;t soften up like a brush when wet.</li>
    <li> long enough for a tall person, works as described.</li>
    <li> *used it about 8 times in a 2 week period and the fabric backing has separated;&lt;br /&gt;*its not wide enough - its curve shape subjects to rolling</li>
    <li> I am using this for dry brushing my back and it works well. I thought it would be a little wider but it still works.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased one of these for me because I&#x27;m having an awful problem with dead skin on my back. This Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber is just the solution for hard to reach areas except for one thing...  being too soft, it rolls and twists so that the soft side is against my back - which does next-to-nothing for exfoliation.  If both sides were made of the Loofah material that might solve the problem; if the product were a bit stiffer so that it would not twist or roll, that could solve the problem too.  As it stands, I won&#x27;t be buying another of these; The Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber is a good concept that needs improvement. I&#x27;ll look for something better...</li>
    <li> Pros: The abrasive side is like Goldilock&#x27;s favorite porridge, not too abrasive and not too soft... just right. You can bunch it up into your hand like a washrag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Within a couple days of using this one of the handles pulled the stitching out, causing the handle to fall off. The scrubber tends to bunch up. Only one of the sides is rough, the other is soft cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thought: Do the cons outweigh the pros for this product? Not really. The handle that fell apart was the reason why the scrubber bunched together so holding the scrubber firming in my hand allows me to prevent the bunching.</li>
    <li> Nice to reach the back.  I just rub my exfoliating soup into the pad with water.  It&#x27;s really refreshing.  So far I don&#x27;t have an itchy back like I used to get.</li>
    <li> There are better options. Feels flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t provide the scrub I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver for anyone who&#x27;s ever experienced a tear in their rotator cuff or any shoulder related injuries. I&#x27;ve always struggled with reaching certain parts of my back until I bought this. Works better than all the brushes I&#x27;ve used and seems like it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
    <li> It is a great scrubber. At first It is very rough on your back but it feels great. Flip it to the other side to soften when finished. I have very itchy skin from allergies and not even medication and lotions help so I use these types of back scrubbers. This one is rougher than the other one that I usually use but it did the job and my back didn&#x27;t itch for a longer period of time. So I am very happy with it and I would tell my friends to order it.</li>
    <li> The soft / course dual textures on each side is a nice feature. The scrubber works as intended and is easy to rinse and dry. Find it much easier to use and maintain than the long handle and brush style scrubber it is replacing.</li>
    <li> Works very well and deserves 4 1/2 stars. I use it to scratch my back and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it was a little more &amp;#34;scratchier&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is one of those rare products that far exceeded my expectations. It is literally the best body scrubbing implement I have ever used. My back has never felt so clean. It took a couple showers to get the hang of, but the learning curve is well worth it. Buy this scrubber. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> What a product!  I am a big man (over 350 lbs. and 6 foot 3 inches tall with plenty of area to cover) and this scrubber/scratcher works as described.</li>
    <li> not wide enough for my taste.</li>
    <li> Benn using this about two weeks.  Cleans my back well.</li>
    <li> Because it is difficult to use. Hard to lather. I don&#x27;t feel it is effective. I am a tall man so I need it longer and wider.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a back scrubber...can&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;, but I do like it.  I&#x27;ve had this one for over a year and it continues to provide great cleaning with a variety of soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way it could be better is if it were 8 inches longer for us broad-chested guys who have wide shoulders to more easily pull it back and forth across our backs.</li>
    <li> This is teh best back-washing solution I have ever found - covers everywhere. Downside is that it doesn&#x27;t scratch well, but it soaps stuff up awesomely.</li>
    <li> I like this much better than my loofah back scrubber.....</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband, but I get to use it too.  It&#x27;s just as described, good quality &amp; durable.  One side is soft &amp; the other exfoliates, great for both of us.  I really like that it&#x27;s machine washable, just wash with the rest of the towels and let air dry.  We keep it hanging on a hook in the shower.  A great purchase!</li>
    <li> Didnt care for this product......very narrow much more so than the way it looks in the pic. You also need to be a contorsionist (hope I spelled that right) to use it.</li>
    <li> best and easiest way to wash your back.  Make sure to wash it with your whites every few weeks or it will pick up an odor.</li>
    <li> Be careful of scammers. I got some cheap knockoff mailed to me, and got it refunded immediately. Looked nothing like the picture. Had no tags. Looked like a towel with a loofah attached to it...</li>
    <li> Actually I tried to cancel this order, but it was not working. They still shipped them. When I received them, I though they look good, so I decided to keep them.</li>
    <li> I recently received this item and it seems top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rope straps at the ends are stitched into the fabric so I don&#x27;t imagine they will come loose any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;This material appears to be pretty tough so I don&#x27;t imagine it will stretch or loose shape.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and the dimensions are about what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Very scratchy material so scrubbing is a quick process - unlike the loofahs purchased at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dull grey with tan borders... which might be an issue with people who have a high priority for decoration in their showers. I am using this back scrubber as a back scrubber, so it works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I love it, my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Rope handle pulled apart before I could even stretch it behind my back the first time I used it... Nice material, poorly sowed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for back and shoulders and I use it for my legs too.  The rough side has just the right amount of grit to do the job without feeling like a belt sander.  One small soaping goes a long way so it&#x27;s probably saving me at least $3.00 a year!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrubber has helped my itchy back enormously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip:  One may imagine using this from side to side but it works best for me to go over one shoulder and then go from the opposite hip.  To get the middle extra well, just hunch over slightly to expand or round out your back.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is great!  Comfortable and it works well.  The only problem was one of the handles broke within a week of owning it, so we had to return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> back scrubber, to get rid of the nasty back dirt. NASTY BACK DIRT</li>
    <li> Material is OK, one of the rope handles broke on the first tug (see other reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels good and sudses well, broken handle disappointing.</li>
    <li> I received it on Tuesday, 5/14/14.  I have been looking for this item for so long.  It was perfect.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, a good stiff long handled brush is better.  It is a bit too long for me but I am a pretty small woman.</li>
    <li> 2nd On.  Bought me one a month or so ago.  Husband really liked so we bought him one.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for some time and find that it is holding up well.  It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Good product. For those who have difficulty in reaching behind them this product makes it easier. Just the right length.</li>
    <li> tried rubber one gave it away! and the supposedly &amp;#34;Better Back Scruber&amp;#34; total piece of ----!THIS ONE WORKS ONE SIDE ROUGH OTHER SIDE SOFT HAVE BEEN USING FOR OVER A YEAR!</li>
    <li> I use it every night and it&#x27;s still in one piece.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to clean.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more then that.</li>
    <li> This thing is really a pain to use.  It looks all easy and cool at first, but when you actually get in the shower, it&#x27;s a bit challenging.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it&#x27;s just hanging in my shower now.</li>
    <li> The very best exfoliating back scrubber I have ever used. I have bought a number of extras to share with family members. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Love this! Ive had it for over a year and its still great. I get grossed out by loofahs and things like that since it stays in the bathroom and are usually prone to mold because of the moisture. Not so with this one. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good buy. Hasn&#x27;t molded in the several months I have had it.</li>
    <li> This thing feels really good to use. I have rotator cuff issues in my shoulders and back brushes are hard for me to use. But this scrubber is long enough that I can give my whole back a good scrub without hurting my shoulders. I really like that it has a smoother side and a coarser &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; side.</li>
    <li> I think it will stop the breakouts.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  I needed a bit of luxury and this was one of the items in my arsenal which has become a must have.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence with this back scrubber because I&#x27;m use to the brush on the stick.  I didn&#x27;t regret this purchase for a second.  Lather up and go to town with it.  I use it on the back of my legs as well.  It suds up quite nicely and you feel refreshed when done. I didn&#x27;t find it grating on my skin at all.  Smart purchase.</li>
    <li> Soft enough on skin, yet coarse enough to do the job of encouraging dead cells to be lightly scrubbed off your body.  Thin enough to dry better than sponges or more natural thicker varieties that tend to mold.  High quality; lasts a long time when hung to dry between shower times.</li>
    <li> I expected something wider, and something that had substantial difference between front and back sides.  Neither expectation was met.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit think, a few inches wide, but it does it job holding the soap and is easy enough to run along the back. It&#x27;s more then long enough so you don&#x27;t feel to hard pressed to use it but if you have never used one before it does take some getting used to to use right, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Has held up to daily use for 6 months.  Has a soft side and rough, which feels great on my back.</li>
    <li> I could feel the difference on my husband&#x27;s blackhead-filled back after just one use.  It was much smoother and softer, with fewer blackheads.  We use it with a salycilic body wash, and scrub acne-prone chest and back.</li>
    <li> Great! No more hurt shoulders or twisted arms trying to clean my own back! Plus the exfoliating side really made it smooth. 😊</li>
    <li> Great product.  Texture just right.  I spent 5 years in Japan where skin defoliation is a part of the daily bath.  For those worried about a smell building up, know that a good machine wash is not likely to work after time.  Just like athletic wear, micro deposits of skin are absorbed into the material and will not wash out.  As soon as this happens, bacteria forms.  Cure:  first, try soaking in baking soda for 1/2 hour before washing.  When that no longer works, soak in 5% solution of white vinegar (very cheap at Costco) for 30 min.  That always works for me.  But if that does not work, purchase Winn.  My better athletic wear I buy with real silver threading.  The silver nitrate kills the bacteria. Otherwise, a 30 min vinegar soaking after each use should prevent the inevitable bacteria buildup.</li>
    <li> It is nice and long and works very well.  I am not as flexible as I used to be, so this was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> My first time with an exfoliating scrubber, and I have to say...why have I never had one before?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my body, it makes my skin so smooth and nice. This is a must have for anyone who is serious about skin care.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is a cheap knockoff. Just compare the stitching on the handles between photo1 (the knockoff) and photo 2 (the real thing). The real aquis has a lot more stitches, which is important in preventing the handles from ripping off during normal usage. My cheap knockoff fell apart after 1 month.</li>
    <li> durable product.  a little abrasive at first but softens up after use.  length is good.  yes i would recomend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Have loved this back scrubber from day one---it hangs in the shower and drys out quickly between uses which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend!! Prompt delivery too!!</li>
    <li> there are other cheaper alternatives out there that works</li>
    <li> It works well but doesn&#x27;t absorb the soap as well as I would like, could be thicker.</li>
    <li> it works great for washing my hairy back , it is hard to wash otherwise and it helps to reduce itching</li>
    <li> I really like this unit. Showering is no longer a problem in regards to my Arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, and I look forward to future sales.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a variety of &#x27;back scrubber&#x27;s before and always struggled with reaching &#x27;that spot that really needs work&#x27;.  This is absolutely perfect!  I use it not only on my back, but also my arms and legs to exfoliate (I like the more textured side).  Hang it to dry in the shower and ready for the next day.</li>
    <li> With a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; shoulder, this is absolutely WONDERFUL.  Long enough to make reaching for it pleasant instead of painful in that shoulder.  Would buy another for sure.</li>
    <li> oooooh sexy, clean back</li>
    <li> I got this back scrubber for my mom and she loves it. It looks nice and does the job well. This scrubber would make a wonderful gift for an older person, who cannot reach some places on the back that have to be cleaned.</li>
    <li> Essential if you are tall.  I am 6&#x27;4\\&quot; and can never find a back scrubber with a handle long enough, or easy to use, that reaches all of my back.  This does easily.</li>
    <li> Great back scrubbers.</li>
    <li> I would write a review of the product, but wasn&#x27;t able to use it since both the handles popped off the first time I went to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this back scrubber. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s held up beautifully. No complaints at all. It&#x27;s got a smooth side and a rough side. If I&#x27;m feeling ambitious I use the rough side to scrub all over and I get out feeling super clean. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> super- use in the shower or dry to get the itchiest of spots!!!!</li>
    <li> The two sides difffer.  One is rougher than the other, so it works on many areas of the body.  The flatness means the scrubber hugs your back as you zigzag it downward.</li>
    <li> This handy little back scrubber is like a spa treatment on the tightest budget ever.  One side is very gentle, and the other is more stimulating and exfoliating.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
    <li> This may work for some people but not for me. I much prefer the brush type of back scrubber.</li>
    <li> One side is more rough than the other. Works great!</li>
    <li> This back scrubber works great.  It is very durable.  I need to exfoliate frequently and this does the job.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, don&#x27;t really do much in the way of skin care, but I really like this thing. I had been using those body scrubber things that Axe and Dove make, but they&#x27;d degrade after a few months, so I got this and I&#x27;m very glad I did. I don&#x27;t use the exfoliating side very often because when I did it was making my back all dry, but the other side is soft like a washcloth. The advantage of this over a washcloth is that it&#x27;s larger and so it&#x27;s easier to get your back, and I think easier overall to use. I use it with liquid body wash and it performs like a champ. You can fold it to make it whatever size you want, and then when you&#x27;re done, rinse it out and hang it to dry. Simple and useful.</li>
    <li> This backscrubber is not too aggressive &amp; may even be too tame for some. It is just long enough for me, which means it may be too short for really big people. The handles are sturdy and I like the feel of the two sided (rough, smooth) material on my skin. I have deducted 1 star because this thing does not create, hold or distribute a lather, which has led to a lot of wasted soap.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace a natural sisal scrubber I lost on a trip.  This was a terrible disappointment.  It&#x27;s too short to use comfortably, it&#x27;s too weak to be effective and I find it totally useless.  Needless to say I&#x27;m wary of purchasing products like this in the future based on a picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my esthetician to help clean my back and prevent breakouts. I have been using it for over two months with great results. I treated the scrubber with tea tree oil to prevent it from collecting bacteria or mold and store outside my shower, so that it fully dries between uses. I use a liquid bath gel, rub it into a lather in my hands and then scrub my back. I have noticed a serious improvement.</li>
    <li> Havent try it yet, will wait and see. But it looks good for washing back thoroughly. Better then using the brush.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of people who complained that the handles of this back scrubber fell apart.  This back scrubber is so long and has such an amazingly perfect feel for exfoliating your skin, just grab the ends of each and don&#x27;t use the handles! It&#x27;s that good. Rough on one side, softer on the other.  I tried all the bath stores in the malls, stand alone stores, trust me-this one is the best.  If it wears out, I&#x27;ll buy 5 more!</li>
    <li> It worked nicely but after a while it started to have that musty smell even though I would hang it to dry properly.  Even after machine washing it, the smell would come back right away.  Too bad because I liked it.  But this smell thing was NOT a problem for quite a long time.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> This works great to wash your back, easy and convenient to use, but is too soft and gentle to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> For all of us who want that uniform scrub on our backs which a brush just doesn&#x27;t provide.  A month in it is holding up fine and seems to have lost none of its scrub. The handles haven&#x27;t fallen off either which is a concern I had from my last scrub. Happy purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> garbage through it out.</li>
    <li> Ordered and no doubt this is counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on the flash sale but believe I was charged the daily price. There was no packing slip in my order so I have nothing to go on.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Good overall length.love the dual scrubbing surface.</li>
    <li> The handle came apart the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I&#x27;ve had trouble areas with acne and oily skin on my back, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try when I saw it on sale one day.  I am unbelievably glad I did.  It&#x27;s one of the best little shower items I&#x27;ve ever owned - not that there&#x27;s lots of competition as I&#x27;m usually just a bar of soap, lather and rinse kind of guy, but this revolutionized my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to scrub my back, and also the undersides of my feet as they get pretty grungy and callused.  This works great on both areas.  The loafa side scrubs it all down and the soft reverse side is good for just polishing my back - which sounds weird, I know, but it really makes it feel awesome and so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not lying, this is one of my favorite purchases in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative I could give was that it took some time to figure the best way to use it, and at first it would often flip from smooth to scrubby side by accident.  But once I figured out the right approach, it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the reviews concerning a cheap knock-off.  I don&#x27;t honestly know if mine is one or not, as I really didn&#x27;t buy for a name or even know specifically what I was getting.  But I can say mine seems good quality, has held up over 4 months so far with no wear, the rope handles are solid and, again, show no signs of wear or tearing; and the thing plain works, with bars of soap, body wash, or lotion.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know these existed, I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my back with a loofa on a stick for years, and hated it! Now I can scrub my own back and exfoliate without harsh chemicals. After using it for a month it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever owned and what a deal. Nice and soft on one side and a nice scrub surface on the other. Made of great quality and should last for years. Fast service and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I think the back scrubber is everything that was described in the article and more, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a long handle brush for my back, but couldn&#x27;t find one with a long enough handle. This product is plenty long and works better than a brush could.</li>
    <li> Feels great, it is well made and long enough to reach around you.</li>
    <li> The only old-fashioned back scrubber that works...!</li>
    <li> I like this much more than the back brush that I have been using. The rough side feels great and helps get rid of the flaky dead skin. Wish I had bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> This thing is simply awesome. Finally a product that allows me to keep my back clean. I really like this product it works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Well little bit skeptic about the use of this. I am a male and I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work as a male product. I can honestly say this is a great product and I wish to see more products for men. So keep up the good work an I looked in the future for more products.</li>
    <li> It works for what it is intended to.  I wanted to be able to scrub my back a bit more, and I am not that flexible to do it myself.  With a handle on either side, it is not difficult at all to clean back and forth across your back.  And it is easy to hang up to dry thanks to those handles.</li>
    <li> Have used it only once, but am looking forward to a long relationship with this gadget.  For the first time - after countless trials with a variety of back scratchers, loofah sponges, and the like - I was able to exfoliate and clean my entire back, comfortably, quickly, efficiently.  I&#x27;ll keep buying these gizmos for as long as they&#x27;re available (or I am.)</li>
    <li> I was worried if &amp;#34;Aquis&amp;#34; was long enough to easily be able to scrub my back. It is. Not too soft texture.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Far more versatile than the handled brushes I&#x27;ve tried. My only real complaint is that, if I try to hold it by the handles (instead of the end of the cloth), it twists up as I use it and I lose the scrubby surface. Minor complaint though and likely won&#x27;t even give some people any issue.</li>
    <li> works great not hard on the skin, arrived on time very happy</li>
    <li> I have a hard time reaching the middle of my back like most people and this thing works flawlessly!</li>
    <li> This exfoliating back scrubber does exactly what it is meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides eliminating the possibility of dislocating my shoulders while trying to scrub my back with a traditional cloth, this product has both a rough and smooth side. I have used the rough side almost exclusively as I enjoy how smooth my back feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the scrubber does get twisted when I scrub my back. This is expected and requires a minor readjustment before scrubbing can commence once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product for the price. Save your shoulders and clean your back - you (and your clean back) won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent shower back scrubber for the price</li>
    <li> Great for back cleaning and also for smoothing out rough callus on heals or elbows. (or wherever else :)</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It seemed to be quite good but it didn&#x27;t take long for my back to break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> very good product, I&#x27;m a repeat purchaser</li>
    <li> This back scrubber is excellent.  I hade tried many different back scrubbers over the years, and this one is by far the best I have ever used.  I am thinking of ordering extras.</li>
    <li> It was great being able to scrub my back effortlessly... until one of the handles that&#x27;s sewn onto the main part broke off. This was during the 5th use. I&#x27;m guessing the thread connecting the handle to the main body became loose somewhere and it unstrung. That says a lot about how this product isn&#x27;t very built well, seeing as how it fell apart when I wasn&#x27;t even using all that much pressure.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this scrubber. i plan to buy another just to have and travel with. there&#x27;s a soft side for light washing and a rougher side for exfoliating. definitely worth the buy for clearing body acne through exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This scrubber has a soft side and a rough side. The rough side is perfect for cleansing my back and I have noticed far fewer skin problems since I could use this every day.  The soft side is perfect for cleaning &amp;#34;more sensitive&amp;#34; areas that are a bit out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be of very high quality and the rope handles are totally secure - none of the problems that a couple of users reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We all know it&#x27;s very hard to be able to scrub your own back. Sure, we can get the back shoulders and some of the sides and maybe some of the lower back. But that whole middle part ends up going untouched resulting in dirty or oily skin, even after showering. This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s sturdy, easy to use, and best of all, it works! Just using it for a short time, my back is clearer, clean, and exfoliated leading to less/no white/black heads or any issues at all. This is such a great product that is made extremely well for a great price. HIGHLY rcommended!</li>
    <li> My days of using an old traditional back scrubber are over. This baby is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a wand type back scrubber this one allows you to put good pressure anywhere on your back without dislocating your shoulder. It takes very little soap to work up a good lather versus the wand type too. Plus it has a soft side and more aggressive rough side, for exfoliating I suppose, all I know is it feels good getting a good back scratch job while getting clean at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are using it to clean other parts of their bod, not sure why, but for cleaning your back, this scrubber can&#x27;t be beat in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone frustrated with the old style back scrubber - looks no further. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Great, I purchased this for my husband who had tiny pimples on his back. Using this has made a huge difference. His skin glows again.</li>
    <li> For me it was a little too rough.  I like to use my loofah&#x27;s on legs, arms, et. as well as my back.  Might be just my personal preference.</li>
    <li> This is a good exfoliating back scrubber to get to those hard to reach areas on the back. I breakout on my body so I needed something to help me scrub the areas I couldn&#x27;t reach. This back scrubber could be wider but overall it&#x27;s easy to use and the handles are helpful. One side is for regular washing and is softer than the reverse side which is coarser and is better at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> It has held up well I makes my back squekey clean.</li>
    <li> Worth the purchase. After using it one time, I can immediately feel a difference between showering with the back scrubber and showering without it. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends and family members cuz life is too short to not feel good and this scrubber gives a good back massage too.</li>
    <li> Rope handles are just barely tacked on.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I am currently using this to speed up the process of getting an even skin tone for my psoriasis. It is really great product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a variety of opinions on this back scrubber, and decided I&#x27;d like to see for myself. The soft side doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, but I love the exfoliating side. I get the scrubber wet, add soap and suds it up. The scrubber is perfect in width, and the handles make it very easy to wash my back.  I also use it to wash my feet and it feels so good. If you have ultra-sensitive skin it may be too rough for you, but for me, it just feels good. I&#x27;ll buy another one if this one ever wears out.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these and will continue to do so. It makes exfoliating your back a breeze and lasts quite a while before you need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Better than expected - Really like that one side is soft &amp; other side rough. (My son loves rough side as a back scratch-er when dry). Plenty long enough also! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased because due to failed back surgeries, I have a hard time reaching certain areas of my body. The rougher side of the Scrubber is great on the back, and even works on the calluses of the feet when I use it while sitting on a chair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoother side accomplishes what I REALLY bought this item for: cleaning the area the toilet paper doesn&#x27;t quite get clean enough.  Soaping up the smooth side and using a back and forth motion while placing the Scrubber between my legs cleans that area PERFECTLY.  Then rinsing the Scrubber thoroughly, then soaping and rinsing again gets it nice and clean for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several so-called &amp;#34;Butt scrubbers&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Hiney Cleaners&amp;#34;, all of which had plastic handles supporting some sort of cleaning material.  These items were cheaply made, and every one I bought was broken after one or two uses. The Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber accomplishes the task perfectly, and more than likely will not break or tear apart for quite some time if I take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one as a gift for my brother and his wife.</li>
    <li> Perfect easy to use back scrubber.</li>
    <li> it works great not to rough and feels great and can reach the middle of my back</li>
    <li> Great shower back scrubber.  I like the combination of the rough side and smoother side, and it&#x27;s comfortable length.</li>
    <li> No more dead skin on my back. No more itchy back too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so well made that I feel like I can exfoliate a Rhino with it and turn it into a unicorn.</li>
    <li> Awkward to use. Flips from side to side. I bought four and gave three as gifts. I should have one one first.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating side of the back scrubber is just right.  It is not too rough so it doesn&#x27;t cause pain and it is not so soft that you don&#x27;t get the scrubbing sensation.  I think it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Good for back scrubbing and exfoliation. I found it to be a bit cumbersome in my small shower. I would suggest it for men thst have issues with clogged pores or acne on their back. My teens love it</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my brother.  He really likes it.  He likes it better than the back brush.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is amazing! I love to feel clean and I like rough scrubbers, I have been looking for a replacement for like 4 months for the one I was using. Every single one I found at the local stores were too freaking soft, it felt like I was cleaning myself with nothing! Until I got this scrubber. It was like my last hope lol. It has one rough side and one soft side. It does get rid of all those dead skin cells and my wife loves the feeling if my soft skin after a shower ;D. Will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Very good quality and very easy to use. It is very effective and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic. It&#x27;s not rocket science to get it to work right, not sure why people are having trouble. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 86 year old grandmother who had recently mentioned she could no longer reach well enough to scrub her back. I purchased a plethora of back scrubbing items and had them shipped to her door. This one hit the top of her list. It was long enough she could use it with ease (she&#x27;s a bit hunched over and with her age has limited range of movement). Will order it again for her and myself.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to use due to overall length. Smooth and course sides are good for applying soap to, and exfoliating dead skin from hard to reach places. Handles make for easy hanging. Also, excellent price.</li>
    <li> This product is just fantastic! Not so rough as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Loofah that can hurt on sensitive skin. Leathers very well. My back loves the harder side and the rest of my body is spoiled with the softer side.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would be way more rough. I am not getting the scratch I was looking for.</li>
    <li> works pretty well, I get dry skin on my backside and this helps wipe it all out</li>
    <li> This is the best scrubber. I have been using them for years. Finally replacing one from two years ago.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an &#x27;ok&#x27; product. Yes it&#x27;s long, and yes it has handles to help reach your back. What I don&#x27;t like is that one &#x27;side&#x27; isn&#x27;t rough. Just the middle part of one side has part of a loofah in it that&#x27;s about 12&amp;#34;, the rest of it on that side and the other side are a terry cloth material that as we all know is soft!  It was my understanding from the description (maybe I missed part of it?), and other reviews that one whole side was rough, and it is not. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy this again - I&#x27;m happy with the extra long loofah&#x27;s that I get at walgreens or Walmart!</li>
    <li> I received this product recently &amp; it&#x27;s the BEST back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever used. A few reviewers complained that, due to its length, the scrubber flips sides. There are rope handles but one may hold the product anywhere &amp; &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; the length accordingly. If this is followed, the scrubber will not flip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 3 years now.  Looking to buy another one.  These are great!</li>
    <li> Good texture and material. This thing is fun to use and does its job well. Works fine on legs and neck too. I feel like im spongebob. It could be a bit wider though as it tends to flip occasionally.</li>
    <li> For the price it is pretty decent.  It has a rougher side and softer side so you can choose which one you like.  It can also double as a loofah if needed.  My one complaint is tend to get twisted up a bit when using it to scrub my back but maybe I&#x27;m just not fully practiced yet.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t imagine the exfoliating side of this to be of any use, but it actually does a good job.  And it&#x27;s long enough to wrap around my whole back comfortably.  The soft side just soft - nothing special.  But the scrubby side is great.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating back scrubber works better than I had expected. One side of the scrubber has a mildly abrasive coating that works VERY well. The harder you pull it across your back, the more it exfoliates. I have to say, it&#x27;s better than my old sisal-type back scrubber that I replaced it with. Nice to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve bought.  The first one lasted well over a year, and this one works just as well.  If you want to really scrub your back, it just works.</li>
    <li> Bought the Aquis and the Dual Sided Back Scrubber.  I use the Dual Sided Scrubber and he likes the Aquis better because it is longer and he can reach his entire back area. He likes it very much, does a great job, dries easily, easy to keep clean. His only complaint is that it is a bit narrow for his torso. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating.   I&#x27;ve tried both and like both equally.</li>
    <li> I like the rough surface of this product. I sometimes develop a itchy back and/or develop acne on my back etc. due intense workouts during the week. The rough surface along with some apple cider vinegar helps alleviate these issues. At least for me, it does. On the other hand, if your skin will not tolerate its rough surface, then I would not recommend this product. Even with its rough surface, I rate it a 4.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this, but I loathe back brushes because they are hard to clean and hard to use for me.  I experience light acne on my back most of my life due to sweat, etc.  This scrubber has eliminated all of those issues completely for me!  I don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side and only use the rougher side of this and I love it.  It is not too rough for my skin (somewhat fair skinned), it rinses out thoroughly (and you can toss it in the washer for a good cleaning once in awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is just a little too short for me as I have long arms... but it is not enough of an inconvenience to make it uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this great product!</li>
    <li> needed something to wash my back, did not desire a brush and this strip was ideal. There is a rough side and a smooth side so you can get just the right feeling while cleaning your back.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is always complaining that he can&#x27;t reach his back when he showers because of his flexibility (he always make me help him). He absolutely loves his gift! He also likes the fact that it exfoliates his skin as he has acne sometimes. I would easily use it too but I don&#x27;t need it because I am flexible.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product because I thought that it would be similar to a product that I had purchased a couple of years ago. It was not nearly as good for about the same price. It was too soft, &amp; very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price (under $10) for a simple solution to exfoliating your back.  I only use mine dry and then throw it into the weekend laundry with my pj&#x27;s.  It folds down to the size of a large washcloth so  it easily fits into a carry-on bag.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I had some doubt about this back scrubber, but I purchased it anyway. As far as doing its job, it does great. It puffs up after it is used and really scrubs good. But each time I used it (maybe 5 times) I heard a pop, like a stitch popping. Now after only a few times using it one handle is broken! Maybe I can repair it, but the handles are the weak point for this scrubber.</li>
    <li> This seller continues to advertise the &#x27;Aquis&#x27; back exfoliating scrubber, when in fact, the product I just received was a cheap white label (literally a white label, with no manufacturer name or identifying company name or logo) being passed off as the real item.  The &#x27;loofah-like surface&#x27; is a cheap, thin layer of cellulose sewn in to a flimsy wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already reported it to Amazon, as others have done. If you want an Aquis product, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> So much better than a regular loofa - good seller, fast shipping.  Like the fact it can be laundered.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating side feels good on my back.  The long length takes a couple showers to get used to, just trying to figure out how best to physically handle it.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator. The cloth is just rough enough to feel like you are getting a good refreshing clean without scratching. I can use this everyday with or without soap and it has never irritated my skin. Since I replaced my loofa with this, I have gotten smoother skin after shaving and less irritation. Its easy to fold and use all over, as well as using the length and handles to scrub your back. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I want to like this.  And when I get it in the right spot, it&#x27;s great.  However, it&#x27;s hard to hold it there because it flips on itself.  And tough to put soap or exfoliator products (beaded) on it...they slide right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with a back brush.  However, my one daughter seems to do fine with it.</li>
    <li> the best one if you like this type of back scrubbers..Read other reviews, they do a good job at explaining the item.  The courser side is very exfolliating.  A LOT more than you would expect from these types of back scrubbers.</li>
    <li> great product except it should be a little longer. Made nicely .  If it had longer handles it would definately be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love it! It covers all areas i need scrubbing. The brush i was using never quit got all the spots. The skin on my back never felt so good!</li>
    <li> after my minor shoulder injury, i found it hard to reach everyplace on my back while showering. this helps for washing using the rough side. i sometimes use the &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; side to apply lotion to my back after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;this would not be great if you are looking for a loofah/rough brush type of exfoliation; it is simply not &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have had none of the issues i have read about in these reviews as to rope handles breaking, or becoming &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; or whatnot. i use, rinse in clear water, and hang just like any washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;it does tend to twist until you figure out what way of holding the handles works for you.&lt;br /&gt;i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap and effective back scrubber.  It works well, with a rough scrubbing side, and a softer smoother side.  It is also very durable.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber - love that it can be thrown in washer!</li>
    <li> Works very well, feels great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love and recomend it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t run it through washer yet, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a wonderful skin brush, but when I&#x27;ve tried to use it on my back in the shower, the head comes right off the handle.  The head alone is great for skin brushing on legs and arms -- not so good for back scrubbing!  So this exfoliating back scrubber is exactly what I need to get the old skin off the back and stop the interminable itching from dry winter skin.  Great product that I&#x27;m happy to recommend to others who&#x27;d like to get a smooth, itch-free, back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> Even good for back scratching when not in shower.</li>
    <li> Posted on behalf of the wife who purchased and uses this. She loves it. She has mentioned to me more than once how well it works and how happy she is to have bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and does the job of washing my back where I cannot reach. It&#x27;s easier to use than a back brush which I find awkward to reach my back. There are cheaper products like this one out there, and I&#x27;ve used them, but I really like this one best, and it seems very well made.  One side is rougher than the other so I can choose if I want deeper scrubbing, or gently washing. If you want to save money the cheaper ones will work, but be advised the rope handles on those  will sometimes break loose.</li>
    <li> Great quality and perfect length.  Perfect body scrub especially for the back and hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Everyone buy this it really works and its great for single, seniors and it does the job and is easy to keep clean...</li>
    <li> Hangs in the shower, put a dab of soap and start scrubbing the back. My back has stayed clearer and cleaner since using this over my old scrubber.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do: help able-bodied people get at those hard-to reach regions of the back.&lt;br /&gt;I do admit that I felt a whole lot better physically after using the scrub side on my legs and feet as well.  Felt a lot cleaner too.&lt;br /&gt;The only CON that I can give it is that it may not be suitable for a tiny shower space; unless you are limber.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am glad I bought some extras!!!</li>
    <li> Spa products can be found everywhere. This back scrubber is durable and feels wonderful on the back, legs, and the bottoms of the feet. Having a handle to grab makes all the difference in the world. Now we can scratch our own back, without the help of long fingernails or wooden spoons. The price was right and this product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great tool! My back has never felt so clean and smooth. It&#x27;s simple to use and plenty long.</li>
    <li> Well this was great.. UNTIL the rope handle pulled out of the main strip section, on one end, less than 6 weeks after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this lasted until just after the return policy date, so I am unable to return to the vendor/manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating as ONE STAR due to piss poor product durability and quality.  Otherwise, until this happened today I would say this was definitely a 4 star item.  Its a shame the product quality is so poor.</li>
    <li> The cords really help me get anywhere on my back. The exfoliating surface is perfectly scratchy.</li>
    <li> Keeping this short, but the rough side is a great exfoliator and the smooth side is better for sensitive areas like your face.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. It really cleared up my back-acne!</li>
    <li> Felt fantastic on my back.</li>
    <li> This product is way too long. It works great if you are very wide and need something to get around you. I am 5&#x27;6 135 lb and I had to grip the loofa part to get it around my body. Otherwise the loofa works and its decent quality. Lasted in my shower a couple months. Probably woudlnt order it again</li>
    <li> Finally a way to scrub my back!  Many years ago I lost the flexibility to reach my back and this is the solution.  Bought one and it worked great with liquid soap, so I bought two more.</li>
    <li> My title says the important thing about this product.  It isn&#x27;t really any improvement on the whole over the typical brush-on-a-handle type of back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it does have more surface area of the brushing part, and two different sides, but the negatives compensate for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big pice of fabric, so expect it to start smelling.  A throw in the washing machine can remedy this, but typical back scrubbers don&#x27;t need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for any odd angles, prepare to have to figure out the best technique.  Again, not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it just seems clear to me that if I were picking a type of back scrubber again, I&#x27;d go with the traditional type.  It&#x27;s slightly easier, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Then you know how to use this exfoliating back scrubber.  Which by the way awesome!  One side is the exfoliating side which is gentle, but effective and the other side is kind of a terry cloth fiber.  I seriously use this to wash almost all over my body.  Cuts my cleaning time in half... and let me say that what prompted this purchase was that my BF got his back waxed and to eliminate any opportunity for ingrown hairs I bought this to help exfoliate.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--3/7/2014--UPDATE--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of this product is of course legit.  However, despite the fact that it&#x27;s used in the shower, with soap, and hang dries, it gets a really funky/musty/moldy smell.  I find it ridiculous to have to wash it after only a couple uses to avoid the odor.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw it away, however it is no longer used and in the bottom of a drawer.  I recommend using an exfoliating cloth.  I&#x27;ve decreased from 5 stars, to 2.</li>
    <li> I know aggressive exfoliation is not good for the skin so I only use this when I get itchy - I figure that&#x27;s a good sign I am in need of something!  That seems to be about 8-10 days.  A blob of body was and a few passes across my back, front, legs, and arms and my skin is ready to soak in some moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t grab it only by the handles but get a good grip on it by the fabric.  I like it better than a natural loofa because it is as flexible as a washcloth and dries quickly.  I will replace it immediately if it breaks down or starts to wear.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews.  For the most part it is a good product.  However I do not find it quite scratchy enough for good exfoliation.  It is very easy to use and definitely hits all the areas of my back.  However, I just do not feel it gets my skin as smooth as when my husband scrubs my back with a plastic scrubber.  For a solo back washing it is just fine.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to retain soap and water no matter now much I rinse/squeeze it dry.  When this one falls apart I may go with a normal back brush to see which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I just love my new back scrubber it is great.  Easy to use. I have tried many different kinds and this one beats them all.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised and was received quickly what more can you ask for?  I use the course side to clean and exfoliate and the smoother to finish up.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is better than your regular back brush. It allows you to actually clean your entire back and you aren&#x27;t breaking a arm to get to it. I&#x27;m glad I bumped into this product.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble washing my back.  This scrubber fixed that.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Works well, will need some time to soften up as it is very rigid.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I&#x27;m using this for dry brushing before showering twice a week and it has made a really big difference to my rather delicate skin.  You have a LOT of control over the pressure and intensity so you can fine tune it to your own needs.  I toss it in the laundry every couple of weeks, in a lingerie bag, and so far it has lasted a long time and held up well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a second time from a retailer that doesn&#x27;t allow secondary sellers. The product if you get the branded version is soft yet scrubby. I can shimmy the rough skin off me in the shower. It holds up really well with its thick handles. I&#x27;m a plus size gal and I have no difficulties.  For my Amazon purchase, I purchased from a managed by Amazon item.  Instead of receiving the Aquis back scrubber that is loofah-like. I received a loofah item that was in a plain plastic wrapper inside a dark wrapper with a computer printed label that said it was Aquis.  I&#x27;m familiar with the brand and like the loofah-like since I can wash it.  Don&#x27;t recommend purchasing from Algitina Trade since it appears they are trying to sell cheaper knock-offs.</li>
    <li> One side is rougher than the other so it&#x27;s like a rough buff then a smooth buff.  It&#x27;s plenty long and doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap acrylic bath puff or plastic scrubber.  Seems like it will last.</li>
    <li> This is great!  I bought several for family members.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how its a top selling amazon product- usually amazon doesn&#x27;t steer you in the wrong direction but this product doest &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; well and it keeps twisting in the shower - its basically not sturdy enough for a good back scrub which was the whole reason I bought it. I would say go for a loofah instead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a working back scrubber</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber and easy to use. Seems a bit rough on my back though even though I use the softer side of the back scrubber, just as an FYI. Maybe my back is more sensitive, but the softer side of this is not the consistency of a rag, a bit rougher than that. Even the actual rough side is ridiculous in my opinion, you might as well exfoliate your back with wet sand paper. Otherwise its an ok product.</li>
    <li> I like it alot. I fear that one day the handles may seperate from the pad but it will take a long time for that. I will buy again if they do because I like to &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  double sides. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived on time. One of my siblings wanted it so I purchased it and have heard no regrets or anything negative about the scrubber. Would buy more.</li>
    <li> Is a great product and the shipment was very quick! Works very well and glad I bought it. No hassles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had back scrubbers in the past with the wooden handle, not any more, this one is the one for me Aquis is great, two different textures on each side, great grip, easy to wash and hang to dry.  Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Best thing since dirt was discovered.  When God didn&#x27;t make my arms long enough, you folks made the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber available and took my worries away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Easy to use..comfortable on skin.</li>
    <li> thought it would be a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Made me break out - I have been using a hand scrubber from CVS.  Could not reach my back so I bought this.  I used it on my face and arms and broke out.  WTF</li>
    <li> People with itchy backs rejoice!  The Equis Exfoliating Back Scrubber is more than an infomercial toy.  This natural fiber product is gently exfoliating and it holds (and releases) a reasonable amount of suds and water to do its job.  Admittedly, I am not long of limb but I find the length of this product to be fine for whipping over the back of my head and its ropey handles are comfortable for the back and forth of scrubbing.  People who have difficulty (like my wife) in reaching behind themselves to clean their backs with a wash cloth will appreciate this product.  It washes out well, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking a little deeper, suppose a guy has a disgustingly hairy set of shoulders:  this product works with an exfoliant to gently scrub away unwanted hair as well as performing its usual scrubbing function.  Maybe we should buy two of them!</li>
    <li> Words cannot adequately describe how well this scrubber works.  It feels like a giant cat tongue licking your back - an experience that should cost way more than it actually does.  After the first time using the rough side I felt like a pink snake shed it&#x27;s skin.  Get one before they realize how good it is and raise the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased three!  Very good.  Have used them for years. Purchased three!  Very good.  Have used them for years. gave one to our son.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product absolutely love! Very long, exactly as described. Would recommend for any one. I will be purchasing as gift in the future.</li>
    <li> I was devastated when my old one wore out and I could not find an exact replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This one is even better, and likely to last longer as well.</li>
    <li> I love it. My wife loves hers. My daughter put hers&#x27; in her room and forgot she has it. I wonder if she will find it ? LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrubber is well made with solid stitching and durable materials. I am 6&#x27;1 and have no problem reaching every inch of my back. My wife is 5&#x27;2 and the same exact product works perfectly for her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to find out where my daughter&#x27;s scrubber went...</li>
    <li> easy to use and it still is going strong, shipped fast and it&#x27;s machine washable with like colors. get it !</li>
    <li> After using this product daily for two weeks, and using it along with a good quality skin cleanser, I can tell the difference.  I have far fewer annoying and sometimes itchy and painful skin blemishes on my hairy back.  It takes a few days to learn how to most-efficiently maneuver the scrubber to reach all areas of your back, so don&#x27;t be immediately discouraged the first few times you use it.</li>
    <li> Great item, has encouraged my pre-teen son to scrub a little better.</li>
    <li> I can get to places I couldn&#x27;t get to before. The one downside is it will fold in half, half the time, to where the scratchy side is against my skin.  So be careful when going for those hard to reach private places.</li>
    <li> Item broke within two weeks</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Does a good job but it discolors after constant use even after washing it.</li>
    <li> This works OK but it is too flimsy and not long enough to do a really good job. It does lather up the soap pretty well. It rinses easily and hasn&#x27;t gotten smelly or moldy hanging in the shower. I like my old brush better.</li>
    <li> I lift, a lot, and by the time I&#x27;m done with my workout I&#x27;m usually so pumped I don&#x27; even come close to being able to reach my back. This is perfect, it has really helped to clear my skin up and folds up small enough to easily bring to the gym. I wish it dried faster, but I just I ended up buying a second one so I always have a dry one to throw in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> By far, the best back scrubber I have owned. It is durable, pliable and effective. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber really makes my back feel wonderful after a hot shower.  It truly is the little things like this that make life great.</li>
    <li> So the first one I got strap broke after the 3rd use. I ordered another. I&#x27;ll let you know if that was a dumb idea or not soon.</li>
    <li> If you  have trouble wash your back like me this is the perfect back scrubber for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many back scrubbers over the years, and this is the absolute best. It is durable, and the rough side exfoliates amazingly well. I&#x27;m a big guy, and this strap is long enough and wide enough for even me. I bought another for when this one dies...</li>
    <li> How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- To exfoliate my upper back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- You can hang it&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliates well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Still hard to clean back thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;- Arms get tired from being in weird contorted positions&lt;br /&gt;- Starts to smell bad very, very quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Collects mildew and mold&lt;br /&gt;- Annoying to have to clean and dry after use</li>
    <li> .If you have a pain under your shoulder blade this is a lifesaver for applying pain cream and also for scrubbing your back.</li>
    <li> Like the title says, do not buy from \\&quot;Maya Beauty\\&quot;.  I ordered the Aquis Back scubber from them and they sent me .99 cents back scrubber.  At first I didnt know.  I pulled out the scubber out the box and immediately one of the ropes broke. I brushed it off and decided to use the product. The exfoliatiig side of it was wearing down after only a couple of uses and I said \\&quot;how can this product have such great reviews, its practically falling apart within less than week.  So I went online and looked at the image of the Aquis back scubber and the scrubber I received in the mail and they were TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After noticing this I ordered the backscrubber from Amazon and finally got the real deal.  The scrubber is fantastic and durable, the ropes are solid in place.  I even use the scrubber on my feet.  With that being said, its a great scrubber just keep away from the Maya Beauty guy.</li>
    <li> I love the two sides so I can exfoliate one day and simply wash the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is good. The width is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles allow me to easily hang it over my shower head.</li>
    <li> It is what it is and it works.  The quality is there which is appreciated.  It&#x27;s difficult to tell from a picture.</li>
    <li> Ease of use and simple for my mom to use.  Makes shower time a little more independent for the aging.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you need. the only downfall for me was that it was too long... but thats a personal problem considering I am just a little petite. It is rough enough to clean and is a good exfoliating scrubber</li>
    <li> Good value, good price. Utilitarian item,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to got to town&amp; fight the crowds.....&amp; all the idiots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I shop @ home!!</li>
    <li> I love this back scrubber. It gets all the dead skin off and really makes you feel like you&#x27;re clean after your shower. I keep it in a secret place, so no one else can use it but me ((^_^))</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled. This product is \\&quot;loofah-like\\&quot;. It is not loofah. It might be a valid a back scrubber, but is worthless as a back-scratcher. One side has the texture and softness of a soft washcloth. The reverse feels more like a rough terry towel. I purchased this to replace my previous loofah product that I used as a very effective back scratcher. Unfortunately, the replacement does not fill the bill.</li>
    <li> does a great job and easy to use</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, easy to use, reasonable price! I like that there is a soft side, but not a fan of the rougher side since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the guy who ruins Loofahs in 2 weeks, bath brushes in a month. I think I&#x27;ve finally met my match. Granted it&#x27;s only been a few weeks but this thing doesn&#x27;t seem to be showing any signs of my rough use. Exfoliates well, even after a few cycles of the washer/dryer still has the same rough texture. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these over the years.  They all worked well enough for me.  Usually, they get so ratty looking that I just throw them away even though they&#x27;re still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one i&#x27;ve found in this price range.  One smooth side, on coarser side (the only one I use).  soaps up well.  rinses well.  It has lasted for four years of near daily use, and is only now starting to get a bit ratty in appearance - though it still works well, the coarser side is starting to smooth out.  I&#x27;ll probably get another scrubber this year.  Fut 4 years of life for $7 is a good deal as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> im not sure if it did the best job exfoliating as i didnt find it rough enough to get the dead skin off my back and it does tend to flip over if you&#x27;re not standing at a peculiar angle with your arms wide open but the soft side is amazing for lathering soap! i find it&#x27;s also nice for getting behind the knees while standing. i think it&#x27;s a good quality product and it did leave my skin softer post-shower so i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> This has cleared up my back quite abit!impressive!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. Had one before and forgot in hotel. This time ordered 2 just in case...</li>
    <li> I love these scrubbers.  I use them in the shower as well for applying lotion on my back in areas I can&#x27;t reach.  Washable and always good as new after each wash!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, and I would highly recommend it.Would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> What a great little device!  Its very simple but really works.  Who doesn&#x27;t like a good back scrub in the shower?  Unless you have a significant other to scrub your back every time, this scrubber can be your new best friend.</li>
    <li> Treat your back and buttocks and buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> awesome little scrubber!</li>
    <li> Does a great job on your back</li>
    <li> Works very well, and is the brand name item claimed (as opposed to what previous reviewers said).  Well made, works great and makes those hard to reach places feel clean.</li>
    <li> A Present!  My girl friend loves this scrubber!</li>
    <li> Great. Excellent scrubbing action and they last forever.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay and gets the job done but it&#x27;s really scratchy all over, I was hoping that one side or portion would be soft for more delicate areas.  Not so much.</li>
    <li> Finally, something to make back washing simple!  Well made and easy to use, great exfoliator, much easier to use than one with a handle.</li>
    <li> This will change your life. I have never known what a clean back felt like until I got this back scrubber. Buy it!</li>
    <li> So, it&#x27;s a pretty fine scrubber. One thing I wished I had paid more attention to is the dimensions. It looked wider in the picture and I find myself wishing for an extra inch or so of width. It is 4 inches across. I find this easier to use than a brush but that is due to spine damage that affects my arm movements. It also did a bangin&#x27; job of reaching my feet when I was unable to bend due to back problems. I am at a toss up with what side I prefer, they are both nice. One for exfoliating, one that&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face. Definitely a fine price based on the mitts and other items like this I&#x27;ve seen on sale at Target and places. I love the fact that there is NO wood handle. NO sea sponge to grow critters in! And? The whole thing is machine washable. This may just be the last bath product of it&#x27;s type I buy. I had a weird dream about all the plastic poufs somehow congealing into a massive net in the sea and wish to pollute less. Just kidding about the dream, but.. that is a lot of plastic now that I&#x27;m forced to think about it. Hope the review helps you with your purchase. Happy Amazon Shopping!</li>
    <li> I do not know if it was truely an Aquis scrubber.  It had paperwork indicating that it was, but no label was sewn to it as described by one reviewer.  The texture on both sides seemed, to my wife and to me, to be the same- very soft and non abrasive - not as described.  I ordered it with the hope of using it to help scratch my frequently itchey back.  Upon opening the package I noticed that the stiching holding one end of one of the rope handles was frayed and thought that I should reinforce it with fabric adhesive and thread.  I took my shirt off  to give it a quick try.  Unfortunately within a few seconds one end of a rope handle broke free.  I thought - Should have reinforced it first, dummy!  But, the frayed area hadn&#x27;t failed yet . It was an area that appeared well sewn.  The rope that the handles are made from is very loosely woven, it&#x27;s ends seperate easily,and only extend about a quarter inch past the stitching.  Not much chance of holding for long with such friable materials at a stressed junction.  Hours later, Amazon has issued a return pickup with UPS</li>
    <li> The last back scrubber I had lasted me for 5 years lol. I know that sounds kinda gross but I just was never able to find a suitable replacement. This one is so far perfect. It&#x27;s holding up well and has just the right amount of scratchiness to it. I&#x27;m a fan. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, the little ropey handles are fairly jank. However, after one of the rope handles broke off, it allows me to actually get a hand full of better grip on one side! This product is great for what it does; cleared up my bacne in a week or so. Even with the compromised ergonomics, it is still quite functional. Would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> A little over a month of use, not daily and the cord handle broke. Not a bad product apart from that.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation for the entire body!</li>
    <li> I ride my bike every morning and I sweat in this 90+ degree heat. After using this in the shower I feel really clean. It&#x27;s long and easy to use.</li>
    <li> While it is narrow, it does what I need without rolling over.  Having 2 options of different textures on each side is a plus. It dries well, too.</li>
    <li> Good scrubbing.  Long enough for a large back and seems very durable.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order. It&#x27;s great really cleanses my skin. Both sides of the loofah has its own way of cleaning. Especially the handles help you reach spots you couldn&#x27;t reach otherwise.</li>
    <li> The scrubs are good shape and just nice to scrub and not to hard.  The handling design is a bit weird, i keep flipping it over when i switch hands.  Could be more intuitive on design but so far it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Works very well with either a bar soap or a body wash. Really smoothes the skin without causing any uncomfortable friction. Durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different back scrubbers and didn&#x27;t care much for them.  After a while, I had gotten to the point of frustration and decided to try the Aquis.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It does a great job of scrubbing the hard to reach areas as well.  After blowing money on other exfoliating items, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber gets the job done. It is easy to use, and affordable. I would buy this again. What else can I say? It is a back scrubber.</li>
    <li> Sometimes showering is a chore, especially when you&#x27;re older and can&#x27;t stretch and bend like you used to. Reaching unreachable places on my back was a pain (literally!), so when I found this back scrubber, I had to give it a try. I don&#x27;t like the brush scrubbers or those long loofa things because I just don&#x27;t like how they look hanging from my towel racks. This scrubber is bendable and low profile, so it looks nonchalant handing with my towel folded across the rack. It&#x27;s easy to use, and as a result, my skin has improved and actually glows (just in time for camisole and tank weather). Will buy more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this fabric band with two different sides of abrasiveness.  The handles on each end make it easy to control than a towel or wash cloth and less aggressive than a brush.  At the same time, it is more aggressive than a pouf which, I think, is pretty worthless.  Since it&#x27;s easier to control you can do a better job on an inaccessible area.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What a cheap, disgusting thing this is. Poor, made-in-Korea quality. The size is fine if your a Munchkin. It&#x27;s not made for normal-sized adults, especially men. Not worth the bother to return.</li>
    <li> Since using this product all of the acne on my back has cleared up. Use in conjunction with Cetaphil antibacterial soap bars and you will be in great shape! Nothing else worked for years, so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Rough on one side, soft on the other, &amp; sturdy little handles. It lathers easily &amp; hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet (1 month, daily use). It also came out of the washer intact. I&#x27;ve only air-dried it, so I don&#x27;t know what the heat of a dryer might do to it.</li>
    <li> Any day is better when it starts with a back scratch. Good product, seems durable.</li>
    <li> I found this item to be most useful in cleaning my back and all the way down to back of calves. These areas have been the most difficult and strenuous. Love the fact it can be machine washed for hygene cleanliness. No more painful straining.</li>
    <li> Works very well to gently exfoliate and prepare skin before moisturizing</li>
    <li> worked great until one of the rope handles snapped about a month later.</li>
    <li> I like it! I am happy! ;)</li>
    <li> Nice rough and smoother side.  Easy to reach all areas of back</li>
    <li> Excellent back scrubber.  It&#x27;s totally long enough, and each side has a different texture. I will probably purchase a couple more for gifts</li>
    <li> I love this product. Nothing else quite exfoliates your back as perfectly as this product does. It&#x27;s even machine washable so you can continue to reuse it. I haven&#x27;t yet tried that, but hopefully it won&#x27;t hurt the product. I leave it hanging after the shower and it dries quickly.  It has a soft side and an exfoliating side which is the side I use. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I purchased this expressly to scratch my back with without tearing up the skin.  Due to an allergy problem, my entire body itches and getting to my back area is very difficult.  This works nicely for that purpose.  It could be just a bit longer for the person with a larger body so that it would have more ease in some areas.</li>
    <li> Awesomely excellent!  It&#x27;s long enough to get my whole back, and the scrubby side is perfect, while the soft side is great for sensitive spots like the face.  Good sturdy handles, and more scrubbing power than I expected from linen.  Holds soap well too.  Just the right amount of scrub, exfoliates without leaving your skin red and raw.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I love the length of the scrubber but I would be happier with a more course scrubber and maybe a little wider since it was purchased for my son. He is pretty good size so wider would have been a little better. For the price paid we decided to keep it but I would not order this one again. After more uses I will update my review if my views change.</li>
    <li> Not five stars because i&#x27;m yet to see its durability, but based on initial quality i don&#x27;t expect to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The loofa part expands as soon as it touches water and the cleaning is superior; you will feel a new level of clean after this.</li>
    <li> I really like this item and have used it for two months now and have had no problems with the cords, like some other reviewers may have had. I&#x27;m a pretty big guy with bad shoulders and have no problem using the scrubber. I like the convex &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side and soap it up for a combo wash and back scratch. Five stars... so far. The straps make it easy to hang on a shower caddy to drip-dry after rinsing and it seems to dry out pretty well overnight.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product I would higly recommend it to anyone looking for an exfoliating scrubber. Arrived on time, quality was excellent not much more to say.</li>
    <li> I realy dont know if all the peoples giving this item 5 star has got the same item that I have got. This scrubber is too soft to be a back scrubber. If you want a soft scrubber, then this is what you want but a towel would do the same thing this item does. Back scrubber should have a little ruffness and this is too soft. softer than a thin towel. Peoples should give the correct review so other peoples wont order a wrong item. Again if you are looking for a very soft back scrubber, probabely you will like this.</li>
    <li> I love this loofah back scrubber!!! It&#x27;s the perfect width and length. I am 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and have a long wingspan so it&#x27;s perfect for tall people. I am sure it&#x27;s perfect for shorties too. Its just that I&#x27;ve tried so many others and they are too short for my wing span. The loofah on this is the perfect amount of \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; on one side and then soothing soft material on the other side. I got one for me, my dad and my mom for Christmas. I just hang it in my shower and it dries. I usually squeeze the water out first. It&#x27;s so perfect, non bulky, perfect \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, doesn&#x27;t stink. :)</li>
    <li> Not durable. Lasted 6 months</li>
    <li> So far this has worked as advertised so only time will tell how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Good quality. . Item shipped and received  immediately.</li>
    <li> Wanted a scratcher for our new shower.  My hubby uses and actually does not like as well as his old one with bristles built in.  He wants one more scratchy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have it. Soft enough, very high durable. Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;so just buy it and go to shower))</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT MET MY EXPECTATIONS  AND I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE IF AND WHEN NEEDED.</li>
    <li> Is works great. Ordered it after spin surgery and limited right arm mobility. Don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d do without it. Priced right. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, like the scrubber side and buffer side.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend and in his exact words when I asked him was &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good!&amp;#34;  It works well and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I have a bad shoulder so getting my back in the shower isn&#x27;t easy.  This does the job.  I wish it was easier to get the soap to suds up on it better, but that&#x27;s just me.  I like a lot of suds.  I&#x27;m sure it is perfectly good for others and it certainly does the job.  I didn&#x27;t get it to exfoliate, just to be able to reach back there so I have no comment on the exfoliation.  It feels like it should do a good job at that.</li>
    <li> I like this product with the exception of on thing. I think the handles should be sewn on a bit better. The first time I used it I heard it kind of ripping but it hasn&#x27;t come apart yet. I could be wrong, but I have a feeling it is going to pull loose withing no time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  There have been reviews of how easy it is for the scrubber to flip, I say work with it you&#x27;ll be able to get it to function the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it for back of my legs, buttocks, and back. Works great. One side is soft terry cloth. The other is some sort of polyester exfoliator like a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy. Good length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> received this item and found it to be very helpful for my mom....as she gets older it&#x27;s difficult for her to reach to her back to get clean....she also found it helpful for cleaning the bottom of her feet without bending down all the way! A very useful item!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days to exfoliate my back, and it&#x27;s already clearing up. The material wasn&#x27;t as rough as I would have liked, but the results are there.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT!  I love that it has a scrubby side and a softer side.  Long enough to get around your back and maneuver.  I will probably buy more as Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> seller was great!! hard to use on my back due to arthritis.</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower to get to those hard to reach places. Have had no problems with the handles. They seem to be sewed on well. It nice to have two different textures for when you need them.</li>
    <li> Its OK. Does the job. A bit too stretchy when back scrubbing. It isn&#x27;t too rough nor too soft. When I got my item it had the tag from &amp;#34;Aquis&amp;#34; so its a legit item. I read somewhere this was counterfeited not sure what that customer was talking about but mine came out fine. :)</li>
    <li> Love this back scrubber.  I have been searching for a good back scrubber for years and now I have found this one by Aquis.  It feels wonderful on my back.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just as promised, quick ship  works fine</li>
    <li> Great for those hard to reach places!</li>
    <li> This thing simply refuses to foam up with soap without using a ludicrous amount of soap. It isn&#x27;t bad; just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased a back scrubber with plastic handles that left scratches and gouges because the quality of the handles was so poor.  I thought this would be better because instead of a molded handle this one looked like it is flexible rope.  Unfortunately, the rope didn&#x27;t keep the band from wadding up into a narrow strip as I worked it across my back.  As it cost less than $10, I didn&#x27;t figure it was worth trying get a refund for something that had been used.  This was months ago and recently Amazon sent me an email asking me to rate it.  Now I see a warning about a seller that was sending bogus/bootleg scrubbers and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if I got one that was not genuine Aquis.  I will never know because I threw it away after determining a washcloth used in the same manner did better at scrubbing than this did.</li>
    <li> This really makes the skin feel great and refreshing</li>
    <li> Product fell apart upon first use. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy. Bad. Terrible. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s far too short and far too smooth to do a goo job of exfoliating and/or scrubbing the back. Add another 6 inches in length and you may have that part of down correctly but there&#x27;s still the issue of &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;  This is no better than a wet washcloth...not at all useful.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 versions of back scrubbers for family members, this ended up being the winner for me. Funny how such a simple little thing can &amp;#34;make my day&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the material. When I lather it with soap and then use it, it feels like there is no soap on it at all. It barely exfoliates and my back still feels dirty afterwards.</li>
    <li> I just got this back scrubber in the mail today. It works just as I hoped. The product was just long enough to reach across my back while being held in my hands to scrub back and forth. I now have a super clean back.</li>
    <li> a great product, fast service, i recommend using this product and this seller i was completely satisfied with this purchase i even ordered a second one for my husband he loves his too</li>
    <li> I love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Liked the product.  Could have been a bit longer.  Rough side could have been a bit rougher.  But over all, good value for the price.</li>
    <li> its a great scrubber it really do exfoliate. You also can throw it in the washer to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> The back scrubber works great as described, but one of the ropes broke. I was able to tie it back together with a square knot.</li>
    <li> A great back scrubber/exfoliator but I would like a little more substance or thickness so it won&#x27;t flip over on itself, and it is a little too long for me.</li>
    <li> My husband has trouble with back brushes and he loves the flexibility of this scrubber.  I would buy this again for him.</li>
    <li> This is better than those brushes on a stick...! This really contours to your back, has a rough texture on one side, smoother on the other... it&#x27;s also much easier, to me, to use! It&#x27;s solid, well made and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in this type of back scrubber!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for one year and really like it.  9 out of 10 times I use the rough side of it although the soft side is very pleasant to touch. As a precaution, I don&#x27;t try to pull it by handles too often and just grab by the end of the scrubber itself. It is so long that there is no need to hold it by the handles. The last thing I want is to pull out those handles. They look strong but with much force can be pulled out anyways I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works well and seems to be holding up OK. Does a good job scrubbing and is easy to &amp;#34;operate&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality item. One side is a pretty rough surface that you only have to apply slight pressure to exfoliate your back. The other side is similar to a wash cloth. I have not had any problems with the handles coming apart, but I could see someone having problems if they pull on them with more pressure than necessary to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Getting soap on its surface! This is a long strap and you have to spend some time applying soap to its surface prior to use. It is a very long strap. I am a 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; woman and getting this strap behind my back and holding the handles is awkward - takes some coordination and practice. Sometimes I wish for a simple brush - seems like that would be a lot easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: High quality, serves its purpose - it will exfoliate your back and with too much pressure could be maybe remove more than dead skin! I have not had any problems with mildew; I hang this from a plastic hook in my shower. It dries nicely. No odors, no mildew - look new and ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again? I am on the fence with this one. I might have been happier with a brush, but with a brush I might not have been able to get the exfoliation that I am getting with this strap.</li>
    <li> A Good Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good works fine just long enough not too long it suits my purpose i recommend it for a meduim size person</li>
    <li> but it&#x27;s rather stretchy so you have to use it a bit to get results... hoping it holds together, it seems well made enough to give me some use.</li>
    <li> Works well, plenty long enough. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> works better than a back brush. second only to having your woman scrub your back for you! great quality. this is my second one only because i lost the other in a move. get it!</li>
    <li> You can really see your skin improving after using this for only a short time. It seems pretty durable, and could last quite some time.</li>
    <li> it helps great as back scrub.My only concern product is expensive may be can afford less price for this fucntioning</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend. She states that it works really well for those hard to reach areas on her back.</li>
    <li> After receiving my first scrubber, I ordered a 2nd. I love this item. It scrubs my back so much better than a brush. Some of the reviews mention it being cheaply built. I do not see that to be the case. It&#x27;s a pretty simple item to construct. I suppose the stitches can come out at some future date, but so far (several months) mine has worked fine. And even if if does &amp;#34;fall apart&amp;#34; after 6 months, it&#x27;s a pretty inexpensive item to replace. Don&#x27;t forego this great back scrubber because it might not last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, maybe it will.</li>
    <li> Used it for several times. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift. I liked it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, item is fine.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the best back scrubber! It&#x27;s lasted a good long while; starting to fray a bit on the grabs - so I&#x27;m ordering another. I combine it with some rich lanolin Moroccan Black soap; very nice for wintery dry skin. Makes the best back scratch tool too for the shower!</li>
    <li> It is a little awkward to use. But for now it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My expectations of the product were not fulfilled. Maybe I should have known.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product would retain the soap I put in it better. The problem is that you must use a lot of soap to spread across the length of this product and the soap seems to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product would be a little longer; however, it&#x27;s as advertised and I mislead myself. I would prefer 4-5&#x27; instead of 2.5&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The material on one side is meant for exfoliation and the other is meant for simple wash. I&#x27;d prefer a more plush on one side for it&#x27;s quite like a dish rag. But it does advertise &amp;#34;back scrubber&amp;#34;. Again, I mislead myself.&lt;br /&gt;Part of my 4/5 is it mislead me and I mislead myself.</li>
    <li> this makes your back feel amazing.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for. One side for exfoliating, the other is soft like a thick washcloth.  It does not roll up when I am using it on my back like others in the past. I also use it on my arms and legs. This looks like I bought it at a spa and without the expense.  My skin is thankful!</li>
    <li> Aww yeah, does the job quite nicely,  will be purchasing more for BACK up.</li>
    <li> I just started using this to wash my back and man I must have needed it. The skin on my back feels wonderful now. I haven&#x27;t itched since I&#x27;ve used this and I itched for years. I just couldn&#x27;t reach everywhere and my wife won&#x27;t help me any more. This seems well made which is yet to be seen.  Very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great price, works good.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it and I no longer get called to scrub  between  his shoulders (6ft 7)</li>
    <li> Works well, But is falling apart after several weeks of daily use. I love the ease of using this scrubber, however, I am disappointed at the fact that it is falling apart after short usage.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I bought this to replace an old brush-on-a-stick backscrubber and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  This scrubber has a smooth side and a rough side so you can stimulate/scrub, or do a more gentle wash. It is long enough to work even on a large guy like me, and the rough side has not worn down with time.  Mine has lasted several years with the occasional trip through the laundry in between the daily rinse in the shower after use.  I have a couple of fraying ropes on each end now, so I&#x27;m here to purchase another!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Easy way to get your back side clean and buffed without awkward contortionist moves!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was still a bit hesitant to get this. I have bought many exfoliating scrubbers before and none were good and I really hated all of them. So I was ready to not like this one. However after my first shower I was in love, It is great easy to use and totally worth it!</li>
    <li> While I love the form of this back scrubber, the rope handles came unstitched after a few months. Other than this, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my muscular boyfriend who can&#x27;t reach his back.  He seems to like it, his only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get as sudsy as he would like.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this and it exceeded them. It works perfectly, texture is great, washable, etc. What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft. So far it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> My husband really appreciates this back scrubber on a strap. It really resists mildew &amp; does a good job for a man.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exfoliater for a number of years. It&#x27;s a great morning wake up and skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s better than any I&#x27;ve tried and I was only thrilled they are still being made. Well designed, nice quality and good price</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable, effective and easy to use scrubber.  I like that the scratchy side does not hurt.  I haven&#x27;t used the soft side yet.  My body wash goes on and stays on easily  I hope it lasts a good while.  I will replace it with the same item when it is time.</li>
    <li> Quite a good product, effective and gives a nice scrubby feeling. Flips over a bit because it is narrow, but I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does the job. With a smooth and rough side to appease everyone&#x27;s needs and machine washable. Easy to use with decent length to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a great back scrubber.  There are two sides to it--one soft and one exfoliating.  I prefer the exfoliating side.  It is plenty long enough to easily pull back and forth across my back, and it nicely reaches the upper and lower back, but it is a little difficult to get the center of the back because of the curvature of the spine.  It is easy to clean/rinse in the shower, and being washing machine safe is a big bonus.</li>
    <li> It has taken a lot to replace my Loofa but this scrubber has met the bill, especially for doing my back in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to see how long it lasts to judge whether I will be getting another Loofa.</li>
    <li> Great product ~ the one side is a little too scratchy for my sensitive skin, so I only use the milder side ~ Just hang in the shower to dry til the next time you need to use it</li>
    <li> This scrubber has two sides with different coarseness to it.  It is not just for&lt;br /&gt;the back.  It can be used to wash your whole body and is easy to keep clean and&lt;br /&gt;dry.  I am sure it will have a place in our shower for years to come.</li>
    <li> Bought 6 months ago. Has been used regularly in my shower since. No mold. NO funky smells. Can be washed. Has a soft side and a semi rough side. Strap has stayed sewn together well. Is wonderful for scrubbing your back. Very pleased with the performance. Will purchase another if this one ever wears out.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting something close to a Turkish exfoliator. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t remove any dead skin at all. So I just ordered a Turkish exfoliator (after like a month of ordering this product). So if you are looking for an exfoliator that removes dead skin (to a level that you see dead skin coming off), this is not the product for sure.</li>
    <li> very generous length. well made. fabric washes &amp; remains fresh &amp; new.</li>
    <li> After using a long-handled wooden brush and never being able to reach the center of my back, I thought I&#x27; give one of these a shot. First off, unless you have a lot of elbow room around your bathtub, this is very hard to use while sitting down in the tub, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s two-sided (rough on one side and softer on the other) and I do agree with another poster here, that it sometimes is hard to get it to not flip over while &#x27;see-sawing&#x27; back and forth.  However, it does make my skin feel softer and the length is very long. So far it&#x27;s worked rather well for me and worth the low price.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers up nice&lt;br /&gt;- Soft and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side&lt;br /&gt;- Nice useable length for your back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I wish they would have had double or triple stitching where the rope attaches just to give it a more secure attachment. I think it will hold up, but to be safe and to make sure mine lasts as long as possibleI am going to go over the threading with my own to make sure it doesnt come off with moderate to &amp;#34;hard pulling back and forth&amp;#34; use</li>
    <li> I have exfoliating gloves for showering, but being that I have short arms &amp; I am not a tiny person, there are a few areas that I wish I could reach a little better.  This is perfect for getting my back &amp; the back part of my upper thigh area.  One side exfoliates &amp; the other side is softer feeling.  I have only used it a few times, so I cant say how long it will last, but I can say that so far I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice product, however, one side is rougher than the other sides. I prefer both sides to be rough, but that is a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love this scrubber!!  It&#x27;s about 4 inches wide and about a yard long, so it&#x27;s easy to grab on both ends and wrap around your back. The ends have a rope type loop to grab so the scrubber stays flat while you scrub. The two sides are wonderful options for washing--one is washcloth like and the other is like a loofah. If I had back acne I could use the loofah side gently and consistently and feel an exfoliating effect.  Ideal situation for keeping back acne or any acne under better control. Obviously it&#x27;s not perfect as back acne is very difficult, but I like it for its back scratching effect. I rinse it out thoroughly and loop the rope like ends over my shower handle, which is about 4 feet off the floor of the shower.  It dries out by the next time I need it. Will probably wash it in a protective washing bag just to keep it from getting tangled up in the washer with the other clothes. Wish I&#x27;d found this a while ago.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  Not so rough like a loofah especially for a lady&#x27;s back.  I throw it in washing machine and hang to dry.  I do not notice it being smelly at all as some said.  Just let it dry out each time.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> It came in delivery quicker than I thought...and I was very pleased with the way it was packaged...it allowed me to see just what I was getting.Very Nice</li>
    <li> Works as it should I suppose but one of the handles gave out after just 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is secured by just a bit of string; add moist environment and it comes apart out in no time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SUPER BACK SCRUBBER AND WHAT A VALUE FOR THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> works as advertised.  I can easily wash and reach all areas of my back with this product.  It has a rough and smooth surface as well with the ruff surface working very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and ultimately does the job intended,  but if I had a redo I would spend a few extra $ for a better one. It is thin and only one side is Exfoliating, but real issue is that it  kinda rolls up on your back so it&#x27;s just not as affective as I had hoped and expected. Again, for the price, I got what I paid for just wish I paid extra for something that does the job better and easier.</li>
    <li> This works really well so far (about 5 uses in).  The one issue I have is that occasionally it gets bunched together or flipped around, so I&#x27;m not scrubbing my back with the scrubby surface.  Perhaps with more experience I&#x27;ll figure out a better style of use.</li>
    <li> I have a large back and this worked great.  It was long enough that I had no trouble reaching my entire back.  I find the scrubber holds soap well and is rough enough to feel like it is really exfoliating.  I also use it on the bottoms of my feet.</li>
    <li> finallky a back scrubber long enough to use easily.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Washing your back is just hard.  This is easy to manage and can be soaped up and used in the shower easily.  Love the fact that one side is exfoliating and the other is not.  Bought this for everyone&#x27;s stocking at Christmas.  A real hit with the girls.  Not sure the guys are actually using.  Too bad...they are missing out.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My new shower is narrower than I prefer, and this scrubber works great for getting the sole of my feet.</li>
    <li> The first rope pulled out in 2.5 sec so i thought I would be real easy on the other rope 4 sec &amp; out. I have three words for this ideam. Piece Of S***.</li>
    <li> Daughter likes the mesh ones better, but uses this for her back.</li>
    <li> This is the best for getting rid of dead skin... have tried others but this one is more sturdy.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating scrub is perfect.  Much better than what I&#x27;ve bought at the local pharmacy.  It makes your shower feel like a spa experience.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> great product, Thinking of buying each of my children one</li>
    <li> Finally a back scrubber that is long enough to use without any awkward twists and turns.  Does a great job of exfoliating my skin and keeps my back super soft.  I&#x27;ve had this for months now and it is still going strong. Highly recommend to anyone.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great for scrubbing my back in the shower.</li>
    <li> It works great, it&#x27;s a nice quality scrubber and it gets the job done. Some other reviews say that they stink of mildew after a few days. If you keep your bathroom tidy and hang it to dry in a ventilated area I&#x27;m sure you will be fine.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best back scrubber on the market. I&#x27;ve used one for years and for Christmas bought one each for my elderly parents. Most back scrubbers on the market are too abrasive especially for the elderly but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected!</li>
    <li> This scrubber is lightweight and not as abrasive as the loofah. It lathers well and is long enough to wash the entire back. It has handles on each end to hang and dries quickly after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different ones in the past but they always seem to be made for little people.  This is LONG.  Perfect for guys with a wide wingspan.  Scrubs very well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The handles are great. Would&#x27;ve liked something a little bit wider. Doesn&#x27;t dry that quickly, but overall a good buy</li>
    <li> Bought this for use on my back in the shower.  I also have the Aquis washcloth and mitt.  This is a nice back scrubber but I do think it&#x27;s somewhat expensive.  If you are use to a handled back scrubber as I am, this might take time getting the hang of it and you can get a handled back scrubber a lot cheaper.  Aquis does make great exfoliating scrubbers and they do last a long time.  I tried to find their large washcloth and had to settle for their mitt.  The mitt is just okay and small.  Hope they bring back their large washcloth.</li>
    <li> It works well enough to wash back but not exactly scrub it.  The sisal scrubbers are MUCH better at scrubbing and relieving an itchy back.  Twice I have bought five of them for $4 a piece on another site with $5 shipping.  Gave away as gifts but not any more, I will save for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Aquis is very soft microfiber terry cloth on one side and a slightly rougher material on the other.  It IS long enough to bathe with but no better than a wash cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t relieve an itchy back and I prefer a rougher back brush to this.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to use due to overall length. Smooth and course sides are good for applying soap to, and exfoliating dead skin from hard to reach places. Handles make for easy hanging. Also, excellent price.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is so unbendable it won&#x27;t touch much of the back.  the other side is so soft it does not even feel like anything is touhing the back.  Not at all the worth the price or even the packaging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of your time to get this. You do not want to be exfoliating your back especially if you have acne and it does not feel good and has to be used in an awkward manner. Just get a benzoyl peroxide rinse and use some soap and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Loved it it is the best back scrubber I have ever had</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.  Excellent for scrubbing my back and many other parts of my body as well.  It has both a rough and a gentle side which allows it to be used as both an exfoliator and a regular bath/shower washcloth.</li>
    <li> This Aquis Back scrubber is fabulous...it cleans your back and so easily. It&#x27;s wonderful and doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands. I recommend this product to everyone...</li>
    <li> I was really wondering if I overpaid because there are many of this type of product on the market for cheaper. It is worth it I have had it for a while and never molds or gets smells drys fast and works like a dream. Great product would buy again worth the price.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be way wider then it was. It&#x27;s only about 4&amp;#34; wide but it&#x27;s not bad. The exfoliating side is rough but not unusable by any means. It does what its suppose to. So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Just kidding, but might be true after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picky, skin-sensitive, ultra-hygienic husband had been complaining about the loofah back scrubber I&#x27;d gotten him some years ago. No wonder: it was caked with soap, no longer would rinse, and generally was worn out. I panicked slightly because I had no idea if the drug store carried the same model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance with this particular one, and it paid off. First time he used it, husband came out of the shower saying, &amp;#34;Hey, this isn&#x27;t bad. I like the double sided thingie.&amp;#34; This is high praise from him, and I am happy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses very well and seems to be maintaining its shape; other types have curled or shrunk from end to end or side to side. The handles are ample and the length just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic thing is that he likes it, uses it, and doesn&#x27;t complain anymore about his backscrubber. That&#x27;s enough for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great item for a great price. I have been very happy with it since I purchased it and I think you will be too.</li>
    <li> great for back scrubbing, nice handle on each end, the scrubber does roll over when you are using it, I would give it a five if the scrubbing surface was on both sides so that when it rolls over you would still get the scrubbing effect</li>
    <li> I have tried different products to accomplish this task of back scrubber-at least three separate brushes. I have to say that this is by far the one that is most successful-Hurrah.</li>
    <li> This is lightweight, long enough to hold easily, and has just the right amount of roughness (not too much and not too little).</li>
    <li> I love this scrubber. Gets the job done and highly durable. Would purchase again!!!!</li>
    <li> On the pirate ship, I have a huge roman shower.  I used to ask my main lady to wash my back.  With 42in pythons as arms, sometimes I don&#x27;t have the flexibilty to get back there after a workout.  This back scrubber allow me to wash my back without asking for help.  The scratch you get is amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I use to have unsightly pimples on my back because it was difficult for me to reach certain areas of my back.  Ever since using this back scrubber, my back is clean and clear and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this...best I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried numerous scrubber before. non of them worked liked this.  everybody who sweats a lot should get this. No sexism but ladies this scrubber is very hard. if one doesn&#x27;t want anything harsh on their skin, this is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is one of those rare items that is exactly what you are looking for because it is well-made, very easy to use and feels great to use. I will be back for this particular item each time I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Feels so good and cleans every inch of your back effortlessly! Both sides are perfect for cleaning and lathers up instantly. I&#x27;m going to be getting more of these for sure (for friends &amp; family) Remember, it&#x27;s machine washable, so I don have to buy myself another one! Love it.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations. The scrubber wilted with use.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job if you go slow, so it won&#x27;t turn on you.  You won&#x27;t be able to grab and go fast as it will turn.  Great also for itchy backs!  Better than trying to back up to a door frame to itch your back...LOL</li>
    <li> Love this In the shower . Hits all of the areas I can&#x27; t reach ........And the &#x27;exfoliation &#x27; is wonderful ......</li>
    <li> Damn good product. Will probably order more......</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery. Reliable packing. I plan to order again.</li>
    <li> The best back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever used when it&#x27;s wet. When dry it&#x27;s the best back scratcher I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase a back scrubber where one side is terry cloth and the other side is loofah. Since I moved to another state I have not been able to find the back scrubber I love. Then I saw this Amazon deal for the &amp;#34;Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber&amp;#34; and I decided to try it. I received it right away and tried it that night. I was very please with the results. Here are some reason I gave this product &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; stars:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use less cleanser and still work up a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;2. The exfoliating side is textured enough to scrub away dead cells without reddening my skin. You can even get in-between your toes.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is well made and I can pull on the handles without worrying they will snap.&lt;br /&gt;4. When I rinse out the cleanser there is no residue.&lt;br /&gt;5. It dries quickly, keeping it mold &amp; mildew free.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, a few months of daily use I have no negatives to report. I would recommend this to my friends and family. I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I like it, but (like reviewers before me have said)  it needs to be rough on both sides instead of only one.</li>
    <li> Feels great! I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was missing out on a real exfoliation until we got this! :D add an exfoliate and you will really feel and see the difference. I use it all over.</li>
    <li> It is a great way of getting my back washed.  I have had a stroke and is also a way training my right hand how to participate in the push-pull hand way of getting my back clean.</li>
    <li> I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this more than I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.  It is simple and effective.  It scrubs the back.  Think out of the box when it comes to &amp;#34;how you use it.&amp;#34;  You will be able to scrub and clean your entire back thoroughly with this product.</li>
    <li> A little rough, but very effective.</li>
    <li> Compared to many other back scrubbers, this one truly provides good force. It doesn&#x27;t roll up as easily as many others I have tried in the past. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this because I always had a hard time getting my back while using my bath pouf. Not only does it work great for scrubbing my back, it feels really good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this came as a pack of 2!</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy.  But considering the price, still a good value</li>
    <li> Ohhh! I love this. Yes, it helps scrub you back, but a use it all over my body. It sloughs off old skin and makes you feel rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> More effective than you might imagine.  Not too rough, not to soft (so it actually cleans)&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.  Keep it out of the shower when not in use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to with this.  I have been looking for a back scrubber/loofah for a while now.  I wanted something wide but not too wide and something that didn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper on my skin.  I typed in back scrubber and this item popped up.  The width is perfect, the rope handles make it easy to hold on to and one side has a soft side and the other has a soft scrub side.  I rub my favorite soap bar up and down the scrubby side and go to town!  I love that my skin feels so soft and that I can get the center of my back without having to stretch too much.  This scrubber does the job and I am so happy with it that I&#x27;m ordering 4 more and using them in gift baskets for my family and another for myself to keep in my travel bag. The price is great and the end result is perfect!  Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed  :)</li>
    <li> The item may be fine for some, but not for me. It was narrower than I expected. And when wet it rolls into a rope shape instead of staying flat. For smaller people [with absolutely flat backs] it might be okay. I used to have one that was about six inches wide and thicker, I loved that one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I use this daily. It is long enough for me to reach it around my back and to use the handle loops for a great scrubbing action.Two sides, one rough and one smooth. I like this better than back brushes or other handled products.</li>
    <li> It is the best back scrubber on the market!!! A bit rough to use on your ass. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Provides a stimulating massage wherever it is used.  I really enjoy this product.  Try it, you will like it!!</li>
    <li> helpful product. does just what it says</li>
    <li> Love this product and the whole family can use this since one side is a little softer than the other. You can reach everywhere on  your body with this.</li>
    <li> We bought our son one of these a while back, and I finally decided to buy one for myself.  Very easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The person that I bought this for said it was exactly what she wanted so mission accomplished. Good product, although a little pricey in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great, great product just, what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Handles break easily--heres a suggestion guys-- make the material stretchable and that way no end handles are needed.</li>
    <li> Beast product of this kind, natural material, efficient, and it is easier to be cleaned by put in to washing  machine</li>
    <li> I usually use a back brush but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It&#x27;s convenient and easier to find a spot to hang in the shower than the back brush was.  But, just like towel drying your back, it takes a little work to hit a few spots.</li>
    <li> When I got this it didn&#x27;t seem to be &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; enough on the one side.  After using it however, it does a very good job.  It rinses easily and completely under the showerhead.  Have used it a dozen times and no complaints.  It also seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> What a great product at such a reasonable price. I have neck problems and&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t clean all over like I used to. Now, problem solved!  I can scrub-a-dub-dub&lt;br /&gt;my back and feel clean all over while feeling less handicapped.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the very reason other people said they did NOT like it - it&#x27;s pretty coarse.  I&#x27;m the guy who asks my wife to scratch my back and says &amp;#34;Scratch harder!&amp;#34; as welts are raising on my back....so I knew I&#x27;d want something that scrubbed well when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not been disappointed.  It&#x27;s easy to wash, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, etc.  I&#x27;ve not experienced the problems with the handles that others have; but then again I&#x27;ve held it by the main body of the scrubber, so as to avoid that problem.</li>
    <li> Great for an all over back scrub</li>
    <li> As a single person, with no hopes of getting any help washing my back haha, this has come in SO handy.  I love the two sides, one being rougher than the other, and the rope handles, that are not &amp;#34;stretchy&amp;#34; like elastic straps would be.  This allows you to control how hard or gentle you want to be.  Will definitely repurchase this again, and again.</li>
    <li> Love this back scrubber!!</li>
    <li> Wow does this thing exfoliate!</li>
    <li> Just what the man ordered. ....me.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely great. I wish I had known about something like this a long time ago. And very much a bargain.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this purchase.  Within minutes of receiving it I took this baby for a ride, and I do mean ride.  But first about the intended use, it scrubs your back and it does it well.  Sorta like in the Jungle Book when Baloo uses a tree to get to his itchy back.  Like that but soapy.  Now back to the best bits.  After my back was thoroughly tended to, like any man with a hankering for multi-tools I whipped this baby between my legs and went to town.  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  This device exfoliated my dangly bits better than if you cast 3 angry badgers down the front of your pants and did a boogie dance.  You could probably make a dozen stops in the red light district of Amsterdam and take the Aquis Scrubber to your frank and beans afterwards and walk away with a virginal cleanse.  Yes sir, may I have another.  On a side note,my wife refuses to use it after I told her what I&#x27;d done with it.  All mine.</li>
    <li> The outerband is superior</li>
    <li> Works really well. It is long enough to not strain your arms when taking care of your back.  It doesn&#x27;t mind being folded over if you want it shorter for your legs. I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and it is holding up without any problems.</li>
    <li> In a hypothetical divorce, I would take this loofah, just for the petty pleasure of depriving the other person of its heavenly embrace. Just the right level of abrasiveness that leaves you feeling like you can take on the world.</li>
    <li> soft but works great!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s about 3 feet long, so you&#x27;re not twisting and struggling to move it, and the exfoliating side does a great job.  I do wish that BOTH sides were exfoliating (one side is soft, like a wash cloth).  Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber. Good quality. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> to small but will use.</li>
    <li> Ahhhh - the next best thing to a back rub!  A nice, long bath aid that makes getting all over the back a snap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda scratchy but it may soften with use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if it continues to be scratchy I may gift it to someone on pain pills</li>
    <li> Love the product and keeps me from throwing my shoulders out when trying to clean my back. Feels great and exfoliates/&amp;#34;polishes&amp;#34; like its supposed to do. I wish it was more &amp;#34;Loofa&amp;#34; like but still a great product and holds soap well.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber comes in handy. It would be nice if it was just a little wider but overall works very well.</li>
    <li> Works great to get to the hard to reach areas. Good length so you don&#x27;t have to be a contortionist to use.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, made from quality materials, a you to use. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally I feel clean all over.  This gets every inch of my back that I never felt a handled scrubber could.  I can really get it tight up against my skin too. It has just enough of a rough feel that I know I&#x27;m getting the dead skin off.  What can I say, it works for me. Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice exfoliating scrubber flip over for soft side to lather up.</li>
    <li> So, I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I will be honest in that I was a tad disappointed upon first glance that the scratchy side isn&#x27;t more \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not looking for a brillo pad by any means, but definitely something more substantial than this. I&#x27;ll update the review when I use it - just not looking too optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I did receive the package in a timely manner, and it was packed appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 06/06/2013&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment held true - the overall quality is lacking, one of the end straps broke with the second use of the \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;. There isn&#x27;t an actual \\&quot;scrubberish\\&quot; aspect to the item - I mean, there is a \\&quot;loofa\\&quot; side, but it is very soft, and I would not have bought the item in the store. It exfoliated no more than a washcloth would.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I&#x27;m 6&#x27; broad shoulders, no issues.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of doubts about this thing, but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> After years of using a shower brush which would first turn moldy and then eventually break, I found this back scrubber and love it. It has a soft terry side and an exfoliating side. The rough side was not too rough for me, and it was a good length (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and my husband is 6&#x27;). After use I rinsed it while still in the shower and hung it up to dry on my towel hook. It is machine washable, which is perfect.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER.  I USE IT EVERYDAY WHEN I TAKE A SHOWER AND IT REMOVES ALL THE DEAD SKIN.</li>
    <li> Flips around a bit but does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this in May this year, product &amp;#34;holding straps&amp;#34; broke a  month ago. Lasted not quite 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Company should have a better sew job. Should not break. Poor quality however the scrubbing part my husband loved.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this item again until the company fixes the problem.</li>
    <li> Works well...very good quality material!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect length to get all of your back, but too bad it doesn&#x27;t allow for ANY lathering of soap or body wash. The clothe is soft but it just soaks up all of my body wash and it barely gives any off after that (super annoying). And the exfoliating side is weak in my opinion, but then again I like a tough scrub and I know not everyone else might.</li>
    <li> Good for exfoliating and cleaning my itchy dry back. The only problem is it falls in the water too easily. I need a hook for it or something to keep it dry and clean.</li>
    <li> While build quality isn&#x27;t the best for a cheap back scrubber it works great and keeps me squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber feels great and is really easy to hold.  It&#x27;s long enough that you don&#x27;t have to be a contortionist to use it.  Two sides, one offers an invigorating scrub, the other a more gentle clean. I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks but it doesn&#x27;t appear to have any quality issues.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little stiffer. It twists and bunches up, making it hard to clean my back.</li>
    <li> Can twist in your hands if you&#x27;re not holding it well, but seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> The rope handle has what looks like mold or mildew on it. Haven&#x27;t had it for very long. I have had other items with rope string handles and they never got anything on it. Kind of gross but I attempted to wash it off. Maybe I just got unlucky? Other than that, the thing works wonders! Has a rough side for exfoliating. The length seems great as I am able to get everything easily.</li>
    <li> One feature changes this product from a 4/5 star product to 2 stars for me. The back scrubbing and exfoliating material is very good and does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is they use a cheap manila rope for the &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; with the two rope ends glued together under a fold in the fabric. Give it 2-3 months and the glue fails and the rope pulls apart. This makes the product useless unless you are a very small person that didn&#x27;t need the handles in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this &amp;#34;glued design&amp;#34; I am sure this would last more than a year or more. This company could have chosen a lot of materials that would not break when they designed these handles so I can only assume this is planned obsolescence.How about a one-piece plastic design?</li>
    <li> We love it and will purchase more for Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, ergonomic...I highly recommend over those exfoliating towels.</li>
    <li> Very helpful with dry back skin.</li>
    <li> It worked very well for the purpose for it was bought.</li>
    <li> Good for washing a scrubbing back, reaches hard to reach places</li>
    <li> You will need it to wash your backside.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE THIS PPROODUCT  111</li>
    <li> I love this back scrubber it is just what I was looking for Thank you!</li>
    <li> This will take care of your oily back! Feels good too!! I have tried alot of back scrubers. This one does not feel bad. I feel clean! SW</li>
    <li> I bought this from a gift list. He seems happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works great and washable</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Was expecting an item with a stiffer scratching surface.  This one doesn&#x27;t doing a thing for an itchy back.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other back scrubber I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a few! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very well made. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll fall apart after a few uses. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Little pricey but if your wearing body armor all day long and you get back to the showers this is well worth it.  It gets the job done well.  A note though it will sound like somebody is rolling you up for your lunch money in those temporary shower units.  It&#x27;s worth the cash.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase one of these earlier in my life! Finally, I feel like I don&#x27;t have a layer of dead skin on my back. Perfect length, perfect amout of exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The scrubber&#x27;s exfoliating side is really great for the guys, smooth side for the ladies.  Some reviews complained about disintegrating scrubbers.  Not so, if one doesn&#x27;t try wringing every drop of water from it after use.  It&#x27;s not designed for that kind of abuse.  Gently roll it up, squeeze out the excess water, hang it up, connecting both ends on the same hook to form a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, and the scrubber will dry very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; of the exfoliating side of the scrubber is becoming a bit less abrasive after a couple of months of use.  Nothing major.  I just pull a bit harder when scrubbing my back!  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> The Aquis Exfolating back scrubber is light weight and I love it.  I would suggest it to everyone for a clean clear back.</li>
    <li> This product meets my expectations, I like the length, having both shoulders busted up makes it easy to reach.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THESE AS GIFTS FOR SEVERAL ELDERLY RELATIVES. IT MADE IT SO MUCH EASIER FOR THEM IN THE SHOWER.</li>
    <li> very effective. Contrary to other posting I find the construction very robust.</li>
    <li> My back feels clean now.</li>
    <li> No problems so far.  Nicely hangs up to dry and works really well on my back!</li>
