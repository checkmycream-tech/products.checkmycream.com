### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very, very happy.  </li>
      <li>Best cream ever!</li>
      <li>It is the best.  </li>
      <li>Incredible!  </li>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this product!</li>
      <li>It was a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job removing unwanted hair, and does not cause any discomfort!</li>
      <li>Great huh ?</li>
      <li>but I experienced no side effects from the product</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how this is working so perfect for people.</li>
      <li>It smells great too.  </li>
      <li>I was happy with the way it was sent and everything just not the product itself.</li>
      <li>The product does a great job, though.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, I will be trying to make the best of it and minimize the irritation as best as I can by using fragrance free lotions, ice or heat afterwards.</li>
      <li>I used this product in the shower and loved it.  </li>
      <li>and I was super impressed!</li>
      <li>It works great if you just want to keep the hair from poking out of a swim suit, not so great if you wanted it completely smooth.</li>
      <li>Super happy with this product.</li>
      <li>It smells good and is easy to apply and use.</li>
      <li>but I experienced zero burning with this product though (lucky I guess?)</li>
      <li>it is more effective for me with a longer time and does so without irritation, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that unless you&#x27;re sure your skin can handle it.</li>
      <li>What is the point of a hair removal cream if it doesn&#x27;t even do as good as a quick shave?</li>
      <li>and it worked better than this</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am a completely satisfied customer and I will be getting this again.</li>
      <li>Most of the hair removed after about 8 min</li>
      <li>I think more should come in the tube however.</li>
      <li>It did remove the top hair</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have better results with a razor than this.</li>
      <li>This bikini cream by Nair really works great.</li>
      <li>Its great works fast.</li>
      <li>Itleaves everything baby smooth!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Tried this product out recently and I have to say it works great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it...</li>
      <li>This is by far the greatest product of its kind on the market right now.</li>
      <li>i feel very clean with no pubic hair.</li>
      <li>i love the way to get the pubic hair off i love to be smooth</li>
      <li>Unlike the other reviews I had a great experience, go for it!</li>
      <li>also I do not recommend re applying after first application because the nair can get into open hair follicles and its not going to feel to great!!</li>
      <li>Fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from Walmart and it has worked perfectly fine</li>
      <li>In 6 minutes my bikini area was smooth and hair free.</li>
      <li>I like to save money and don&#x27;t enjoy the idea of waxing the bikini areas, so I tried out this product.</li>
      <li>so I have to get used to whats available now.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I reapplied after the first coat, and even more came off.</li>
      <li>Ugh I was so excited for this product</li>
      <li>The original formula works, though.</li>
      <li>It wiped clean in some place and did not in others.</li>
      <li>This product claims to be specially formulated for the bikini area.</li>
      <li>After a full 10 min, not one hair was removed.</li>
      <li>This container was only good for 3 applications.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was no bad odor</li>
      <li>i love to be smooth at young age.</li>
      <li>I quickly wiped it off of that spot.</li>
      <li>In general, it&#x27;s little more effective than shaving, but It&#x27;s nice to avoid shaving in bikini areas so as not to make hairs around there thicker, and I follow with a hair inhibitor cream after I shower.</li>
      <li>I got the sensitive formula for the top and sides of my bikini area.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if it was worth my money since I still get irritated and get ingrown hairs for a couple days afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with other similar products, but this one worked Wonderfully.</li>
      <li>would say this is the perfect product for men and women who are not exactly looking for the constant upkeep that shaving requires or the fear and pain that waxing could incorporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you will run out pretty quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve told you like four times now, let&#x27;s make it five just to be thorough like the nuclear wasteland that is my nether regions right now:</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I did find out that my old tried and true Veet for sensitive skin is still available its just the packaging that changed.  </li>
      <li>I dont like the product Very Much .</li>
      <li>thank you very much Shane...</li>
      <li>The sensitive skin formula was a nice alternative to the regular, which was much too strong for me, but these creams in general HAVE to be strong to work.</li>
      <li>I used this product, exactly as directed.</li>
      <li>I tried this product on myself and it did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
      <li>really enough in the bottle to use more than twice&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
      <li>I was able to return it and get my money back.  </li>
      <li>Not one hair was taken off and my skin did get irritated though not visibly at first.</li>
      <li>(I have thicker hair) but the next day I ran a razor over it just to be sure.</li>
      <li>First, I would tell you (based on experience) figure something else out.  </li>
      <li>I barely had any hair and my hair is a fine texture</li>
      <li>never tried it before, but I&#x27;m so glad that I did, works so lovely on my eyebrows and other facial area,</li>
      <li>They came off really well</li>
      <li>I learned that you really have to cake that stuff on</li>
      <li>It was very uncorfortable and did not do as it said.</li>
      <li>Anyway, it works fast</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot Nair.</li>
      <li>It came before expected thats the only good thing about it.</li>
      <li>Hot water will open your pores and will likely be what causes most of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, Nair cream is surprisingly less potent than all Nair products I have tried before.</li>
      <li>Thicker strands you can still feel as nubs and hair grows back quickly.</li>
      <li>good product for somebody with very sensitive skin such as I did the job it&#x27;s supposed to do and did not irritate my skin one bit will definitely buy this again since it&#x27;s not sold in my local stores anymore</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions and applied a even thick coat and then waited the 6 minutes and all the hair came right off :)</li>
      <li>Anyway, I tested this one out on my bikini line due to that area being the most sensitive.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair; I follow the instructions and it takes a little bit of the hair off but mostly just leaves the hair stuck together</li>
      <li>There was a bit of a burning, but I figured it was normal.</li>
      <li>This is fine for touching up eyebrows or sideburns, but this is definitely not an ideal product for the bikini zone!</li>
      <li>So I decided to give this one a try after not being able to find my usual.  </li>
      <li>(luckily my skin didn&#x27;t burn like a lot of other people&#x27;s seem to have done).</li>
      <li>so I removed it early</li>
      <li>Just wow.</li>
      <li>Third, let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re just very stubborn, and you&#x27;ve went ahead and waited about 8 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Worked quit well in the sensitive areas, but needed to stay on for the Max amount of time.  </li>
      <li>Although each individual is different, it left him with no irritation and smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is completely ineffective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Most of the hair removed after about 8 min (I have thicker hair) but the next day I ran a razor over it just to be sure. Minimal pain... Tolerable for me. I reapplied after the first coat, and even more came off.</li>
    <li> Was this supposed to take off hair...because it didn&#x27;t. I bought this because I was tired of ingrown hairs and itchy razor burn and all I got was a smelly cream. I even left it on for the max time of 10 minutes and nothing came off (luckily my skin didn&#x27;t burn like a lot of other people&#x27;s seem to have done). I would not recommend this product to anyone who has even the slightest coarse hair because it will not work.</li>
    <li> Ugh I was so excited for this product and it came with much disappointment. I barely had any hair and my hair is a fine texture and I applied, let sit for 10 and wiped. My results looks like a bad wax job that you wouldn&#x27;t even wish on your worst enemy. It wiped clean in some place and did not in others. I&#x27;m  left a blotchy mess. Plus the size of the tube is ridiculous. I mean it&#x27;s like 2 applications and that&#x27;s it. Great huh ?</li>
    <li> I left it on for the maximum of 10 minutes and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. I&#x27;ve used Nair Sensitive that wasn&#x27;t bikini and it worked better than this</li>
    <li> It works well. Removes majority of the hair when I leave it on for 8 minutes (max recommend time is 10) and I have really thick coarse hair. I wish the size was bigger. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation what so ever.</li>
    <li> Initially left it on for the suggested amount of time and it had no effect.  I got the same results after leaving it on for the maximum recommended time and almost twice that.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t work at all and just gave me ingrown hairs down there  :(</li>
    <li> No matter how long you keep it on (and it says do not exceed 10 mins) it does not remove the hair. I do not recommend the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; formula. The original formula works, though.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping to remove hair without waxing. It did remove the top hair but I was left with spikie poking hairs.  It was very uncorfortable and did not do as it said. I was happy with the way it was sent and everything just not the product itself.</li>
    <li> The hair wiped off without any problem or irritation. However, it only removed the hair to just above the skin, so it leaves little spiky hairs. It works great if you just want to keep the hair from poking out of a swim suit, not so great if you wanted it completely smooth.</li>
    <li> Tried this product out recently and I have to say it works great! I followed the instructions and applied a even thick coat and then waited the 6 minutes and all the hair came right off :) love this product no longer will I have to agonize over getting waxed! also I do not recommend re applying after first application because the nair can get into open hair follicles and its not going to feel to great!!</li>
    <li> I used this product, exactly as directed. There was a bit of a burning, but I figured it was normal. But before the time to clean it off came, it started seriously hurting so I removed it early and I was bleeding from my pores! There wasn&#x27;t even much to any hair missing, it was awful!</li>
    <li> Always gives me red bums everywhere and hurts</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me at all</li>
    <li> My first time using it was a little tricky. I got the sensitive formula for the top and sides of my bikini area. I learned that you really have to cake that stuff on so you will run out pretty quick. Nair was made to dissolve hair so it&#x27;s a pretty harsh chemical. That is why the skin becomes red and irritated even if you leave it on for the recommended amount of time. When you put a chemical on your skin that dissolves hair, it&#x27;s going to dissolve some of your skin too. Granted I did see hair wiping off but I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if it was worth my money since I still get irritated and get ingrown hairs for a couple days afterwards. Regardless, I will be trying to make the best of it and minimize the irritation as best as I can by using fragrance free lotions, ice or heat afterwards. As an FYI, do not rub nair into your skin at all. Just let it sit there. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again... I think I&#x27;ll just stick to shaving.</li>
    <li> I tried this after a recommendation from a family member. I am a african american female w not so coarse hair there. It was a wonderful product. Itleaves everything baby smooth! I think more should come in the tube however.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I&#x27;ve had issues with other similar products, but this one worked Wonderfully. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it...</li>
    <li> This product is not worth it because it does not get rid of all of the hair. It does get rid of the length of the hair, but leaves short spikes or \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; behind. What is the point of a hair removal cream if it doesn&#x27;t even do as good as a quick shave? I&#x27;m very disappointed. The stubble it left behind is enough to notice, but not enough to comfortably shave tomorrow without getting a razor burn. I hope no one stares at my crotch at the beach tomorrow afternoon. I&#x27;m going to be embarrassed all day.</li>
    <li> Item was squeezed and looks like a duplicate. Different packing box then other stores. But after using came to know that its a Fraud product and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> I like to save money and don&#x27;t enjoy the idea of waxing the bikini areas, so I tried out this product. It says to leave it on for no longer than 10 minutes and I did, it&#x27;s just that it left a couple hairs behind while it cleared off majority of it. It thins out the hairs and you will see it when you wipe it off with a cloth. I&#x27;ll stick with trimming.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work , tried it a few times and kept it on for a little bit longer than the required time once to see if it would make a difference and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> One generous application, wait 10 minutes, 95% of hair gone.  Incredible!  Will wait a few days and re-apply to see if rest of hair comes off.  Could have been uneven coverage on my part.  No pain as reported by some users. So far so good.  Very, very happy.  Will update if a bad reaction develops. I may never shave again.</li>
    <li> I did not buy it on amazon, I purchased mine at Target for a cheaper price ($3.xx) I was pretty hesitant after reading the bad reviews but I hate the razor feeling after shaving so I tried these and left them for 8 mins. They came off really well and I was super impressed! BUT --- after cleaning up and I took a shower it kinda burned. Rate 1-5, I would say a 2.5. All day it had a burn feeling but it didn&#x27;t bug me. I will use this forever now. No more shaving! Super happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this on your testicles. Don&#x27;t do it.  Don&#x27;t do it.  Don&#x27;t do it.  I&#x27;ve told you like four times now, let&#x27;s make it five just to be thorough like the nuclear wasteland that is my nether regions right now: don&#x27;t do it. The product does a great job, though.  No hair at all anymore.  I&#x27;m not one for scorched earth policies, however. Let&#x27;s assume you have already bought this for the express purpose of what I&#x27;ve told you not to do with it.  First, I would tell you (based on experience) figure something else out.  I&#x27;ve never tried waxing, but I could see that as being preferable to microwaving one&#x27;s testicles.  Second, let&#x27;s say that you have applied it.  Take it off IMMEDIATELY! Third, let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re just very stubborn, and you&#x27;ve went ahead and waited about 8 minutes.  Use the container to scrape off the product and/or the first few layers of your dissolved flesh.  Rinse with cold water.  Put ice cubes into a plastic bag, and wrap that with a thin T-shirt. Apply iced bag to ravaged, war torn area. Go to Amazon and warn other people of their impending doom.</li>
    <li> I definitely was amazed how woderful this product work. I will recommend this product to anyway. Its great works fast.</li>
    <li> I ended up having to leave this stuff on well past the recommended 10 minutes (see more like 30 minutes with multiple reapplications) I usually have very sensitive skin but I experienced zero burning with this product though (lucky I guess?) one of my pores started bleeding for like 5 seconds but stopped once I wiped it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it but I experienced no side effects from the product so I can&#x27;t speak for whether this would work for a majority of people or not.</li>
    <li> I have tried Nair products before, all of them having the issue of the overpowering odor that comes with the product. However, Nair cream is surprisingly less potent than all Nair products I have tried before. I tried this product on myself and it did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, only it beat the competition in a few aspects such as the following: 1) The cream causes the skin to not be so dry afterwards. 2) There was no irritation, this surprised me because the only other form of hair removal in the private area that I have tried is waxing and shaving. Shaving leaves shave bumps and waxing leaves chicken-skin irritation as well as the occasional ingrown hair. 3) As I have mentioned, the smell is not as overpowering as other products of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the men out there who are wondering if this product could work on you, it can. My boyfriend and I tested this product out together and it worked just as well on him as it did me. Although each individual is different, it left him with no irritation and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is the perfect product for men and women who are not exactly looking for the constant upkeep that shaving requires or the fear and pain that waxing could incorporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for delivery, the shipping was anything anyone could hope for. It was fast delivery (4 days before the due date) and it came in a very high quality, protective package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a completely satisfied customer and I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Waited 10 minutes and not much hair came off my bikini region. Throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from Walmart and it has worked perfectly fine but when I ordered it from here didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> I used this on my butt, I have very coarse hair and so I left it on for 10 minutes- the Max amount of time. The first time I was hairless without pain, but instead left me with hives the next day. the second time it did nothing- like at all. tried it with only 8 min. This time and nothing, at all, still have hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair; I follow the instructions and it takes a little bit of the hair off but mostly just leaves the hair stuck together and you end up having to use a razor to finish. Might just be my hair type; works well on my husband so could work for others. My hair is thick and it&#x27;s sensitive so I need a stronger product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  It is the best.  Not to give TMI, but I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair ( I don&#x27;t like looking like a prepubescent girl).  Anyway, it works fast and it&#x27;s non-irritating.  I use this about once a month and the tube lasts a few months.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I dont like the product Very Much . The Smell is Horrific. I Applied some to my arm to test it . Hair Was Not Removed . Then I Tried it on my private and it still didnt work But i&#x27;ve used The Nair Lotion and it Works Fine</li>
    <li> The sensitive skin formula was a nice alternative to the regular, which was much too strong for me, but these creams in general HAVE to be strong to work. No matter what your skin type, you should always follow instructions and test a small sample first to avoid bad allergic reactions, since everyone is different! This product definitely worked for me, but it only takes off a shallow layer of hair. Thicker strands you can still feel as nubs and hair grows back quickly. In general, it&#x27;s little more effective than shaving, but It&#x27;s nice to avoid shaving in bikini areas so as not to make hairs around there thicker, and I follow with a hair inhibitor cream after I shower. I also leave it on for 15 min instead of the &lt;10 min as I find it is more effective for me with a longer time and does so without irritation, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that unless you&#x27;re sure your skin can handle it. All in all, it does what it says, though I do wish the results lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Worked quit well in the sensitive areas, but needed to stay on for the Max amount of time.  This container was only good for 3 applications.</li>
    <li> Boy, what a disappointment! I hated Nair in the past, I don&#x27;t know why I thought this newer cream would be any different.  After a full 10 min, not one hair was removed. I thought maybe I should press a little harder with the damp washcloth. So after thatI started to bleed a little from my poors yet all hairs were still there! Now the area is irritated and I can&#x27;t even shave it away for fear of making the pain worse. Thanks a lot Nair. You still suck after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;I used Sally Hansen on my legs and underarms the same time and those areas are CLEAR OF HAIR, no smell, and no burning or bleeding. I should have spent the extra money that SH charges for the bikini cream and saved myself the pain and hassle of Nair. I don&#x27;t recommend and I have learned my lesson after trying in my teen years, twenty something, and now thrity something..Nair just doesn&#x27;t work and smells bad.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I would. This was a total waste of money. It came before expected thats the only good thing about it. But the package that it was in was open and so was the box, idk if that&#x27;s from the postal office or not but either I didn&#x27;t like that. And I&#x27;ve used it in two different places on my body and neither places was the hair removed. This product is horrible. I usually post pictures of the products I buy but I don&#x27;t feel like doing one for this one because it was just a waste of my time.</li>
    <li> i love the way to get the pubic hair off i love to be smooth i feel very clean with no pubic hair. i love to be smooth at young age. thank you very much Shane...</li>
    <li> I used this product in the shower and loved it.  The green tea makes my skin feel softer after shaving and it eliminated the burning I sometimes get with other products.  Even though I used a less expensive razor, I still didn&#x27;t notice any razor bumps like I did with some of the other brands. It smells great too.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job removing unwanted hair, and does not cause any discomfort!</li>
    <li> This bikini cream by Nair really works great. It smells good and is easy to apply and use. In 6 minutes my bikini area was smooth and hair free. No itching or burning. No razor burn or stubble. I will never wax again. This is my go-to bikini line hair removal product!</li>
    <li> Just wow. Thought it was gonna work but I guess not.</li>
    <li> good product for somebody with very sensitive skin such as I did the job it&#x27;s supposed to do and did not irritate my skin one bit will definitely buy this again since it&#x27;s not sold in my local stores anymore</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst depilatory cream I have ever used.  It is completely ineffective. I left it on for the highest recommended time of 10 minutes.  I may as well have lathered myself up with my body wash and expected it to remove the hair. The Nair did NOTHING.  Nothing was removed. This product claims to be specially formulated for the bikini area. This is obviously a fraudulent clam. I will be getting a bikini wax ASAP.  I&#x27;ll never waste my money on this product again, and if you read this review then save yourself 10 wasted minutes you&#x27;ll never get back and your $4.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it was the eases way to solve the shaving pain, it is no at all. Fist i doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair and second it burn and hurts afterwards. It&#x27;s just a waist of money!</li>
    <li> Best cream ever! I am an african American female with thick brown hair and it removed evey single hair. I put a thick coat of the creme and I did it two different times. I will not be shaving ever again. Love it. Unlike the other reviews I had a great experience, go for it!</li>
    <li> Man this Nair bikini sensitive is awesome….I&#x27;ve never tried it before, but I&#x27;m so glad that I did, works so lovely on my eyebrows and other facial area, no burn, oh yeah.</li>
    <li> I got a terrible clitoral abscess from this that had to be surgically removed! Do NOT USE THIS! Medical student, followed the directions to a tee, terrible results. Stay away!!!</li>
    <li> I got this and figured since it says it is for the bikin area and for sensative skin it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. Well I left it on for 5 minutes not even as long as they state on the directions and in one part near my leg it burned so bad I quickly wiped it off of that spot. I noticed it didn&#x27;t take any hair off so I put it back on except for that part (I thought maybe it was irritated prior to using the product cause the other parts didn&#x27;t burn). Left it on for the time the directions say and nothing came off no hair at all! What a waste of money and now the next day that spot still burns like if I got really bad sunburn. Don&#x27;t use this product it does not work!</li>
    <li> This is by far the greatest product of its kind on the market right now. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, and when I use the product I have shaved a few days prior to make sure the hair is very short. However, it has not worked the few times I have used it. I have almost gone through the entire package, and not once has it removed all of the hairs. All of the times I have let it sit for 10 minutes. Except for once, it actually has removed ZERO hairs. I&#x27;m not sure if it because this is a sensitive formula or what, but this stuff not only stinks to high heaven, but it doesn&#x27;t work. The one time it sort of work, it was patchy, and some areas were bald, the rest... :( I&#x27;m not sure if I am not making a thick enough application or what. If I go any thicker to bottle wuld last two applications. That&#x27;s just stupid.</li>
    <li> This is fine for touching up eyebrows or sideburns, but this is definitely not an ideal product for the bikini zone! You&#x27;d have better results with a razor than this.</li>
    <li> So I decided to give this one a try after not being able to find my usual.  Its been a while since I&#x27;ve used any of the creams so I have to get used to whats available now.  I hate it when good products are discontinued!! Anyway, I tested this one out on my bikini line due to that area being the most sensitive. I left it on for 6 minutes and had to wipe it off due to a burn that was starting.  That should have been long enough for the cream to remove the little bit of hair growth I put it on.  Not one hair was taken off and my skin did get irritated though not visibly at first. The next day when I looked at the area, my skin was slightly red and dry.  This has to be the worst sensitive skin formula I&#x27;ve ever tried. Fortunately, I did find out that my old tried and true Veet for sensitive skin is still available its just the packaging that changed.  I only wish I would have known that before I wasted my money on this.  I was able to return it and get my money back.  But if your looking for a cream that you have to leave on forever that may still not work even then, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Not only did this not remove any hair, I actually started bleeding when I went to take it off about 8 minutes later...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and yes it stinks but it gets the job done without razor bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This worked well enough but I still had to go back over the area with a razor to remove what remained. I only left it for the minimum time. I didn&#x27;t apply twice, having read the reviews prior to trying the product. The product did not cause irritation or red bumps. I do recommend a person follow the directions when they say use lukewarm water to wipe of the cream. Hot water will open your pores and will likely be what causes most of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no bad odor&lt;br /&gt;What was removed was removed well&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not remove all the hair&lt;br /&gt;Did not remove all the hair&lt;br /&gt;Not really enough in the bottle to use more than twice&lt;br /&gt;Did not remove all the hair</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how this is working so perfect for people.It was a waste of money.I used it as directed and hardly any hair came off so I left it on a few more minutes and no difference.All in all I am now left with prickles and chemical burn on my groin.POS do not buy.Seriously.I think the good reviews on it are fake.</li>
