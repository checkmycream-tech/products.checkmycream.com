<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have NOT purchased it from Amazon, but I received it as a gift from my mother-in-law this Christmas. Prior to this, I rarely ever wore scents as they were either overpowering, or too sickly sweet. This is the most perfect scent, so much so that my mother who is allergic to nearly everything, can stay around me without an issue. I noticed that the scent does tend to fade after a day of wear, so I remedied that by applying a small amount of Vaseline to the area before spritzing on a little of Shi. Stays all day now :)</li>
    <li> this is a very lovely fragrance</li>
    <li> I had this fragrance years ago, glad that I purchased it again. I has a nice floral fragrance that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent and price. will def get again.</li>
    <li> This is a regular fragrance I purchase.  It is a clean fresh scent that you can wear anytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. I like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long... not at all..</li>
    <li> This is a light and fresh Eau de Parfum.Very flowery. I bought it although I had never smelled it because I already have Sung and Pure by Alfred Sung and I like them both. You cannot buy this as a gift because it is a tester and comes in a plain cardboard box and has no cap on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Item as described. The wife loved it!</li>
    <li> Very clean smell. Light not overwhelming . First time buyer after smelling it at booth. The price is a big plus. Could easily pay 50 for it if I didn&#x27;t see it here.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to my wife. She liked it and this spray or my attention made her happy that day. It&#x27;s not expensive stuff to get a little pleasure to someone. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, and if people are standing close to me I&#x27;ll often get compliments on it&#x27;s scent.  It does wear off quickly though, even using five or six sprays when I apply it.  The price here on Amazon is an excellent deal - I bought my first bottle at Nordy&#x27;s for three times as much.</li>
    <li> Watered down version. NOT as expected. Almost no scent. Very disappointed. Bought his many times and the scent is definitely not what I purchased in the department stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume to replace my mom&#x27;s empty bottle of Shi. I was worried that this fragrance would differ from the original because it was coming from Amazon. However, the fragrance was spot on. Bravo Amazon! I would order a fragrance from them again.</li>
    <li> Love it the size for the price is amazing</li>
    <li> This item was shipped very timely &amp; it was in perfect condition, brand new in an undamaged box. I would gladly recommend this item &amp; user to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a perfume shop a long time ago and since then it has been one of my staple fragrances. Theres nothing on the market that smells quite like it and people are always asking me what I&#x27;m wearing. To me it smells like the ocean with lots of sea salt; kind of contradictory to what the description says. Regardless, one of the best scents out there and at an unbeatable price. I paid triple when I bought it at the perfume shop.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume and the top had broken during shipment and it leaked out a little. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it very much anyway. I&#x27;ve worn it about a week and haven&#x27;t touched it since. It smells cheap to me (it was cheap hah) it doesn&#x27;t make me go crazy to smell it more and more like perfumes I like. I think I will end up using this for a restroom deodorizer or something.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these, one to give as a gift to my sister and both of us agree, this perfume does not last half an hour. I dont think it is the real thing. Too bad for me it has been d/c at stores and thought I scored when I found it on Amazon. Dont even care to use it anymore it just sits inmy  perfume cabinet and everytime I see it gets me upset that it is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 3 times!! once for myself and twice for friends who loved the scent on me! It is beautiful, soft and feminine. the service from Fragrance net is wonderful as well......you will not regret this purchase</li>
    <li> IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE.SHE LOVES THIS .WAS TIRED OF INFLATED PRICES PAID AT THE MALL ,SO I TRIED ORDERING.FAIR PRICING AS ADVERTIZED-WOULD RECCOMEND</li>
    <li> Shi is one of my favorite scents.  I was soooooooo happy it arrived 3 days prior to Christmas. It was scheduled to arrive 2 days after Christmas. I opened my package and immediately put some on.  I already had the lotion so I used that on my arns to layer the scent which made it last longer.  I will order other products from this vendor.  Thanks for the fast service!</li>
    <li> OMG my FAV for years..</li>
    <li> I love the perfume and always purchased it from the same place then they did not stock it anymore.  I looked at numerous places but could not find it except at a very high price.  I tried the internet and was very pleased to find the perfume and at a much cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume a lot, I just wish it would last a little longer. Seems that I don&#x27;t smell it after a few hours...</li>
    <li> Love the smell....first last very long though</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  You can rock this on the weekends or wear it for dress up occasions!  It lasts ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this perfume over 5 years ago and I have been wearing it ever since. It is currently not for sale in department stores...so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a fraction of the cost!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the description and was not dissappointed! It smells great!! It is light and not overpowering. It is impressive looking as well. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for several years now and NEVER get tired of it!  It is a feminine, clean, soft scent, and not flowery.  It smells even better as the day goes on!  I get so many compliments on this scent and people asking what I have on.  My dentist complimented me just yesterday! :)  I am shocked that amazon sells it for this cheap because it costs about $50.00 at the store!  So glad I found it online. Will be ordering it from now on!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Macys do not carry it anymore, so I am very happy that I found it on Amazon. It arrived quickly, the packaging is great and I love the fresh scent. I would recomend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Scent lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite!</li>
    <li> One time in my past, I wore Shi almost exclusively for nearly 6 months. It is an inoffensive, light floral that is relatively long-lasting. The water lily gives it a translucent, watery quality. The orange blossom does not dominate. The base wears really well. All the \\&quot;like\\&quot; thumbs-up ratings are a true indication of just how nice Shi is overall: Shi appeals to almost anyone but probably won&#x27;t push anyone to extremes (love or hate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually tired of Shi and really struggled to finish the bottle. I replaced it with Omnia Crystalline, which is along the same lines but better imo, but I tired of Crystalline too. In a certain way, I regret not having a bottle of Shi (or, Crystalline) around anymore. Both are easygoing scents that are great for summer, the office, casual outings, and the outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large bottles of Shi are pretty darn cheap. A bottle is a low-risk purchase at current prices - an easy blind buy that&#x27;s also highly gift-able.</li>
    <li> I am not the biggest perfume wearer, and have a few go tos that I usually wear like Bvlgari Blv, Burberry Weekend and Brit, this has blown those out of the water and is my new favourite.  It is a lovely clean modern scent that is not too heavy for daytime wear and mellows nicely. I would definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature scent for a few years. It&#x27;s light enough to wear during the day and it still feels special at night. I get compliments on it all the time. I hope I don&#x27;t ever have to stop using it!!</li>
    <li> When you find a perfume that men constantly compliment you on, you know you found a keeper. This has been my staple perfume for years now... it is hard to find a new scent, and this one continuously pulls in the compliments! One thing to remember, perfume does go bad and stale... so use it while you can, and replace after a year.</li>
    <li> The smell is very relaxing and very elegant. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews i brought this Parfum and i felt great from first spray. Fresh flower scene i would recommend this Parfum.</li>
    <li> I love this Parfum and never tire of it while there are so many out there, this one is still my favorite.  Its fresh and light simply wonderful!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product does not seem as long lasting and as strong as same item purchesed in major department store</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear Shi, people ask what it is and say they love its subtlety.  It doesn&#x27;t scream -- it whispers.</li>
    <li> I normally pay a lot of money for this perfume and I got a Fantastic BARGAIN!!! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SHI for over 5 or more years now &amp; I never get tired of the scent. I get compliments ALL the time from men &amp; women!! It&#x27;s great for work &amp; also a night out in the town..if you love soft scents that last through out the day then this is the one for you...I usually buy a few bottles &amp; place them in the fridge so they keep freash &amp; crisp it also helps them last much longer then keeping them at room temp...at this price why not!...Enjoy..;)0</li>
    <li> Love this beautiful fragrance! One of my favorites!! It&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable! It&#x27;s a very clean and fresh scent! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> SHI IS A  VERY GOOD SMELLING PERFUME WITH A VERY SOFT SMELL IT CLIMGS TO YOUR BODY AN LINGERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  MS PATRICIA A HARRIS</li>
    <li> Great scent, it&#x27;s perfect for Spring</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all time! I love that I can still find it!</li>
    <li> not only does it look good, it smells good too.  Make sure you test at a department store prior to purchasing so you know what it smells like.  The going price in a department store is about $50, so for the $23 I paid for it, it is definitely worth it! 3.4 ounces may not sound like a lot, but it is a hefty bottle of perfume that I predict will last me more than a year (I have about 20 bottles of perfume)  The bottle is stylish and different, easy to open.  The scent lasts for HOURS, is a bit strong, so you dont need much.  Try it on your wrists and ankles for the first day to get acclimated to it.  I found that when I first got it, I sprayed it on my neck and it gave me a bit of a headache, but love it none the less, and I dont spray it under my nose :)  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do!  Packaging was secure.  No complaints on shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Long time a go I bought her the first one she tried to purchase another kind but she ended getting back to this one and I like it too on her.</li>
    <li> I use Chanel Allure, DKNY Be Delicious, Michael Kors Michael regularly and Shi is fast becming my regular scent too. I needed a fragrance that worked well for day wear and would not over-power people around me yet stayed on all day. Shi works perfectly - it&#x27;s a modern and clean scent - floral with musky undertones, very soft and feminine but strong enough to linger all day. Just to give you an idea of similar \\&quot;blue\\&quot; fragrances there is D&amp;G Light Blue which is great for day wear but a little too light for me, and also Davidoff&#x27;s Cool water which is fresh but a little less floral than Shi. Shi works perfectly for me, and I love the composition, it has a very calming effect on me.&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes- Water Lily, Fig Leaves.&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes - Orange Blossom, Fragipani.&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes - Water Musks, Silver Birch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume bottle shaped like a droplet of water balances all aspects of yin very well - metal, wood and water in its design. It even has a dark wood base to rest it on. The companion perfume is Hei (the yang elements) which is for men. This perfume is available for a great price here on Amazon, it&#x27;s more expensive everywhere else I&#x27;ve seen it.</li>
    <li> Shi is a wonderful fragrance--light and fresh, but substantial-smelling at the same time. And it lasts for a nice while. Great shopping experience here on Amazon--my order got here quickly, and I could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about why this product was so cheap but when it arrived in the mail, everything was fine.  In the past a black little wooden block (used as a stand for the perfume) would come with it but I did not see it in this one so not sure if they stopped including this piece in all their packaging.  I personally didn&#x27;t care too much for it.  I would definitely order from Amazon again.  That would mean I save $30 than to spend $60 purchasing directly from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great price!  One of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> underwhelmed. scent fades quick.</li>
    <li> Bought this for me wife for Christmas but ended up giving it to my mother and she really loved it.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles and still paid less than 1 would have costed retail!  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This fragrance makes people ask you, what is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing?  I had never heard of it before, but now it&#x27;s my favorite.  Great job offering great prices on extraordinary products!</li>
    <li> this fragrance is my absolute favorite. its feminine but not overpowering, lovely and soft but refreshing as opposed to powdery. please try it on yourself first though its the only way to really tell if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This product arrived as advertised.  It was brand new - packaging intact.  The scent is awesome and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this parfume and buy it all the time...very nice light scent not over powering or too flowery....I love it and will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this perfume while out in a nightclub in the late &#x27;90&#x27;s.  I always equated it with how young, sexy women should smell.  It is a clean scent that reminds me of a perfect early Summer day, warm but cool, breezy but calm.  It is fruity and and spicy, but very light and crisp, not overbearing or powerful.    When my wife wears this scent I immediately fall for her all over again, because it will always remind me of when we were younger.  Shi is perfect for younger women and for older ladies who still feel young...it puts a spring in your step and exudes a sexiness of young love.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1Z19M Shi By Alfred Sung For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces]]    This is one of the most beautiful fragrances by Alfred Sung.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Great gift with scent</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it lasts. It&#x27;s clean, fresh and floral and can be worn at work or play.</li>
    <li> This is great for daytime use. This clean, clear, lightly floral perfume always bring me good moods in busy days. A black wood seat came with this perfume and it enhanced the simple water drop bottle design. This price is also a great bargain!</li>
    <li> The frangrance reminds me of Bath and Body Works Moonlight Path.  However, the scent lasts much longer!  It&#x27;s great as an evening perfume.</li>
    <li> I hated when they stopped selling this in the stores and I checked Amazon and there it was, and cheaper too.  I love the scent Shi has, it gives me that fresh scent.  It&#x27;s not over powering as some perfumes that enter the door before you even get there.  It is soft, clean, and very feminine, and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> 1st time i used it about 5 years ago. i didn&#x27;t come back to this fragrance since then. I&#x27;ve ordered it now and i&#x27;m realizing that this smell is one those you are not tired of - it&#x27;s fresh,wears out nicely a little sweet, and has a little bitter side. Not too heavy, not too strong, but still noticeable and very bold, recognizable, wears out nicely - after a long day you still smell it.For the price Amazon offered it is a must have.</li>
    <li> Great light smell. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of shi by Alfred Sung but this is not it.  I took a gamble and bought this product through a merchant on amazon and lost.  I was running out and this was sold at a bargain, arrived on time and had mixed reviews.  Yep, one of those foolish moves.  I should have returned the item but it was too much of a hassle.  As a person who relies on reviews, I felt obligated to let others know to purchase this product through this vendor with some caution.  The scent of the item received is very close to shi but it (1) lacks the sweet floral musk after notes, (2) has a pungent after note that smells like alcohol, and (3)  the perfume is not long lasting.  It&#x27;s not terrible but it was noticeably different to me especially when I compared it to what I had left from the legitimate bottle.  Until then, I&#x27;m spritzing away with hopes that the scent may change to the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years and Blue Scandal had it for half of what I usually pay. Will definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent but my boy friend found it sexy&lt;br /&gt;and I got it on the third day I ordered it&lt;br /&gt;great speed</li>
    <li> Ideal scent for women which can be worn day or night.  I bought this as a gift for my sister. I love the compliments I get when I wear this scent.</li>
    <li> A little too sweet and feminine for me and I am going to give it as a gift to someone coz. it is a lil sweet for me but definitely some ultra feminine types would love this product.</li>
    <li> to me, this is one of the best fragrances i have ever owned BUT it wears off quickly. wears more like edt rather than edp... but i would definately recommend it for the price alone.</li>
    <li> Very light, very pleasing.  Soft, delicate, floral fragrance.  It&#x27;s not for those that require a bold fragrance.  Excellent pricing here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a feeling it&#x27;s not the original.  I saw this at Ulta and the scent was alot different and definitely held on longer than this bottle.  It was a gift for my mom and she tells me that the scent does not last as long.  I tried it on my and I can definitely see that. I&#x27;m kind of disapointed.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I have been looking for this sent for about 3 years. It is nice to find it at a good price without having the issues of department stores.</li>
    <li> My old time favorite, will never go out of style. The scent I&#x27;d like no other</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, light scent for the office, or day time, and it lasts longer than many of the more expensive brands. I would recommend either Alfred Sung Shi, or Alfred Sung Forever to any of my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance!  It is light, just a tad sweet.  Not overpowering!  I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong fragrances, but I can wear this one.  I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, great price!!! I recommend anyone who likes a light, sweet, floral fragrance to try Shi, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent that lasts and isn&#x27;t overbearing! All time favorite!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume. I love the price versus buying at 3x the cost at the mall.</li>
    <li> Oooooh, this smells so good, lasts all day! Light clean scent - arrived on time brand new in sealed package.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my self for my Christmas and I was not disappointed, where forever is gorgeous, this has a clean crisp scent, i love it.</li>
    <li> First, I didn&#x27;t know that I could not return this. Second, I did not think the scent was &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; as described.</li>
    <li> i have loved this perfume for years.  did not expect the bottles to be so big. had neighbors to ask for one of them. NO!</li>
    <li> Everyone I have introduced to this scent has made it a favorite. Indescribable.  Not musky, nor floral, nor citrusy but a good combination light intermediate scent.</li>
    <li> Second purchase on this perfume.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but it has a wonderful smell.  You just have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Very good for women and my family really enjoyed this item and the smell is very good!!! And I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I adore this perfume. I used to wear it a lot about 10 years ago, but had a hard time finding it after finishing college. It&#x27;s a great size for the price and the perfume lasts a while. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Its very go od n a rare scent.its ril y a must have for ladies n it lasts long on you evn after hours of using it</li>
    <li> OMG! this is my all time favorite perfume. I use it everyday and have gotten many compliments on it. Plus it&#x27;s inexpensive! Trust me and get this perfume. You won&#x27;t regret it! and if you do... then there&#x27;s probably something wrong with you. It comes in a small box with the word &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; written in Chinese (for those you who are wondering what it means). You don&#x27;t need to spray too much of it in order for others to smell it. I guarantee you that you will get at least a couple compliments about the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, Wife loved the bottle design which I didn&#x27;t think much of when buying this. The scent was even better not to flowery just enough hint of it with other feminine scents that i and my wife liked.</li>
    <li> Just what my niece wanted. Great smell, not heavy, pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time. May last about 6 hours but that&#x27;s good enough. You do not have to spray too much to get the reaction you want from others. Will always buy this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect light PERFUME To be used for on all occasions! It also lasts a long time and it&#x27;s very fresh smelling. I would also recommend buying from this seller, I actually received in&lt;br /&gt;It in 1 day instead if the 2 day Prime. I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is wrong with this but I do know this is not real Alfred Sung Shi. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for 10 years and this is the first purchase of Amazon. I went to use it the first time and it just stinks. Not the same as Shi you&#x27;d buy in store which probably explains why it&#x27;s so much cheaper. Smells somewhat like Shi but there is definitely something defective or fake about this perfume. I would have given zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. I haven&#x27;t seen it in years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It is very light and natural and clean smelling. Not sweet or musky at all. Very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;I wore this in my late 20&#x27;s and now I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Received this item prior to the expected delivery date and it exceeded my expectations! Especially for the price and I will be buying more as gifts!</li>
    <li> The price of the product was the best I have ever found.  The speed at which it was recieved was 2 days.  So I was very worried about what I would recieve, but it was brand new in the box.  I would rate this purchase and service the best I have ever delt with.  I recommended it to all my friends.  I give it 5 stars out of 5 stars and will use Amazon again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume ever! It has an amazing very light smell. It&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. Great for the small price.</li>
    <li> Bought if for myself.  My mom discovered it and decided she had to have it. Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Light and clean.  I love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfums and hard to find.  I Sure wish they were still producing this fragrance.</li>
    <li> this is something that my daughter wanted for Christmas gift.  I opened it and it does smell real nice. packaged good</li>
    <li> I began using sung in the mid 1990&#x27;s. I love the light YIN properties of sung. I came across SHI, in 2000. This was a fragrance,that would have MEN running up to me, and asking what is that, or looking for a long period of time. I ordered a bottle, and my husband, said &amp;#34; you are trying to get laid, tonight&amp;#34;, with a naughty smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a HOMERUN fragrance, if you like clean, and light powdery scents, with floral mid notes. last about 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a perfect, sexy fragrance, that EVERY pretty girl, should try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is great, considering, I remember paying around $50.00 per bottle</li>
    <li> Clean smelling without being overpowering...love it!!</li>
    <li> I shall order again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the summer season, but it smells too sweet and warm. It feels like eating a scoop of sugar. Maybe it should not be called Shi. I don&#x27;t think I will use it until winter.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite perfume!!!!!  I was told that this item had been discontinued a few years ago. So glad to find it again on amazon.  Just took a chance and typed in the product.  Yes!!</li>
    <li> It was recommend to me.  I was fast I ordered the toilette spray.  So next time I&#x27;m  going to get the perfume.  But it is still lovely!!!</li>
    <li> This is not Shi by Alfred Sung.  It must be some kind of cheap knock-off.  The color is wrong (clear, instead of blueish) and I could tell the smell was off the minute I sprayed it.  Very sad and disappointed and it cannot be returned, so I am out the money.  That&#x27;s what I get for buying fragrance, online from Amazon.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the price on this. I haven&#x27;t worn it in about 13 year, and it smells better than I remember. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent...and so do I. I picked it out at Kohls because I liked the smell and I am the person smelling her the majority of the time haha. She loves it too and has told me she has gotten compliments on it. It is way better priced on amazon so I got it here when she ran out the first time. I will continue getting this scent for years to come!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Light and airy.</li>
    <li> great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it soooo much</li>
    <li> A light scent perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> Collected today and the smell is amazing! Will surely buy again. Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a great daytime fragrance, since it&#x27;s light with just a hint of grapefruit mixed in.  Quickly became my number 1 choice for the office.</li>
    <li> I love my perfume, it came in the mail right on time, there were no problems what so ever!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying it very well. I love this fragrance. one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s second favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Another great value for the size of the bottle of perfume. I was happy to find it because it is hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s used it for years, and this was a restock of her cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good perfume, decent price, shipped fast.  Cool!</li>
    <li> I am a perfume Junkie! I think I use most of my money on perfumes. With that said this is one of my favorite perfumes. Its not overpowering, its romantic, sweet, floral draws people (men) to you! At least that has been my experience. I discovered it in 2007 and almost finished with my 5th bottle. That is how much I love it! Will continue buying forever!</li>
    <li> It was great I love it</li>
    <li> Love&#x27;d perfume, price and service.</li>
    <li> Looooooove this perfume! I don&#x27;t want to use any of my others right now. Really not much else. I do spray on a couple times a day. That&#x27;s usually the same for any brand of perfume I wear.</li>
    <li> cheap perfume in every way.&lt;br /&gt;we use it as a bathroom spray now. Not good to use as perfume. do not recommend</li>
    <li> I have always bought this perfurm from a store and then saw the price with Amazon and thought, great price. I was very disappointed because the manufactered one lasts all day and this one I bought with amazon was a fake! This happend with the Ralph Lauren Romance as well. The fragance did not last more than 2 hours for both. I just couldn&#x27;t believe it! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My lady loved it! I love it too. Its soft but it lasts all day and all night *wink wink ;-)</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t smell as good as the men Alfred Sung Hei. I hope they improve this product to smell as good as the men version.</li>
    <li> this perfume is nice ---but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  probablly will not buy again</li>
    <li> Love the subtle hint of scent that this perfume has. It has a lasting effect too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume almost 10 years. It doesn&#x27;t matter where I am I always have people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s subtle but not overpowering and it last all day. Paradise is my second favorite!</li>
    <li> Everyone wants to know what is that scent you have on.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and is hard to find locally its always sold out. Super fast shipping and everything was as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my wife for Xmas and love the smell. I have a hard time keeping my hands off her when she is wearing it. Oh, she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean and fresh. Great price. Fast delivery too</li>
    <li> Love it been looking for this scent for years</li>
    <li> People always ask me what i&#x27;m wearing. I will definitely purchase another bottle once the one I currently have runs out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister who loves it so much she only wears this smell.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, if you like super feminine floral perfume you will love this.Ive had lots of compliments when I&#x27;ve worn this.</li>
    <li> Fine.I don&#x27;t have time to write extensive reviews on everything I buy from Amazon or anyone else these days.My wife has been using this perfume for several years.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, this is one of the best scents by Alfred Sung. You can wear this from the morning and it lasts through out the day. I always get complements about this perfume,plus I always have an extra bottle in hand so I will not run out of it. You will definitely love this.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the smell.  Last pretty good..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for 11 years! It may have been out longer than that but that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve known and loved it. It&#x27;s crisp, fresh, but has a luxurious smell that is all its own. It&#x27;s a timeless scent that I&#x27;m sure to keep enjoying for years to come. And I have the best nose when it comes to quality fragrance. Trust me ladies :-)</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have ever worn &amp; have been for around 10 years. I get so many compliments from both men &amp; women. Did they really discontinue it? I went to buy another bottle &amp; was told that it&#x27;s no longer made. Last time I bought Shi was over 2 years ago because I got 3 bottles, which have lasted that long for me. I just ordered a bottle on Amazon &amp; hope it&#x27;s the same great product. Tears if they really did discontinue Shi!</li>
    <li> Smells like you just got out of the shower! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> Love this cool smell and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
    <li> If you love romantic scents this perfume is for you. Great price and long lasting. I get many compliments on this lovely frangrance!</li>
    <li> My wife put this on and got several compliments.  As soon as I gave her this perfume she said it was great.  That&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It is my new obsession - very fresh citrus-floral scent, makes me feel the spring. Just to help in selection: I love floral unobtrusive preferably cool scents like Marc Jacobs (everything), I also love Aqua di Goia by Armani, White Linen by Estee Lauder, Eclat d&#x27;Arpege by Lanvin, Lalique&#x27;s Fleur de Crystal. Shi resembles Marc Jacobs perfumes a lot, especially I find it quite similar to DOT, but a bit greener (I can smell the fig leaf note on my hair, just a little bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is produced by house of Elizabeth Arden. As for the staying power -  the smell is quite light, but I can smell it quite well on my hair after 4-5 hours , but it disappears from my wrist in an hour or so. However, I have not noticed any difference from my other fragrances, so I would not say it is weak or more like EDT.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, and I&#x27;ve purchased it twice now. It smells just as nice as the more expensive brands, and the price is unbelievable. It has a nice, light, airy smell- for those of us who don&#x27;t like heavy fragrances. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Nice, light and fresh scent. Great for summer. This is my second bottle. I am enjoying it and getting compliments on the scent. I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume because most scents are too heavy.</li>
    <li> Smells great, my wife really liked it but she says it doesn&#x27;t have staying power. It may not be the real thing, who knows.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume a number of years back and it was one of my favorites back then. Its light, fresh and clean. You know how certain smells bring back certain memories? This one brings back the pleasant carefree times during my early 20&#x27;s. I always got a lot of compliments on it back then. I love it and so does my fiancé.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 2-3 years now and I never get tired of it. It&#x27;s light, floral, not sweet and cloying. Just a light fresh scent that goes with everything. I had first tried Sung, also by Alfred Sung, a Chinese designer, which was a bit of a heavier scent. I prefer Shi (pronounced She), and I have received many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME.WAS REALLY INEXPENSIVE.</li>
    <li> Great product; great service delivery</li>
    <li> gave this as a Valentine&#x27;s present and was not disappointed. Received a lot of compliments from my sweetheart. Great price for  the money.</li>
    <li> She didnt like it (80years).  It figures that if I deviated from her hints that I would be so rewarded.</li>
    <li> I can clearly see why this fragrance is typically on a top 10 list of best perfumes.  it is absolutely wonderful, and very affordable.  So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice smell get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> Gave to my daudhter as a gift. She loved it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Shi smells like you stepped right out of an ethereal spring and were scrubbed up with citrus blossoms and water lilies by tiny, winged, magical creatures. Yeah…it is like that. You can expect  a young and fresh floral scent that is light with hints of fruitiness, but not pre-teen young and not too floral like an elderly woman’s perfume you’d smell at a funeral or at church. It is a perfect every day scent.</li>
    <li> cheap, smells good, and stylish. Good accomplished.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and am happy to find it at such a good price.  This is what I wear when I want something slightly soapy and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
    <li> Excellent value - prompt delivery</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume, and gets it over and over. That is about all that needs to be said. I bought it for her as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have my doubts about it being authentic....&lt;br /&gt;from the size of bottle and price I paid...a knock off?  Not sure if I would use your company again....</li>
    <li> Got here super fast smells excellent.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted will order again</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  Have been using it for years!!  Unfortunately it is getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> I was given this perfume as a Christmas present a long time ago.  I recently ran out, and thought I had to get more.  Some of the stores I was at did not have the fragrance, but luckily I found it on Amazon.  Smells wonderful! And the smell lingers for a good amount of time.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I asked a co-worker what she was wearing because I loved the fragrance she was wearing and it was this so I ordered it. I love it and find it light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;shi\\&quot; for years so when I saw the dark picture on Amazon I was a bit skeptical, it appeared to be darker than I was used to seeing. When it arrived, I was so happy!&lt;br /&gt;The actual bottle and product was fine. Thankfully, it looked nothing like the bad picture on the site. It was a bonus to see that it was less than half of what I usually pay for the smaller size, so I  bought 2.</li>
    <li> I  get  compliments  all the  time  on  how  good I smell.  I love it!</li>
    <li> loved the price and perfume.</li>
    <li> I have worn this sent for several years and love it.  It&#x27;s my every day scent and the eau de parfum lasts all day.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents...clean and fresh. Shipped quickly and packaged professionally-would recommend</li>
    <li> I have been told many times even by small children who are the most honest people, that I smell PRETTY.  All because of this perfume</li>
    <li> very wonderful scent. Take it with me in my purse. It makes me feel good when I sniff it. Great shape and great price.</li>
    <li> I have used Shi for many years and have always gotten compliments on this very pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday perfume - lovely light scent. I love Alfred Sung products and this is one of my favorites along with Jewel.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  My signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ok but don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the scent.  Makes me sneeze.  Am sending back.</li>
    <li> Good value for money, great scent.</li>
    <li> Oh my I love this scent</li>
    <li> love their Sung, ok with Shi</li>
    <li> VERY GREAT PRODUCT INDEED. NOTHING BAD TO DECLARE. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Received in good order.</li>
    <li> Smells good. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Better then i thought.</li>
    <li> I like this scent but it seems to fade very quickly. Layering it sometimes helps it last a little longer</li>
</ol>
