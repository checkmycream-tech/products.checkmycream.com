      <li>I love this stuff been using it for a week now</li>
      <li>I am very excited to start seeing the oil working.</li>
      <li>But so far so good!</li>
      <li>This oil is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Has a menthol scent that very mild.</li>
      <li>or so I can be stretch mark free thanks to Elastic!!!</li>
      <li>This oil smells very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This has been a great product for stretch marks after pregnancy!I can&#x27;t wait to try other remedies!:)</li>
      <li>This product was packaged very well and arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I was willing to try anything!</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel super soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>who doesn&#x27;t love the potential to rid themselves of stretch marks!</li>
      <li>At first, you not gonna see the difference, just keep using it.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a small very easily transportable glass bottle which will be easy to take in my gym bag for application after workouts.</li>
      <li>The older scar was somewhat faded to begin with and has now really started to disappear, and the newer one, which was lumpy and bright pink, is now much smoother and lighter in color.</li>
      <li>Stretch marks are something that can never disappear completely, but this oil does a good job of minimizing their appearance and lightening the tone of them so that they&#x27;re less noticeable.</li>
      <li>it worked really well&lt;</li>
      <li>This Emu oil could do lot more, if I could get out bottle,  small whole!  </li>
      <li>I am having to review this just off of smell as I haven&#x27;t been able to use it long enough to see the maximum benefits BUT</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product to see what it could do for patches of dry skin (took care of them with no trouble)</li>
      <li>but in the process I also applied it to a couple of 1-2 year old surgical scars and am amazed by the results!</li>
      <li>Ive never used elastic before and after having two boys that left my body less than appealing</li>
      <li>I used this to clear up some scaring  </li>
      <li>So far my face seems to be getting smoother, not really sure if it&#x27;s helping my stretch marks as those are pretty light and not very big anyways</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed, the bottle is so tiny</li>
      <li>After applying this oil leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this oil as I have a few stretch marks from 3 kids but also some acne scars.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time, but I really have noticed a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for a couple of weeks and only use a few drops at a time - very fast and positive results!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s barely lasted me</li>
      <li>What I love about it is that though the bottle is so tiny, just a small dab of the content on the affected areas spread widely.</li>
      <li>This little number is very gentle on the skin.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time, but I really have noticed a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks! Stretch marks are something that can never disappear completely, but this oil does a good job of minimizing their appearance and lightening the tone of them so that they&#x27;re less noticeable. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This little number is very gentle on the skin. Has a menthol scent that very mild. What I love about it is that though the bottle is so tiny, just a small dab of the content on the affected areas spread widely. I can&#x27;t confess to seeing any improvements in my marks yet, but I&#x27;ll continue using to see if this will indeed work for me.</li>
    <li> This product was packaged very well and arrived very quickly. I originally bought this product to see what it could do for patches of dry skin (took care of them with no trouble) but in the process I also applied it to a couple of 1-2 year old surgical scars and am amazed by the results!

    <li> SCAM smells like nothing. Chemical chaos.</li>
    <li> Did not come with any direction. Did nothing for my stretch marks</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed, the bottle is so tiny it&#x27;s barely lasted me a wk Def not enough time to see if it even works,  and it&#x27;s very hard to get out of the bottle u have to bang it on ur hand..</li>
    <li> This spilled out before it got to me. I used the little bit that was left and it seemed to be as advertised... But there was not enough left to know.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.... thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.”</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see any changes...........its a waste!</li>
    <li> This oil is pretty good.  I have seen a difference in how my stretch marks look.  I also like the smell of the oil.  I&#x27;ll have to keep trying to see how it will work a month after. But so far so good!</li>
    <li> This oil has a very light scent. I have been using it on scars on my face for about a week and i notice a slight improvement. They see to be fading a little. After applying this oil leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I mixed a few drops of this oil with other oils, raw honey and yogurt and made a face mask. It made my skin feel super soft and healthy. I received this oil for review purposes all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the correct product.</li>
    <li> This Emu oil could do lot more, if I could get out bottle,  small whole!  I get frustrated by having shake get some out! Really loud smell!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I love this stuff been using it for a week now and id definitely buy again!!! I&#x27;ve been trying to work around stretch Mark creams and oils been working great:)</li>
    <li> Price is too expensive for such a little bottle Got it today hope to see if it works!</li>

No my stretch marks aren&#x27;t completely gone but for me only using it 2 weeks I can see a dramatic difference especially in the area where I had my Csection! the marks are not as dark and they have shrunk in size. I am hoping in the next month or so I can be stretch mark free thanks to Elastic!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free for my honest review and i actually loved it!</li>
    <li> I use it after i take shower everyday. At first, you not gonna see the difference, just keep using it. This process does take time. After one week, i notice the marks are fading. So it works, just need to be patience</li>
    <li> I used this to clear up some scaring  I had and it worked really well&lt;br /&gt;**DISCLAIMER*** I was given this product to review. All opinions and experiences expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this oil as I have a few stretch marks from 3 kids but also some acne scars.  So far my face seems to be getting smoother, not really sure if it&#x27;s helping my stretch marks as those are pretty light and not very big anyways but I would assume since my scarring seems to be improving over time my stretch marks will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own*</li>
