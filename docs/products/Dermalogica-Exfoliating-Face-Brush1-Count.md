### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So grandma is very happy with it</li>
      <li>and he is very happy  with it</li>
      <li>Happy Memorial Day, Fran Callahan</li>
      <li>With this brush, I can give it a good rinse</li>
      <li>If you are washing a baby great....but to truly get a good exfoliation you need something with firmer bristles.</li>
      <li>This product is good</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good for that...</li>
      <li>The brush is nice and I loved it while using it in beauty school.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>If you plan on putting an abrasive exfoliant on them, they will be effective in applying the exfoliant.</li>
      <li>Great for my face and keeping it looking fresh.</li>
      <li>Perfect softness for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It takes a very light touch with circular motion to feel like it is doing the job.</li>
      <li>Could be more thicker.</li>
      <li>I would use another brush with a more sturdy handle.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The Dermotologia brush has the company&#x27;s logo on the brush; the MenScience brush has no markings of any sort on the brush, so seems to be of a generic variety (aren&#x27;t most good companies proud to put their logos on their products?).</li>
      <li>I used a face brush for many years</li>
      <li>Great value and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>hairs\\&quot; would be more accurate?</li>
      <li>Nice brush very gentle.</li>
      <li>BUT because I try to make the best of all situations, I now use this brush to dust the little crevices in my car....</li>
      <li>I think they should send me another free one.</li>
      <li>I just like the way it makes my skin feel clean and helps take off my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I really wish it was better suited to my skin.</li>
      <li>I love my new one that has a thicker, softer brush and a very sturdy handle:)</li>
      <li>they are super durable -</li>
      <li>super easy to use and does gentle exfoliation that can be done every day.</li>
      <li>To soft for me; I would prefer more abrasion but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
      <li>For packaging &amp; other non-performance areas, the Dermotologia is superior.</li>
      <li>I noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin right away</li>
      <li>and it dries out nicely leaving a tool that feels very hygenic the next day.</li>
      <li>However, if you have pretty manageable skin, this is a really nice daily gentle exfoliater.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, but works really well to clean it.  </li>
      <li>I have used it once, with a creamy &amp; foaming face wash that I have been using daily for many years without issue, no issues with irritation.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need something strong enough to scour grout in my tub, but I do need my face brush to have SOME strength in the bristles in order to get that &#x27;freshly-scrubbed face&#x27; feeling.</li>
      <li>But a nice little brush</li>
      <li>Soft, useful and very practical.</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the brush feels nice on the skin, soft and soothing but NOT particularly useful for real exfoliation like the packaging and name indicate.</li>
      <li>360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot</li>
      <li>This is a great exfoliating brush if... - you have very few blemishes and flaky skin with constant cell turnover is not a problem for you.</li>
      <li>This brush seems like good quality and will probably last for a few years.  </li>
      <li>The bristles appear to be overly soft and longer than really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush by Dermalogica is soft enough for even sensitive skin but definitely ideal for daily facial cleansing (especially for those like me who have combo skin and bigger pores on and around the nose).</li>
      <li>I had one for about 7 years before I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a good facial brush in stores.</li>
      <li>the bristles are VERY soft.</li>
      <li>With a little liquid face cleanser, this brush leaves skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>My recommendation is to buy whichever one you find at a cheaper price, but only if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, gentle, non-abrasive brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is a rock star for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Both brushes are far too soft to exfoliate in &amp; of themselves.</li>
      <li>I am cursed with near constantly flaking skin so this brush turned out to be too soft to really work for me.</li>
      <li>but this brush is so soft that it will not have the slightest abrasive effect on my face.  </li>
      <li>The packaging on the Dermotologia is sturdier, but the brushes themselves are about the same size &amp; weight (very light-weight).</li>
      <li>I thought this brush would work, but it is extremely soft.</li>
      <li>It feels sooo soft</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this particular face brush.  </li>
      <li>Brush is just the right softness but broke after less than a week of use.</li>
      <li>This one though is soft enough not to damage your skin and firm enough to clean it</li>
      <li>I have combination sensitive skin, but I need some marginal &#x27;scrub&#x27; effect to feel like I&#x27;ve actually cleaned my face.</li>
      <li>As soft as its bristles are, I don&#x27;t see how that would be possible.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought the bristles were too soft, but after a few uses, I actually like the soft tapered bristles.</li>
      <li>If you have delicate skin then this is the right brush, but if you are wanting to exfoliate it is not for that!</li>
      <li>Anyway, the bristles on this awful brush are so soft, I think I could actually get better scrub action if I used my cat to clean my face.</li>

    <li> The brush is nice and I loved it while using it in beauty school.  The handle broke on my friends within the second week and then mine broke a couple weeks after.  I would use another brush with a more sturdy handle.  I love my new one that has a thicker, softer brush and a very sturdy handle:)</li>
    <li> At first, I thought the bristles were too soft, but after a few uses, I actually like the soft tapered bristles. With a little liquid face cleanser, this brush leaves skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a good facial brush in stores. When you can find them, they are often poorly made or have bristles that are too harsh for your face (even for a guy). This brush by Dermalogica is soft enough for even sensitive skin but definitely ideal for daily facial cleansing (especially for those like me who have combo skin and bigger pores on and around the nose). I still think this should be under $10 but I&#x27;ll not quibble.</li>
    <li> I am not a complainer....but this brush is so soft that it will not have the slightest abrasive effect on my face.  Terrible.  BUT because I try to make the best of all situations, I now use this brush to dust the little crevices in my car....and it&#x27;s good for that...Happy Memorial Day, Fran Callahan</li>
    <li> I bought this item at the same time as the MenScience brush, &amp; they cost about the same. The packaging on the Dermotologia is sturdier, but the brushes themselves are about the same size &amp; weight (very light-weight). Both brushes are far too soft to exfoliate in &amp; of themselves. In other words, if you use a cleansing product on the brush that doesn&#x27;t have abrasive qualities, these brushes will not provide any degree of abrasion by themselves. If you plan on putting an abrasive exfoliant on them, they will be effective in applying the exfoliant. The Dermotologia brush is made in China (isn&#x27;t almost everything these days?), but at least Dermotologia advises the consumer of the country of origin. The MenScience brush has no indication of country of origin, either on the brush itself or on its packaging. The MenScience brush indicates that it \\&quot;combats ingrown hairs.\\&quot; As soft as its bristles are, I don&#x27;t see how that would be possible. Perhaps \\&quot;massages ingrown hairs\\&quot; would be more accurate? The Dermotologia brush has the company&#x27;s logo on the brush; the MenScience brush has no markings of any sort on the brush, so seems to be of a generic variety (aren&#x27;t most good companies proud to put their logos on their products?). The MenScience brush has their logo on the case, but if case &amp; brush become separated over time, you&#x27;ll be hard put to recall what company made this brush that you either like or don&#x27;t like. For effectiveness as a face brush, they are equal. For packaging &amp; other non-performance areas, the Dermotologia is superior. My recommendation is to buy whichever one you find at a cheaper price, but only if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, gentle, non-abrasive brush. I will be posting this same review on the webpage for the MenScience brush.</li>
    <li> This product is good but quality wasnt there broke not even a year. I wish it was bigger. I wouldnt buy it again. I think they should send me another free one. If they do I hope it doesnt crack on me.</li>
    <li> Nice brush very gentle. It feels sooo soft you can hardly feel it on your face. Now lets just hope it works!</li>
    <li> This has to be the most useless face brush in the history of womankind. I use a face brush every morning when I wash my face. I have combination sensitive skin, but I need some marginal &#x27;scrub&#x27; effect to feel like I&#x27;ve actually cleaned my face. I don&#x27;t need something strong enough to scour grout in my tub, but I do need my face brush to have SOME strength in the bristles in order to get that &#x27;freshly-scrubbed face&#x27; feeling. I know I&#x27;m not alone in this desire. Anyway, the bristles on this awful brush are so soft, I think I could actually get better scrub action if I used my cat to clean my face. This brush is completely useless and WAY overpriced (Nearly $20 for a face brush? Ridiculous). Do yourself a favor and buy a different face brush. I gave this product 1 star only because I couldn&#x27;t get away with giving it ZERO stars. UGH.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little softer than I had hoped. If you have delicate skin then this is the right brush, but if you are wanting to exfoliate it is not for that!</li>
    <li> If you are washing a baby great....but to truly get a good exfoliation you need something with firmer bristles. But a nice little brush</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush to replace facial scrubs which is clogging up the plumbing.  I thought this brush would work, but it is extremely soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a wash cloth to wash my face, but I&#x27;ve always felt that the wash cloth was harboring bacteria. With this brush, I can give it a good rinse and it dries out nicely leaving a tool that feels very hygenic the next day. It takes a very light touch with circular motion to feel like it is doing the job. If you press too hard the bristles just collapse.</li>
    <li> super easy to use and does gentle exfoliation that can be done every day. I noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin right away</li>
    <li> This product came packed well.  I gave the face brush as a present and it was used well received.</li>
    <li> This brush is a rock star for sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t know who other brush makers (and believe me, I have tried them all) think of - elephants or rhinos - when they make their brushes but they all are to coarse and scratchy. This one though is soft enough not to damage your skin and firm enough to clean it really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are super durable - I had one for about 7 years before I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to anyone who loves their skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that this brush was so small for the price and the bristles are too soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect softness for my sensitive skin.  I use it every night to wash my face.  I used a face brush for many years but I never realized it was for exfoliating.  I just like the way it makes my skin feel clean and helps take off my makeup.  This brush seems like good quality and will probably last for a few years.  I love it</li>
    <li> I like it. I use it every other week. That is how often i need this product. Could be more thicker.</li>
    <li> To soft for me; I would prefer more abrasion but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
    <li> This Dermalogia facial brush was quite pricey, but no one forced me to buy it.  I have used it once, with a creamy &amp; foaming face wash that I have been using daily for many years without issue, no issues with irritation.  The bristles appear to be overly soft and longer than really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brush feels nice on the skin, soft and soothing but NOT particularly useful for real exfoliation like the packaging and name indicate.</li>
    <li> THis was for my Grandson  and he is very happy  with it he uses it every night and day... So grandma is very happy with it</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this particular face brush.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, but works really well to clean it.  And it lasts for years!  In fact, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I purchased this brush ... maybe 3-4 years ago?  With care and cleaning, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Brush is just the right softness but broke after less than a week of use. Manufacturer should have use a less brittle plastic.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliating brush if... - you have very few blemishes and flaky skin with constant cell turnover is not a problem for you. I am cursed with near constantly flaking skin so this brush turned out to be too soft to really work for me. However, if you have pretty manageable skin, this is a really nice daily gentle exfoliater. I really wish it was better suited to my skin. Remember- the bristles are VERY soft.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is to notch! It does not slip away from my hands and fulfills its purpose. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great for my face and keeping it looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Soft, useful and very practical. Money well spent. Great value and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was having dry skin and my nose and forehead were peeling so I just started exfoliating and it has made such a difference.  The brush is soft but firm...I can feel it working into my pores and removing the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
