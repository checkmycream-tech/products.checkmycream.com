<li> Besides being called ignorant and mentally diseased, there were other harsher comments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but the wild orange has a awful taste.  </li>
<li> I also add it to dressings for fruit salad or chicken salad with fruit in it, and to orange cakes and cookies that I bake.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The taste was alright. The quality appears good. But I didn&#x27;t buy it for taste. I bought it for its therapeutic value. It did not work for me. Presently, I am undergoing chemo in spite of the numerous homeopathic solutions I tried. I would never dissuade anyone from trying it though. My experience may not be yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that I was the only one that rated this product with 3 stars. I don&#x27;t see any other reviewer that had anything but 5 stars for this. I did notice a peculiar thing happen with the review. Even though the original post was very fair, I received a number of personal attacks for my rating. Besides being called ignorant and mentally diseased, there were other harsher comments.&lt;br /&gt;I went in to delete my original post but then I realized that left nothing but 5-star reviews. Was that what they haters wanted? I have no proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the haters. My star rating sticks. But this time, no matter how much you rant, I won&#x27;t be responding. If you feel the need to eval this product, why not buy it and give it your own review instead of making personal attacks on honest posters? Review the product, not the reviewer.</li>
    <li> Best orange oil ever for adding to drinking water, infuser or adding to lotion for use on skin.  Tried other brands Young Living is the best!  Tried DoTerra wild orange oil I like some of their other oils but the wild orange has a awful taste.  Young Living is pleasant to the taste and smell.  Only one I will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I went a little crazy and ordered three different bottles of orange oil from three different companies. I compared the three and YL was by a long shot the best smelling and the strongest smell as well. It is definitely you get what you pay for with oils. I did not have the competitor to compare and would be curious, but I am not ordering another bottle at this time.</li>
    <li> Orange is a mood enhancer and about the only YL oil I can afford! Goes well with so many other oils- this you can take internally, add a couple drops to hot or cold water, diffuse, massage with carrier oil, clean your house, deodorize... the list goes on and on.  Great for those midwinter blahs.</li>
    <li> Nice fresh scent. Definitely smells like oranges.&lt;br /&gt;I use this around the house to give it a fresh summer smell. Sometimes I dab some on as well, good summer scent.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, packaged nicely, no problems.</li>
    <li> Great tasting and wonderful refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time keeping calm and have a lot of panic moments. Young Living orange oil has helped me tremendously! The smell is so lovely I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Young Living Essential Oils and the orange oil is no exception. Very high quality and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Most amazing oils in the world.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma that the Orange gives a room.  You always have a fresh fragrance in your home on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with all the things I  Bought so far from amazon. Really good quality always on time. They have the best price compare to all the big expensive stores out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my least favorite oil but I love the brand. Just doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would. However I diffuse it and it smells more natural.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a clean, clear orange scent and this one does it.  It&#x27;s not overly sweet smelling, nor mixed with mango or other fruit smells.  It truly smells as if you&#x27;d just peeled an orange.  This is the only company I&#x27;ve found that has a clean orange scent.  Don&#x27;t stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Waited a week after ordering online.</li>
    <li> Someone told me to smell this when you feel nervous and you need some uplifting...its the best!  I took a figure skating test I was nervous about so I put some orange oil on my gloves and when I got to the  got to the rink I was confident and passes it.  I use it every morning now just to feel all over great!</li>
    <li> Wow, This stuff is just orange peel oil. Period. Dot. I have migraine triggers, which I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what ingredients are the culprits, some I know others I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s nice that a product is just what it is no &amp;#34;natural flavors&amp;#34; which due to slack laws mean they don&#x27;t have to tell the consumer. I put this in my water bottle with a little bit of nectresse or stevia (those I can handle) and it was awesome. I wanted mine a little sweet but honestly you don&#x27;t need it. I bought this to take the place of the low calories single serve drink envelopes/packets. I&#x27;m getting many other flavors from Young Living.  I&#x27;m totally impressed.</li>
    <li> I use Young Living essential oil Orange oil every day. I love to smell it to improve my mood; it \\&quot;encourages positive emotions.\\&quot; I also add it to my drinking water, as it supports the body&#x27;s cellular repair process. I also add it to dressings for fruit salad or chicken salad with fruit in it, and to orange cakes and cookies that I bake. A few drops go a long way! One bottle can last several months. It can also be diffused or mixed with a carrier oil and applied topically.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my oil</li>
    <li> Creat Service, awesome oil.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I need another bottle of this for my desk. I use it as a pick me up during the day and also I put 2 drops in my vanilla protein shake in the morning, so good!</li>
