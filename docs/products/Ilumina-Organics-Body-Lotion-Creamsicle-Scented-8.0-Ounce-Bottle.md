      <li>It has an awesome fragrance that I really enjoy.&lt;br</li>

      <li>As light as it is, Ilumina Organics Body Lotion sure does do the job!  </li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t care for the smell, but I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the aroma</li>
      <li>There are many consumers for whom this alone would make them buy this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to try out this lotion from Ilumina Organics.</li>
      <li>and love) creamsicles</li>
      <li>and love) orange</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy it--spend your money on a brand more reliable.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much-a lil dad will do ya:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, there are better and cheaper organic products to be had and used.  </li>
      <li>The easy-open flip top works well.  </li>
      <li>Inform our friends, family, and clients about the hazards in most cosmetic products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light - lemony, I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminded me of a creamsicle however.</li>
      <li>I definitely love the fact that it&#x27;s organic..</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on nice and smooth and I would say non-greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s luscious in a creamy citrus flavor that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lotion is not greasy at all, nor does it leave me with an overly waxy feel like so many lotions do.  </li>
      <li>When mixed together with the vanilla they do not make a very pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Their Soothing Body Lotion offers a delightful fragrance and is absorbed almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>Diligently search for the highest quality, safe for your body products, and make them easily available to you.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice, comfortable lotion, great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>moisturizer itself applies easily and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>Although many hand and body lotions are produced by firms that promise health oriented benefits, Illumina is as good as its word, its line being organic, natural, and completely free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
      <li>This lotion smells absolutely divine -- I love the Creamsicle scent!</li>
      <li>you are committed to organic products, this is a fantastic choice for a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>After applying it a couple of times, I can honestly say that it really works.</li>
      <li>The skin lotion feels really smooth going on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and leaves my hands feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>My sample of this didn&#x27;t smell too much like a Creamsicle, but it does smell nice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a creamsicle -- despite its name, it&#x27;s got a more sophisticated scent, very herbal.   </li>
      <li>Overall, a very nice lotion.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and easily and allows my skin to breathe and not feel like it has a plastic bag over</li>
      <li>First, i love the fact that the bottle is BPA-free and estrogenic-free.  </li>
      <li>I think that is important as it becomes more and more clear that these pollutants are a hazard to our health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What a unique scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great body lotion for dry skin.</li>
      <li>For the most part, my wife really likes this lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent: The very first whiff I had smelled like a rich all-natural creamsicle, maybe (reaching a bit) --</li>
      <li>My skin feels much softer and more supple after a couple of weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>also really like using organic products, though in that regard I tend to spend my money more on things I put IN my body rather than ON it.</li>
      <li>overall opinion is that it&#x27;s a nice lotion with a pleasant scent, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying more when this one&#x27;s empty.</li>
      <li>it smells GREAT, it is absorbed very fast, and it actually works as it should.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I found this to be a great lotion for prompt application right after a bath or shower, especially during the winter, but too greasy for use on the hands or during a hot summer.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s super moisturizing..more like a mild moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love that it is synthetic free and&lt;br /&gt;100% natural.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t strike me as greasy, which some reviewers have said, and it absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>This is really nice lotion which has a nice fragrance and not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>This is not the case with Illumina, as there is obviously no compromise within its ingredient list, resulting in a body of fine products that are safe to apply upon the skin of newborns as well as of adults.  </li>
      <li>It gets absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves no oily residue, so you can get dressed pretty quickly or touch things without worrying about getting oil on fabrics.    </li>
      <li>I found this to be a great body lotion for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>However, I did find that it stung a bit when used on freshly shaved skin.</li>
      <li>After around 1-2 minutes it has totally absorbed into my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>scent is lovely-clean and fresh, not too feminine-but creamsicle?</li>
      <li>I have had better Natural hand creams, but</li>
      <li>I have been using natural lotions for many years</li>
      <li>Okay, so, I like the smell of it, and her skin feels soft, but here&#x27;s what she had to say about it:    </li>
      <li>I think it would be a better fit for somebody with dry skin.</li>
      <li>The quantity is very sufficient in that, you do not need very much and they give you a very good amount so it should last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The citrus scent on this lotion seems a little bit strong sometimes, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just a strong smell.</li>
      <li>A little oily, but seems to be just as good as a non-organic product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am picky when it comes to what I put on my body. This stuff is wonderful. It is light in texture and fragrance, yet achieves the moisturization my skin craves in the dry winter months. It&#x27;s luscious in a creamy citrus flavor that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Not only would I recommend this product - I&#x27;m getting some for many of my girlfriends as gifts this year for the holidays.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great body lotion for everyday use.  Like a lot of other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t think it smelled much like a Creamsicle, but scent is a very subjective experience.  What pleases one person will irritate another.  I found the scent of this lotion very light and pleasant and I can wear it at work without the risk that it will set off anyone&#x27;s allergies.  In addition, and this is very important to me, my cats don&#x27;t recoil in horror at the smell of my hands after I&#x27;ve used this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on very lightly, and quickly sinks into the skin.  I didn&#x27;t find it very heavy and there wasn&#x27;t a greasy feel that stuck around for hours after application.  As light as it is, Ilumina Organics Body Lotion sure does do the job!  My skin feels much softer and more supple after a couple of weeks of use.  It&#x27;s a very nice, comfortable lotion, great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is really nice lotion which has a nice fragrance and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and leaves my hands feeling smooth.  The easy-open flip top works well.  Overall, it&#x27;s simply a very nice lotion which would make an attractive gift, or a great splurge for yourself!</li>
    <li> Great body lotion for dry skin. Goes on very smooth and makes the skin very smooth. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No complaints about the body lotion. The scent is nice and light - lemony, I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminded me of a creamsicle however. It&#x27;s not completely organic but does use organic ingredients and it&#x27;s paraben-free.</li>
    <li> The scent is definitely Creamsicle - but it manages not to be overwhelming.  It smells yummy going on and then fades to a reasonable scent.  The lotion is not oily and soaks in nicely.  It&#x27;s not as thick as I like my lotions to be so I&#x27;ve docked this 1 star.  If you like your lotion on the easy to spread side - this may be a 5-star lotion for you!</li>
    <li> First, i love the fact that the bottle is BPA-free and estrogenic-free.  I think that is important as it becomes more and more clear that these pollutants are a hazard to our health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself applies easily and absorbs well.  It has an awesome fragrance that I really enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint it would be that I wish the bottle were larger!</li>
    <li> My skin is quite dry this time of year (winter) and I could probably put lotion on every day and wouldn&#x27;t notice a difference. Generally I use unscented lotions such as Aquaphor. I was pleased to try out this lotion from Ilumina Organics. I did not notice any greasiness or slick feeling. All in all a very nice lotion. After around 1-2 minutes it has totally absorbed into my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering. You do not have to use much to notice how soft your skin has become. The quantity is very sufficient in that, you do not need very much and they give you a very good amount so it should last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very nice lotion, thank you for reading my review.</li>
    <li> This lotion is extremely moisturizing and massages into the skin very&lt;br /&gt;well.  I put it on in the morning after my shower and by late&lt;br /&gt;afternoon my skin was still very moisturized and soft.  This is a&lt;br /&gt;great lotion for winter skin.  I love that it is synthetic free and&lt;br /&gt;100% natural.  It has a very light, non-overpowering citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Ilumina Organics is a company commited to providing vegan products with all ingredients being 100% certified organic.  There are many consumers for whom this alone would make them buy this lotion.  Myself, not quite so picky, but if all things were equal, I would choose vegan/organic over animal byproduct/synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;So I did a little comparison (and very unscientific) study.  For one week, left arm and leg were moisturized with Ilumina, while right arm and leg were moisturized with a well known soothing (oatmeal) lotion.&lt;br /&gt;After one week, my left arm and leg were ever so slightly smoother than the right.  Certainly not noticeably so however.  And with other factors possibly weighing in, (maybe I used more Ilumina, etc) I would have to conclude both lotions worked equally well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  texture is very creamy.  Scent is light and pleasant (although they might want to drop the word &#x27;creamsicle&#x27;).  I did not experience aftersmell.  Dry elbows no longer dry after 1 week use.  Also nice after shaving leg.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  price.  The cost of this 8 oz bottle of lotion was approximately 10 times the cost of a store brand, non-vegan lotion that includes lab-produced chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The whole idea behind moisturizers is to assist your body in maintaining adequate moisture (read: water) levels within its largest organ, which easily dehydrates due to its large surface area.  A little bit of oiliness helps to maintain a moisture barrier.  Ilumina got the formula right as far as that goes.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the list of 100% organic, vegetable based ingredients.  The scent (largely debated here) is natural and not arrived at with a few drips of synthetic scent.&lt;br /&gt;If you are committed to organic products, this is a fantastic choice for a moisturizer.  They don&#x27;t just say the ingredients are organic, they stand behind the claim (check out their website).&lt;br /&gt;The single thing I did not like, which cost this lotion a star, is the price.  But if the commitment levelis there, that shouldn&#x27;t stop you.  Nice stuff.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite place this \\&quot;creamsicle\\&quot; scent, but my first impression was something like petroleum oil.  The scent is a turnoff, but it does go away.  The lotion is rather thin, thus making it easy to overuse it.  Lotion is not moisturizer!  There is a complete difference, and I prefer a moisturizer.  The ingredients are plenty with plenty of fruits and other organics.  The lotion soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky or unpleasant residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me.....It&#x27;s that smell I can&#x27;t overlook!!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. I use body lotion daily as I live in Minnesota and it is so very dry here and it shows on your body. This lotion was thin in consistancy and it had a terrible scent. Body lotion should be at least creamy and this was not. I even shook the bottle but it still was basically \\&quot;water\\&quot;. It may be organic but not nice. Do not buy it--spend your money on a brand more reliable.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a creamsicle -- despite its name, it&#x27;s got a more sophisticated scent, very herbal.   But it&#x27;s smooth and not greasy at all, feels great on the skin.  I especially like that it moisturizes for hours.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of Ilumina Organics Creamsicle Scented Body Lotion for my wife, and it turns out she really likes it. It&#x27;s very cold and dry here in the winter, and she uses lots of creams and lotions to keep her skin in good shape. Okay, so, I like the smell of it, and her skin feels soft, but here&#x27;s what she had to say about it:    The skin lotion feels really smooth going on. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get the lotion out of the container, though, because the plastic doesn&#x27;t give way enough for a decent squeeze. That&#x27;s not all bad, though, because you don&#x27;t want to use too much of this.    The lotion wears really well, too. It gets absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves no oily residue, so you can get dressed pretty quickly or touch things without worrying about getting oil on fabrics.    I really liked the creamsicle smell at first, but after a while I sort of get tired of the citrus-y smell. All in all, it&#x27;s a very good skin lotion (but I still favor my Ahava).</li>
    <li> I have been using natural lotions for many years so I have had a chance to try many different scents, qualities, and types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had tried them all, and then I tried the Ilumina Organics Creamsicle scented lotion.  What a unique scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not greasy at all, nor does it leave me with an overly waxy feel like so many lotions do.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and easily and allows my skin to breathe and not feel like it has a plastic bag over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for moisturizing, it does a good job- especially in the dry winter air.  The only lotion that works more intensely that I have found so far is the KISS MY FACE Honey Calendula lotion for extra dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ilumina does a great job.  I love the smell - it is like an Lemon Italian ice with a touch of lemon verbena and lemongrass added.  I don&#x27;t have to reapply constantly either, which I like.</li>
    <li> Ilumina Organics Body Lotion is, I would guess, aimed at the affluent, health conscious, 25-35 year-old female target market.  The lotion has a pleasant texture and is the right weight for normal skin [though it&#x27;s not heavy enough for drier skin].  The initial scent is lemony, but it changes to a light sweet creamsicle aroma after a few minutes.  It reminded me of the fruity scents from Bath and Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it gets five stars for being just what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> Ilumina Organics Soothing Body Lotion is indeed organic but comes up on the short end when it comes to soothing and moisturizing.  I have written nary a negative review but this product just isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;up to stuff\\&quot;.  I have used many different organic body products and Ilumina&#x27;s body lotion just doesn&#x27;t match up neither in price nor performance. The lotion is a bit thin, watery and greasy all at the same time and the smell leaves something to be desired. It lists the lotion as \\&quot;creamsicle scented\\&quot; but it smells nothing like the orange and vanilla combination that I was expecting.  Instead, it smells of the essential oils that are in the ingredient list which are lemon, bergamot, grapefruit and rosemary. When mixed together with the vanilla they do not make a very pleasant scent. I would think a nice lavender/chamomile or rosemary/calendula mix would have been a better choice for this lotion&#x27;s signature and only scent that you can purchase this product in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full list of ingredients are: Distilled Water, Organic Cocos Nucifera Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Macadamia Ternifolia Nut Oil, Organic Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Gel), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Organic Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower, Organic Extra Virgin Olea Europaea (olive) Fruit Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Vanilla Planifolia Extract, Citrus Medica (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Granis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Mixed Tocopherols (Vitamin E) and Organic Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, there are better and cheaper organic products to be had and used.  This lotion was quite disappointing...  :&gt;(</li>
    <li> This soothing body lotion from Ilumina Organics does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. It moisturizes your skin and smells good. Is lotion supposed to do anything else? The citrus scent on this lotion seems a little bit strong sometimes, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just a strong smell. I still like to use it, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting on a lot of it if you&#x27;re about to go to work or somewhere else that you&#x27;re in close contact with people because the scent is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilumina Organics itself seems like a great company. They take the organics mission very seriously and have their own standards beyon the government standards for \\&quot;organic.\\&quot; Their goals (from their website), are listed below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Inform our friends, family, and clients about the hazards in most cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;+ Provide the tools necessary for our friends, families and clients to make better choices.&lt;br /&gt;+ Diligently search for the highest quality, safe for your body products, and make them easily available to you.&lt;br /&gt;+ And last...we intend to promote less known companies who create high quality products that make you and the environment their first priority. (why should large cosmetic companies profit from making us unhealthy?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an organic, natural, synthetic free lotion, and you&#x27;re looking for a company that promotes a natural/organic lifestyle, then this is the company to buy from.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely divine -- I love the Creamsicle scent! -- and is nicely moisturizing, even though it doesn&#x27;t have that super-thick texture I prefer in lotions. It didn&#x27;t strike me as greasy, which some reviewers have said, and it absorbed quickly. However, I did find that it stung a bit when used on freshly shaved skin. (I&#x27;m guessing perhaps because of some of the citrus extracts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like using organic products, though in that regard I tend to spend my money more on things I put IN my body rather than ON it. And thus the price of this lotion is just too much for me to justify buying it. There are nice-smelling, moisturizing products that I can get for FAR less ... even if they aren&#x27;t organic.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use this lotion. She doesn&#x27;t care for the smell, but I love it. To be honest, it reminds me of citronella..kinda weird, but I do like that smell. The lotion goes on nice and smooth and I would say non-greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s super moisturizing..more like a mild moisturizer. I definitely love the fact that it&#x27;s organic..big plus.</li>
    <li> a guy&#x27;s review of body lotion:  it smells really good, nice texture, seems to be very effective in cleaning.  i like it very well.  i prefer larger size products, say 16 oz instead of 8 oz.  overall, i&#x27;d give this product an A-.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;this product is very moisturizing-I wash dishes by hand and have very dry skin. This product really helped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely-clean and fresh, not too feminine-but creamsicle? No-still nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: besides the price being a bit much-watch how much you use. You don&#x27;t need much-a lil dad will do ya:) If you use too much your hands will be slippery and ya can&#x27;t grab ahold to a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all-I&#x27;d buy and recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.</li>
    <li> Illumina Organics, an independent family-owned and operated company located in Salt Lake City, has developed a group of products that has made of it a success story within a crowded commercial field.  Although many hand and body lotions are produced by firms that promise health oriented benefits, Illumina is as good as its word, its line being organic, natural, and completely free of harmful chemicals.  Most of its competition utilize BPA packaging, along with phthalates, paraben and other potentially harmful substances that are synthetic, in particular omnipresent chemical-based preservatives.  This is not the case with Illumina, as there is obviously no compromise within its ingredient list, resulting in a body of fine products that are safe to apply upon the skin of newborns as well as of adults.  Their Soothing Body Lotion offers a delightful fragrance and is absorbed almost immediately.  This company that places our environment first will soon have its line upon display in Whole Foods stores, and this lotion can be thoroughly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> I did not like the aroma.  I know (and love) orange and I know (and love) creamsicles but this is no creamsicle.  Scent is such an objective thing.  I reviewed a skin cream called Just Carrots and I love the aroma but other reviewers didn&#x27;t.  Go figure!  I was so distracted by the scent of this Ilumina body lotion that I did not give it much of a chance on the moisturizing side of things.  I couldn&#x27;t give it away fast enough.  (Sorry, Ilumina!  You can&#x27;t please everybody!)</li>
    <li> Good product. Feels good going on and continues to feel good after. Pleasant smell (it actually does have the odor of a creamsicle), not greasy and it seems to be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a nasty winter here and it appears to be helping my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying an organic lotion. It&#x27;s nice to know that the ingredients are natural, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus for this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that it&#x27;s too greasy, but I used less in future applications and that made most (not all) of the greasiness go away. I also don&#x27;t have dry skin, so just a little of this product goes a long way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is just a little bit thicker than normal lotions. I found the citrus smell to be slightly overpowering at first, but after a few minutes I smell less of the lemon and more \\&quot;creaminess,\\&quot; which is nice. It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery to me, so I think this could work nicely as a gender neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion is that it&#x27;s a nice lotion with a pleasant scent, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying more when this one&#x27;s empty. I think it would be a better fit for somebody with dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a brutal winter here, so I&#x27;ve been going through different creams like they are going out of style. Most of the products I tried failed in at least one department. They were either too greasy, too smelly or they simply did not work.     The Ilumina Organics creamsicle lotion worked perfectly - it smells GREAT, it is absorbed very fast, and it actually works as it should. After just several minutes, the stuff is absorbed, without any greasy residue.    After applying it a couple of times, I can honestly say that it really works. I no longer feel dry skin, and by applying it every other day, I&#x27;ve kept cracked skin away for weeks.</li>
    <li> I would say this lotion is nice.   I have had better Natural hand creams, but with that said,  it is nice, and not greasy.    There are wonderful healthy natural Nutrients in this lotion, which is why  I gave it a 3 star.     I don&#x27;t see where the fine lines in my hands look smooth from this lotion,  as other hand creams do.     I expected a more Vanila/orange scent,but after its on for awhile it does live up to its scent name, although very faint! At first it smells like lemon.  It is not a strong scent that would interfer with purfumes.     I think a Man would like this also</li>
    <li> My sample of this didn&#x27;t smell too much like a Creamsicle, but it does smell nice. A little oily, but seems to be just as good as a non-organic product.</li>
    <li> For the most part, my wife really likes this lotion. The scent is very pleasant. I know some reviewers have said otherwise, but both my wife and I think it smells really good. The lotion also does a great job of moisturizing, without being too greasy. The only downside to this lotion is the price. While it may be reasonably priced for an organic product, my wife thinks the $17.00 list price for an 8-ounce bottle is just a bit much, especially for everyday use. Overall, a very nice lotion. Just a bit too expensive for our budget.</li>
    <li> Texture/Moisture: As others have noted, this lotion can be a bit greasy-feeling.  I first applied it to my hands, and was delighted at how well it moisturized them, until I noticed they stayed a little *too* moisturized and greasy -- but then again, I wasn&#x27;t using it as labeled -- for the body.  When I tried it immediately after a shower on my body, it was fantastic -- on freshly patted-dry skin, it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: The very first whiff I had smelled like a rich all-natural creamsicle, maybe (reaching a bit) -- but since then I&#x27;ve only smelled a very distinct, but not-quite identifiable citrus scent with a tiny hint of vanilla.  Almost -- but not quite -- like a strong key lime pie perhaps.  My fiance and I enjoy the smell for the most part, and it fades fairly rapidly on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this to be a great lotion for prompt application right after a bath or shower, especially during the winter, but too greasy for use on the hands or during a hot summer.</li>
