      <li>Love this oil and was so glad when I discovered the travel size.</li>

      <li>Especially wonderful in the dry winter.</li>
      <li>Not to strong smelling...but just a nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>Always read the fine print.  </li>
      <li>but that is fine.  </li>
      <li>which it is, so that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
      <li>This stuff worked so well &amp; quickly too!</li>
      <li>Given how little you need to use, this is the best value around!</li>
      <li>I work for a dermatologist and get a huge discount on products</li>
      <li>This oil is so light  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s unbelievable how wonderfully this product is absorbed and works its magic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is unique to my skin for whatever reason</li>

      <li>This moisturizer feels good the second it goes on my skin.  </li>

      <li>It smells wonderful and it looks like it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>On a positive note, if you like citrus scents, this does have a light orange smell, and I do like the pump dispenser.</li>
      <li>these are the first to show the signs!  </li>
      <li>Very light weight and all natural.</li>
      <li>REALLY TAKES CARE OF THE DRYNESS AND REDUCES THE FINE LINES ALOT.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had used Olivella hand cream and loved it, so when I saw the good reviews I was eager to try this.  I use it mainly on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands, since at my age (53) these are the first to show the signs!  It works wonderfully on the upper chest, where little lines appear from sleeping on the side.  I saw a difference within a week.  Also feels very soothing after being in the sun.  You don&#x27;t need much, just a drop or two, and I could still feel the softness in the morning!  The lovely citrus fragrance is refreshing, too.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Always read the fine print.  The front of the box says 100% olive oil - it&#x27;s NOT.  It contains other fruit oils.  I&#x27;ve used other olive oil moisturizers with no problems, but this made me breakout.  Besides the other fruit oils it has ingredients I cannot pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would keep it for use on my legs/hands but it also has a very unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to return it</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; smells good. Absorbs well. I had a very dry elbow that grossed me out. This stuff worked so well &amp; quickly too! No more dry ashy elbow for me. Only baby soft ; ) I use this stuff all over now. Even face.</li>
    <li> I am 54 and needed a less expensive skin care regimen. Worked well to minimize my shallower wrinkles within days and my more noticeable ones within a few weeks; skin is softer as well. Odd thing is that my skin has gotten lighter which is great for areas that were prone to redness like my cheeks but around my eyes, it looks like I went crazy with highlighter powder. I knew it wasn&#x27;t my imagination when my brother made a comment! LOL  I don&#x27;t know if this is unique to my skin for whatever reason but I thought I should mention it. The whitening is evening out as areas of my face become less red (including the tiny spider-type veins) so I am pleased overall with the price and effect of this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Dissappointed  it is as if I am just putiing olive oil on my face.....guess I could have just used what is in the kitchen cabinet  .  I will finish it, but wouldnt order ir again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Olivella Moisturizer Oil from a local store &amp; loved it but it was twice as expensive so I thought I would buy it here but this is not the same product. The name of the product &amp; list of ingredients are identical but this is NOT the same product. The first thing I noticed it the bottle is different than my others. Second this smells like slightly stale olive oil, whereas the other smelled citrusy &amp; good. Finally, this product is a lot heavier &amp; doesn&#x27;t absorb as well; I may as well be just putting regular olive oil on my face. I&#x27;ve tried contacting both the seller and Olivella to see what was up but I unfortunately got no reply from either. I&#x27;m not sure if this is old product that they&#x27;re trying to get rid of or what but I won&#x27;t be buying it from here again. I&#x27;ll pay for the more expensive stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 10/2/13*&lt;br /&gt;The company has replied and said that it was an old lot and that they will send me 3 new bottles at no cost. Will update again if I receive them.</li>
    <li> Used to use Dhc olive oil, but just couldn&#x27;t see spending $39-$42 anymore. Found Olivella, pleasantly surprised. Have acne prone skin, I use Proactiv but can&#x27;t use around nasolabial fold drys me out. Broke out in that area once it cleared up skin left dry and left with dark spots. Started using Olivella for dryness worked overnight skin smooth and soft, after a week noticed added bonus, dark spots were fading, works faster then Proactiv Clarifying Cream. Started using around eyes at night and during the day. I massage in around the nasolabial area and pat around eyes. Blends in well, does have a light smell not unpleasant but does disappear after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. I have had issues with adult acne for years, and after one week of using this product I have seen a 90% reduction in blemishes. It absorbs well, especially after a shower and doesn&#x27;t appear greasy like you may expect an oil to be.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to using store bought lotions again. Because i love this face oil so much, i decided to buy the shampoo and conditioner to see how those work for dry scalp...they arrived today and I can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> Who would think that olive oil was good for your skin, but Olivella has made a very nice moisturizer for all skin types. Just a drop or two is all you need for your whole face and face should be moist before applying this for best results.  Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> For my skin, olive oil is the best supplement for softness and to alleviate dryness. I Normally use a higher priced cosmetic company&#x27;s olive oil on my face &amp; love the results. Since my skin drinks it up, I had to find a more affordable option and this is the ticket. virtually odor free, blends in nicely, leaving a glow but nothing really &#x27;greasy&#x27; looking.  I will say I don&#x27;t like Olivella&#x27;s olive oil soap. It  has a strange smell, but does work well.  The oil itself is perfect, however.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Smells good, goes on smooth.  Great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny how I came across this wonderful product.  I was on the net looking for a good moisturizer by Laura Mercier and saw this bottle displayed at the bottom page (believe it or not) and its 5 star rated reviews caught my eye.  Due to my acne/oily  prone skin I was a bit hesitant to order this product however I took a risk and so pleased that I did.  After I shower, I use one drop of this on my face, and another drop for my neck and hands.  This product smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olivella for a couple of weeks now and it makes my skin look and feel great. I even found another perfect use for it. After I shower, I put it on my face and the residue that is left over I lightly rub over the outside strands of my wet hair and then blow dry. I have to say that this is better than any \\&quot;frizz-free\\&quot; hair serum that I have ever used. My hair is VERY fine, slightly wavy and frizzy and Olivella makes my hair less frizzy after blow-drying and more manageable and amazingly shiny, but WITHOUT weighing it down. Truly a miracle for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This product smelled horrible - rancid! Although of the same name, the packaging was different from the one I normally use and that I buy from other stores. It had such an awful smell. Will return it so the seller can see how bad the product is.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific moisturizer.  I have been using it for over a year now, and just love it.  The consistency is great and the scent is beautiful yet not overpowering.  I use this under my face cream and foundation.</li>
    <li> Use this over my regular \\&quot;wrinkle-cream\\&quot; at night; wake up with very smooth (not greasy) soft, hydrated skin. If you use very lightly in the AM, is a great make-up primer for mineral-type make up (have been using for years). Works especially well during winter months. Love this...skip all the high-priced, cosmetic oils (omega, etc.)...this has natural omega fatty acids and anti-oxidants. The key is to use sparingly (one small pump)and pat lightly around face, concentrate on \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; areas. Lasts forever...a little goes a long way. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer. Must use on damp face. Keeps cuticles looking fantastic too. Make sure you have time for it to soak in before bedtime. Skin feels wonderful in the morning.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I have a t-zone complexion and it is light enough for my oilier areas and moisturizing enough for my drier areas. Very light weight and all natural. My grandmother recently used it on a visit to my house and she loved it so much that I sent her a bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil is difficult to apply in a thin layer (works best when skin is still damp from shower).  It seems comparable to Lubriderm, just average moisturizing.  It has a pleasing but very strong black tea fragrance.  I ended up mixing it, 1 part Olivella to about 5 parts unscented Lubriderm, to use it up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for two months already. It moisturizing my skin very well. I apply it on my face and body. Believing in all natural plant stuff working good, I will keeping using it.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer. Especially wonderful in the dry winter. It goes on easily after I wash my face and what is left in my palm gets rubbed on my elbows. I scent is light, citrus-y but not strong and fades quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer - especially if you have dry skin  because it is straight oil!  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a necessity for anyone with dry skin. I have an illness that requires me to be on several medicines. Unfortunately these medications make my dry skin even dryer. I simply cannot go without this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is so light  I like to use it on my face every morning. The scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
    <li> Product is great I get compliments on my skin all the time. Real easy to use not greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, but I like it very much.  I use it morning and night.  The other reviewers are right that putting it on while the face is slightly damp is better.  I feel it gives a refreshing look.  It doesn&#x27;t do away with wrinkles altogether, but helps to soften them.  I also use the Olivella Anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> Tried to purchase to replace DHC Virgin Olive Oil (which is much more expensive). This product felt a bit heavier than DHC, and it is heavily fragranced, which didn&#x27;t appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a bad skin reaction- just personal taste.</li>
    <li> I had been splurging on the DHC Olive oil moisturizer, which I LOVE, but was having a hard time justifying the cost. This oil is just as light and moisturizing, the only difference that I&#x27;ve really noticed is the smell. This one smells more like Olive oil....which it is, so that&#x27;s fine with me. Leaves my skin soft and glowing, and has never once made me break out. I was skeptical about using oil on my face too, but I&#x27;ve become a total believer.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves your face really oily. It doesn&#x27;t absorb like I thought it would. It also has a smell to it that I do not like. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job.  I work for a dermatologist and get a huge discount on products but this is my go to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and almost any moisturizer that is not Rx makes my skin break out or itch. This does not and does not leave an oily residue either. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was looking at the $70 oils at Sephora.  I knew there must be a reasonable alternative and this is it.  I use it at night and my skin feels great in the morning.  It smells wonderful and it looks like it will last a long time.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> MOTHER SWEARS BY THIS STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE THIS REVIEW WON&#x27;T EFFECT AVAILABILITY OR PRICE. IF YOU HAVE TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE &amp; THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT YOU COULD TAKE TO HYDRATE YOUR SKIN. THIS IS THE STUFF AND THIS IS A GUY TELLING YOU THIS. WHOM THINKS MOISTURIZERS ARE FOR TRENDIES.</li>
    <li> IT WAS CLEAR AND WHAT I EXPECTED THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Olivella All Natural Olive Oil Moisturizer is awesome.  It is the only moisturizer I use.  Wash your face and then while it is still wet or damp; apply a couple of pumps of this oil onto your face.  It absorbs into the skin so is not oily.  It moisturizes very well.  I use it at night before I go to bed and then again in the morning before I apply my makeup.  It&#x27;s a great product and without all those horrible toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels good the second it goes on my skin.  After only a week I can tell a difference.  Very, very light but pleasant scent that disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, mostly olive oil moisturizer which keeps away dry skin in the winter, and sirens&#x27;t put strange chemicals on your skin!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews for this natural moisturizer.  The person who said to wet your face prior to application was 100% correct.  My skin still feels moist in the morning.  I highly recommend it for a natural moisturizer.  Just don&#x27;t expect a lotion!  It is an oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more smelly than I thought.  Has lots of other oils not just olive. Otherwise not bad and works okay and good price.</li>
    <li> This oil does lubricate the skin and help it to retain moisture.  It will last you forever because one or two pumps per night is enough to use for your entire face.  It does contain natural olive oil which does wonders for the skin and its listed as one of the first ingredients on the box.  Before I purchased this product, I had been using regular 100% virgin olive oil and that worked lovely for me and it was a bunch cheaper.  I saw that this product contained other botanicals and I figured if evoo was good, then evoo with other essences had to be great! While I do like this product, I did not find that the benefits of olive oil were super charged by the other ingredients and plain old olive oil works just fine.  On a positive note, if you like citrus scents, this does have a light orange smell, and I do like the pump dispenser. Olivella absorbs in the skin nicely and is not sticky, tacky or oily.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my facial skin (body also) feeling more hydrated than it has with ANY other product of it&#x27;s type ; i.e. moisturizers.</li>
    <li> olivella moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;love the moisturizer.  I expected it have a stronger lavender fragrance but that is fine.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think something so &#x27;benign&#x27; could irritate one&#x27;s eyes - especially when you don&#x27;t put it ANYWHERE near your eyes.  I only put it on the lower half of my face, so it&#x27;s a mystery why this happens.  But very shortly after I apply it, my eyes start to itch and feel &#x27;grainy&#x27;.  I wonder if anyone else has had this experience.  I&#x27;ve used an olive oil product from one of the home shopping channels and never had this experience.  So much for thinking that anything made in Italy is going to be great!</li>
    <li> I use this as my new moisturizer and it is great. It has a nice scent. Honestly it feels like plain old olive oil but I like natural products and the less ingredients the better. It will leave your face greasy if you use too much! I like to lather and then eventually my face absorbs the excess.</li>
    <li> I orginally bought this product for my sister in law, husband and mother in law because they get very dry skin in the winter. It has now become a household product! My mother law said if she could bathe in it she would! We have also branched out and tried many other things like Olivella soap, hand cream, body wash, etc. We love it all!</li>
    <li> Really good moisturizer and treatment for skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and continue to be amazed when I do</li>
    <li> Love this item! I live on the Bay of Fundy and purchased this in the winter months when I was starting to feel like a reptile! Have never been happier with a skin care product! I use only a drop or two when I wash my face in the evening and another moisturizer in the morning. It&#x27;s unbelievable how wonderfully this product is absorbed and works its magic. My skin is very sensitive, but has had no issues with Olivella.  I love how I can instantly feel its soothing, moisturizing properties. Given how little you need to use, this is the best value around! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and so it gets dry at night but oily during the day. I just use this moisturizer every other night to maintain moisture, but it&#x27;s impossible to use during the day if you have oily skin. It&#x27;s also very runny, not a cream at all, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to apply. I have also started using it as a body lotion after I shave, and it makes my skin soft. However, if you have oily skin I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, but did not like the fact that it was solid and would leave chunks as it melted, so I wanted to try something different.  This is okay, but I like the feel of the coconut oil better.  And I just found out that you can buy it in liquid form (fractionated coconut oil), so I will go back to coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I have used olive oil on my face for years, and feel that it benefits my complexion. This particular brand is not&lt;br /&gt;nearly as expensive as other brands, but feels just as wonderful. A great savings!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something truly moisturizing for the winter months and tried this product based on the reviews.  I am thrilled with the results!  It absorbs beautifully into the skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, smoother texture, line softening and a true retention of moisture in my skin.  I absolutely love this impressive product!  I use it at night and in the morning under makeup.  I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;ve ordered several other Olivella products to try.</li>
    <li> I ordered a replacement and did not use it until 45 days later. I now cannot return it. It has past the return date policy. The moisturizer has an extremely bad odor. The package is different than I normally received.</li>
    <li> This is going to be a product that I&#x27;m going to have to try for awhile to see the results. I was concerned about the smell when I ordered this...I will not wear products if they have a strong or sweet smell. This Olive Oil Moisturizer smells wonderful!!! Not to strong smelling...but just a nice clean scent. And it arrived FAST!!&lt;br /&gt;I joined Amazon Prime last year and I have decided this is the BEST way to shop. I don&#x27;t have to have a $25.00 minimum to order and the 3 day free shipping is terrific. What few times I have called Customer Service in regards to an issue....these reps are great to work with.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on moisturizers and creams to battle dry skin patches on my face. In addition I have always been somewhat acne prone. This oil moisturizes the dry scaly areas but doesn&#x27;t break me out. The antioxidants and fatty acids in olive oil are very healing to the skin. This oil also has a pleasant scent, very light but doesn&#x27;t linger. I use regular virgin olive oil in the shower on my body but this little pump jar is convenient for use on the face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product a little on greasy side.  I realize it is olive oil but it I think it should be a little thicker since it is a moisturizer.  I combine it with a lotion @ night and works pretty good.  I am still having problem with the dry skin on the sides of my nose. I make sure I put something on my pillowcase so I don&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
    <li> Never had used this product before; now I am sold on it.  Makes a big difference in the smoothness and softness of my skin.  Must have item</li>
    <li> This oil for me is not like lotion or cream.  It does have an oily feel to it, but I can say it deeply nourishes the body and extremely dry skin.  I found it effective on the heel of the feet, elbows, and knees (all notoriously dry spots for guys).  In a matter of days I saw a difference.  I did notice that I had to use more oil than I would with a traditional lotion or cream so my wife and I started by using the Moisturizer first and then rub that in really well.  Then use a lotion on top.</li>
    <li> This product has very simple ingredients, and works very well for my face, neck, ears, and elbows.  My skin is ultra sensitive, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  I use it every night and morning (live in a very dry climate) before bed with a few drops of water to make it go further...love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it lasts a LONG time!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing night time moisturizer in the winter. This us my third year using it. Key way I have found to use this product is after I wash my face and dry it,splash a little fresh water and then add only two pumps of the oil to my face and neck. In a couple of minutes it will be totally absorbed.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and was so glad when I discovered the travel size. The cap fits snug with no leakage.</li>
    <li> Great product, stays with you instead of washing off the first time you wash your hands!  Great mositurizing!  Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Not heavy feeling at all. A little oily feeling at first, but once it soaks in, no problem. Might be best used at night for some.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin moisturizer for the entire body especially the face. I have to see what it does for me after tanning when i return from Puerto Rico.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin soft. I use it every morning and every night. It does not make skin feel oily.</li>
    <li> THIS IS FANTASTIC FOR REALLY DRY LINED SKIN. MY AUNT &amp; MOTHER IN LAW SWEAR BY THIS PRODUCT AS WELL. iT&#x27;S A BIT GREASY BUT THE IDEA IS THAT YOU RUB IT INTO YOUR FRESHLY CLEANSED SKIN &amp; IT REALLY TAKES CARE OF THE DRYNESS AND REDUCES THE FINE LINES ALOT.</li>
