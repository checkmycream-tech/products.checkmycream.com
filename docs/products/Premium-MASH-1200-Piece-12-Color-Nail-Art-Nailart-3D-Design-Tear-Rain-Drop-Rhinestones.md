      <li>These are a great buy!</li>
      <li>perfect loved it!</li>
      <li>every pennyperfect loved it!</li>
      <li>This was a great wheel of rhinestones.</li>
      <li>Great buy for your money.</li>
      <li>Perfect, good product :-)</li>
      <li>I have reordered again  good qiality</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, still a great buy. :)</li>
      <li>I love these nail art decorations, they came on time and as described by seller!</li>
      <li>Nice colors but</li>
      <li>they came nicely wrapped.</li>
      <li>just need to make sure you have a really good sealing polish for them</li>
      <li>I liked all the colors that it had to offer.</li>
      <li>Would have liked if some of the MASH products would come with a glue to apply, but a dot of top coat on a piece of parchment paper and a wood stick are magical things.</li>
      <li>just given how cheap it was, but it came quickly with over 100 pieces of most colors and in a great sturdy storage case.</li>
      <li>Buy them, use them, love them:)</li>
      <li>would recommend buying this product for sure :)</li>
      <li>My daughters love to &#x27;glam up&#x27; their nails, but I have no interest in paying salon prices for my wee ones.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and would totally order these again.</li>
      <li>The rhinestones are awesome, but they&#x27;ve got all mixed up in the container during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have so many uses in nail art.  </li>
      <li>I have used these on many occasions and have gotten many compliments.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay atleast for me .</li>
      <li>so it was fine and great for nail art and not expensive at all.</li>
      <li>and careful of moving the disc where you want it sometimes things fly out!</li>
      <li>More importantly, these are some of the cheapest rhinestones you&#x27;ll find on amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>Easy to pick up with fine-tip tweezers.</li>
      <li>easy to put on.</li>
      <li>otherwise they come off as easy as pie.</li>
      <li>These are great little gems that look nice and were easy to apply with topcoat.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted! :)</li>
      <li>The price is fabulous and the quality exceeds my expectations.  </li>
      <li>This seller offers a GREAT alternative for anyone willing to do it themselves.  </li>
      <li>One or two single stones are good, but more than that started to look a bit gaudy.  </li>
      <li>Even for half the number, this is definitely worth the price, and I will happily buy more when I run out of these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was such a great purchase for the price , not to mention shipping was super fast</li>
      <li>These are such a nice workable size and the colors are so pretty!</li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>For the price, the crappy advertising is still worth it for what I need.</li>
      <li>worth</li>
      <li>but I can see how they are just right for nails.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>These build up static electricity, so the gems kinda get everywhere and mix together when you open the container.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what it looks like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only other issue I experienced was that my gems showed up in one of those wheel holders, not the (much handier) clasp holder shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>I tend to be hard on my nails and was looking for something that looks good but wouldn&#x27;t cost me a lot.</li>
      <li>She uses them when she&#x27;s doing Acrylic Nails and absolutely loves them.</li>
      <li>Absolutely nowhere.</li>
      <li>First off, there is NO WHERE near 1200 pieces in here.</li>
      <li>Really vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>overall, definitely recommend, and even ordered myself a 2nd right away :)</li>
      <li>this is a fantastic product for anyone interested in a little sparkle and uniqueness to their makeup, nail art, crafts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say MAYBE half that amount, but I&#x27;m thinking more like a third.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d cost five times as much for me to buy this stuff locally.</li>
      <li>My coworkers are surprised I do the designs myself.</li>
      <li>I will continue to order things like this, even though the items are no where near what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
      <li>i love the tear drop shape too as a little something different from the usual round rhinestones, makes it easy to make some cute shapes too by using a few (bows, hearts, etc).  </li>
      <li>i was a little hesitant at first</li>
      <li>The container is a little large and makes it look like you got hosed on the quantity</li>

<li> The color is vibrant and the shapes are well-defined, but they are a little too big to do any designs on my nails.  </li>
<li> in packaging they got a little mixed and were in a loose rhinestone wheel but didnt mix so much</li>
<li> Small than expected but pretty</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t sort them out like other people did, but it&#x27;ll be pain in the neck to pick up the same color from different sections.</li>
<li> These are teeny tiny jewels and ended up being too small for the craft product I was doing</li>
<li> It was as described, but not worth the wait.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not going to waste my time counting them though....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not the worst though, I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new organizer at a craft store.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like they just put a random sprinkle of each color in the wheel and call it a day.</li>

    <li> I have reordered again  good qiality</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are awesome, but they&#x27;ve got all mixed up in the container during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t sort them out like other people did, but it&#x27;ll be pain in the neck to pick up the same color from different sections.</li>
    <li> Small than expected but pretty</li>
    <li> These are great little gems that look nice and were easy to apply with topcoat. I&#x27;m not gonna count, but just by looking it&#x27;s obvious that there is not 100 of each color. It looks closer to 50 each. Even for half the number, this is definitely worth the price, and I will happily buy more when I run out of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other issue I experienced was that my gems showed up in one of those wheel holders, not the (much handier) clasp holder shown in the picture.

    <li> Easy to pick up with fine-tip tweezers. Really vibrant colors. Would have liked if some of the MASH products would come with a glue to apply, but a dot of top coat on a piece of parchment paper and a wood stick are magical things. The container is a little large and makes it look like you got hosed on the quantity though - they could do with a smaller wheel.</li>
    <li> These rain drop rhinestones have so many uses in nail art.  More importantly, these are some of the cheapest rhinestones you&#x27;ll find on amazon.com.  Buy them, use them, love them:)</li>
    <li> Nice colors but in packaging they got a little mixed and were in a loose rhinestone wheel but didnt mix so much so it was fine and great for nail art and not expensive at all. Great buy for your money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! :)</li>
    <li> These are just the perfect size for my fingernail projects</li>
    <li> It took a month to get this item. It was as described, but not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This was such a great purchase for the price , not to mention shipping was super fast it came three days before the estimated delivery date . I was upset to see that it came in a wheel instead of the case shown in the picture but it&#x27;s okay atleast for me . I would purchase again .</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She uses them when she&#x27;s doing Acrylic Nails and absolutely loves them.</li>
    <li> The colors were all intermingled when it arrived</li>
    <li> Perfect, good product :-)</li>
    <li> These are such a nice workable size and the colors are so pretty! I&#x27;m very happy and would totally order these again.</li>
    <li> These are a great buy! I have looked all over for nail art rhinestones that are inexpensive and these are it. I tend to be hard on my nails and was looking for something that looks good but wouldn&#x27;t cost me a lot. I have used these on many occasions and have gotten many compliments. My coworkers are surprised I do the designs myself. Highly recommended!!</li>

    <li> perfect loved it! worth every pennyperfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
    <li> This is the third set of rhinestone I&#x27;ve purchased and these are the biggest.  The color is vibrant and the shapes are well-defined, but they are a little too big to do any designs on my nails.  One or two single stones are good, but more than that started to look a bit gaudy.  I will use these on my toes.</li>
    <li> This was a great wheel of rhinestones. I&#x27;ve used a ton and still have a ton left! I liked all the colors that it had to offer.</li>
    <li> Alright... First off, there is NO WHERE near 1200 pieces in here. NO WAY IN H*LL. Absolutely nowhere. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. I&#x27;d say MAYBE half that amount, but I&#x27;m thinking more like a third. I&#x27;m not going to waste my time counting them though.... Anywho, I purchased two of these because I use a lot of gems and rhinestones to decorate random things, mostly lighters. I will continue to order things like this, even though the items are no where near what&#x27;s advertised. For the price, the crappy advertising is still worth it for what I need. It&#x27;d cost five times as much for me to buy this stuff locally. I&#x27;ve attached a picture comparing the advertised picture and the two wheels that I actually received to show the actual amount you get. Even the two wheels I got had completely different amounts of gems, as shown in the picture. It&#x27;s like they just put a random sprinkle of each color in the wheel and call it a day. I hope this review was helpful for some of you. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love these nail art decorations, they came on time and as described by seller! would recommend buying this product for sure :)</li>
