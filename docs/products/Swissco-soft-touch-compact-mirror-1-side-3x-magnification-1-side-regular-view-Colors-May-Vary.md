    <li> The only bad is I got the blue instead of the purple. It&#x27;s a neat little mirror and for the price, I&#x27;m thinking of getting a second one .</li>
    <li> I like these very much, especially because I can close them to protect the glass; good for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love it! However I wish there was an option to choose color! I got purple, but I really love pink! Other than that, I would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Simple, cheap, looks nice. Great buy. I&#x27;d buy again if I needed to!</li>
    <li> This mirror is tiny.  This might be really great for your purse, but I found that the mirror was too small to be practical. On a positive note, the mirror seems sturdy and well-constructed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my purse.  I had another, much heavier one, and needed to lighten up my purse load.  This one is perfect, cute, and very compact!!</li>

    <li> This is a basic small mirror, one side normal, one side 3x.&lt;br /&gt;It is slim, fits well in makeup bag and is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to fill up a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; order and I am happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is a great, lightweight compact mirror. A must have for your purse. I love the magnifier and the regular mirror choices it has.

    <li> This is compact, fits easily in a small purse and would also fit in a pocket.  As described, includes one regular and one magnified view.  The viewing space is small, but acceptable.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to me that it&#x27;s \\&quot;soft touch\\&quot; plastic, but it seems pretty durable.  Probably could have found a cheaper-priced mirror if I&#x27;d shopped around in town, but that would have taken a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Health issues keep me in bed for long hours. I needed a mirror small enough to fit in bedside table, not easily breakable, that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. This mirror fit on all counts. I use it mostly for tweezing  and flossing. One side is magnified, one side not. It closes to keep it safe and clean. I would guess it would be good to carry in a bag to check make up while out and about. I would buy it again.</li>

The outside is kind of a soft/rubbery plastic that feels nice in the hand. It fits well in my hand, with the hinge open one half sits in my palm and the other goes up my fingers. Maybe a little bigger than I expected, but it is absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is really small.  Too small to be usable.  The dimensions in the description are for the entire mirror opened up (both sides), not for the compact itself.</li>
    <li> cute putting in Easter bags</li>
    <li> Perfect size and sturdy build. I like that the outside is slightly textured (silicone feeling) so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
