      <li>Smell is great and your friends will like it too!</li>
      <li>Looks great!  </li>
      <li>I like the Pinon wood the best because it is what mom burned, but all of the woods offered will make your house smell like you have the fireplace going.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a fireplace in my house so it is especially nice.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful!!</li>
      <li>In all, Incense of the West is the Best!</li>
      <li>like we used to have-otherwise the service was quite prompt and the incense smelled wonderful - -</li>
      <li>This burner and the pinon incense bricks are the best.  </li>
      <li>The detailing in the burner is wonderful and looks like an adobe house.</li>
      <li>Good quality!</li>
      <li>Great gift.</li>
      <li>It makes me happy when skies are gray.</li>
      <li>We have a wood burning stove but don&#x27;t get the great smell.</li>
      <li>Had one 50 years ago, they are still great.</li>
      <li>Colors are great and the house is easy to remove and place the incense bricks for burning and the bricks burn perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Good price,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a charming item and the incense</li>
      <li>The adobe is so charming, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>cute packaging - made a great gift.</li>
      <li>This very cute abode incense burner is part of a line by Incienso De Danta Fe.  </li>
      <li>I was in Arizona visiting friends and stumbled across this at a giftshop, purchased it for myself, and LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>They absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and when I got my own place she bought me one.  </li>
      <li>Like all the burners, it looks nice on a shelf or desk whether you burn incense or not...</li>
      <li>Gives a nice homey feeling, seeing the fragrant smoke wafting from the chimney.</li>
      <li>Really nice looking.</li>
      <li>Another great southwest incense burner that reminds me of Taos Pueblo in northern New Mexico-the land that I love!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cute and it works.</li>
      <li>We light pinion and it fills the house with warm woodsy campfire smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a well made, interesting, and functional incense burner.  </li>
      <li>I really love the concept of this.  </li>
      <li>This is so adorable, and it works well</li>
      <li>My mom and I both love this company&#x27;s incense.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>We bought this as a gift because we love the identical burner and incense that I&#x27;ve owned for more than 30 years.</li>
      <li>They report that I couldn&#x27;t have sent a more memorable gift.  </li>
      <li>I love it, it reminds us of our trip to Santa Fe.</li>
      <li>This thing is so cute when there is incense burning in it.</li>
      <li>It is an adorable and safe vessel to burn our piñon incense.</li>
      <li>:) Especially love to use it to freshen up the house after cooking.&lt;br /&gt;The little casa is adorable.</li>
      <li>And, and unlike the others, it is easy to touch lightly and have it fall off its imprecise perch.  </li>
      <li>But in a nutshell, its a very smoky, sorta fireplace scented incense as opposed to the oil based sweet incense more popularly found.  </li>
      <li>Smells like a wood fireplace, not that cheap \\&quot;incensey\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>The pinon is such a great smell too.</li>
      <li>but, the aroma has this very fresh quality to it while burning.</li>
      <li>The clay is an orange color, rather than the light tan of the original (still seen in the photo).</li>
      <li>I received my first adobe as a gift, and loved it so much that my purchase here was a gift for someone else.</li>
      <li>If you have never been inside one of these adobe dwellings, you would be so surprised that it is naturally warm in winter and cool in summer!</li>
      <li>Cute item...and incense smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>Try the tepee - it seems to really sit flush and when burning something, this is important!  </li>
      <li>The pinion scent is strong, but nice, and very different.</li>
      <li>This incense burner is meaningful for me--we gave these as gifts to our wedding guests when we got married years ago, so it is of great sentimental value.</li>
      <li>The smell is very natural and not overly perfumed and the adobe house with the smoke coming out of the chimney is cute.  </li>
      <li>It looks like there are notches for it to fit a certain way</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s the only line of its kind anywhere I have found, not just here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to see the smoke come out of the chimney.</li>
      <li>I ordered a pack of 40 bricks separately so no harm, but would have liked the extra ones, too.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much, I ended up ordering a second one in case the first one breaks, or to give it as a gift...</li>
      <li>This is the best smelling incense on the planet, in my opinion, and I am only giving the adobe burner four stars because it did not come with the few bricks to burn as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I burn this in my bedroom with central air on, and it works fine  without being overpowering !</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use only one block a day as the fragrance lingers.</li>
      <li>This burner can burn any cone incense of course, and would make a handsome addition if you are collecting the entire line of burners.</li>
      <li>But you already know that ;)</li>
      <li>Had my first one of these in the sixties</li>
      <li>The incense burning through the &#x27;chimney&#x27; delights pretty much anyone who sees it.</li>
      <li>I have waited many years to replace my little tepee from the same manufacturer and was delighted to find the incense and the burner again (last time - 1990).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quaintly decorative and works very well.  </li>
      <li>I had this exact old thing years ago from a \\&quot;Nature</li>
      <li>I have left a full review of it in another post.  </li>
      <li>I love this little burner--smells much better than your typical incense.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little terra cotta house with a hole for he smoke - it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
      <li>Anyway, fast forward twenty years, and that old one was lost in time and space.</li>
      <li>This was a gift to  the  New England area.  </li>
      <li>Matches the burner I purchased on a family vacation to New Mexico in 1957.</li>
      <li>This is very soft clay, almost like plaster.</li>
      <li>and cedar scents take me back to my first Christmas in Albuquerque.</li>
      <li>The pellet lasts much longer than just open tot</li>
      <li>All natural.</li>
      <li>The whole family agreed, this was the only air freshener, insence, whathaveyou that any of us could stand.</li>
      <li>My only issue is that the house doesn&#x27;t really sit on the platform provided that well..</li>
      <li>Recently she took a winter vacation down to sunny Phoenix, but wasn&#x27;t able to bring back one, much to her and our general dismay.</li>
      <li>Contrary to the review above, mine sits squarely on its base--not crooked--maybe they fixed the design!!!</li>
      <li>They clearly have a new manufacturer as the appearance and quality is not the same as the old one.</li>
      <li>Classic New Mexico Kitsch&lt;br /&gt;Great gift or memento to bring a little New Mexico to any home.&lt;br /&gt;Pi&amp;ntilde;on</li>
      <li>About 3 inches long and a couple of inches or so high.</li>
      <li>ad this was a fun little extra.</li>
      <li>The others in the line ( a cabin, tee pee, oven, and ceremonial house) all have removable tops that fit squarely on the top of the burner base.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Unlike the other burners in this line, this particular one is a little cheaper made.  </li>
<li> I mostly burn it on cold winter days, and of course on Christmas eve.</li>
<li> Company\\&quot; store that has long since closed</li>
<li> am so incredibly disappointed, and all the more upset that I dropped the last one we had.</li>
<li> we have several of the burners, the tipi, the adobe, and the little chiminea.</li>
<li> For some reason, this one is also a little smaller than the others.  </li>
<li> I plan to get a couple of the other styles as well.</li>
<li> BUT....this company sent a cute little \\&quot;Fireplace with dog lying on a rug in front of it - still burns the incense, but we were so disappointed to not receive the adobe \\&quot;house\\&quot;</li>
<li> BUT....where is the little \\&quot;Santa Fe adobe house incense burner\\&quot;???</li>
<li> They all have a southwest flavor to them, as opposed to the usual dragons, wizards, and unicorns that dominate other incense burner lines.  </li>

    <li> Another great southwest incense burner that reminds me of Taos Pueblo in northern New Mexico-the land that I love! If you have never been inside one of these adobe dwellings, you would be so surprised that it is naturally warm in winter and cool in summer! I burn this in my bedroom with central air on, and it works fine  without being overpowering ! Just be sure to use only one block a day as the fragrance lingers.</li>
    <li> This very cute abode incense burner is part of a line by Incienso De Danta Fe.  They all have a southwest flavor to them, as opposed to the usual dragons, wizards, and unicorns that dominate other incense burner lines.  In fact, it&#x27;s the only line of its kind anywhere I have found, not just here on Amazon.  They are all designed to burn either cone, or brick incense.  No sticks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the other burners in this line, this particular one is a little cheaper made.  Or at least, not as well thought out.  The others in the line ( a cabin, tee pee, oven, and ceremonial house) all have removable tops that fit squarely on the top of the burner base.  This one for some reason has a smaller base, and is designed in such a way that it sits at an angle, as the picture shows.  And, and unlike the others, it is easy to touch lightly and have it fall off its imprecise perch.  This does not in any way make this burner unsafe or useless by any means, but it is just not as well thought out as the others in this line. One final thought, none of these burners are very big.  About 3 inches long and a couple of inches or so high. For some reason, this one is also a little smaller than the others.  You may want to keep this in mind if you are considering this for yourself, or a gift, and am having trouble deciding which one of the line to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this burner, like all of them, come with a small batch of wood based incense in a brick design.  I have left a full review of it in another post.  But in a nutshell, its a very smoky, sorta fireplace scented incense as opposed to the oil based sweet incense more popularly found.  This burner can burn any cone incense of course, and would make a handsome addition if you are collecting the entire line of burners. Like all the burners, it looks nice on a shelf or desk whether you burn incense or not...</li>
    <li> The adobe is so charming, and smells amazing. We have a wood burning stove but don&#x27;t get the great smell. We light pinion and it fills the house with warm woodsy campfire smell. The incense burning through the &#x27;chimney&#x27; delights pretty much anyone who sees it. I received my first adobe as a gift, and loved it so much that my purchase here was a gift for someone else. My sister bought one, bought one for her friend&#x27;s wedding. My friend came to visit he bought one as well... you can&#x27;t not love this adobe.</li>
    <li> I love this little burner--smells much better than your typical incense. Smells like a wood fireplace, not that cheap \\&quot;incensey\\&quot; smell. The execution is adorable--nicely painted and made. Looks great!  Contrary to the review above, mine sits squarely on its base--not crooked--maybe they fixed the design!!!</li>
    <li> I was in Arizona visiting friends and stumbled across this at a giftshop, purchased it for myself, and LOVE IT!  It&#x27;s a well made, interesting, and functional incense burner.  The pinon bricks it comes with remind me of the smell of the lodge we stayed in out west in-- it is earthy, smells like you have a fireplace going all the time, and rustic.  I loved it so much, I ended up ordering a second one in case the first one breaks, or to give it as a gift...I haven&#x27;t decided.</li>
    <li> Classic New Mexico Kitsch&lt;br /&gt;Great gift or memento to bring a little New Mexico to any home.&lt;br /&gt;Pi&amp;ntilde;on and cedar scents take me back to my first Christmas in Albuquerque. I got off the plane and the pi&amp;ntilde;on smoke perfumed the air.&lt;br /&gt;This burner and incense bring me back.</li>
    <li> I had this exact old thing years ago from a \\&quot;Nature Company\\&quot; store that has long since closed so I couldn&#x27;t replace it when it broke and my incense was used up. It&#x27;s a charming item and the incense really deserves an entirely different name as it&#x27;s nothing like the typical stuff! I grew up in a home heated by fireplace and wood stove- these pinion wood blocks invoke the coziness of a crackling fire holding back an autumn chill.</li>
    <li> This thing is so cute when there is incense burning in it. The pellet lasts much longer than just open tot he air like we were doing it. I plan to get a couple of the other styles as well. The pinon is such a great smell too.</li>
    <li> My mom had one of these when I was a kid and when I got my own place she bought me one.  Fifteen years later, I still use it regularly.  I like the Pinon wood the best because it is what mom burned, but all of the woods offered will make your house smell like you have the fireplace going.  I don&#x27;t have a fireplace in my house so it is especially nice.  I mostly burn it on cold winter days, and of course on Christmas eve.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as advertised. It&#x27;s a little terra cotta house with a hole for he smoke - it&#x27;s really cute. My only issue is that the house doesn&#x27;t really sit on the platform provided that well.. It looks like there are notches for it to fit a certain way but it just doesn&#x27;t. Good price, cute packaging - made a great gift.</li>
    <li> Was worried it was just going to smell like campfire smoke but, the aroma has this very fresh quality to it while burning. It makes me happy when skies are gray. :) Especially love to use it to freshen up the house after cooking.&lt;br /&gt;The little casa is adorable. It&#x27;s not meant to sit flush to the base because it needs an opening to draw air in. Don&#x27;t expect it to sit flush.</li>
    <li> Really nice looking. All natural. Smoke comes out chimney. Great gift. I would recommend this. Smell is great and your friends will like it too!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to  the  New England area.  They report that I couldn&#x27;t have sent a more memorable gift.  They absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> The detailing in the burner is wonderful and looks like an adobe house. Colors are great and the house is easy to remove and place the incense bricks for burning and the bricks burn perfectly.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My mom got one of these from a secret santa one year. The whole family agreed, this was the only air freshener, insence, whathaveyou that any of us could stand. The pinion scent is strong, but nice, and very different. Anyway, fast forward twenty years, and that old one was lost in time and space. Recently she took a winter vacation down to sunny Phoenix, but wasn&#x27;t able to bring back one, much to her and our general dismay. But we know where to look - AMAZON! Pinyon times are here again.&lt;br /&gt;Now we have several of the burners, the tipi, the adobe, and the little chiminea. They all work. The new adobe house did crack on first use, and the crack opens up every time thereafter, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get any worse. This is very soft clay, almost like plaster.</li>
    <li> I really love the concept of this.  It&#x27;s quaintly decorative and works very well.  Gives a nice homey feeling, seeing the fragrant smoke wafting from the chimney.</li>
    <li> This burner and the pinon incense bricks are the best.  The smell is very natural and not overly perfumed and the adobe house with the smoke coming out of the chimney is cute.  We bought this as a gift because we love the identical burner and incense that I&#x27;ve owned for more than 30 years.</li>
    <li> Cute item...and incense smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue keeping the incense lit..hard to get started and goes out after a short while..have to keep re lighting</li>
    <li> I ordered the little \\&quot;Santa Fe\\&quot; style adobe incense burner.  Used to have one just like it - BUT....this company sent a cute little \\&quot;Fireplace with dog lying on a rug in front of it - still burns the incense, but we were so disappointed to not receive the adobe \\&quot;house\\&quot; like we used to have-otherwise the service was quite prompt and the incense smelled wonderful - - BUT....where is the little \\&quot;Santa Fe adobe house incense burner\\&quot;???</li>
    <li> I have waited many years to replace my little tepee from the same manufacturer and was delighted to find the incense and the burner again (last time - 1990).  This is the best smelling incense on the planet, in my opinion, and I am only giving the adobe burner four stars because it did not come with the few bricks to burn as advertised.  I ordered a pack of 40 bricks separately so no harm, but would have liked the extra ones, too.  The burner does not sit flush but they are handmade. Try the tepee - it seems to really sit flush and when burning something, this is important!  In all, Incense of the West is the Best!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and I purchased myself one shaped like a tee pee. My mom and I both love this company&#x27;s incense. ad this was a fun little extra. It&#x27;s a silly thing but it&#x27;s cute and it works. It&#x27;s fun to see the smoke come out of the chimney. It&#x27;s fairly small. Do you need it? No. But you already know that ;)</li>
    <li> Remnants of my childhood and family vacations in Santa Fe....Had my first one of these in the sixties</li>
    <li> I love it, it reminds us of our trip to Santa Fe. It is an adorable and safe vessel to burn our piñon incense.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Beautiful!! Good quality!</li>
    <li> Matches the burner I purchased on a family vacation to New Mexico in 1957.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of nostalgia.  Had one 50 years ago, they are still great.</li>
    <li> Goes hand-in-hand with Mesquite Wood Incense bricks.</li>
    <li> This is so adorable, and it works well and I like the quality of the incense it uses.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace another we dropped and broke. They clearly have a new manufacturer as the appearance and quality is not the same as the old one. The clay is an orange color, rather than the light tan of the original (still seen in the photo). The base is not even and does not lay flat on the table. The house also does not sit squarely on the base. The paint job is also not up to the same quality as before.&lt;br /&gt;I am so incredibly disappointed, and all the more upset that I dropped the last one we had. This incense burner is meaningful for me--we gave these as gifts to our wedding guests when we got married years ago, so it is of great sentimental value. I am so disappointed that the new one is of such poor quality.</li>
