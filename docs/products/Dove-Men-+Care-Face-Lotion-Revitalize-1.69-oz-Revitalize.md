      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good, non-greasy lotion that feels nice on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, which is a very good thing for something that you&#x27;re applying close to your nose.</li>
      <li>It is really an amazing</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cleared up nicely.</li>
      <li>I like the idea that it has sunscreen in it, and that will come in handy here in Tucson.  </li>

      <li>I love Dove products.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a couple of months now and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had this issue more than once on my face</li>
      <li>The canister has a pump on the top, and one push is all I need.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>I love this face lotion.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more when this is used up.</li>

      <li>Light scent!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect all around the face and back of neck.</li>
      <li>so it is ok anyway</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s probably more plastic than lotion in this product.</li>
      <li>The bottle is handsome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d mostly say to keep an eye on which one you buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good smell and my lady likes it after it&#x27;s had five minutes to dissipate but right off the bat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly light, doesn&#x27;t add a shiny look to my skin, absorbs fairly quickly, and does a good job of hydrating my skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a very refreshing feeling on the skin once it is used but did not care for the scent very much.</li>
      <li>It soaked in very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Packaging was nice-liked the design of the bottle and easily came out of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a bit strong.</li>
      <li>This Dove lotion is pleasantly fragranced, is easy to apply and is easily absorbed with no icky residue.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent on it and stays longer on his skin.</li>
      <li>It is light, not to greasy.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll light some incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth, not oily, absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>It is lightly scented.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall though a great lotion that I would use again.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fast and has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>I use it in the morning after shaving and it also helps smooth away any discomfort that causes.</li>
      <li>i will buy one more next time , good</li>
      <li>has made a nice softening moisturizer which softens the face nicely, and smells lightly masculine, but it does not do anything much for tightening, or lifting the skin at all.  </li>
      <li>very good, absorb quickly, no grease.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a light scent and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Not musky, more of an Irish Spring kind of smell.  </li>
      <li>I like that it is absorbed by the skin so quickly (without leaving residue) and that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to someone who is looking for a light moisturizer that does not leave your skin looking greasy -- and it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>In the past I&#x27;ve not had great luck with pumps like this being able to dispense all the lotion, so I like the fact that it&#x27;s low-mess</li>
      <li>This is a good daily face lotion for men.</li>
      <li>My objective is to test and review products fairly, providing you with helpful information that improves your shopping experience.</li>
      <li>a enough to smell good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and this stuff does a good job for me.  </li>
      <li>I liked the pump which is good if you are older and don&#x27;t have the same fine motor skills (difficulty opening jars, holding lids steady etc)</li>
      <li>my face is actual clearer than before and looks a lot more radiant and feels smooth even with a full beard&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dove!</li>
      <li>It goes on clean and is absorbed quickly while still feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>I apply the lotion after shaving and it absorbs quickly without a cloying smell or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m applying lotion to my face and it absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>Since I live in a very warm climate with high humidity, I really put this product to the test.</li>
      <li>The scent is a pleasant lime and peppery spice with a hint of woodsy undertones.  </li>
      <li>wife complimented me on my skin (that was a first!)</li>
      <li>It is an excellent lotion, and left me without the dry patches that I was concerned about.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light, unobjectionable fragrance, and I would prefer completely unscented because I use cologne, but the  scent probably wouldn&#x27;t overpower cologne.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
      <li>Hubby said his skin quickly absorbed the lotion, and it did not leave his skin feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Right now it&#x27;s been one hour since my application and the smell</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on what exactly it smells like, but it is refreshing early in the morning.</li>
      <li>It would be better in a tube instead of the pump bottle, but I have no other complaints.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh scent (for men) and it takes care of the problem dry areas: around the nose and in the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was fortunate and got to try both kinds through the Vine program for free, but I like them enough that I&#x27;m going to buy the Hydrate version to try it out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-Not very much lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is too oil……after use it the skin not that dry  so it is ok anyway</li>
    <li> I have sensitive dry skin. Shaving kills me but I can&#x27;t just throw anything on because I break out. Tried this out and surprisingly no breakouts. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Feels light and dry after a minute or so. Smells good. One pump is enough for the face. It&#x27;s a rather tiny bottle.</li>
    <li> very good . I like it very much .  a nice one.  i will buy one more next time , good</li>
    <li> Feels good..not sure how it helps my skin yet.</li>
    <li> The bottle is handsome. The dispenser is slick. The lotion spreads easily and moisturizes deeply, and a little goes a long way. Yet I can&#x27;t recommend this product. Why not? The smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dab it on your face and you&#x27;ll detect a flagrant odor that&#x27;s remarkably reminiscent of Axe body spray, the first deodorant of many a teenager. It&#x27;s anything but subtle. And it&#x27;s on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, as Unilever owns both Axe and Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to smell like a high school student or college freshman, you&#x27;ll like this. On the other hand, if you have a modicum of taste or sophistication, avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak to the &amp;#34;Revitalize&amp;#34; line, as that&#x27;s the one I bought. But I wouldn&#x27;t risk my money on the other two. Right now it&#x27;s been one hour since my application and the smell is still present and disagreeable. I think I&#x27;ll light some incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s probably the last time I try buying a toiletries online. I think I&#x27;ll go back to the more expensive Lab Series line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and good luck with your online shopping endeavors.</li>
    <li> Moisturize my face during these cold weather and leaves a smell that is not strong but a enough to smell good</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of such products in general, but this one is light and not a bit greasy.  Definitely would buy.</li>
    <li> I find the smell to be a bit unpleasant, which is problematic as it tends to linger for quite some time.  As a face lotion it&#x27;s just OK... I&#x27;ve essentially stopped using it as the smell outweighs it&#x27;s usefulness to me.</li>
    <li> This is a great aftershave lotion.  The one complaint I have is that it is a little greasy to me.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion.  The formula is non-greasy and has no obnoxious fragrance.  Dove has stepped up their game in the battle for the men&#x27;s skin care line market.  Its on par with any of the high-end skin care lines.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried out many different moisturizers- some made for men, and some not.  One of the concerns that he has is not only moisturizing, but also anti-aging properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove has made a nice softening moisturizer which softens the face nicely, and smells lightly masculine, but it does not do anything much for tightening, or lifting the skin at all.  It does make skin velvety soft but that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the softening properties, it gets a five star, but for the lack of all around properties, it gets only three stars.  As an average I would say four stars.  There are other products out there that have similar moisturizing properties yet lift and tighten the skin better than this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a simple moisturizer that keeps skin soft, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for other properties, you might want to look at other products.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about having to use a face lotion, but my doctor suggested it and this is a great product. I use it before work and it seems to last all day. I love Dove men care products, they&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to dry skin, mainly on my hands, so I was definitely interested to check out this face lotion and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It absorbs pretty quickly and definitely doesn&#x27;t leave you with that greasy feeling that some hand lotions do - big plus there. It also smells great - my girlfriend notices it and really likes it. I personally like the smell of it, too - it&#x27;s fragrant without being flowery. I typically get pretty minor acne on my face every couple of weeks but I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a couple of months now and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had this issue more than once on my face since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to be picking up more of this stuff - while it&#x27;s a little expensive, it lasts quite a while so it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> I never used any kind of face lotion before, so I was skeptical. Now that I am in my mid 50&#x27;s, my skin is getting a little dry. This lotion is not oily, and just a small amount rubbed in after shaving makes your skin soft and  moisturized all day. The scent is very nice and manly, and lasts all day. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> My sweetheart works outdoors and the winds and sun and blowing dirt are rough on his handsome face.  I have been trying to get him to use my face cream on his face and he looked at me like I had three heads.  This is made for men and so heas agreeable.  It was made by dove, so I thought it would be of quality.  I like that it completely absorbs into his face and is not greasy.  It is lightly scented.  If he doesn&#x27;t wear anything else it&#x27;s pleasant and clean.  If he wears cologne it simple fades out.  I don&#x27;t like that there is no SPF.  I think there should be.  He has a beard and this does not create a buildup in his beard, it mixes in well, and makes his beard softer.  His one complaint is that when he has been wind burned and then uses this lotion there is an instant burn feel.  So I would assume if your face is extremely sensitive this may not be the gentlest solution.</li>
    <li> Well, brace yourself - because you&#x27;re probably going to like this stuff, and it costs ~$4 an OUNCE.  :D  That would be like my normal $8 bottle of [[ASIN:B004ML4XW4 Jergens Shea Butter]] costing over $100.  :eek:  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - you can (and I have) buy really inexpensive lotion that is worthless, so it&#x27;s not all about the money to me.  However, Jergens is pretty decent stuff and a lot less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, given that, why four stars?  Because I really do like this stuff.  It&#x27;s pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole face, neck, and ears.  The canister has a pump on the top, and one push is all I need.  It&#x27;s fairly light, doesn&#x27;t add a shiny look to my skin, absorbs fairly quickly, and does a good job of hydrating my skin.  It&#x27;s unquestionably a step up from my normal Jergens, as it should be given the price.  It&#x27;s such a step up, though, that I&#x27;m going to recommend that you give it a try.  I like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three varieties of this lotion.  I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;Revitalize\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; versions - neither of which have any sunscreen, as far as I can tell (the \\&quot;Hydrate\\&quot; version does have sunscreen).  I normally buy sensitive skin products for my face, but in this case, I prefer the Revitalize variety.  The Sensitive version smells a bit mediciney to me, but I like the scent of the Revitalize variety.  Also, the only difference in the ingredients lists between the two is that fragrance and stearic acid are flip-flopped in the order, although the amount of ingredients could be different.  They both seem to have the same effect on my skin, and neither irritate it.  So, my vote goes to Revitalize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate and got to try both kinds through the Vine program for free, but I like them enough that I&#x27;m going to buy the Hydrate version to try it out.  I like the idea that it has sunscreen in it, and that will come in handy here in Tucson.  I won&#x27;t give this a full five stars because of the price, but overall, I recommend giving it a try.I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Dove Men Revitalize Face Lotion leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft. It offers just the right amount of moisture and doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy. It&#x27;s perfect all around the face and back of neck. The scent is masculine, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s light enough so it doesn&#x27;t clash with cologne. It would be better in a tube instead of the pump bottle, but I have no other complaints. It&#x27;s a good product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I like to leave short and &amp;#34;to the point&amp;#34; reviews for my experience and whether I would recommend this. Bought this after my face starting turning red and sort of flaking. Like dry skin or a healing sunburn basically. So started applying this twice daily and it&#x27;s cleared up nicely. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use aftershave regularly, but on days that I don&#x27;t have time to shave, I don&#x27;t want to mess with the greasy feeling that my aftershave leaves with a previously dry face.  I was excited to try this product, but found myself disappointed.  It is an excellent lotion, and left me without the dry patches that I was concerned about.  However, less than a half hour after application, the nice manly smell that I had liked about it was completely gone, and replaced by something much more reminiscent of my mothers night cream, with a touch of spoiled milk.  I don&#x27;t know if they were still figuring out the formula with the initial batch, or if this is the standard, but I am not interested in purchasing another bottle to find out.</li>
    <li> It has a very refreshing feeling on the skin once it is used but did not care for the scent very much. Packaging was nice-liked the design of the bottle and easily came out of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though scent is everything with me so would not buy again...</li>
    <li> Dove Men&#x27;s face lotion is pretty nice, it can be quickly rubbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, the smell is alright, but I am not a big fan of scented lotions personally. I like the container, and the size is small but it does go a long way. I like that it has spf since I have skin issues from chemotherapy.</li>
    <li> My husband has real dry skin, especially on his face. The North Carolina weather doesn&#x27;t help either. He&#x27;s tried various products and lotions and they either were soaked up by his dry skin, almost instantly or after a few moments they would flake up on his skin. He seems to be responding well to this product. It has a light scent on it and stays longer on his skin. It does eventually soak into his dry skin, but I&#x27;m sure with regular use his skin will adapt. Hmm. Dove . . . who knew?</li>
    <li> One of the best face lotions for men. It really helps in the afternoons when your face gets dry or you look tired. It doesn&#x27;t make your face oily like the other creams do. It is really an amazing</li>
    <li> This Dove lotion is pleasantly fragranced, is easy to apply and is easily absorbed with no icky residue. I also like that its small travel-sized container fits conveniently in my backpack.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of all the Dove products. This face lotion I gave to my husband because he suffers from severe dry skin on his face. Dove is known for being a good quality moisturizer and this product does just that. It has a nice fresh scent (for men) and it takes care of the problem dry areas: around the nose and in the eyebrows. I recommend this lotion 5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer for men that actually works. Most moisturizers, even supposedly unisex ones, are like, mango blossom scent, and not something that most men are going to want to have on all the time. This one fills that gap in the market. It definitely helped my husband&#x27;s dry and sensitive skin, was non-irritating, and it has a nice, subtle masculine cologne scent.</li>
    <li> This is generally very nice lotion. The scent is mild, which is a very good thing for something that you&#x27;re applying close to your nose. It&#x27;s nice and rich, spreads well, and absorbs into skin nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is small and well designed to be portable without making a mess. In the past I&#x27;ve not had great luck with pumps like this being able to dispense all the lotion, so I like the fact that it&#x27;s low-mess but you have to weigh it against possibly not getting it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole I quite like it. I&#x27;d mostly say to keep an eye on which one you buy. For the mornings it&#x27;s a good idea to have some SPF in your face lotion. At night it doesn&#x27;t matter too much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dove man all the way.</li>
    <li> Paid $5.39. It does a great job of moisturizing your face. I have noticed using this over the course of a month, I have noticeably less acne and less breakouts. It keeps my face moisturized and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling. I will continue to use this product as it works. It has really helped during the winter months.</li>
    <li> This is a good daily face lotion for men. It&#x27;s got a light scent and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. I tried this, as did my fiancé, and we both agreed. I use a Neutrogena face lotion daily and this is just as good. When I don&#x27;t use a face lotion, my skin feels tight and dry. My only complaint is that I wish the bottles were a little bigger, especially with daily use, it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a man, but I&#x27;m married to one so that&#x27;s how I qualified myself for giving this moisturizer a try.  I am VERY picky about scents so all lotions that go on me OR on him have to pass my \\&quot;sniff test\\&quot; first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Men+Care has a great, fresh scent.  Not musky, more of an Irish Spring kind of smell.  Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thick but not at all greasy, it feels like it melts into the skin but he hasn&#x27;t complained about feeling like he needs to re-apply it later like he&#x27;s had to do with other brands.  He has sensitive skin (gets rashes) and so far (about 3 weeks) this lotion hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.  The price is great too and it&#x27;s easy to find in any store, which makes it even better.  Smells good, feels good, works well and the price is great - what more to ask?</li>
    <li> This lotion made a very nice finish to the shave, especially considering that our water softener recently stopped working and my skin has been feeling unusually dry.  It soaked in very quickly.  It has a very light, unobjectionable fragrance, and I would prefer completely unscented because I use cologne, but the  scent probably wouldn&#x27;t overpower cologne.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;d choose an unscented version first.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my Men+care facial moisturizer.  From the first night that I put it on before going to bed, I have noticed that my face is dramatically smoother.  My favorite things about this product are: its light and refreshing scent, the non greasy feel, the size of the bottle is perfect for travel, and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated after every use.  I would highly recommend this product to someone who is looking for a light moisturizer that does not leave your skin looking greasy -- and it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this when I purchased my dove deodorant and it came with a mini version of this product. I tried it before going out in the humidity that is Florida weather. I was struggling trying to keep my face moist and clear but once I used this it went so well with my skin. my face is actual clearer than before and looks a lot more radiant and feels smooth even with a full beard&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dove!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that likes to moisturize my face...without lotion of some kind, my face tends to look craggy and dried out.  I used the new Dove lotion with some trepidation.  Soap, which is what Dove is known for, can really make my face break out if I&#x27;m not careful to remove all the soap after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, the lotion is pleasant smelling (not sure what the scent is, call it \\&quot;Generic Scent &#x27;o&#x27; lotion\\&quot;) but it smells good and vaguely reminiscent of soap.  The bottle includes the phrase &#x27;Dematologist Tested&#x27; so that gave me some comfort. I&#x27;ll say this...the lotion does moisturize.  An hour later and I could still feel it on my face, moisturizing away (is that a verb?).  It stung a little going on, probably a consequence of my shaving this morning.  The only reason that I gave this four versus five stars is that the packaging is colored and non-opaque, so you can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the bottle.  This isn&#x27;t a ding on the lotion, just on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in, it seems to be a good, effective moisturizer that appears to have some staying power!  If you are considering purchasing, go on ahead...I will be buying more when this is used up.</li>
    <li> This face lotion works great. It is very easy to apply to the neck and face area. It absorbs fast and has a nice scent. It does feel a little greasy at first though which is really the only downside. Overall though a great lotion that I would use again.</li>
    <li> It worked well for me, I had some facial redness from dry skin, used this for a few days and redness is completely gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and found that it works very well to give my skin a soft but not oily feel. I like that it is absorbed by the skin so quickly (without leaving residue) and that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. The only reason I&#x27;m going with four stars is the high price per container.</li>
    <li> This is a great light lotion after a hard day working outside or just those windy days.  It is light, not to greasy.  It goes on clean and is absorbed quickly while still feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love Dove products. I didn&#x27;t use to apply face lotion in the past until I started using this Dove face lotion. What a difference! Since I live in a very warm climate with high humidity, I really put this product to the test. My face feels moisturized, clean and fresh all day long. No exceptions! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good Product, Good Price, Good Service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and this stuff does a good job for me.  Smooth, not oily, absorbs well.  The smell is pretty strong and I tend to prefer something with less odor when I&#x27;m rubbing it on my nose.  It&#x27;s a good smell and my lady likes it after it&#x27;s had five minutes to dissipate but right off the bat, it&#x27;s a bit strong.</li>
    <li> very good, absorb quickly, no grease. Light scent!  I just wonder what is the different between hydrate, sensitive, and revitalize ! In amazon they said &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; .... if just the scent, it should not be different in price.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, and I&#x27;m a guy. I hate lotion. For whatever reason, I like this Dove Face Lotion a LOT. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m applying lotion to my face and it absorbs quickly so I forget that I have. It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, but my face stays moisturized all day. Why didn&#x27;t I try this stuff sooner? The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering- it is very light. I can&#x27;t put my finger on what exactly it smells like, but it is refreshing early in the morning. Another pro? It has SPF 15. That is adequate for the amount of sun I get on a regular day. (Obviously I would need sunblock if I was at the beach or planning a day outdoors.) Highly recommend this product to other guys that feel the way I do about lotions!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to moisturizing my face when I was younger. Now that I&#x27;ve reached the age when a morning check in the mirror includes dry skin and tufts of ear hair that serve as daily reminders that I&#x27;m on the downhill side of life, I&#x27;m keenly aware of the need to apply some lotion to soothe the rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of Dove&#x27;s claim that its face lotion could be applied without a greasy feeling. I was wrong. I apply the lotion after shaving and it absorbs quickly without a cloying smell or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife complimented me on my skin (that was a first!) and reminded me to trim my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s a romantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Four stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: My only complaint about this product is the unnecessary amount of packaging. I&#x27;d rather buy this in a collapsible tube instead of the short can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback.

    <li> I thought the smell was nice-not too manly or too pansy ;). I tried it on my dad&#x27;s face and neck area. He&#x27;s old now and shaves twice a week and wanted to see how it would hold up his skin integrity. His skin did feel softer which was nice. The smell not too overpowering so good for people with sensitivity to fragances. I think it was a good buy. I liked the pump which is good if you are older and don&#x27;t have the same fine motor skills (difficulty opening jars, holding lids steady etc)</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care Revitalize face lotion is a light lotion made for facial use.  It is absorbed quickly but leaves a protective coating that is smooth and lasts a long time.  The scent is a pleasant lime and peppery spice with a hint of woodsy undertones.  It comes in what looks like a little miniature shaving cream can and is quite easy to dispense.</li>
    <li> I live smack in the middle of the high plains. The temperatures range from 20-below in the winter to 114 in the summer. The wind blows constantly and it&#x27;s dry!....really dry. The bottom line is that the climate takes a toll on your skin. Now I can treat the scaly dry skin on my body through moisturizers in the tub, but I&#x27;d never really considered the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When given the opportunity to try Dove Men+Care Revitalize + Face Lotion I figured, \\&quot;why not\\&quot;? The lotion is light and non-greasy. The scent is vaguely herbal and very light as well. I like the way it feels and the way it makes my skin feel. I tend to have very dry patches around the corners of my mouth and around the crow&#x27;s feet area of my eyes. After just a few days of use, there was a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab will do you. I use it in the morning after shaving and it also helps smooth away any discomfort that causes.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1PKDLK408D9ZS]]I didn&#x27;t like how perfumed this is. It smells good, but I don&#x27;t usually like perfumed lotions, and there&#x27;s nothing about the container that indicates that it&#x27;s perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, non-greasy lotion that feels nice on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only 50 mL, which is the exact same amount as is in a shot glass, so you really don&#x27;t get very much lotion at all. I probably used about half of the lotion in this video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Works well, non-greasy, and moisturizes your face well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t like the perfume&lt;br /&gt;-Not very much lotion. There&#x27;s probably more plastic than lotion in this product.</li>
    <li> Do men really put lotions on their faces? I mean, other than sun block, I never see any guys put lotions on their faces. I know I don&#x27;t. There may be guys out there that have extremely fry skin and would benefit from lotions, but faces are usually pretty oily places and don&#x27;t need any extra moisture on them. Marketing face lotions to men seems like a risky proposition to me, and isn&#x27;t anything I&#x27;d be voting in favor of if I was in charge of launching new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample bottle of this lotion, which I have been using on the portions of my body that actually need moisturizing - my hands, knees and elbows. Being a hard-working tradesman, these are the parts of my body that get the most wear and tear and get overly dry. This lotion works as well as well as most other lotions I have used in the past, though previous lotions I have used don&#x27;t have fragrance in them. Honestly, the added fragrance doesn&#x27;t float my boat, and I would prefer it to not have any scent. I probably still prefer moisturizing lotion products from companies such as Neutrogena, Jergens, Lubriderm or Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing you have to realize is that with this Dove product you&#x27;re getting a very miniscule amount. Most moisturizing lotion bottle have several ounces of lotion in them, while this one has less than two. You&#x27;re almost paying fragrance prices for this lotion, which is running you over $8.00 per ounce. That&#x27;s a pretty steep price to pay. High enough, so, that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for any guy that spends a lot of time outdoors. Cold and wind are very hard on your face.  Hubby said his skin quickly absorbed the lotion, and it did not leave his skin feeling greasy. I like it because it does not have an over-powering scent.</li>
