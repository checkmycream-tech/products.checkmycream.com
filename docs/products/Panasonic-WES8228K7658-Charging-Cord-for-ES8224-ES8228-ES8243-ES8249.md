    <li> Great replacement for my Panasonic razor! Item came as described and works great. Highly recommended for anyone who needs an extra power adapter.</li>
    <li> My butt is back to being smooth as a babies...,well butt, again. So much better than the weed wacker I had been forced to use without this!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Shipped quickly.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my razor&#x27;s lost cord.</li>
    <li> It works well and it charges fast.  It does have a buzzing sound while it is plugged into the wall.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I lost my original charging cord on a international trip. After research and ordered one at Amazon and it works like champing. Love it.</li>
    <li> Just like the original as others have mentioned, a little pricey for a dog toy. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Fast service/shipping.</li>
    <li> What can you really say about this charging cord? It is a good charging cord, reliable and well made I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and was delivered in speedy fashion.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> The original charger that came with my shaver was lost needed to be replaced.  This charger was the exact replacement.  It arrived n a timely fashion and seems to be working as intended.</li>
    <li> This was the exact plug my husband needed for his shaver. He had misplaced his when we took a trip and we were unsure a replacement from amazon would be a good fit. Well it was perfect and it is still working after several months.</li>
    <li> After hunting down the PDF manual for the shaver I have I arrived here, just like you, looking for a new charger, this has endured a year of use, charging once a week, and literally being thrown back into a drawer. Does what it says and is durable, what more could a man want?</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it. Works as described and for the Panasonic electric razor I own.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I stupidly left the charger behind on a trip. Now I think I may get another, so I have one at home and one to keep in my travel bag. It&#x27;s nice to have a backup.</li>
    <li> So far so good, what more can I say except that it works as promised. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement of the panasonic shaver adapter that I accidentally left in a room.  Delivery was very quick too.</li>
