      <li>Love this fragrance!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>If you love the smell of Orange Blossom then this is the fragrance for you!</li>
      <li>Love Joe Malone cologne!  </li>
      <li>Orange Blossom is my favorite and always get compliments on fragrance!</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, this is a wonderful, light, citrus scent with a honeyed sweet note to it.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best orange blossom scent out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this scent.</li>
      <li>But for heaven&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t pay more here than you&#x27;d pay on the Jo Malone website.</li>
      <li>My husbands favorite.</li>
      <li>smells just like orange blossoms, a smell that I have found most perfumes don&#x27;t replicate well.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful, light citrus flower cologne and I constantly am getting compliments on it from both men and women.  </li>
      <li>It smells excatly like an orange blossom and is very sweet without being overpoweing.</li>
      <li>Very sweet and spring/summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>I live where citrus trees are abundant and this is authentic!</li>
      <li>Recommended for a nice summery or fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Unless you have a ton of money to throw away on high-end, trendy gimmicks, buy REAL perfume that will stay with you throughout the day!</li>
      <li>The little sample size sprays are perfect for that...</li>
      <li>My favorite scent - fresh and light.</li>
      <li>It is light and clean.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my ex wife so she could attract a man, fall in love, get married and thus save me alimony payments.</li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of sitting outside on a warm night and being able to smell flowers from your garden.  </li>
      <li>Go to the Jo Malone website and you can get the same one-ounce bottle for $60, with free shipping and a couple of sample-size sprays thrown in for good measure.</li>
      <li>Extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>No musk, just pure, clean, fresh orange blossom.</li>
      <li>Is rich and heavenly like the real thing.</li>
      <li>I own a lot of Jo Malone cologne and body cream, and it&#x27;s hard to believe that people will pay $15 more per one-ounce bottle for Jo Malone cologne here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very subtle, light, and it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>It has such a unique scent that everyone would ask what I was wearing.  </li>
      <li>The reality is that after one hour of being on your body, the scent is COMPLETELY GONE . . .  </li>
      <li>I realize that they are only &amp;#34;colognes&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;perfumes&amp;#34; but for what they are, they are completely overpriced!!!  </li>
      <li>so small they&#x27;re easy to stash even in a wallet in case you don&#x27;t carry a purse.</li>

<li> so small they&#x27;re easy to stash even in a wallet in case you don&#x27;t carry a purse.</li>
<li> Pretty pricey for a small amount, but it goes a long way.</li>
<li> Or check out Jo Malone on eBay and look for deals - if you spend some time checking the listings, there are deals to be had, with some cologne offered at less than the Jo Malone price (and, yes, just like here, some at higher prices that simply are not justified).</li>
<li> The sillage is minimal, though, so be prepared to re-apply every few hours.</li>
<li> Once I got it i&#x27;ve tried other Orange Blossom fragrances and they do not even come close!</li>
<li> I wear this everyday now.  </li>
<li> I just purchased two bottles (approximately $150 per bottle) of different Jo Malone fragrances.  </li>
<li> this has a very heavy honeysuckle scent, which is a little overpowering, and everyone I asked to tell me what scent they could smell was also honeysuckle....</li>
<li> HATED IT TO STRONG.</li>
<li> and I apply quite heavily!  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a hard one to find.</li>
<li> Try the smallest one at least and you will be hooked.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!  </li>
<li> ,very subtle.</li>
<li> I was looking for an actual orange blossom perfume, and was very disappointed .....</li>
<li> I think the product was fake because every time I used it, it made me sneeze terribly.  </li>
<li> That buyers are stupid?</li>

    <li> HATED IT TO STRONG. AGAIN, SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A SMALL SAMPLE FIRST.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an actual orange blossom perfume, and was very disappointed .....this has a very heavy honeysuckle scent, which is a little overpowering, and everyone I asked to tell me what scent they could smell was also honeysuckle.... I will finish using this perfume, but will probably never buy it again.... I am thinking that the makers of this cologne, have never had the pleasure of actually experiencing the aroma of blossoming oranges in Florida, which is the epitome of the orange blossom scent.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!! It&#x27;s not overpowering...it&#x27;s very subtle, light, and it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.  It has such a unique scent that everyone would ask what I was wearing.  Pretty pricey for a small amount, but it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant pick me up perfume. It smells excatly like an orange blossom and is very sweet without being overpoweing. Recommended for a nice summery or fresh smell.</li>

But for heaven&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t pay more here than you&#x27;d pay on the Jo Malone website. What is this seller thinking? That buyers are stupid? I sure hope the seller is wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a wonderful, light, citrus scent with a honeyed sweet note to it. Perfect for summer and very refreshing.

    <li> My favorite scent - fresh and light.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!  I just purchased two bottles (approximately $150 per bottle) of different Jo Malone fragrances.  The scents were absolutely awesome and heavenly, as were ALL that were displayed at Saks.  The reality is that after one hour of being on your body, the scent is COMPLETELY GONE . . .  and I apply quite heavily!  The salesman advised me to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; the scents, which prompted me to purchase TWO different bottles.  I realize that they are only &amp;#34;colognes&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;perfumes&amp;#34; but for what they are, they are completely overpriced!!!  Unless you have a ton of money to throw away on high-end, trendy gimmicks, buy REAL perfume that will stay with you throughout the day!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, light citrus flower cologne and I constantly am getting compliments on it from both men and women.  The smell reminds me of sitting outside on a warm night and being able to smell flowers from your garden.  Extraordinary.  Not over-powering.  I wear this everyday now.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Another Jo Malone scent! I adore her fragrances but there is no staying power. I wish she&#x27;d make them in perfumes so I wouldn&#x27;t have to reapply after five minutes.</li>
    <li> Love Joe Malone cologne!  Orange Blossom is my favorite and always get compliments on fragrance!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this scent. If you love the smell of Orange Blossom then this is the fragrance for you! I&#x27;ve been searching for this all over and it&#x27;s a hard one to find. Once I got it i&#x27;ve tried other Orange Blossom fragrances and they do not even come close! Try the smallest one at least and you will be hooked. Very sweet and spring/summer fragrance. Just perfection</li>
    <li> This is by far the best orange blossom scent out there. No musk, just pure, clean, fresh orange blossom. I live where citrus trees are abundant and this is authentic! People complain about no staying power, but I can still smell it on my skin after 4 hours....,very subtle.</li>
    <li> I hope this works! I gave it to my ex wife so she could attract a man, fall in love, get married and thus save me alimony payments. Fingers crossed!!</li>
    <li> smells just like orange blossoms, a smell that I have found most perfumes don&#x27;t replicate well. Is rich and heavenly like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It is light and clean. My husbands favorite.</li>
    <li> I think the product was fake because every time I used it, it made me sneeze terribly.  I threw it away.</li>
