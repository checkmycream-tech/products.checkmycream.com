      <li>I like this better than the gel now!</li>

      <li>This was a good substitute, with the plus that the spray applies it more evenly.</li>
      <li>I have problems with perfume in products and this one is very easy on the allergies.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t yet used it on its own instead of AnGel since it seems like you&#x27;d really have to use a lot to get coverage, but for spot areas it works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping as always!</li>
      <li>This spray gel is my favorite product from the DevaCurl line.</li>
      <li>Love the Devacurl method and products.</li>
      <li>I love the product.  </li>
      <li>Since I began using Diva Curl products, my hair has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I thought a spray gel would be more convenient than the bottled gel, but this product is drying.</li>
      <li>I use more Deva Curl and my hair</li>
      <li>It definitely takes some messing around with to get the perfect amount for your hair.</li>
      <li>I love some of the Devacurl products and use them all the time.</li>
      <li>This gel was just okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with the results and definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
      <li>Love it &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>Now, I have recommended it to many friends and love, love, love it and the way my hair looks.</li>
      <li>Much more bounce in my curls when I would use this product.</li>
      <li>One of the many curly hair products I&#x27;ve tried--but this onhe delivers what it promises.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love deva products.</li>
      <li>Love love this product</li>
      <li>I also have to use the devacurl gel and curl creme with this spray and together they do OK.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The price is great and it came in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how it helps control my curls.  </li>
      <li>Free works much better for keeping frizz at bay and keeping her curls bouncy and nice all day.  </li>
      <li>Very clean feel and not sticky at all.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, the scent does bother me a bit, but I am very sensitive to everything.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair, and have been using this mostly to spray on my roots (after I clip them for volume) and on my ends (where I tend to accidentally go light on my Deva AnGel).  </li>
      <li>It would great at keeping my corkscrew hair in check where it tends to get wild.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and switched from TIGI&#x27;s curl spray, which had excellent control and shine, but the fine mist got all over me and into my eyes and smelled too much like candy.</li>
      <li>I have gotten more compliments in the last 6 months than I did in my whole life time...and best of all, my husband has nothing to tease me about anymore :-)</li>
      <li>DevaCurl is hands down the best product line for curly hair!</li>
      <li>I used the ArcAngel gel before, and I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, but I go through it quickly</li>
      <li>It has a nice gentle fragrance too that isn&#x27;t offensive and doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair.  </li>
      <li>The spray gel is great to use after I&#x27;ve put in the regular pump gel and have my curls set in place.</li>
      <li>Such a great product.</li>
      <li>I use this product 6 days a week always cleansing hair with a cheap brand on the seventh to rid it of any build up.  </li>
      <li>The product smells good &amp; makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>My hair looks OK the first day, but it feels and looks sort of tacky (with the DevaCurl stuff)</li>
      <li>smells good, didn&#x27;t have enough hold for my hair which is s-wavy, made my hair kind of frizzy and didn&#x27;t give it enough curl, may be better for kids</li>
      <li>Great product, shipped quick and the real deal; soft curls without silicone and curly</li>
      <li>DevaCurl almost smells like pear to me, but isn&#x27;t overly sweet and obnoxious</li>
      <li>I love the spray gel since I can adjust how much I use to the hold that I want.</li>
      <li>With Deva I&#x27;ve got a head full of corkscrew curls without the frizz.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using Paul Mitchell Light Spray Gel for years with middling results, and actually tried this product because I was hoping it smelled better!</li>
      <li>This works great with the other Deva Curl Products.</li>
      <li>Obviously the more you use, the greater the chance of crunchiness.</li>
      <li>ITs super crunchy</li>
      <li>The spray comes out easily, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to target those areas of your hair where you are missing gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>--I&#x27;d describe the smell as fresh.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all, worth it.</li>
      <li>Still trying to get all these products to work right.</li>
      <li>so I mist it  with the Mist r right to liven up the curl and set it with this Deva Curl spray gel.</li>
      <li>Great hold that scrunches out into soft curls once my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>My hair looks very full and curls are defined and soft.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>I really like it!  </li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Well, I don&#x27;t know how, but this gel makes my hair curl consistently and appear so even that it looks like I&#x27;ve just had a trim (</li>
      <li>I tried just wetting my hair and not using more product the next day</li>
      <li>I like the regular gel, but this spray gel is even better.  </li>
      <li>It is one of the only healthy hair products I have found after trying several hundred brands from drugstores to fine salons.</li>
      <li>At first I used the trio recommended for my hair type but found that the gel would make my hair feel course and sticky, When I used the low poo and conditioner without any styling product my hair felt light and bouncy but the curl would straighten out just after a couple hours.  </li>
      <li>I have Curley hair but goes flat easily.</li>
      <li>Too much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping as always!</li>
    <li> When the stylist used this on my hair, it came out as a misty spray.  Mine came out in blobs-not what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love some of the Devacurl products and use them all the time. This gel was just okay. I thought a spray gel would be more convenient than the bottled gel, but this product is drying. The bottled gel doesn&#x27;t give my hair the dull coating this gel does.</li>
    <li> My hair is somewhat thin, grey and the curls are a bit fragile.  This is the product I spray on my hair right before I do a little light drying with a diffuser.  It truly encourages curls and provides definition that lasts two to three days (unless I step out into a high wind).  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is it goes on rather sticky, though I admit it softens up as the day goes on.  This is another great product from the DevaCurl line.</li>
    <li> I paid $38 at my hairdresser for the same damn thing.</li>
    <li> Awesome price with fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This and the [[ASIN:B006K26D9E Deva Curl Styling Cream 5.1oz]] are the two newest products in the Deva lineup, and I picked both up the other day locally. The Spray Gel is targeted towards all of Deva&#x27;s curl types -- S&#x27;Wavy, Wavy, Botticelli, and Corkscrew.  I have wavy hair, and have been using this mostly to spray on my roots (after I clip them for volume) and on my ends (where I tend to accidentally go light on my Deva AnGel).  I really like it!  The spray comes out easily, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to target those areas of your hair where you are missing gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet used it on its own instead of AnGel since it seems like you&#x27;d really have to use a lot to get coverage, but for spot areas it works great.  You can also use it on second- and third-day hair to revitalize your gel, without adding tackiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the bottle are as follows:  \\&quot;For added volume, lift and definition, use DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam and follow with Spray Gel to roots and crown to define and separate.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started following the Curly Girl method a little over a year ago, I actually used other brands, before finally trying out the Deva line.  I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better.  My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy. I really love their products!</li>
    <li> Does nothing, but dry your hair out. When used it leaves a white film on your hair.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product and was looking for something comparable to another that went out production, it does what I want and I will reorder this spray. I have problems with perfume in products and this one is very easy on the allergies.</li>
    <li> It is one of the only healthy hair products I have found after trying several hundred brands from drugstores to fine salons. Absolutely amazing for curly or wavy hair!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Great price. My hair looks very full and curls are defined and soft. Doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty residue like other products because this is sulfate free and also has natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this! No crunch and no grease left on my hair. Feels delicious.</li>
    <li> This product is not for my hair.  Left it feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Sprays on evenly; holds wet hair &amp; allows it to dry naturally into corkscrew curls.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have Curley hair but goes flat easily. Deva Curl holds my curl great. If I blow my hair too much and it straightens I use more Deva Curl and my hair curls again. The price is great and it came in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> My curls are grateful</li>
    <li> Works well. I used the ArcAngel gel before, and I have fine hair. This was a good substitute, with the plus that the spray applies it more evenly. All as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> I love the product.  Since I began using Diva Curl products, my hair has never looked better.  I love the spray gel since I can adjust how much I use to the hold that I want.</li>
    <li> Apply for curls all day without the crunch.  My salon no longer provides this product, so I was relieved to find it on Amazom.</li>
    <li> Product arrived just when it said it would. I ordered this for my best friend for our cruise to The Bahamas, she was out. Her stylist began using this on her very curly hair about a year ago. Shortly after she bought the same products for herself at home. DevaCurl is hands down the best product line for curly hair! My friend used this on her hair on the humid weather of the Bahamas and had zero frizz!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well, depending on the humidity of the day. In Florida, it works well in the winter. Summer, when the air is very wet, it lost it&#x27;s hold.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Will def order again in the future. Much more bounce in my curls when I would use this product.</li>
    <li> Finally a spray gel that doesn&#x27;t clump my curls!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the scent does bother me a bit, but I am very sensitive to everything. This works great and rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> I love deva products. Lately I have been pairing this by spraying it over top of the foam mousse. ITs super crunchy but allows me to sleep on my curls and have them still look decent the next day.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. If you use a lot of the product your hair will be &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. If used sparingly produces soft, non-frizzy curls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year.  I absolutely love how it helps control my curls.  I usually have issues with my hair when I travel--gets flat and unmanagable.  When my son got married I was afraid of what my hair would look like as we had to travel to another state for the wedding.  My hairdresser recommened this and it worked like a charm!!  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> Works alright for my daughters long curly hair, but I think the Deva Curl Set It Free works much better for keeping frizz at bay and keeping her curls bouncy and nice all day.  Going to get the Set It Free next time!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and always struggle to find products that don&#x27;t weigh it down but do keep it under control.  This spray gel paired with the ultra defining gel does the trick.  I&#x27;d recommend it to all my curly friends!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair . Product is sticky and doesn&#x27;t make my hair curly, just weird.</li>
    <li> This sprayer mechanism puts gel on your hair in small clots.  I won&#x27;t be reordering.  The gel itself is great - ti&#x27;s the sprayer that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> smells good, didn&#x27;t have enough hold for my hair which is s-wavy, made my hair kind of frizzy and didn&#x27;t give it enough curl, may be better for kids</li>
    <li> This and the KMS curl spray are the only two products I&#x27;ve found thus far that work half-way decent in controling the affects of humidity on my hair. I also have to use the devacurl gel and curl creme with this spray and together they do OK. Or I use the curl creme from KMS and their spray gel. But still not exactly what I want. My hair looks OK the first day, but it feels and looks sort of tacky (with the DevaCurl stuff) if I use the spray again the next day. I tried just wetting my hair and not using more product the next day (I only wash every other day) and it&#x27;s not enough. I will use this for now and keep looking.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish it had a little more hold though.  Still trying to get all these products to work right.</li>
    <li> Best gel for my white-girl curls.</li>
    <li> Great stuff... Great smell too</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.I have used it before and will continue using the product.</li>
    <li> I have thin wavy hair that has lost an alarming amount of volume and curl over  the past couple years due to age and illness.  Recently  after a long trial and error with many other brands I was introduced to Deva Curl, I&#x27;m so thrilled to have life and luster back in my hair!  At first I used the trio recommended for my hair type but found that the gel would make my hair feel course and sticky, When I used the low poo and conditioner without any styling product my hair felt light and bouncy but the curl would straighten out just after a couple hours.  I did some research and found a lighter weight gel by Deva Curl called B&#x27;Leave in,  I use this product 6 days a week always cleansing hair with a cheap brand on the seventh to rid it of any build up.  I still loose curl as the day goes on so I mist it  with the Mist r right to liven up the curl and set it with this Deva Curl spray gel. My hair never feels sticky or weighed down any more and the curls are more pronounced and don&#x27;t look stringy like they have in the past.  I would suggest this product to anyone who&#x27;s curls tend to loose their bounce during the day, or someone with super fine hair that normal gels make sticky and coarse.</li>
    <li> This is great for curly hair- doesn&#x27;t make crunchy and holds the curl. I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and like it both ways (prefer to use it on wet hair). I like this better than the gel now!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my roots only. It would great at keeping my corkscrew hair in check where it tends to get wild. Just be careful how much you spray in your hair. Too much and you have the crunchy feel form normal gel, too little and it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is any there. It definitely takes some messing around with to get the perfect amount for your hair. However, it works just the same as the anGEL where you can scrunch after it has dried and get rid of the gel cast and crunchy feel.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but I go through it quickly so I went back to the gel. I use this as a touch up for places I missed once my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and looked like a Brillo Pad until a friend suggested I try this product. Now, I have recommended it to many friends and love, love, love it and the way my hair looks. I have gotten more compliments in the last 6 months than I did in my whole life time...and best of all, my husband has nothing to tease me about anymore :-)</li>
    <li> One of the many curly hair products I&#x27;ve tried--but this onhe delivers what it promises.  It sets my curls, and leaves them soft and bouncy when my hair is dry.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The DevaCurl are the best products I&#x27;ve ever used for curly hair.  I will never use anything else.  I use this product every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel spray I&#x27;ve found for fine curly/wavy hair like mine.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or hard and it doesn&#x27;t give it that wet look like other spray gels.  It has a nice gentle fragrance too that isn&#x27;t offensive and doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair.  Very clean feel and not sticky at all.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This spray gel is a great for anyone with frizzy and unruly curls. Even if I diffuse my hair with my curl cream and it&#x27;s a giant mess, I just spray DevaCurl all over my dry hair and mold it a bit and presto, my hair looks great with defined, shiny curls.  I don&#x27;t have hair you can run your fingers through, so if that&#x27;s your goal, don&#x27;t use a spray gel as it is a stiffer product that you will feel in your hair.  DevaCurl almost smells like pear to me, but isn&#x27;t overly sweet and obnoxious--I&#x27;d describe the smell as fresh.  My only complaint is that one of the ingredients gives me a rash if I spray it onto my hair while wet as it hits my scalp.  But, as my hair is really huge, I can spray it on once it&#x27;s dry and no issues with rashes (I suspect it&#x27;s the rosemary).  I highly recommend this product and switched from TIGI&#x27;s curl spray, which had excellent control and shine, but the fine mist got all over me and into my eyes and smelled too much like candy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. No alcohol means no crispy curls! Withstands humidity wonderfully too! Would recommend for anyone with curls!</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quick and the real deal; soft curls without silicone and curly no-no&#x27;s. Love the Devacurl method and products.</li>
    <li> I like the regular gel, but this spray gel is even better.  Isn&#x27;t as heavy, but makes curls defined without the over glazed look</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly but also baby-fine, which is a troublesome combination. Most curly-hair specialty products are designed for coarser hair, adding tons of moisture that just makes my hair go limp and over-soft.  Non-spray gels are too heavy and make my hair crunchy and stringy. I&#x27;d been using Paul Mitchell Light Spray Gel for years with middling results, and actually tried this product because I was hoping it smelled better! It does, but that&#x27;s just the beginning. My hair curls very inconsistently, not just from day to day but from lock to lock. The result is that it appears to be a dozen different lengths, which drives me crazy. Well, I don&#x27;t know how, but this gel makes my hair curl consistently and appear so even that it looks like I&#x27;ve just had a trim (and I&#x27;m way overdue)! I&#x27;d give it five stars, except that I can&#x27;t use it three days in a row without it building up too much. My hair is too fragile for daily washing and in winter it gets washed every third day, so I&#x27;ve just been wearing it up one day. It won&#x27;t be an issue in summer when I can get away with shampooing every other day, since there&#x27;s higher humidity and no indoor heating drying things out. It did take some getting used to because it sprays in short, quick bursts, unlike the Mitchell spray gel, but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it and overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with the results and definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I use Devacurl&#x27;s No-poo and conditioner. Before buying the spray gel I was using another brand of hair gel but decided to switch so I was only using one brand. This stuff is great! I have 3a curls. I sprayed this on my hair after a night time shower but was a bit skeptical at first. It seemed like I was spraying so much but nothing was working. I let my hair dry over night and I woke up with soft, defined curls!! No flakiness, crunchiness or weird smell. My curls lasted all day through 85 degree weather and 70% humidity!! pretty impressive. Obviously the more you use, the greater the chance of crunchiness. I found it to be easier to pour some out on my hand and then comb in through with my fingers. It just depends on how much hair you have and personal preferences.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair. After you shapoo and style, use this to keep your curls looking great all day. This works great with the other Deva Curl Products.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Harmon&#x27;s until they stopped carrying the line. Since then, I was paying a fortune for it at Ulta. I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.</li>
    <li> This spray gel is my favorite product from the DevaCurl line. I use a small amount of the regular gel as soon as I get out of the shower with my hair soaking wet and then the spray gel after it has dried about half way to finish styling. This product is amazing for controlling the &amp;#34;trouble friz&amp;#34; spots!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about deva curl. Love love this product</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this entire line of products. I have very long, thick &amp; kinky curly hair. Before my purchase I would just put conditioner in my hair &amp; defuse it. I was hoping the devacul line would do &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than my Suave $2.00 bottle of conditioner. NO! The product smells good &amp; makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s it. So if your thinking about forking over a fortune for this line.... I wouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not at all, worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a convert. I&#x27;ve spent my life with a head of frizz no matter what product I used. With Deva I&#x27;ve got a head full of corkscrew curls without the frizz. The spray gel is great to use after I&#x27;ve put in the regular pump gel and have my curls set in place. Great hold that scrunches out into soft curls once my hair is dry.</li>
