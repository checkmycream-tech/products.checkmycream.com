      <li>These blades work great.</li>
      <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of stropping, and no honing, so it&#x27;s great if there aren&#x27;t any sharpening businesses close to your house.</li>
      <li>The blades are so damn cheap - goodbye forever Gillette!!!</li>
      <li>This product is actually very nice.</li>
      <li>C&#x27;est un très bon rasoir :P</li>
      <li>You learn very quickly the handling and motions will suit you best once you start shaving.  </li>
      <li>The plastic must just be of a good quality.  </li>
      <li>Good blades which seems to hold edge longer than others.</li>
      <li>It was economical, and perfect for a beginner like me.  </li>

      <li>Great price and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great razors, smooth and easy to handle</li>
      <li>Better than the shark blades that I used to have.</li>
      <li>i definitly want to order more.  </li>
      <li>For me, Shark worked better.</li>
      <li>I am not at all pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Wetshaving.net has a review and better pictures:    </li>
      <li>fantastic blades!</li>
      <li>Reviews that say otherwise reflect more so on the reviewer than the product itself.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time these nicks will be invisible, but you&#x27;ll be able to feel them.  </li>
      <li>I try this blade now and then to see if I was having too many nicks and cuts because of inexperience, but I still have too many of them after all those months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are very good blades and they were very affordable and came in the mail quickly.</li>
      <li>It appears like it could break easily, but, like I said, I&#x27;ve had it for years and that hasn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
      <li>nice Merkur Hd Classic \\&quot;barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor-#38c is very ideal.  </li>
      <li>That said, it&#x27;s worth the price given how many shaves you can get from the shavette and the 300 blades.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am extremely happy with this razor, and I look forward to using it as often as I can.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>A clean and smooth finish.</li>
      <li>In either case, five bucks for a years worth of shaving is enough to make me feel good about this purchase.</li>
      <li>It looks like something you would buy at a gas station for &lt;$10 for a quick shave.  </li>
      <li>My first impression when I received this product was that it looked cheap.  </li>
      <li>you get 100 in count and nicely wrapped up and easy to take loose from the paper.  </li>
      <li>With proper technique - which, contrary to popular belief is quite an easy and quick to acquire - you can cut all lengths of hair quickly, and very close.  </li>
      <li>i actually enjoy it more than i did regular shaving.  </li>
      <li>Buy a real straight or even better, buy a old school safety</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a nice razor.</li>
      <li>bought them because i forgot my original pack (the ones that came with my straight razor) at home while i was on a trip.</li>
      <li>Really good quality, but it was just too sharp for me.</li>
      <li>Today I cut myself decently on my right jaw, but that was my fault...</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how easy it was, if you take your time.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>you feel like you&#x27;re skilled enough</li>
      <li>I nicked myself a couple places on the first shave, but no worse than I do when I use my Fusion.  </li>
      <li>I got my first straight razor shave from my barber on my wedding day, and since that day in April I knew I wanted one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time straight edge user . . .</li>
      <li>I prefer straight razors to multi-blade safety razors.</li>
      <li>Do some research before using this straight razor.  </li>
      <li>cause they work really well..</li>
      <li>but i use them for not just my face but my legs and body as well, a new razor would last me over a week, easily.</li>
      <li>I have become a new convert to straight razor shaving.  </li>
      <li>However, most of what you need to know is that to get the blade in, you must pull the red holder out of the shaver and open it to put the blade in.</li>
      <li>They are good for around 3 shaves on my very thick hair.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to make sure everyone has a few bits of information to keep in mind.</li>
      <li>Use these blades for every shave job and with this pack I get plenty of uses before I need to by a new pack.</li>
      <li>No strops or hones to worry about, just slide in a new blade and off you go.  </li>
      <li>And while the shavette may seem simple and cheap, it&#x27;s well designed and has lasted me several years without rusting, breaking, or loosening.  </li>
      <li>This seller is very trustworthy, I will definitely be back.</li>
      <li>Secondly, shaving with any straight razor requires a bit of understanding.</li>
      <li>Which isn&#x27;t to say you&#x27;ll cut yourself frequently or severely, but you&#x27;re bound to get nicks every once in a while.  </li>
      <li>These cut my face a bit more than other razors, so they might not be as straight as others, or I just haven&#x27;t had a steady hand lately.</li>
      <li>The derby razor blades are top quality but the Dovo shavette is not good at all; they do not mix well.</li>
      <li>The real things are super expensive, especially for a guy like me wanting to try it out.  </li>
      <li>they work just as expected, dont really need to be maintained and last a VERY LONG TIME especially for the price.</li>

<li> Wow- very sharp.</li>
<li> I will just say be careful taking them out because the blades are really sharp.</li>
<li> If you have anyone in your life who&#x27;s worried about you cutting your throat open, just tell them to calm down, it&#x27;s not goingto happen.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made of aluminum and plastic and is extremely lightweight.  </li>
<li> This baby is sharp as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
<li> Go slow and cut in simple strokes.  </li>
<li> Maybe the problem was the single blade vs. the four blade Quattro that I have been using, but the blade is difficult to insert, directions are non existent, and I found the shave (mostly used in trim areas (nose, around the mouth) to be painful.</li>
<li> the razors in the green box isn&#x27;t the 1 u r gonna receive</li>
<li> Very poor quality and do not last at all.  </li>
<li> Thank you, I was looking a little scruffy lately!</li>
<li> You will have to learn to shave with both hands, so you can see in the mirror what you are doing, but it&#x27;s not all that hard.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get a sense of what it looks like from the pictures on amazon.  </li>
<li> For those afraid you&#x27;ll cut your neck open, go slow.</li>
<li> The worst cuts I&#x27;ve had have not been any worse than the kinds you can get from moving a modern razor laterally across your face.  </li>
<li> this may seem weird</li>
<li> When the razor is inserted it does not lock in the position so when you&#x27;re shaving the blades goes into the holder and you have to reposition the blades during shaving what makes it totally useless.</li>
<li> The edge of these razors do not work, they are very bad quality , just one shave and goes to the garbage with that poor quality I do not recommend to buy this to anyone, some of them even has not any edge, you cant use it one time.</li>
<li> For pictures I have found this helpful site: [...]    </li>

    <li> Use these blades for every shave job and with this pack I get plenty of uses before I need to by a new pack.</li>
    <li> Wow- very sharp. Great price and easy to use. I&#x27;m a first time straight edge user . . . so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is actually very nice. I got it as a Christmas gift and I came on here to check the product and a couple of accessories out. I saw a couple people talking about this and I wanted to make sure everyone has a few bits of information to keep in mind. One of them is that there aren&#x27;t instructions. However, most of what you need to know is that to get the blade in, you must pull the red holder out of the shaver and open it to put the blade in. For pictures I have found this helpful site: [...]    Secondly, shaving with any straight razor requires a bit of understanding. Look on youtube for helpful videos there. You learn very quickly the handling and motions will suit you best once you start shaving.  I prefer straight razors to multi-blade safety razors. With proper technique - which, contrary to popular belief is quite an easy and quick to acquire - you can cut all lengths of hair quickly, and very close.  For those afraid you&#x27;ll cut your neck open, go slow. Practice on spare hairs on your arms and legs. See what it&#x27;s like. I dove into straight razor shaving and I&#x27;ve only really cut myself once, and I&#x27;ve had worse cuts with a Mach 3. Believe me. Go slow and cut in simple strokes.  Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a nice razor. It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of stropping, and no honing, so it&#x27;s great if there aren&#x27;t any sharpening businesses close to your house. I&#x27;ll be enjoying this razor for a while!</li>
    <li> This thing tore up my neck something fierce.  Buy a real straight or even better, buy a old school safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;A nice Merkur Hd Classic \\&quot;barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor-#38c is very ideal.  The blades are so damn cheap - goodbye forever Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> I am not at all pleased with this product. Maybe the problem was the single blade vs. the four blade Quattro that I have been using, but the blade is difficult to insert, directions are non existent, and I found the shave (mostly used in trim areas (nose, around the mouth) to be painful. I am back to the an electric trimmer and the four bladed wonder (Schick Quattro)</li>
    <li> The edge of these razors do not work, they are very bad quality , just one shave and goes to the garbage with that poor quality I do not recommend to buy this to anyone, some of them even has not any edge, you cant use it one time.</li>
    <li> The derby razor blades are top quality but the Dovo shavette is not good at all; they do not mix well. When the razor is inserted it does not lock in the position so when you&#x27;re shaving the blades goes into the holder and you have to reposition the blades during shaving what makes it totally useless.</li>
    <li> I received my DOVO Shavette over the weekend, and I am impressed.  I got my first straight razor shave from my barber on my wedding day, and since that day in April I knew I wanted one.  The real things are super expensive, especially for a guy like me wanting to try it out.  So, I found the Shavette on amazon, and after researching it further (and clearing it with my wife), I ordered myself one.  It was economical, and perfect for a beginner like me.  No strops or hones to worry about, just slide in a new blade and off you go.  I shaved with it the evening I got it (I work 3rd shift).  I was surprised at how easy it was, if you take your time.  Research how to shave with one properly (you can find videos on youtube) and take your time.  This is not something you can rush through!  This baby is sharp as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I nicked myself a couple places on the first shave, but no worse than I do when I use my Fusion.  You will have to learn to shave with both hands, so you can see in the mirror what you are doing, but it&#x27;s not all that hard.  Just take your time.  Today I cut myself decently on my right jaw, but that was my fault...I rushed in that spot and in so doing I cut myself.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this razor, and I look forward to using it as often as I can.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;est un très bon rasoir :P j&#x27;aime comment c&#x27;est simple et rapide se faire la barbe. Je recommande ce rasoir à tous les gens et il ne faut pas avoir peut de l&#x27;essailler ! je me coupe rarement la peau et c&#x27;est des bonnes lames qui sont facile à changer.     5 étoiles!</li>
    <li> fantastic blades! bought them because i forgot my original pack (the ones that came with my straight razor) at home while i was on a trip. they work just as expected, dont really need to be maintained and last a VERY LONG TIME especially for the price. this may seem weird but i use them for not just my face but my legs and body as well, a new razor would last me over a week, easily.</li>
    <li> These blades work great. They are good for around 3 shaves on my very thick hair. Better than the shark blades that I used to have.</li>
    <li> They were thinner than I thought but they get the job done</li>
    <li> Very poor quality and do not last at all.  I do not recommend them.</li>
    <li> This blades are great on the skin and they cut real nice.</li>
    <li> i definitly want to order more.  I have become a new convert to straight razor shaving.  i actually enjoy it more than i did regular shaving.  you get 100 in count and nicely wrapped up and easy to take loose from the paper.  I will just say be careful taking them out because the blades are really sharp.</li>
    <li> Good blades which seems to hold edge longer than others.</li>
    <li> Great razors, smooth and easy to handle</li>
    <li> My first impression when I received this product was that it looked cheap.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like something that costs between 20 and 50 dollars.  It looks like something you would buy at a gas station for &lt;$10 for a quick shave.  It&#x27;s made of aluminum and plastic and is extremely lightweight.  It&#x27;s hard to get a sense of what it looks like from the pictures on amazon.  Wetshaving.net has a review and better pictures:    [...]    That said, it&#x27;s worth the price given how many shaves you can get from the shavette and the 300 blades.  And while the shavette may seem simple and cheap, it&#x27;s well designed and has lasted me several years without rusting, breaking, or loosening.  The only part that seems problematic is the red plastic piece which opens so you can place the razor into it.  It appears like it could break easily, but, like I said, I&#x27;ve had it for years and that hasn&#x27;t happen.  The plastic must just be of a good quality.  So, congrats to Dovo.    Also, this razor will not cut up your face if you use it properly. Reviews that say otherwise reflect more so on the reviewer than the product itself.  Do some research before using this straight razor.  There&#x27;s a technique to it, which is part of the attraction.  You WILL cut yourself, however.  Which isn&#x27;t to say you&#x27;ll cut yourself frequently or severely, but you&#x27;re bound to get nicks every once in a while.  Most of the time these nicks will be invisible, but you&#x27;ll be able to feel them.  I find that the likelihood of this occurring increases if I shave over the same spot several times or if I shave against the grain (which I don&#x27;t recommend anyway).  I use a styptic pencil to stop the bleeding (can be purchased at wal mart or walgreens for about $1).  The worst cuts I&#x27;ve had have not been any worse than the kinds you can get from moving a modern razor laterally across your face.  If you have anyone in your life who&#x27;s worried about you cutting your throat open, just tell them to calm down, it&#x27;s not goingto happen.</li>
    <li> This item is one package of blades only.  At the time of my purchase (if the listing has been changed since) the ad showed three packages  of blades, plus a blade holder.  The reviews also mentioned these items, however when I got my order, only one package of blades was sent.  I wrote the seller mentioning this, but haven&#x27;t heard anything back.  I suggest the seller fix the misleading information in this listing and improve their customer service.</li>
    <li> Thank you, I was looking a little scruffy lately!</li>
    <li> These cut my face a bit more than other razors, so they might not be as straight as others, or I just haven&#x27;t had a steady hand lately. In either case, five bucks for a years worth of shaving is enough to make me feel good about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Where do I start, I only trust Derby brand blades for all my shaving needs. I cut hair all the time and believe me when I say these are the sharpest. A clean and smooth finish. I can&#x27;t feel any hair after I used these. I like to switch blades after each cut for sanitary reasons so having 100 will last me quite some time. This seller is very trustworthy, I will definitely be back.</li>
    <li> These are very good blades and they were very affordable and came in the mail quickly.</li>
    <li> the razors in the green box isn&#x27;t the 1 u r gonna receive u r gonna receive a pack of royal red but that is not a problem for me cause they work really well..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using straight razor for a few months now. I tried 2-3 razors and 2-3 different brand blades. This one is the sharpest among all 3. Really good quality, but it was just too sharp for me. I try this blade now and then to see if I was having too many nicks and cuts because of inexperience, but I still have too many of them after all those months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel like you&#x27;re skilled enough, that&#x27;s one of the sharpest blades. For me, Shark worked better.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Well recommended to all barbers who use disposable razors</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
</ol>
