      <li>It&#x27;s great for people with busy schedules and helps to keep my hair manageable.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it makes my hair smooth and shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>I use other products by the brand and they work wonderful on my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;You apply it to clean hair in the shower like many of these type of products.  </li>
      <li>it was pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is great to use and the results are seen by the second use.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it takes away the chlorine smell from your hair leaving on its fantastic scent.</li>
      <li>the price point is awesomely cheap.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I picked it up because the price point was attractive in comparison with similar products.  </li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>I was unsure if it was going to be very effective because I&#x27;ve had mixed experience with Organix before</li>
      <li>I normally use only salon products, but this product is awesome.  </li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and my hair is really really soft after using this !</li>
      <li>I love this brand, their products really works.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about OGX / Organix.</li>
      <li>I love them, they have helped me sooo much,</li>
      <li>results are noticeable and make your hair feel amazing for a few days and leave it in better condition even longer.  </li>
      <li>and it really seems to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>So pretty cool.</li>
      <li>However Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque makes my hair silky and smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>My hair felt great and a lot stronger after first use with less breakage.</li>
      <li>You have to use a fair amount of product and it feels almost watered down.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair SO smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>Very nice product would recommend it, keeps your hair ber soft and shiny when you blow dry and flat iron, love it.</li>
      <li>I have been loosing balls of hair every time I run my fingers through my hair and the first time it is just a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; 4-5 hairs.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>If used consistently, it does its job.</li>
      <li>Can definitely say I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>and I cannot believe how different my hair looks, it&#x27;s getting back to its healthy state SO FAST!!!!</li>
      <li>I have to say that it is certainly no better than, and maybe even not as good as, the conditioner for this line (Organix Keratin Oil).  </li>
      <li>It also smells fantastic for the whole next day.  </li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>My ragged ends are much improved and I also believe it fights frizz although it doesn&#x27;t make that</li>
      <li>will absolutely be a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like it and recommend it for damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Absolutely would recommend.</li>
      <li>This works really well.  </li>
      <li>It kept my hair from being totally frizzy when it was humid out - and it definitely helps the ends of my hair so that they look healthy.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!&lt;br</li>
      <li>In addition to this first review, I noticed that it works even better once you are done with washing your hair and washing off the conditioner, you put some cold water on your hair, it will shine even more and the split ends are barely noticeable (if you have).</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that this stuff does not smell good at all.  </li>
      <li>but this is about as low as it goes, especially with prime and free shipping.</li>
      <li>(more like let it dry in this thick piece of hair) and compared it to the strands in the light</li>
      <li>It made my hair very soft</li>
      <li>I used this last night - shampooed with the Organix Keratin Oil shampoo, toweled off my hair, applied the product, and left it on for 5 minutes, then rinsed in cool water.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>My hair gets really dry and wiry in the back sometimes, and this fixes it right up!</li>
      <li>my hair is really frizzy and dry but this makes my hair feel so silky and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is very dry and damaged from processing and this doesn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
      <li>In the past I have always used Pantene special conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My individual hair strand were strong, thick and not split?</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as wella or other products, but I do know I really like it.</li>
      <li>days which my hair particularly suffers in the heat, humidity, in the pool, or after a long exercise I actually apply a bit to my tips after I&#x27;m out of the shower and get great results from this also.  </li>
      <li>I have super curly thick hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cannot find in stores.  I use this every 2 weeks.  Love it.  I also use the Brazilian Keratin Therapy.  Great products.  Love Organix.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but it smells like a toxic waste dump that they tried to cover up with a floral scent.  I tried to wash it out immediately but it didn&#x27;t take the smell away--I was stuck with it all day.</li>
    <li> It work for my hair. help my thick curly hair clam.</li>
    <li> I was looking at really expensive keratin masks, then decided to try this first. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair very soft. I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as wella or other products, but I do know I really like it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be nice....no miracles</li>
    <li> Not really sure this product does a lot. You have to use a fair amount of product and it feels almost watered down. I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m better off using the Biotin and Collagen Shampoo and Conditioner together (I get great results).</li>
    <li> Not very conditioning at all compared to other similar type products</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about OGX / Organix. I switched to this brand, choosing the keratin oil, because my hair was thinning, breaking, and falling out. I&#x27;ve been using the OGX Keratin oil shampoo, conditioner, 3-minute conditioner, and the spray oil as my only care products for the past 6 months. The change in my hair has been outstanding. No more loss, no more breaking, and it&#x27;s been growing like crazy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product would recommend it, keeps your hair ber soft and shiny when you blow dry and flat iron, love it.</li>
    <li> A very good Product.  I order by mistake, but happy I did.  I use other products by the brand and they work wonderful on my hair</li>
    <li> I recently gave my hair a keratin treatment and I use this as a deep conditioner a couple times a week. It keeps my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for people with busy schedules and helps to keep my hair manageable. I use it twice a week and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> After using these products, I found that Keratin products are not good for my hair -- made my hair very brittle and I had a lot of breakage. I had to stop using after a couple of weeks and change to something that would repair the damage. Not happy with this at all.</li>
    <li> I like to just use this on my ends and then put the conditioner from the same line on the rest but I feel like my hair is softer and my ends are less damaged now that I use this.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair SO smooth and soft! My hair gets really dry and wiry in the back sometimes, and this fixes it right up! I recommend this to everybody. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  My hair looks great after one use.  I have thin, brittle hair and it really seems to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> In the past I have always used Pantene special conditioner.  Recently I spotted this conditioner by Organix.  This particular formula is great for thickening hair and giving it volume.  Try it and you decide.</li>
    <li> I used this last night - shampooed with the Organix Keratin Oil shampoo, toweled off my hair, applied the product, and left it on for 5 minutes, then rinsed in cool water.  I have to say that it is certainly no better than, and maybe even not as good as, the conditioner for this line (Organix Keratin Oil).  The Keratin Oil line is generally very good - I love it, but this product did not perform as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It kept my hair from being totally frizzy when it was humid out - and it definitely helps the ends of my hair so that they look healthy.</li>
    <li> Usually after blow drying I have to put a little oil or light spray for it to not be dry when I straighten it, but using this I don&#x27;t have to. After shampooing I leave it in for however long sometimes even an hour (depends on what I&#x27;m doing) and you just wash it out with cold water to close the hair follicles &amp; keep the shine locked in. My hair looks soooo pretty every time with this!!! I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> Organix products - I love them, they have helped me sooo much, this one in particular, do not think it is the best i have tried (Keratin oil) but it somehow works</li>
    <li> i love this product very much ill used every 2 days or maybe every two weeks its keeps my har shiny &amp; beatifull</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so soft. After washing my hair I realized putting my fingers through my hair was so disappointing. So I used it and after 15minutes washed it out. It worked great. I combed through my crazy curly African hair and saw a difference.</li>
    <li> Used this twice and left it on longer than three minutes and its makes my hair dry. Maybe it’s not for my hair type (Coarse / Ethnic hair).</li>
    <li> I bought this in store. I decided one night (I was too lazy to go jump in the shower bc our house was freezing) but I decided to rub this root to tip on a thick piece of bangs (dry actually) and just test this 3 minute Miraculous recovery. If it does what it states my hair will show it because it has been breaking off and falling in globs in the showers and looks like my hair is fried? Stress, illness I suppose. Anyways, in 3 minutes I checked it (more like let it dry in this thick piece of hair) and compared it to the strands in the light it was pretty amazing. My individual hair strand were strong, thick and not split? So pretty cool. Washed my hair with the shampoo and this (they were out of conditioner in the store) and my hair looks amazing... I didn&#x27;t have a Persian cat in my hand or drain after washing my hair and still do not. This is how my hair has been. I have been loosing balls of hair every time I run my fingers through my hair and the first time it is just a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; 4-5 hairs. I even blow dried my hair. I am amazed. I haven&#x27;t done anything else differently. I think I am going to use it daily until my hair is back to it&#x27;s norm with shampoo...(conditioner has awesome reviews) and stock up now!</li>
    <li> My hair felt great and a lot stronger after first use with less breakage. I love this brand, their products really works.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s all that matters. Really. If she likes it then I like it. It would be nice if the price was lower but this is about as low as it goes, especially with prime and free shipping.</li>
    <li> my hair is really frizzy and dry but this makes my hair feel so silky and soft. I use this once a week. I really like it and recommend it for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This among the other OGX products have saved me from losing all my hair due to dry conditions I moved too.  This product is great to use and the results are seen by the second use.  In combination with the shampoo/conditioner and repair oil, it will repair&lt;br /&gt;your hair almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time and works above the rating stars.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Works perfectly for people with chemically processed hair. Makes it silky smooth!! Can definitely say I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I normally use only salon products, but this product is awesome.  Works as advertised and the price point is awesomely cheap.  My only complaint is that this stuff does not smell good at all.  Has that kind of VO5 petroleum type smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair smooth and shiny and manageable. Absolutely would recommend. Very easy to follow directions</li>
    <li> 3 minute miracle? Hardly. After using this it made very little.  No difference in shine. Perhaps the strength of my hair is slightly stronger but it&#x27;s hard to tell. My hair looked and felt extremely dry afterwards.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and damaged from processing and this doesn&#x27;t do much for it. From experience now I know that hair masks are really the best thing for damaged hair and I think I&#x27;ll have to spend the $20-30 next time to get a Bumble and Bumble mask or something else heavy duty from a salon. This OGX Keratin Oil works less than regular drugstore conditioner unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Seems good, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to ever be without it!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and my hair is really really soft after using this !</li>
    <li> Not really miraculous. Don&#x27;t feel or see any difference.</li>
    <li> Last month, I started swimming and my hair needed an aid. While I got a specific swimmers shampoo, I had opted for this as a conditioner/mask. Simply FABOLOUS. I basically use it twice a week and it makes my hair smooth and soft. Plus, it takes away the chlorine smell from your hair leaving on its fantastic scent. Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;PS: Use a microfiber towel or a t-shirt instead than a regular towel, it help preventing frizz!</li>
    <li> It made my hair very soft</li>
    <li> If used consistently, it does its job.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites if not my fav deep conditoner. Smells amazing &amp; does wondera for me it!  I have super curly thick hair.</li>
    <li> Organix Miraculous Recovery is a great product. It worked wonders on my over worked hair. I would suggest this product to anyone who has dry or over worked hair~! It really works!!!</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is a formula with keratin proteins and argan oil.  Unless you&#x27;ve been living in a box for the past couple years you&#x27;ll know those are sort of the two hot ingredients the hair industry has been touting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked it up because the price point was attractive in comparison with similar products.  I was unsure if it was going to be very effective because I&#x27;ve had mixed experience with Organix before but I am really happy I picked it up.  It is a wonderful formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply it to clean hair in the shower like many of these type of products.  You&#x27;re supposed to leave it three minutes but I just leave it however long it takes me to accomplish everything else I&#x27;m doing which is probably 3-5 minutes.  Three minutes seems to be totally adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly satisfying because it is one of those great ones that it feels like your hair is just drinking up and incorporating it in it&#x27;s structure and there isn&#x27;t a feeling of any of it is wasted going down the drain even when you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are noticeable and make your hair feel amazing for a few days and leave it in better condition even longer.  It improves hair&#x27;s texture, appearance, and strength.  It also smells fantastic for the whole next day.  My ragged ends are much improved and I also believe it fights frizz although it doesn&#x27;t make that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days which my hair particularly suffers in the heat, humidity, in the pool, or after a long exercise I actually apply a bit to my tips after I&#x27;m out of the shower and get great results from this also.  There is no feeling of slick oiliness, it just feels like your hair is bare but much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local drugstore and I LOVE IT!!!! I&#x27;ve had chemical straightening processes on my hair and keratin treatments. Around a year ago I got a keratin treatment on my hair with a bad quality keratin which caused a lot of split ends and kinda fried the front layers of my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but nothing has repaired my hair and hydrated it like OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 minute, I&#x27;ve used it twice and I cannot believe how different my hair looks, it&#x27;s getting back to its healthy state SO FAST!!!! I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to repair their hair and look awesome all the time!!!  In addition to this first review, I noticed that it works even better once you are done with washing your hair and washing off the conditioner, you put some cold water on your hair, it will shine even more and the split ends are barely noticeable (if you have).</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for me. If anything it makes my hair dry and frizzy. The product smells and looks good. However Earth Science Olive &amp; Avocado Deep Conditioning Hair Masque makes my hair silky and smooth and healthy. I kept with it for a while to see if my hair got stronger, but I noticed no difference. I kind of even want to give this 1 star instead of 2, but it does smell good.</li>
