      <li>Probably one of those applicator brushes would have been nice</li>
      <li>Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
      <li>It removed the color, but not as well as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>It barely took color out of my hair and my roots were bright orange!!!</li>
      <li>and now I feel much better.</li>

      <li>Customer Satisfied.</li>
      <li>SO my hair is relatively healthy.</li>
      <li>so you can be sure you have even coverage</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have been better off to have just used this to start with.  </li>
      <li>A stylist was able to fix it before I had to be at work on Monday.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a back-up plan before ever trying this stuff.</li>
      <li>I totally love this product.</li>
      <li>This brand works a lot better than &amp;#34;Oops&amp;#34; Haircolor remover; I needed three boxes of &amp;#34;Oops&amp;#34; just to get an unwanted raspberry color out of my hair.</li>
      <li>This brand works much better.</li>
      <li>but I was told this product would lift the red perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I have used this once before and the result was ok.  </li>
      <li>and now I feel much better.</li>
      <li>:-)).</li>
      <li>&#x3D;).  </li>
      <li>This item worked better for me than Color Oops..</li>
      <li>and I love Color Oops.  </li>
      <li>MUCH more time</li>
      <li>I would reccomend this to people for sure.</li>
      <li>I had no idea what I was doing, as I&#x27;d never tried to lighten my hair before, and it was helpful to get more info and watch tutorials</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with the result, thanks ColorZap!!!!</li>
      <li>one tip i can give people thinking about using this product is to use a very good deep conditioner to keep your hair healthy.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s what you want, it actually does a really good job at bleaching it out, but that is NOT what I intended!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was easy to put together and apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used color removers before and everything went fine.</li>
      <li>The colorzap was amazing and got me back to a neutral (kind of reddish) tone</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had really silky hair, so it was kind of distressing to have hair that felt like straw.  </li>
      <li>It will need more color applications to get to the right coverage</li>
      <li>Very powerful stuff.</li>
      <li>It removed a significant amount but not all the color in my hair.</li>
      <li>It literally takes the color right out!</li>
      <li>It did bleach my roots to a bright brassy yellow.</li>
      <li>I put on a shower cap and waited the full hour it recommended for my hair color needs.</li>
      <li>I added some low lights and they didn&#x27;t turn out good (too muddy and ashy looking).</li>
      <li>but I felt it wise to condition with a deep conditioner first and wait a day or 2.</li>
      <li>Loreal Colorzap works very quickly so you will want to move fast, it helps to have two mirrors.</li>
      <li>It did leave my hair feeling dry but nothing a good moisturizing treatment wont help with.  </li>
      <li>easy to use, and very helpful</li>
      <li>Used it to remove red from my hair, did a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>I used this product Saturday and 3 days later I love it, don&#x27;t put on your roots tho!</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product for brunettes AT ALL (unless you are planning on going platinum or blonde), and I do not think this product is honest about its purported results or quality.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product for brunettes AT ALL (unless you are planning on going platinum or blonde), and I do not think this product is honest about its purported results or quality.</li>
      <li>And to top it off my hair is now completely fried and frazlled.</li>
      <li>For many years, I have been coloring my hair Darkest Brown, which contrary to popular belief, contains black dye and therefore cannot be lightened without first stripping the color.</li>
      <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t strong enough to take the chemicals better to find out in a snipped strand than your whole head!</li>
      <li>The instructions say you can color right away</li>
      <li>oops right after using.</li>
      <li>I colored my hair right away to medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>which is slightly less effective, more gentle, but</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry out, and you&#x27;ll need to buy your own plastic gloves.  </li>
      <li>It worked very fast.</li>
      <li>My hair lifts to white super easily though</li>
      <li>The first time I used Color Zap</li>
      <li>you not its not the first time i use this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased overall and would recomend buying from this seller, and I also recomend this product.</li>
      <li>Why did it lighten my hair so much?!</li>
      <li>Will know better next time.</li>
      <li>and it is a tiny but better but still damaged.</li>
      <li>I was pretty alarmed by it, but I guess that&#x27;s normal?&lt;br</li>
      <li>hair was pretty fried after all this.  </li>
      <li>It is a bleach, so be aware of that.  </li>
      <li>Removed most of the ronald mcdonald red so that I could bleach it to platinum.</li>
      <li>This product works quite well and is much more financially frugal than a visit to a salon.</li>
      <li>first, then this bleach-like solution over it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived on time. Product exactly as listed.</li>
    <li> Used it to remove red from my hair, did a pretty good job. I&#x27;m trying to get it back to blonde. Before I used ColorZap I tried to dye it blonde and nothing happened, I have dyed it twice since then and the reddish hue is almost entirely gone. Also, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> There was no cap, gloves or even a good squeeze bottle included in the box. To read the directions the &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; its listed on the side you open so be careful. I would use scissors&lt;br /&gt;I do not have thick or really long hair and there was not enough product to cover my hair. I went and bought color oops right after using.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. my hair is naturally light brown, and i wanted to dye it platinum blonde. so i decided to go to the hair salon and get my hair bleached, but my stylist told me that ,that will damage my hair. but she suggested for me to get a hair dye removal and recommend it me color zap.But she told me that it would do some damange to my hair, that it was going to leave it dry and with split ends and look orange. After doing some research on the internet i read some very good reviews on amazon, but on the reviews they said that it was a very good product, but it was going to do some damage on my hair, just like my stylist said. I decided to take a risk and order it so i did, i ordered one box, because i have very short hair, but i suggest if you have long and thick hair to order two boxes. so anyways i ordered it, and i applied it to my hair and it felt really hard, so i left the product for 45 minutes. so i went to wash my hair, i was expecting the worse my hair looked really onrange so rinsed it and i was very surprised my hair didn&#x27;t feel dry at all it felt really soft. i know is hard to believe it ,i couldn&#x27;t believe it myself either, but i guess my hair is really different from everybody else or i guess i&#x27;m very lucky:)so after using color zap i waited 24 hours to dye my hair, and i was very pleased with my results my hair looked very platinum blonde. i am so happy. i will definately recommend this product to everyone. one tip i can give people thinking about using this product is to use a very good deep conditioner to keep your hair healthy.One very good  conditioner that i use is \\&quot;Redken\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Didn&#x27;t strip any color out.</li>
    <li> This product is A M A Z I N G. I tried Color Oops and it didn&#x27;t do much. This one doesn&#x27;t smell as bad and took permanent fire engine red out of my hair in the recommended time. I&#x27;ve tried in on multiple colors and every time it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I used this product Saturday and 3 days later I love it, don&#x27;t put on your roots tho! I went from violet to golden blonde, it took a while but it lifted the color . I used 2 bottles and it does dry out your hair a little but I would use this product again. I applied the color zap put on a shower and played the waiting game , I checked on the color every few minutes because it was getting warm under the cap and I put a towel on the shower cap to hold the moisture/heat in. I like the product</li>
    <li> my natural hair is BROWN and within 30 minutes of using this, I became BLOND (and not a good blond either).  It kinda scared me.</li>
    <li> I am leaving 1 star simply because there is no lower rating available.This product is one of the worst products I have ever ordered for any purpose at any time, in the history of everything... ever. Are you picking up on my mood? I&#x27;ve used color removers before and everything went fine. Despite claims that it does not bleach or otherwise change hair&#x27;s color I wound up with a horrible mess. I had cheeto orange patches, banana colored streaks, almost white spots and patches of my roots that were completely unaffected. A stylist was able to fix it before I had to be at work on Monday. Make sure you have a back-up plan before ever trying this stuff. But never try it ... ever.</li>
    <li> Literally just overpriced bleach. You might as well just do a bleach bath. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this haircolor remover to get rid of the blue/black color that was in my hair. I have short hair, so I only needed 1 box to get rid of the unwanted color. This brand works a lot better than &amp;#34;Oops&amp;#34; Haircolor remover; I needed three boxes of &amp;#34;Oops&amp;#34; just to get an unwanted raspberry color out of my hair. This brand works much better.</li>
    <li> Very powerful stuff. It takes out the hardest of colors from my hair and leaves no hint of them.. Great product!</li>
    <li> If you have medium to long hair (mine is to the middle of my back) you really need 2 packages of the Colorzap, possibly 3. It&#x27;s safer to buy more and return what you don&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are suggestions and my own personal experiences: I am not a hair professional I just prefer to save $$ and always color my own hair using products from Sally Beauty. People always assume I get it done at a salon ;)  When in doubt, consult a professional stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d do as the instructions on the box say--do the ends first then work your way up towards the roots. I wouldn&#x27;t apply on virgin roots for a long time or you may end up with crazy light roots. Do not get this on your scalp or skin as it does burn. I suggest you do not do this alone so you can be sure you have even coverage, I had my sister do it for me. She poured the contents (powder + activator) into a salon type mixing bowl and she used an applicator brush to apply it. Sectioned my hair using clips. We did the darkest hair (underneath back of the head) and worked her way to the outer areas and up the hair saturating all the hair minus the roots. She did brush some onto my roots (avoiding my scalp) for the last 5 minutes since they are light brown and I&#x27;m going strawberry blonde.&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from a 3W + 4RC (very dark burgundy brown) to a lighter copper red. I actually received compliments that I look like a natural redhead (I&#x27;m not). It didn&#x27;t remove all the color either and it was very runny which is why I gave it 3 stars. It removed a significant amount but not all the color in my hair. I could do another round to get it even lighter but I want my hair to be less damaged. I did notice breakage on the ends (about 1-2&amp;#34; on the ends) but that&#x27;s to be expected since I use heat styling tools frequently.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on 30-40 mins and I rinsed &amp; shampooed &amp; rinsed and immediately conditioned with Ion Repair Solutions conditioner for 30 mins under a plastic cap and rinsed with cool water and blow-dried on cool setting. My hair felt soft not like straw but I imagine the deep conditioner had much to do with that--before the conditioner my hair was drier.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to do another deep condition before I color &amp; tone it. The instructions say you can color right away but I felt it wise to condition with a deep conditioner first and wait a day or 2. I intend to color with a 8N+8V to tone the copper down a tad and hopefully I will end up a nice natural strawberry blonde. We shall see.</li>
    <li> I had dark purple hair and I left it in for only 15 minutes and I went right back to blonde, totally recommend</li>
    <li> Was too runny, did not cover my hair completly and it fried my hair to where it will not hold any color.</li>
    <li> We all know many of these reviews begin with tragedy and either end in immense gratitude or further tragedy. In my case, it began with me just wanting a change in hair color for the summer. For many years, I have been coloring my hair Darkest Brown, which contrary to popular belief, contains black dye and therefore cannot be lightened without first stripping the color. Having had this done a couple of times in a salon, the idea of paying upwards of $100 again did not appeal to me. So I went to Sally&#x27;s and checked out their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a great deal of time reading the labels on the different packages. I ultimately chose the Color Zap because I was under the impression it was mild and did not contain bleach. On the box it states that it will not lighten natural hair, but rather only works on the parts of the hair that have been dyed or colored. So I figured: gentle. Boy was I wrong! And boy are they making false claims on their packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I see two small bottles. So small I worried there would not be enough for my long, but thin &amp; fine hair. I read the instructions and followed the advice to use the powder and the developer (because I have a dark shade) rather than the powder and just water (this is recommended for lighter shades). First of all, it burned like hades on my poor head. It smelled like... well... bleach! It was too late to stop by the time I noticed the odor, so I just kept going. Once I got all of my hair covered in the solution, I eventually ran out of it anyway and had to stop. I put on a shower cap and waited the full hour it recommended for my hair color needs. That was one long hour! My head felt like it was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I went to the mirror before rinsing it out, I could already tell that this was not going to end well at all. I rinsed the product out of my hair very thoroughly, shampooed, conditioned, and conditioned again. I also applied leave-in repair serum once I got out. That&#x27;s how badly the texture of my hair felt. Aside from coloring my hair regularly, I have never been one to use a lot of hairspray, heat, or serial bleaching. SO my hair is relatively healthy. I was shocked at how damaged my hair was after using this stuff. Once my hair dried (I wasn&#x27;t about to subject it to the torture of the blow dryer), It was worse than I thought. My roots (i.e. my natural color dark brown with greys here and there) were ORANGE. There were huge blobs and stripes of black dye left all over my head, and my ends were BLONDE. I had to wear a head scarf for two days, it looked so horrible. I went and got Color Oops for m Wal-Mart and now I feel much better. I do not recommend this product for brunettes AT ALL (unless you are planning on going platinum or blonde), and I do not think this product is honest about its purported results or quality. I say, buyer beware. Beware to have all kinds of weird stuff happening with your hair, and beware of a whole lot of damage.the texture of my hair felt.

    <li> All over the packaging this says that it will NOT lighten hair, but please please please know that if you the activator powder in it WILL bleach your hair! I went from dark brown color to yellow, even at my roots that were 2 inches of never been colored grow out. I have used OOPS color remover before and it works, but this will bleach your hair! If that&#x27;s what you want, it actually does a really good job at bleaching it out, but that is NOT what I intended!</li>
    <li> After reading the instructions, I decided I needed to add the developer and go for up to 30 minutes, because I had used demi-permanent red color on a human hair wig and did not like it.  Being not very experienced, I was somewhat afraid to put this on the wig, so first I tried several other ways to remove the color, like washing with Dawn, and Tide, before I used ColorZap.  First of all the other ways only lightened the color a bit, and still made the hair feel very dry and damaged.  When I put ColorZap on, it had done the trick in about 5-10 minutes instead of the 30 I was expecting, and as far as I could tell the hair was no more damaged than before I used it.  I&#x27;d have been better off to have just used this to start with.  Now I am back to blonde I started with, if not a bit lighter.  But sadly, because of the Dawn and Tide drying the wig, and my extensive use of conditioner, the knots loosened and a lot of the hair came out before I used ColorZap.  Well, this has definitely been a learning experience.  Next time I&#x27;ll just use ColorZap, and keep the conditioner off the knots.  It&#x27;s a good thing I did not like that wig anyway.</li>
    <li> I had green hair and rather than bleach it and redye, I opted for this instead. It worked perfectly! I dyedmy hair purple after this and it looked perfect!</li>
    <li> It barely took color out of my hair and my roots were bright orange!!!</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Did not take all the color out, and left my hair orange and blonde</li>
    <li> Great product of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> After years of dyeing my hair black, I find it&#x27;s nearly impossible to go lighter when the mood strikes me. Normally I go for the box bleach. When that fails, to Sally&#x27;s for some 8-10 levels of lift bleach with a 40 developer. When THAT fails, I turn to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I turn to this product, my hair is so damaged it stretches. So the fact I can use it and still have any hair left speaks to how (comparatively) non damaging it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still bleach-like. It did bleach my roots to a bright brassy yellow. It did froth up and smell like bleach, and bleach my towel. But whatever it has in it removes color that regular bleach won&#x27;t touch, without being TOO damaging. I&#x27;ve tried Color Oops! which is slightly less effective, more gentle, but MUCH more time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the best results with using Color Oops! first, then this bleach-like solution over it. I was able to get my bleach-proof black to a copper penny red with one application</li>
    <li> Removed most of the ronald mcdonald red so that I could bleach it to platinum.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help remove some provona vivids blue from my hair. While it didn&#x27;t remove it all or some of the darker color I had in, It did remove it from my ends the best (weird, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was easy to put together and apply. Almost like shampoo. I will totally use this again!</li>
    <li> This item worked better for me than Color Oops.. and I love Color Oops.  This is cheaper than Color Oops as well, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I would definetely use it again. It literally takes the color right out! I would reccomend this to people for sure.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! I tried to ombre my hair by myself and it was just awful, so I tried dying my whole head to fix it and it looked even worse! The colorzap was amazing and got me back to a neutral (kind of reddish) tone I could start from scratch. I would only suggest it as a last resort though, it is very damaging and my ends got very dry from it.</li>
    <li> This did not pull out the color like I expected. I&#x27;ve had better results with other hair color removers.</li>
    <li> I used this to get dark hair off of blonde and it came out an ugly orange and brown and incredibly uneven. And to top it off my hair is now completely fried and frazlled. Totally ruined my hair. Do not recommend to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Misadvertising all around:  This just fades the color you currently have to a lighter iteration of itself, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;remove&#x27; anything.  IT WILL NOT RESTORE YOUR HAIR TO ITS NATURAL COLOR -- it is only useful if you&#x27;re planning on re-dying your hair to a darker color than it will fade your hair to, and there is no guarantee what that color will or will not be.  Save your money, let your hair grow, and just cut the color out.</li>
    <li> I have bleached hair that i&#x27;ve been coloring silver/white for the past 3 months. A week ago i got a little \\&quot;adventurous\\&quot; and tried to add a slight blue tint, and to my horror my hair turned a dark royal blue! after washing it 20 times and using Color Corrector from the local Sally&#x27;s TWICE, it was still a medium purple/blue color. I literally had to wear a hat to cover it up for the past week! Last night i picked up ColorZap and used it. BANG! The purple/blue is ALL gone, my hair is left whiter than ever (it still has some pinkish and blueish tints at places, but it looks really neat i rather like it :-)). Overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with the result, thanks ColorZap!!!! will definitely use again for my next hair coloring disaster!</li>
    <li> I have used this once before and the result was ok.  But I decided I wanted to go blue.  My hair is half black and half red.  I had just gotten my hair cut short to get rid of damaged hair and I was able to blow dry my hair everyday because of how healthy it was!  I got this product hoping it would easily lift the black (the black has been in my hair forever and I had not redyed it in forever) and the red was slightly new but I was told this product would lift the red perfectly.  I am completely disappointed after using this product!  I kept it completely away from my roots, but my scalp still felt burned.  The hair near my roots is blonde, the midshaft of my hair is brown and my ends are black!  It barely lifted the red out of my hair.  What&#x27;s worst, is that my hair is so dry!  I had to do do a miracle treatment and slept in a hair mask with olive oil and conditioner and it is a tiny but better but still damaged. I&#x27;m scared to blow dry or bleach my hair but I&#x27;m going to have to because my hair is not only still too dark, but a horrible array of disgusting colors that were not lifted from my hair-as this product was supposed to do.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for a very long time and I always follow instructions.  Do not use this product if you value your hair.  Also, the product is very runny/watery and a pain to deal with.  There is a lack of instruction-and be careful opening the box because the instructions you might need to use are right in the fold of the box that is easily ripped off when you try to open the box to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
    <li> I had colored my hair black and i wanted to remove the color and well this kinda worked but not really some hair stayed black and some hardly changed to a brownish orange color , i wasnt completely thrilled i followed the direction to a t and it didnt really work mind you not its not the first time i use this product i used it before and it worked great but not this time .</li>
    <li> my daughter has had a reddish color for a long time now and we put this in to get back to her original color and i did put it in the roots by mistake so that was obviously yellow but the rest just turn blonde yellow instead of her regular brown hair</li>
    <li> I used this product to remove a number of layers of salon color and unfortunately since I had a number of different colors in my hair, the end product was a variety of colors of orange.  Even following the directions and placing the color remover on the ends first, my roots were nearly platinum and the ends were nearly fire engine red.  Package arrived completely crushed but none of the product was damaged or punctured.</li>
    <li> Great product to lift darker shades..but is still slightly damaging to hair also 3 boxes was barely enough to do my hair that is medium to long</li>
    <li> I had pre lightened hair with roots. I added some low lights and they didn&#x27;t turn out good (too muddy and ashy looking). So I got this color remover at Sally&#x27;s. I put it on my hair. It has ammonia in it, smells awful. Anyway, I went through with the application. After literally 5 min, I looked in the mirror and notices my hair below the roots turned platinum blonde. OMG! It felt like I put 100% bleach on my hair. I washed it out immediately. Now, I have dark brown roots and platinum blonde the rest of the hair. Very dreadful look. Why did it lighten my hair so much?! I can&#x27;t understand. I thought it was supposed to wash out hair color molecules by shrinking them. I&#x27;m surprised my hair is still on my head. I really really really would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Of course I expected to get some dryness, it is expected since this product had so much dark pigment to lift.  I highly recommend for someone who is trying to go a shade or two lighter but not completely blonde.  It mostly made my roots yellow but the ends still were darker than I wanted them to be.  Still it did a great lift without breaking my hair and no horrible smells.</li>
    <li> Definitely removed the dye.  Bleached out to blonde with pink highlights.  I bought a pure dark blonde and am very pleased with the end result, but next time would try color oops next time, as I just wanted my own color back.  Will know better next time.</li>
    <li> this striped my hair it went from muti colored hair to almost 1 perfect shade of golden blond&lt;br /&gt;which made my hair  uch easier to dye and keep it one color for once</li>
    <li> I got it out of the box and knew I was in trouble right away seeing the size of the bottles, definitely not enough for the amount of hair I have. If you&#x27;re hair is thick you&#x27;ll need multiples. I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and got 2 boxes of Color Fix and it worked well to get the red out of my hair and get me back to blonde.</li>
    <li> It works well enough. It turned my hair a blondeish orange color. It didnt really matter  to me as I was just trying to remove the hair dye out my hair (it was red) and dye my hair jet black. I would recommend that if you have long, thick hair like I do that you get more than one bottle. I didnt have quite enough to do all my hair. Also I would recommend that when you shake the bottle up (to mix the stuff) to be really careful when opening it. It exploded everywhere when I opened it xD also Dont let it get on your skin as it will bleach your skin and anything else it gets on.</li>
    <li> Worked very well in 15 min my hair was stripped of all the dye</li>
    <li> My hair was dyed red, it took out only 60% of the color, I now have. A very spotty bleachy strawberry blonde thing going on. It&#x27;s going to be a real fun time getting it to a base blonde to color.</li>
    <li> My natural color is a dark blonde, dyed it black. I got tired of dark colors looking flat when they fade and wanted to remove all the dark hair dye from my hair and bleach my hair a light blonde so I ordered 2 packs of this to start the lightening process.  When lightening hair always start applying the product from the back to the front. Loreal Colorzap works very quickly so you will want to move fast, it helps to have two mirrors. I like to use my bathroom mirror and the mirror on the medicine cabinet to the side. By angling the mirror on your medicine cabinet you can see what youre doing in the back.  Once all the product was on my head and I looked a sloppy mess I waited 15 minutes then rinsed it out with cold water.  It did leave my hair feeling dry but nothing a good moisturizing treatment wont help with.  I do not recommend leaving it longer than 15 minutes.  I was about a level 2 or 3 before using Loreal Color Zap and this took me to a level 6, my hair looked orange (which is expected).  I followed up with bleach, toned my hair and dyed it a natural light blonde hair color. Minimal damage and shiny results &#x3D;).  Customer Satisfied. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair black for many years. This product works quite well and is much more financially frugal than a visit to a salon.</li>
    <li> After trying to tone down brassy colors in my newly bleached hair, I ended up with pastel blue, concentrated at the ends. This product was slightly pricey at Sally&#x27;s,  so I used half of each bottle, and mixed with a brush in a coloring bowl. Noticing how runny it was, and how difficult it would be to brush on, I just tipped my head forward upside down, and dipped my hair into the bowl,  ends first.  I then used gloved hands to distribute, keeping my head forward,  until it stopped dripping everywhere. It worked very fast. Btw, it smells and it will burn skin and eyes. Gloves are imperative. I rinsed and then shampooed, and then toned with manic panic white snow. Rinsed and conditioned. It looks and feels good. I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> I had dyed black hair that I was trying to get back to dark brown.  I&#x27;d been dying my hair black for about two years, so it had a lot to combat.  The first time I used Color Zap I only used one box, and it was not enough to cover my medium/long hair.  I left it on for about an hour, but it dried up and didn&#x27;t do much to change the color.  I walked around for a month with red roots and black hair.  Gorgeous.  So I figured out that it needs to stay wet (things I wish the box had told me - that you&#x27;ll need a shower cap or a plastic shopping bag to wrap your head in so it doesn&#x27;t dry out, and you&#x27;ll need to buy your own plastic gloves.  There are none in the box.  Probably one of those applicator brushes would have been nice too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried was a month after the first attempt, and I used two boxes.  It removed the color, but not as well as I would have liked.  I had some black patches - so be sure to cover your head well, and put it under a cap after, so it stays wet.  The product heats up while it&#x27;s working... I was pretty alarmed by it, but I guess that&#x27;s normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my hair orange red with yellow roots after about 25 minutes.  Very scary.  My hair was VERY dry.  You have to wash out the Color Zap, and then dry again before you can dye it.  I would advise letting it air dry.  I blow dried, and I think that was a mistake.  My hair felt like straw, and combing it out was a nightmare.  It felt like every strand would snap off.  They didn&#x27;t, but I was very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dyed it dark brown immediately after, and it was still pretty red.  I liked it, but YMMV.  I was pretty excited to not have black hair anymore, so I think I would have liked anything.  When I colored again a month after it was much darker (I used the same color both times.)  I still have some reddish tones in my hair.  I&#x27;m going to try putting in some highlights soon so the lighter/darker patches aren&#x27;t so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was pretty fried after all this.  I cut off about 4 inches at the ends, because they looked awful.  I&#x27;ve always had really silky hair, so it was kind of distressing to have hair that felt like straw.  I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda&#x27;s repair shampoo and conditioner ever since to try to get my hair back to normal, and I think it&#x27;s better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this reads like a hair nightmare, but it wasn&#x27;t terrible.  If I needed to get color out of my hair again I would use Color Zap again, only I&#x27;d do better next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and reading every review you can find before you do this to your hair, I found it really helpful to watch YouTube videos of people using Color Zap and the like.  I had no idea what I was doing, as I&#x27;d never tried to lighten my hair before, and it was helpful to get more info and watch tutorials so I had a clue as to what I was in for.</li>
    <li> it took 7 years of box color out of my hair!! Wow!! Helped me go from red to blonde!!!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this is basically just a very small bottle of overpriced bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t even very effective at that - I was attempting to remove hair dye from a white dog, and all it did was slightly lighten the dye. There wasn&#x27;t enough of the product to even get to the root of the hair shafts either, just the tips over a small section. I highly doubt this is enough product for a human girl&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> My daughter dyed her naturally blonde hair with pink Splat.  2 months later, we wanted the dye our before her gymnastics competition, and this didnt touch it!  Maybe would have worked if we hadnt waited so long, i dont know. didnt work for us.</li>
    <li> This product arrived much faster then I anticipated. I had used a brown/black dye that I wanted out. The color zap removed a good ammount, however the resulting tones are uneven. I&#x27;m pleased overall and would recomend buying from this seller, and I also recomend this product. It did not \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair, and it worked.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair my natural medium dark brown a few times a year for gray coverage, but wanted to go lighter for the summer. I used this product to remove all the dye so I had a clean base. It worked exactly as described. My color after was pretty much my natural color but with an orangey tint, which is what it&#x27;s supposed to be; you must immediately re-dye, as this product isn&#x27;t meant to be your finishing step. My only complaint was that it left my hair a little dry and stressed. Some good conditioning after the finishing dye and it seems ok a week later. Make sure to read the directions carefully. You have to mix it differently and leave on for various times depending on your circumstances. And definitely strand test. If your hair isn&#x27;t strong enough to take the chemicals better to find out in a snipped strand than your whole head!</li>
    <li> Decent stuff.  It is a bleach, so be aware of that.  The first time I used it, I was faded turquoise, and left it on accidentally for like an hour.  80% of the turquoise came out and it bleached my roots so my hair was white and mint.  Today I used it on super stubborn, two month old, red Manic Panic dye and it bleached my roots again and left the red a really pretty soft sorbet orange.  My hair lifts to white super easily though so maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had dyed my hair black many times, and I wanted to go back to my natural color. I followed the directions but, it turned my roots a blonde/orange color and a big circle in the back of my head was blonde. Everything else was black. My hair was ruined and I had to spend $150 to fix it.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair a dark auburn and was getting tired of it. Trouble is my hair is a light brown/dark blonde color naturally so there was no way I could dye it back to it&#x27;s original color. Note: This product will not turn your hair back to it&#x27;s original color. My hair was sort of an orangeish blonde color after using it. I then redyed it to something a little closer to normal. If I had left it on a bit longer it might not of had the orange tint ( my roots were very pale blonde). It is a type of bleaching product so be warned your hair will be damaged some, but nothing that a few deep conditioning treatments won&#x27;t solve.</li>
    <li> Did not even do anything to my hair color. The bottle was so small it was barely enough to coat my hair and I have ear length hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine and fragile hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been coloring my hair black for years. Color zap got it off in 30 min. I was amazed. I did not believe this product would be able to do so, but I was pleasantly  surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells bad and acts as bleach, but gets the color off. You will end up with hair that is damaged and all weird colors, but it is a great beginning for the color that you would like to achieve. I colored my hair right away to medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out nice. It will need more color applications to get to the right coverage (Some strands are lighter and some are darker I was not able to achieve one color all over), but I&#x27;m very satisfied. I have nice brown hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The damage is not bad at all and the black is gone. Huray!</li>
    <li> i love my colorzap by loreal, it is wonderful. easy to use, and very helpful if i have an OPPS with hair coloring, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried colour remover after colour remover and this, just like any other one I&#x27;ve tried has turned my hair a brassy orangey red. My hair is naturally blonde.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible  product  compared  to color oops. .. my hairdresser  is going to freak out.it turned  some parts bleach blonde from  red and the bottom  is like cheetahs print .</li>
    <li> This product worked great but I have thick shoulder length hair and ran out of product.  Thankfully, I only needed to colorzap the top layer of my hair but would definitely need 2 bottles for an entire head.</li>
    <li> This stuff destroyed my hair!! It turned my hair straw-like -- I love my long hair but ive made an appt tomorrow to get it colored and cut short... Use COLOR-OPPS!! its so good every time and never damages my hair but they were out so I bought this one - WORST MISTAKE EVER! I can&#x27;t beleive how bad this stuff messed up my hair :( I&#x27;m so sad!!</li>
    <li> terrible product! About a yr ago I used this and my hair came out different colors. Dark brown, light brown, yellow,orange and white, it was terrible!</li>
