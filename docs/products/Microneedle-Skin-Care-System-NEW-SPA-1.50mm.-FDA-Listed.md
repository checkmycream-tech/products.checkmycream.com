      <li>Everytime I use this product and go out people come up to me and say you look great</li>
      <li>This product is amazing on stretch marks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly remarkable, and I hope to continue to see improvements as I go along with the treatments.    </li>
      <li>But the most impressive thing was that I could see results not after 2-3 weeks but literally like 3 days.</li>
      <li>but After doing tons of research &amp; speaking to a certified plastic surgeon.. I do believe that with continued use, a healthy diet, a great anti-aging skin care regime, &amp; exercise, I will receive the results I&#x27;m expecting!</li>
      <li>the result I saw, was remarkable.</li>
      <li>I would think if you have very fair skin, you might want to needle your face at night so that the redness is mostly gone by morning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having a good face \\&quot;system\\&quot; i.e., products that deliver Vitamin C, E, A - peptides/antioxidants - and, that assists with collegian building will be advantageous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product to target the cheeks and the forehead</li>
      <li>put a  good amount of cream on you face and rub it in or use a massager which I do .</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>well  good luck to everyone with stretch marks</li>
      <li>I started out really good by useing as directed-even though it has a lot of do&#x27;s and dont</li>

      <li>MOISTURIZE with good quality&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good Luck.</li>
      <li>Use a good moisturiser after use.</li>
      <li>Appears to be good quality.</li>
      <li>However, do not get caught up into \\&quot;good</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be a fair comparison.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really good</li>
      <li>The best thing about this product was how quickly it arrived, literally it came in three days.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased and have now tried it on BOTH breasts tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Started using this I&#x27;ve heard great things about how it can help absorbtion for Minoxidil and thus making it more effective.</li>

      <li>are amazing.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had to wear coverup on any blemishes since I started using it which is amazing for me.</li>
      <li>and I am already noticing a difference which is amazing.</li>
      <li>the amazing results I have had on my face and scalp</li>
      <li>It kind of feels like the sensation of getting a tattoo.</li>
      <li>Very well built and price is perfect .</li>
      <li>Shipping was extremely fast and the packaging was perfect so product arrived undamaged.</li>
      <li>I am not kidding here, folks, there is a very noticeable and delightful</li>
      <li>Then I use Rose hips oil on my face followed with an avocado oil massage.  </li>
      <li>, I gave them a let me show you how class,some liked it</li>
      <li>but like anything it takes time to heal so give it a week ,cover your face with a good cream you like and make sure it has spf in it and keep applying cream .</li>
      <li>i honestly wouldn&#x27;t have order it.</li>
      <li>I used Bio Oil on the skin right after I used it, as I have read its very good for skin health and repair.</li>
      <li>(in fact, I handle it with more care than anything else I own for fear of damaging the needles) and I keep it on the very top shelf of my bathroom</li>

      <li>/&gt;Maybe if I were more familiar w procedure, I&#x27;d like better?!?!</li>
      <li>using it 2 times a week should be good enough.or once a day if u do it lightly and for a couple minutes.</li>
      <li>What I do know for sure from my own experience at my age and from friends (all at my age)</li>
      <li>the longer you use it the more effective it will be.</li>
      <li>So far I am impressed.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprized that it was not bad at all.  </li>
      <li>I think reviews are very important for these things.  </li>
      <li>BUT the bottom one is 75% gone and the top is beginning to lighten.</li>
      <li>And I am not even sure dermarollimg works for indented scars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a very good quality roller. The needles are sharp and perfectly aligned; the rolling mechanism allows for a very smooth roll; the handle is a good length; it is over-all very sturdy. I have done two sessions with it for some stretch marks on my thighs. I use the Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy Lotion morning and night and right after I roll. I got the 1.5 mm size, and I am happy with it. I am able to roll without using numbing cream/gel, but if I did numb the area, I&#x27;d probably be able to apply more pressure and get better results, but I don&#x27;t want to damage the already-delicate tissues. The instructions say this roller should last you between 3-6 months, so when I am ready for a new one, I will probably get the 2.0 mm roller and some numbing cream. But I will definitely buy this same brand and from this same seller because a lot of people sell rip-off rollers online and now that I know this seller is legit I will only buy from them just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I wish they described which size roller was appropriate for different areas/treatment goals.&lt;br /&gt;I have taken before/after pictures and I saw significant improvement in the redness and number of stretch marks after I started rolling vs just using the lotion. Also, the first time I rolled I just did one thigh and not the other so I could compare, and the side that I used the roller on was much improved a couple weeks later when the redness was gone and I could see that almost all of the very small and light marks were completely gone and the more severe ones had at least improved!&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after rolling (maybe more like the morning after) the skin has plumped up in response to the mild trauma and that makes all the stretch marks invisible! :)&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the skin heals itself and they become visible again, but less so. It is for this reason that I think I need a longer needle (2.0mm) and that I wish they would have had a way of helpingme choose the right length before I got my first one.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using this without numbing cream, especially if you have a low pain tolerance or if you are doing it on an area with thinner skin. (I am doing it on the top of my thigh and even though that is a well-padded area of the body in general, it is especially unpleasant when I get higher up on the thigh, closer to the hip, where there is less fat/muscle under the skin.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely say this is worth a try! Don&#x27;t wait too long if you are thinking about treating stretch marks because the sooner you treat them the better! I started rolling about 3 months after mine appeared and I think if I had started sooner it may have worked better, but there&#x27;s no way of knowing now.</li>
    <li> you can buy these on ebay for cheaper. i got mine for under 20 dollars. go to ebay and go to advance search. then click search for seller. type in \\&quot;beautyhow\\&quot; that seller sells derma rollers for cheap and their brandnew and sterlized. you can also go to ebay and type derma rollers and find other products similar by other sellers. but i think that one is the best deal, for me since im from the u.s. if your from another country you can search worldwide for it. ive been using a derma roller for a year now that i bought from ebay. it has improved the stretch marks on my stomach. they have faded and actually have shrunk in size. they used to be thicker lines and now they are slimmer. they were a dark pink and are a light pink now. i believe if i keep using it they will fade away to where there not visible anymore. these derma rollers really do work. it just takes some time. so be patient. my stretch marks are about 4 years old though. so maybe u will see faster results with new stretch marks. also applying cocoa butter,shea butter,vitiamin e helps afterwards. and ive been washing with sauve cocoa butter body wash and that makes my skin really soft and i believe that helped the stretch marks too. my goal someday is to wear a bikini. i would love to have a normal looking stomach thats smooth and clear. this derma roller is helping me get there. oh and for first time users your skin will be red a couple days after using the roller. using it 2 times a week should be good enough.or once a day if u do it lightly and for a couple minutes. for  twice a week roll the roller in different directions and about 5 - 10 minutes pressing deeply but not too hard.. the longer you use it the more effective it will be. but dont use it too long. and then use a moisturizer afterwards. i think its best to use this at night before you go to bed or when you wake up in the morning. i got stretch marks from gaining weight and i never been pregnant. so its embarassing. you can get stretch marks fordifferent reasons. its sucks whoever gets them. well  good luck to everyone with stretch marks and i hope if you use this product it will help you.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that could treat my acne scars naturally without any chemicals or lasers for a very long time. Finally, I found this magic skin roller. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money elsewhere. The Micro Needle System is the best product out there, and Rose the service rep goes way above and beyond your normal customer service rep to satisfy her customers.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hours of research on the concept. Believe me when I tell you this will work. I have been using it about 3 times a week for 2 months or so already. I can see a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I think this is partially because after the skin has been slightly pierced, it allows for your scar/stretch mark creams to absorb better and be more effective.     In terms of the pain, it really depends on where your scar is located. In my case, I have stretch marks almost all over my body after pregnancy, some worse than others. On the belly and the love handles, I really don&#x27;t think this is painful at all, but other areas are very painful. I would recommend some kind of numbing cream if you have a scar on your face or on very sensitive areas, such as the inner thighs (this is the most painful area for me). Overall, if you still with it, and use a decent cream after you are finished, you will see a more drastic reduction in scars and stretch marks and much much faster than using a cream alone. Also make sure you sterilize the product between uses in boiling water for about 5 minutes. Good luck everyone! I hope it works for you.    Also, taking the advice of another reviewer, I bought mine on ebay from a top rated seller of derma rollers and micro-needle products for about 15 dollars. It was perfectly packaged and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of creams for stretch marks and nothing has made a difference until I started using them with the derma-roller. I can&#x27;t believe I am actually seeing results.This is so exciting to me. What a breakthrough product. Jeez, that sounds like some cheesy, fake testimonial but, honestly, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of this product so far and I just started using it.</li>
    <li> I have had scars on my face for 20 years and deep lines between my eyebrows for 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried acid peels, retinol, dermabrasion, castor oil, scar creams and patches, Frownies, many many things. Most of these did reduce finer lines at least temporarily. But only the 1.5mm dermaroller has really made a difference on my deeper lines and scars. I&#x27;ve had this about 2 months and use it 2-3 times/week, followed by copper peptide super serum.  (I&#x27;ve also used the copper peptides alone with no effect.)    The 1.5 mm models can draw tiny drops of blood when applied with solid pressure. You can actually hear tiny \\&quot;pop-pop-pop\\&quot;s when the skin is pierced. When I hear this, I know it&#x27;s getting deep. I believe this is needed to get at the really deep scars and wrinkles. It makes tiny wounds that your body will then quickly heal. This does hurt, and there are some areas such as the upper lip that just hurt too much (maybe with a skin anasthetic I could do it). I can only get myself to do it a few times per week, to the depth that makes a difference.  By the next morning, though, there is no sign or only a little redness that is easily covered.  (Not like dermabrasion or agressive peels where you look awful for the next week!)    So you have to be serious to use this, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I I am using it since last week and I can see the difference in my skin, and I am sure that it will be better in next days.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and I can see the stretch marks breaking up...I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this derma needle for about a week. i ordered the 1.5 mm length and it seems to be working good so far.  The only thing that you should be concerned about, is that when you start needling (especially when you get out of the shower, because your skin is much softer) you should roll very gently and apply GENTLE pressure.  Since your skin is much softer, you wouldnt want to create more scars on your face.  I have been using this spa derma needle for my acne scars and it seems to be working pretty good on my temple area.  beware when  you use it on your cheeks, you should apply gentle pressure there, because i have seem to notice little holes ( almost like my pores are getting larger) after i use this.  It seems to go away after a couple of hours so dont freak out if you get the same problem.  I also follow my routine with a vitamin c serum and spread it all over so it can heal faster.  look on ebay for those serums because they are much cheaper there with free shipping.  I also check to notice if this dermaneedle is working by looking at my skin in different lightings.  It has worked for sure on my temple area by making it more smoother and i have only used it for a week so far.  shout out to the people who are skeptic about this device, i would say to try it out, it has been working for me and it might work for you too (esp the people with acne scarring) I feel for you guys.. Trust.  It does not aggravate or mess up your skin at all if you dont apply hard pressure.  Just make sure you apply gentle pressure and feel the needles piecing into your skin and it should do its job well.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this product everyday for the past 3 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my wrinkles on my forehead or around my eyes but Im keeping my fingers crossed.  The product is not as painful as I anticipated and will continue to use this until it works</li>
    <li> Ordering from these people was fabulous, and the shipping was extremely fast. As far as the product it works well, comes with a nice protective case, and the only other thing I had to buy was some cocoa butter with vitamins and alcohol for cleaning! Can&#x27;t wait to see results!  (And in case you were wondering, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, the 1.5mm. I use it on my stomach and face and the pain is completely manageable. I am surprised so many people say they can&#x27;t handle it because it is really not that bad and part of it is a guts thing.)</li>
    <li> This thing works but does occassionally get stuck during the rolling process. I wont buy again but Its not so bad that I wont discontinue use.. I just go slow. But for anyone who has a little age showing these types of rollers along with good creams (I use the brand No7 from Target) along with hydrochloric acid cream) make the world of a difference. I wont be without</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve just received my dermaroller and i&#x27;ll give it a try but i&#x27;m pleased with shipening service it&#x27;s really good thanks man</li>
    <li> After reading all of the rave reviews for this product on well over a dozen sites, including Amazon, and after finally using it myself, I can say to anyone interested in this product with utmost honesty that THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. I have been using this product for about 5 months now, and if you have wrinkles, scars, stretch marks or even if your HAIR is falling out like mine, you&#x27;ve got to get your hands on one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)The lines on my forehead - gone after 4 weeks of use (I had a really long one that ran across the length of my forehead that creased whenever i smiled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)The scars on my cheeks from acne - significantly less visible after approximately 15 weeks of use (these were pitted scars too, not just mild surface scars) I am still working on this area though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)The wrinkles around my lips and eyes - gone after only 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)The hair that I&#x27;ve lost around the crown of my head is actually regrowing, yes, I am serious, let me repeat that - my HAIR has been REGROWING, thicker and more visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the amazing results I have had on my face and scalp, I am planning to use this product for the stretch marks on my thighs with extremely high hopes. This really is science at it&#x27;s best, and you would be depriving yourself of something truly wonderful if you were to pass this up. The only real downsides to any of this is that the process can be somewhat painful, you&#x27;ll need to start wearing an spf sunscreen of at least 30 if you want to go out afterward, and if you plan to roll your scalp as well, be prepared to spend up to an hour rolling - I am a female, and my hair loss stems mostly from stress and hormonal changes, so i can not vouch for it regrowing hair in men. However, the facial healing alone should convince anyone to give this a try, and I swear my skin has never looked so good in years. Please feel free to ask any questions by the way! I use this product twice a week (Mondays and Fridays) and will try my best to update on the status of my cheeks and thighs within the coming weeks or months, depending on the rapidity of my results.ate on the status of my cheeks and thighs within the coming weeks or months, depending on the rapidity of my results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about 2-3 times a week for the last couple of months. So far, I have noticed a lot less breakouts and the look of my acne scarring and large pores have really improved. I don&#x27;t even have to wear make-up anymore as I have seen that much improvement! I am even going to start using it on my décolletage now to see if it helps with the wrinkling. So glad I found this product. Beats spending hundreds of dollars on peels and laser treatments each year!!!</li>
    <li> Have used my roller 3x since it&#x27;s purchase, I probably should have gotten a smaller needle size to begin with, as it does sting a bit too much on my forehead, however, it is tolerable on the rest of my face, neck, upper chest and arms.  Too early to tell for any skin improvement will update the status after a few months. I will probably get the 2mm for the more sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the money! I had horrible stretch marks on my stomach from my first child, and have tried everything to fade them. I saw this derma roller on here and thought I might as well try it, and in the first month they were already faded! Its been about 3 months and I would say the stretch marks on my tummy are about 70% gone. It does not really hurt as much as it is uncomfortable. It kind of feels like the sensation of getting a tattoo. I used Bio Oil on the skin right after I used it, as I have read its very good for skin health and repair. So, I would definitely recommend this product. I am 100 percent satisfied!</li>
    <li> I am African American and I used this for a hypertrophic scar on my face. I use this roller at night and apply super cop 2x. Then in the mornings I use salicylic acid 20%. Within 4 days my scar was flat. But that was just the start of the process -- over a couple weeks, the underlying scar tissue comes to the surface as you repeat the process over and over. So the scar has been bumpy, then flat, bumpy then flat, and now it&#x27;s actually getting flatter and flatter. It&#x27;s been about 6 or 7 weeks, and the scar is almost unnoticeable. Remember to start slow with everything because the skin is sensitive and if you overdo anything, you&#x27;ll have to deal with several days of swelling/scarring.</li>
    <li> I just received my rollers yesterday and tried it last night for the very first time. I researched greatly (which included shopping around for roller prices), watched many videos and viewed many before and after photos prior to diving in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for me I have a very high pain tolerance so, it really wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and thankfully I didn&#x27;t need any numbing cream prior to the procedure. I must admit (it&#x27;s not my imagination) I immediately noticed my upper eyelids perked up and not as droopy. Note: You do not roll over your eyelids. It&#x27;s important to keep in mind: building collegian naturally takes time but, I was pleasantly surprised to see this happen. Another thing I noticed: my creams - that I use on my face - are actually going into the skin as opposed to just sitting on the surface. My skin feels wonderful and looks firmer. I also like the refreshed \\&quot;increased circulation\\&quot; glow that it gives my complexion. Also note: It&#x27;s very important to use a good sunscreen (after the procedure) and do NOT wear makeup for at least 24 hours. Without a doubt, this is something I will be definitely maintaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dermabrasion several years ago (every 6-weeks, 6 @$150 per session) and looking back and \\&quot;comparing them\\&quot; (during and after the procedure) this is far better, more economical and the \\&quot;after session\\&quot; results are almost identical. By far I would highly recommend rolling over dermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a good face \\&quot;system\\&quot; i.e., products that deliver Vitamin C, E, A - peptides/antioxidants - and, that assists with collegian building will be advantageous. However, do not get caught up into \\&quot;good products\\&quot; equals lots-o-money. Dr. Jeannette Graf has an EXCELLENT and more than reasonable 6 piece kit titled \\&quot;Look your very best\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger the needle - and in my case 1.5 - the procedure need only be done once every 6 weeks. You need to give your skin time to heal and rebuild. Where as, when using a smaller needle - and in my case 0.3 or less - (which is particularly good for under your eyes and all over your face) can be done every day if you choose. By the way, many spas provide their clients with a smaller roller (0.3 or less) to use in between sessions. Using a smaller roller assists with skin product absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, you need to replace your roller every 6 months because the acupuncture needles will become dull. Hope this helps.good for under your eyes and all over your face) can be done every day if you choose.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 1.5mm roller with gentle pressure on face (until a \\&quot;sunburn\\&quot; develops) three times so far.  Then I use Rose hips oil on my face followed with an avocado oil massage.  I can not believe how the smile lines around my eyes have diminished and the overall skin looks brighter and healthier.  I do the oil regimen twice a day. The acne scars on my checks have almost flatten out (I had fraxel laser 2 yrs ago for $1900 and didn&#x27;t get results like these!!) In theory, its true that the puncturing of skin does absorb the oils or cream deep into the skin layers. Otherwise, how could I have seen improvement so quickly? I have also used the roller on my thighs for the cellulite which I follow with different essential oils massage.  In the past, I have done six \\&quot;vela shape\\&quot; treatments for my cellulite in a spa for $1200 and all I got was bruising.  It took weeks to see some improvement. With this derma roller at this price, I can do the treatments at home right after showering and know that I do not have to spend thousands to keep up the treatments. The bumps on my thighs look a little better but I still need at least 2 months on those treatments.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and have tried everything including top line creams and serums but never have seen results like these in just 7 days. I am going to buy 2mm roller for thighs and 0.5mm for eyes and lip areas. This is an excellent product at an excellent price that I can take anywhere and do my treatments at any time!!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and have small lines around the mouth and between eyes, forehead. I have used this daily for 20 days now, and have found improved skin texture, lines starting to smooth out. Very happy, and if you use a good organic skin care line, it will improve results.</li>
    <li> This product shipped fast, came packaged well and was as shown. I was hesitant to purchase this roller as I have tried many different stretch mark products. All i can say is i see a difference. I roll almost every night and apply [[ASIN:B004ZDEGJO (1 oz. / 30 ml) Pure 100% Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer Gel -(P) AntiAging, Firming Serum]] directly after. I ordered bio oil and think i will alternate between it and the Hyaluronic gel. I think this system requires time and dedication, along with a tolerance for annoying pain. It doesn&#x27;t hurt enough to buy the numbing topical gel but it doesn&#x27;t feel great either. Just know what you are buying... a whole bunch of little needles to poke yourself with! Overall I think it is a great product the only reason for 4 stars it that it must be replaced after roughly 30 uses (if you are doing larger areas more often)because it becomes dull leading to a pretty steep cost over time. BUT, I feel the benefits out weigh the costs due to it actually working on my trouble areas (i do my entire stomach and 3-4 scars roughyl 6 times a week before bed). Also i think you may want a tad bit smaller of a needle (1.0mm) for the face as this one seems a bit too much in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I started out really good by useing as directed-even though it has a lot of do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s but eventully you can&#x27;t follow all the dont&#x27;s(no makeup for 24 hours after)I use it mabe 3-4 times a week after my shower or after I wash my face before I go to bed or during the day(whenever I remember)  I do not see a difference but I am hoping that it is doing something that will show later. I roll it aroung my lip area, under eyes/eye browes, forehead and chest for wrinkles and I roll it along my checks for acne scarring. Once in a while I will roll it over my strech marks on my hips.    Caution:  Sometime the wheel might get caught on a piece of clothing or a peice of hair and it will not roll so you end up scratching the needels across that area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and so far I&#x27;m loving it. It hurt at first but now I&#x27;m used to it. I use it three time a week and follow up with vit E/lotion. The best thing about this product was how quickly it arrived, literally it came in three days. Sweet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roller for about a month, and I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s doing anything or not. I know in theory it should work like a charm, but I&#x27;ve yet to see any results.</li>
    <li> it does make the face soft when i used it but after a while i don&#x27;t feel any difference anymore. It&#x27;s a good product to target the cheeks and the forehead but i wish they had one that targets the corner of the nose, the side of the nose. Overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I only recently became aware of microneedling and at first glance, it seemed barbaric! Piercing your skin with hundreds of tiny needles over and over - ON PURPOSE??? It was just weird enough to make me research further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise behind microneedling is that aging skin produces less collagen. Collagen is the stuff that keeps skin plump and less wrinkly. It also repairs skin damage from the sun, from acne, from injuries etc. So when you make thousands of tiny puncture wounds in your skin, it stimulates your skin to produce collagen to repair the puncture wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science behind it made sense, so I spent a couple of hours Googling the process and discovered that dermatologists are recommending it as a skin treatment that can be done at home. I also watched quite a few YouTube videos of the actual process, which I suggest for anyone purchasing a microneedle roller. It made me feel highly confident that I knew how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the price is less than some skin creams, I decided it was worth trying. I read a lot of comments about how painful it is, so I also ordered some topical anesthetic cream. There were several YouTube videos made by estheticians who said that most of their clients do not require anesthetic cream, but I wanted to have it just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My microneedle roller arrived in a sturdy plastic case that keeps the needles from touching anything - important for keeping the needles clean and sharp. These needles are extremely sharp and extremely thin, so that can be damaged easily by bumping or dropping the roller on hard surfaces. In this particular roller, the needles are surgical stainless steel, but there are also rollers available with titanium needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, the skin you will be needling must be very clean, as well as your hands. I also sprayed the needle roller with isopropyl alcohol (the kind you buy in a big bottle at any store for about a dollar). I had read this was a good way to clean your roller, so I purchased a small spray bottle for this purpose. NOTE: let the alcohol on the roller dry before you begin needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to stretch the skin taut with one hand and then run the roller over each area about 6 times before moving to the next area. When you have covered the entire area you want to needle, then change the direction by about 45 degrees and repeat the process. You don&#x27;t need to press down hard. Light pressure will allow the needles to pierce the skin the full depth. There will be a few pinpoint spots of blood, but mostly the area will become red like a mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it feels, I didn&#x27;t find it painful. It feels like mild stinging to me. However, since everyone has different nerve endings and pain tolerances, I would suggest ordering an anesthetic cream along with the roller. I haven&#x27;t used the anesthetic cream, but I am glad I had it just in case. There is a little popping feeling as the needles pierce the skin, especially on the forehead or places where there isn&#x27;t a lot of fat underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After needling, it is suggested that you apply some sort of moisturizer or other skin treatment. I am using a Vitamin C serum, but others use Vitamin E, a copper peptide cream, or plain moisturizer. Because my skin is fairly dark due to my Native American ancestry, the redness afterward doesn&#x27;t look bad so I can needle and go out right afterward. I would think if you have very fair skin, you might want to needle your face at night so that the redness is mostly gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question is, of course, how does it work? In my case the results are nothing short of astounding! I had a few very fine wrinkles and a few scars on my face. In about two weeks of treatments 5 days a week, most of the wrinkles are gone! The scars look better, too. My pores look finer and less apparent. I am sure that deeper wrinkles will take longer, but I was shocked to see how quickly my fine wrinklesdisappeared. Apparently, microneedling is very good for minimizing scars and stretchmarks, as well as enhancing minoxidil absorption for hair loss treatment. I can&#x27;t speak to that except for the 2 scars on my face, but I can say this is serious skin treatment that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have aging skin, this might be just the skin treatment you are looking for.disappeared.

    <li> I bought this product more than a month ago and I use it following the instructions but It does not work for me at all, and even worse, when I looked the needles closer I noticed some black little holes on the sides of the them, so I am not sure if trusting this product or I just lost my money....The only good thing is that it arrived like two days after I ordered it</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. The reason for my high rating is that it WORKS. I&#x27;ve tried various creams and lotions and none of them produced the results I desired. Most produces no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I am using this mostly for stretchmarks. I&#x27;ve never had a child but I have terrible stretch marks on my abdomen and breasts due to losing and gaining weight too quickly. (because of an eating disorder) I have never had this problem until recently so the stretch marks are very fresh and bright red. I wanted to get rid of them before they aged and became more difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and I am already noticing a difference which is amazing. I use this item about 2 times a week to give my skin time to heal. I&#x27;ve noticed the people who review this item poorly do not use it correctly, using it every day of the week is an absolute NO. This thing punctures your skin, duh you will damage your skin further if you don&#x27;t give your skin time to heal before using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you need to do;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make sure your hands are clean before handling this item.&lt;br /&gt;make sure you sterilize the item. (I put it in boiling water, then blow dry it dry)&lt;br /&gt;make sure you sterilize the area you are going to use it on. (I wash my body with soap and water and then use sanitizer on the specific areas I&#x27;m to use it on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fail to do these things you risk infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you are finished using it you should apply a lotion. It will penetrate your skin more easily after your skin has been derma roller and will allow your skin to  heal faster. I use palmers which has vitamin e and is specifically for stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one more thing, this is the incorrect size to use on your face. You should really be using .5mm on your face or maybe .10mm at the most. I see some having success using this size on their face but I think you should be safe rather than sorry. Different parts of your bodyrequire different needle sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is using this painful? yes, but it&#x27;s not seriously that painful, it&#x27;s mostly painful after you&#x27;re actually done using it. Once you&#x27;re finished using it it stings for about an hour and then the pain fades. worth it? definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be updating this review in about a month to see if my stretch marks have been removed entirely.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe these reviews, please!!!!!!!!!!!  I am a 50 something woman and decided to try this on my face for fine lines and wrinkles, and the results were just the opposite of what I expected.  This product actually increased the number of wrinkles and lines on my face and after only a couple of uses.  Woman in their mid-40s and up should not use this product.  Our skin does not have the elasticity needed to recover from use.  This is a real review by a real Amazon consumer.  You can check my purchases.  Don&#x27;t do it!!!  You will regret it!</li>
    <li> I used this roller once very cautiously and with no pressure and I got a red broken blood vessel on my crows  near my eye,  web research warns not to roll more than once ever four to six weeks so collagen can repair.  It&#x27;s been three weeks and I see no difference except the damage mentioned and holes in my face from the rolling.  I&#x27;m only 37 and look much younger due to genes and people think I have great skin but I&#x27;m a perfectionist.  I&#x27;m too scared to use this again, it&#x27;s unfortunate as I think it make sense theoretically. I&#x27;m just amazed at how gentle I was one time and got these adverse results.</li>
    <li> I have tried the .5 mm roller before, and though it was good, but it takes very long time and shows good results. This one, the 1.5 mm you can see GREAT results after only 2 times (once every few days). The open pores and noticably reduces and the scars are getting lighter. Definately the best product out there for these two problems! plus makes the skin glowing overall &amp; even toned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I am an older man and a contractor that has worked in the sun for over 25 years and this review is more about questions than providing answers. I&#x27;m very busy and I don&#x27;t find time to use it as recommended by directions and other reviews but when I do get around to it I do notice some improvement but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Maybe if I used it as I should the effects would last a little longer I don&#x27;t know but then again the effects might just be swelling and we think we are building collagen so if you use it every day or four times a week you are in a constant state of swelling and therefor the wrinkles appear to fill in some, I don&#x27;t know. I see the effects the next day, I don&#x27;t know how long it takes to build some collagen but I know it takes longer than that so the improvement must be swelling, if it were collagen it would last longer. I guess in time it will build collagen but again I don&#x27;t know. The Microneedle Skin Care System Roller is a little fragile but for that kind of money what do you expect? When I use this product with the Vitamin C Serum by Avalon is seems to do a little better than with the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Pure it will just dry up and if you use the Vitamin  Serum over it it doesn&#x27;t do as well as with C alone. If you are going to order the Hyaluronic Acid to use with the Microneedle I would recommend the Watts Beauty 100% Hyaluronic Acid Solution [[ASIN:B005XP4YNQ Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 60ml]] it should arrive at least five days sooner than the Timeless see feedback, come in a pump bottle not a dropper bottle and contains no alcohol, this solution seems not dry on your skin as fast as the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid. Some say to use the Vitamin C Serum over the Hyaluronic acid to keep it from drying but in that case I don&#x27;t think either would work. I read somewhere online that the Molecular Structure and Acidity are altered when you use two acids together and according to them that would include Vitamin C but again I don&#x27;t really know for sure.  What I do know for sure from my own experience at my age and from friends (all at my age) at best you will see a 10% improvement with skin care products no matter what they are and what you pay for them. Once your over 50 save your money and get a face lift. Together we have spent thousands on just about everything possible short of a face lift with very little improvement and with what improvement you do get it won&#x27;t last unless you keep spending more and more on it. It reminds me of an old Liz Taylor movie Cat On A Hot Tin Roof where Big Daddy say&#x27;s Americans just buy and buy and buy hoping that someday what they buy will be ever lasting life which it never can be. Good Luck.</li>
    <li> Amazing but it actually works !  What else can I say ?  Hurts a little but not bad considering what it is doing .</li>
    <li> I started rolling on my face about a month ago for fine lines around eyes and forehead.  I put nutrogena product on after rolling.  at first skin kinda flakey but now after a month, very smooth, and lines are disappearing.  skin is healthier looking. i had some little bumps around chin that was always there and totally gone.  i will use this daily to see what results i get in 6 months.  I recommend to everyone even gals with pimples.</li>
    <li> this thing works great- i have (had) two grand canyon sized furrows on my brow forever. never expected improvement on them. BUT the bottom one is 75% gone and the top is beginning to lighten. cannot believe it. acne scars starting to show improvement as well. its been 3 weeks but i am pleased beyond expectation.</li>
    <li> I just started to use it.. hope to get the results I m looking for. After few months :)) Thank you..</li>
    <li> I bought this tool when I was 28 and I would not recommend using it at home.  I am 30 now and looking back asked myself &amp;#34;what the heck were you thinking buying this tool full of needles then rolling it on your face??!?!?&amp;#34;  Do yourself a favor and seek professional help if you want work done.  No telling what kind of infection you could get, how good the quality of needles are and how long they last...  Please stop and think about what you&#x27;re really buying...a rolling pin of needles to roll on your face!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I used it- my face felt like it was on fire, followed by intense itching and dryness.  Some people may say the burning was a side effect of the product working, but I say it was because I just rolled a bunch of needles all over my face (stupid idea)!!!&lt;br /&gt;I watched numerous YouTube videos - read online tutorials - these people didn&#x27;t look any more different or spectacular than me after using this tool.  This tool draws blood- so if you do use this buy some numbing cream for your face and neck and be sure to have plenty of rubbing alcohol unless you want a serious infection.</li>
    <li> The one and only thing that&#x27;s ever improved my pitted acne scars, this needle roller has left me shocked and extremely grateful to have found it. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products, light therapy, etc and this is the one thing thats also kept my skin clear from day one of using it. I can&#x27;t believe everyone doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I have pretty large and noticeable pock marks on my cheeks from acne when i was younger. Ive tried almost everything from maderma gel to a fraxel laser treatment (which was about 2 weeks of healing time!!) I just got this dermal roller 4 days ago, and have used it every night since i got it....and already, i see a big difference!!! Even after the first night, my skin looked more rejuvinated. It does hurt mind you.. but for me, its not completely unbearable. Some people might want to get a numbing cream before trying it. The first night i tried to do my entire face, but quickly realized I&#x27;m not tough enough for the lip or eye area! (I might get a .5 needle length for those areas) I also go an Avalon Organics Vitamin C serum to pair with this tool, and its quite lovely. I really feel that its getting deeper into my skin with this tool and that its doing a million times better than it would without it. I also just bought some Bio oil that Ill be trying out tonight after the C serum to really focus on those pock marks. I REALLY love this product, and Im so happy I bought it...I cant wait to see what my face will look like in another couple weeks!! And a little advice for my large pore&#x27;d sisters...I used this on my nose and upper cheeks (where my pores are pretty big, and have a few blackheads as well) and the next day i had a few little bumps. I think it might be from a needle going into a plugged pore or something, but im not completely sure. So now Im just using it on the sides of my face where my scars are. Hope this helps, and if you decide to get this, I hope it does the same wonders for your skin!!        UPDATE: PLEASE READ!!!  The dermaroller is great, but buy from a different seller, or get the wooden model!!!!! I am on my second dermaroller which I had only had for less than a month because my first one had broken without cause, and I went to use it tonight, and the plastic handle is completely shattered, just like my first one!!! When my first one broke, I thought it might have been just a fault in that particular roller...but now I know its simply this awful product! I have never dropped it, used it roughly, (in fact, I handle it with more care than anything else I own for fear of damaging the needles) and I keep it on the very top shelf of my bathroom so my animals cant get to it. I don&#x27;t know if the plastic is disenigrating or what, but they need to fix this problem or take it off the market. I could have just seriously hurt myself, and I really hope no one else does because of this cheap ass product. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase coz my first one fell and the needles were bended., i use it twice a week before i go to sleep for my acne scars then id apply vitamin E., u shouldn&#x27;t press hard while rolling and u should stretch the skin ur rolling on specially if it was for scars and lines., i do get dots of blood and my face gets really reddish but the next day it looks ok.. ive been using it for three weeks now and i do notice that my scars r less deep., i read that dramatic results would show on week 12.. gd luck ;)</li>
    <li> I spent hours researching various products. None of them seemed as promising as thins one. I found plenty of information that said that there is no way to get rid of stretchmarks. I figured for the price it was worth a shot. I used the product for a few weeks and forgot about it but the next month I was getting dressed and realized it hag significantly reduced the appearance of my stretchmarks, also the skin seemed a little less wrinkly.</li>
    <li> Good product! I like that the needles  are fine and thinner than others.. Wished it had more needles in it...</li>
    <li> I received this promptly and a good seller.  I was afraid to use it at first because the needles scared me and other reviews said the popping noise was heard when the needle went into the skin.  I was pleasantly surprized that it was not bad at all.  I try to use mine every three days but don&#x27;t manage to do it.  I don&#x27;t know that there is any change in the months since I got it but there is always hope.</li>
    <li> I have tried it a couple times...forehead area&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I like it yet. Don&#x27;t really see how results last. Initially skin just seems fuller from puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly if I use it more but it&#x27;s a little uncomrtable and awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I were more familiar w procedure, I&#x27;d like better?!?!</li>
    <li> So far I love the dermaroller!I have used a few times on my face now and the results are really good. I have suken in scars on my face which are just horrible from acne as a teenager, and no matter what i&#x27;ve used in the past (dermabrasion, all kinds of peels and products) nothing has ever made a differnce. But I will say the dermaroller (after about 4 uses) has definitely minimized the depth of my scars, and the redness.  I feel much more confident now and will keep using the dermaroller as I&#x27;ve heard results  in the long run are amazing. I use the dermaroller on my face once a week, to give it some healing time in between uses, and so far this is working pretty well for me, my face always looks like its glowing the next day!  The pain is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading other reviews, but I do have to stop and take a breath after a few rolls as it definitely isn&#x27;t without some pain. My face is red after  use, but that usually goes away in an hour or so.  Also  I have just started using for my cellulite on my legs and so far no real difference there, but have only used it twice on that,so maybe some updates in the future.  Overall I am so glad I discovered this product and definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Just received item....promptly!  Excited to see dynamic results.  Simple to use.  Get the great results of a professional facial right at home!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have been using for almost a month. And seeing a difference in my stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> I read that this hurts a lot before you buy it. They weren&#x27;t lying! It&#x27;s not terrible. If you have moderate or high pain tolerance it is completely bearable and WORTH IT. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and you will have to be disciplined and use it at least once a week. You can use it 3 times a week, MAX, but it must be with lighter pressure. 1.5mm is only recommended for those with large pores and boxcar scarring. If you&#x27;re using it for wrinkles or minimal scarring, I recommend buying a shorter needle. Also, there is another brand that has many more needles than this product. I would definitely search first before going for this exact roller. I also experienced the squeaky noises.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product at first but after reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and I can honestly say that I am starting to see positive results from it&#x27;s use.  It does hurt a little when you first start rolling it but you get used to it after a minute or so.  I had developed a couple of large pores that seemed to keep getting larger but once I started using this roller they have diminished greatly in size.  Also, my fine lines and sun damaged areas are starting to look better and better with use.  I have been using the roller around 3 times a week and then apply a copper peptide serum and moisturizer after use for maximum absorption.  This is probably best used at night as in my case it will turn your face red like a minor sunburn.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Im not really sure if I saw any improvements with the use of this, but after I use it, it does feel like its doing something. It tingles and gets red, like blood is rushing to the area, but there is no pain or discomfort. It makes a strange popping noise when used on my head but you do get used to it. Very well built and price is perfect .</li>
    <li> Hard to say if this product alone if this product did any help but with a college in cream I ordered on here it work miracles. I got mines back in September and my face looks a lot better and clearer then he used to</li>
    <li> I gained too much weight with my first pregnancy 7 years ago which resulted in stretch marks on my belly and thighs. After using this for a week and a half about every other day I can see the fine stretch marks on my thighs start to disappear and the larger ones on my belly are starting to fill in!!! It doesn&#x27;t hurt all the much during the rolling process but it does feel like a sunburn once you are done.</li>
    <li> I know these things work, because I have read many reviews. However, I am not a pro at it yet. Therefore, I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star. I need to learn how to use it better. I know it seems simple to some who haven&#x27;t tried. I just recently bought some numbing cream, so I hope that will help the process. I also bought a dermastamp, because I feel like that is better to target areas.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical wether I should buy it or not but after only 3 days my scar was showing great improvement! I would&#x27;ve never thought I would be another Dermaroller user to get amazing results, a little pinching feeling but definently worth it, love it.</li>
    <li> I love the roller.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it gets rid of wrinkles but it does improve circulation.  Don&#x27;t use it every night.  3-4 times/week max.</li>
    <li> Should use it more often but I do like it so far.. I will post another review when I get into the habit of it and see (or don&#x27;t see) results..</li>
    <li> They deliver what they promise. The ones giving bad reviews just don&#x27;t know how to use it. No, you don&#x27;t use this every day, not even once a week. This is 1.5 mm the biggest you can usemon the face, use with carefulness, and let the face rr0est at least 2 weeks, better if 3</li>
    <li> This is a great product, i only regret that I didn&#x27;t get the numbing cream to go with this. Otherwise, it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> got the tool on time and packed safely.. works just as expected, excellently :)&lt;br /&gt;light weight and smooth finishing surface, not like the cheap replicas.</li>
    <li> This item does just what it is suppose to.  It&#x27;s a bit painful until you get used to the treatment, but it does wonders for smoothing the years away.  I use about once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> My face had been clear, and I broke out after using this. I followed the instructions. My face hasn&#x27;t been clear since I used it. It might work for some people, but for me it just gave my face more area to break out in .</li>
    <li> I religiously derma-rolled my skin 5 days a week for 6 weeks.  I used a vitamin C serum after each use so that it could be better absored after puncturing my face.  I saw no improvement with fine lines - in fact, my skin started looking worse than prior to using derma roller.  It is very uncomfortable - heck, it&#x27;s outright painful.  I wish I could give this product 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this dermaroller! The day I got it I was so anxious to use it. It&#x27;s true that you do feel it when using the dermaroller, but it really just feels like someone with rough hands has been repeatedly rubbing their hand against you; it&#x27;s a nuisance, but you get used to it. After the first use though, it felt like I had a carpet burn on my side; this didn&#x27;t happen any other times, just the first time. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed a significant improvement in my stretch marks. Anyone thinking about buying this: just do it, buy it, because it performs miracles. (lol)</li>
    <li> I found that the 1.50mm is quite harsh. Your face, if you use it will peal for a couple days. Would suggest you use a skin exfoliator to remove dead skin. Would suggest the use of a numming agent before using your Microneedle,better if done before bed. Use a good moisturiser after use.</li>
    <li> I used the microneedle for two weeks now and I see major difference. I have huge pores and by using this it has significantly made my pores smaller. I recommend to put vitamin C after using the microneedle to have better results.</li>
    <li> I just got my derma roller, so I can&#x27;t rate the results of it yet...will do soon. The purpose of my comment right now is to confirm something for those of you who are undecided about this product due to the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; issue. I&#x27;m confirming that YES, it does hurt. No it is NOT painless. Is it excruciating pain? Nah. I&#x27;ve had 2 babies, naturally. I know what pain is, ha ha. It&#x27;s nothing like that. Bottom line, it&#x27;s not painLESS like some companies are claiming. I wanted to clear that up because it&#x27;s false advertisement. As far as it being tolerable/intolerable...I think it&#x27;s going to highly depend on the person. I don&#x27;t like pain, but I&#x27;m gonna keep using it. Here&#x27;s what it feels like- a bunch of tiny needles poking your face!! It feels exactly how you think it would feel. Anyway, hope this clears up the pain question for someone :)</li>
    <li> I bought this micro needling product to help with sun damage and scaring.I have only used it twice,and I have noticed my pores are getting smaller and my skin is getting firmer.I also noticed that the frown lines between my eyes are diminishing. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was extremely fast and the packaging was perfect so product arrived undamaged. I&#x27;ve only used it once and used on back of arms, my hips, and a few other places where I have stretch marks and minimal scaring. I did not buy topical cream, so I was a little tentative to just go in for the kill. With that being said, maybe I&#x27;m just crazy or not doing it right but I actually thought it tickled. Especially on the backs of my arms and thighs. Maybe I&#x27;m not pressing hard enough but it said light pressure and my skin was red afterwards like its supposed to be. I dunno, either way I am excited to see results if there will be any.</li>
    <li> Do not use on your face please. I had a rash covering my entire face for two weeks. Okay for body, like your thigh.</li>
    <li> I was super sceptical about this product. I mean, how puncturing your face possibly can eraze wrinkles or other imperfections.... right? Wrong. First of all, it does hurt. There is no question about that. So for that very reason, I try to do it as quick as possibe. But my point is, that it does work. After I used it the first time, my face was feeling like after a bad sun burn, but it went away pretty quickly. Due to having some sun damage on my face I was applying [...] (which I love) right over it for the night time. But the most impressive thing was that I could see results not after 2-3 weeks but literally like 3 days. I admit, I am not a person who reads directions or sticks with them too much (out of desperation I guess), so I was using it every day for 3 days and the result I saw, was remarkable. Not only my lines were smoother and not so prominent, but my brown spots were clearly lighter. So far I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Great product to use. I see a definite improvement in my skin everytime I use it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. My skin definitely burns after the treatment, but looks amazing 12 hours later!</li>
    <li> when I first brought it and used it, I do admit it made my skin softer. Sometimes it made the acne scars heal a bit faster. However, I brought this because I had a hyper-pigmented bumpy scar that never disappeared for YEARS on my face! I hoped that it would help but to my disappointment, there was no difference.   It hurts, especially when I&#x27;m rolling it around the corner of my nose and the side of my nose. It left my face all red for hours.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old, Mexican American female living in Arizona, I have acne prone skin during that time of the month (mostly around my chin which never seems to fully evolve but ends up leaving annoying little brown spots on my chin area) and some scarring from acne from when I was a teenager mostly on my temples and some hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my DermaRoller a few days ago and at first I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try it on my face so I needled my inner thigh to get familiar with the process and to understand what kind of pain might be associated from the needling.  I did NOT use any form of topical anesthetic and at first it DID NOT HURT.  Unfortunately, as the night went on I felt like I had a bad sunburn and I decided to ice my thigh.  I did not see any difference on my thigh but I really don&#x27;t have a problem area there.  This past summer I backpacked through Europe and was exposed to the sun A LOT!  I tried to do my best about sunblock but by the end of the summer I noticed my first THREE fine lines on my forehead.  Now every time I wash my face I see them and it really concerned me since I am still a young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I tried a Glycolic Acid peel to help with the discoloration and fine lines.  I saw a small improvement on my skin and pore size but I wanted more dramatic results.  I decided to order the DermaRoller.  Last night I tried the DermaRoller on my face.  Before using the roller I washed my face then used a cotton pad to go over my face with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol.  I started with my forehead and proceeded to the skin between my eyes just above my nose where I noticed a fine line from squinting.  I waited a bit because my face was really stinging and feeling like a sunburn and then I proceeded to do the rest of my face.  I must say that it was UNCOMFORTABLE for me all night because my face felt like it was on fire.  I told myself that it BETTER produce results or it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.  I went over my face with a second wipe of Isopropyl Alcohol to remove any of the small blood droplets that the needling had produced.  I washed my face with the Mary Kay TimeWise cleanser and followed up with the Mary Kay TimeWise Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning when I woke up my face was shiny but not greasy.  I went and STARED CLOSELY at my forehead and to my surprise one of the fine wrinkles on my forehead had ALMOST COMPLETELY disappeared while the other ones were also less visible.  My face feels tighter and plumper in a way.  My cheeks are still a little pink but it mostly looks like I am blushing.  My face still feels sensitive this afternoon after nearly 15 hours of completing the treatment.  I will wait 2 days before doing it again.  I am EXCITED to see the results as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it was UNCOMFORTABLE and made my skin feel sensitive, I believe that if you used a topical anesthetic before needling you wouldn&#x27;t feel as much discomfort.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I will update my review as I continue with the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  I decided to use the derma roller on stretch marks I had on my breasts since puberty when I hit a growth spurt.  I only used it on my left breast and I didn&#x27;t touch my right one.  The stretch marks were similar to begin with so I thought it would be a fair comparison.  I only did it once about 2 weeks ago and didn&#x27;t do it again.  My skin was very sensitive and it felt like a sunburn.  Today when I got out of the shower I NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE!  The stretch marks have definitely faded to a noticeable degree.  I asked my sister to look and she right away noticed the difference.  I am very pleased and have now tried it on BOTH breasts tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have stopped treating my stretch marks I still see a noticeable difference on the marks I had on my breasts and even the ones I had on my tummy.  They are not completely gone but theyare smoother and less noticeable.  I was brave tonight and I did some needling on my face.  I feel that since I know the feeling now I am more tolerant of the discomfort.  My face looks red but it is also glowing.  I am experimenting once again and I am only going to needle one side of my face and keep track of improvements.  I hope this update helps!</li>
    <li> I have scars left by acne I had because of some medication a few years ago. In the past two years, I have had 2 chemical peels, two microdermabrasions, three Fraxels, and one laser facial resurfacing at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. These came out to around $4,000. I figured for the price, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this.  I used it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for two weeks. I already see a slight difference. My one deep scar isn&#x27;t as deep, and the shallow ones are definitely fading. I used to be able to really notice the deep one, even when wearing makeup, but now I can barely see it with makeup.   It does hurt a little, but if you&#x27;ve ever had a Fraxel, it&#x27;s nothing compared to that. I use Lidocane gel to numb it a little before I use it, and then after use I use a Vitamin E liquid from a pharmacy.</li>
    <li> If used diligently, works great with forehead 11 lines and wrinkles.  I would recommend as long as your skin isn&#x27;t too mature.</li>
    <li> I think reviews are very important for these things.  I love this product!  I ordered this for my first dermaroller. I was skeptical at first, but the results have been amazing!  The \\&quot;eleven\\&quot; lines, or frown lines in between my eyes are almost completely gone. I have read conflicting information about dermarolling this area. Some Dr&#x27;s said dermarolling would not have any impact on frown lines,  but I swear it has.  I have rolled twice,  maybe 3 times. My completion is great.  The product arrived on time, and was neatly packaged. It came in a very convenient plastic case ,that keeps the needles safe. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I anticipated,  I do not use any numbing cream. It is very easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading extensively about the potential benefits of micro needling for scars. I am sort of in a unique situation because I was using this for a hypertrophic burn scar. I used this a few times separated by about a week or so, and I really don&#x27;t think it did much of anything. It flattened the scar out a small amount but its hard for me to know if that was from the microneedling or the silicon gel sheets I had on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have decided to get laser surgery to help the scar using IPL and Genesis lasering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone else in getting rid of skin conditions!</li>
    <li> I do like how plump my face looks in the morning when i use this at night. I haven&#x27;t seen any major fading of my scars but hey i&#x27;ve only used it 3 times...i use it every two weeks. Hopefully i get better results but pleased to have bought it.</li>
    <li> t here it was dark gray, so I opened it up and the little grate was cocked in sideways and spilled every where, so I fixed it half way and then clumps came out. very disappointed, I had been pleased with this product before but I can&#x27;t afford to spend on faulty workmanship plus what a hassel to pay and ship back which pleases you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my belly stretch marks for just over two months, but have only used it regularly (every other day) for a couple of weeks.  I had my baby over 21 years ago, and have had stretch marks all this time.  They were never horrific, but after recent weight loss they were much more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased and quite surprised at the drastic improvement in such a short time frame!  The depth has decreased and the color is more natural, more matching the surrounding skin.  They look at least 50% better.  I feel confident that with regular use over the next few months, they will so much improved that they will become a non-issue.  I am not kidding here, folks, there is a very noticeable and delightful improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lesser sized version of this for the face, but find it pretty painful, so haven&#x27;t gone \\&quot;full steam ahead\\&quot; with that, but I am able to use it on the frown lines between my eyebrows, hoping to see some change there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to improve the appearance of marks on your belly, I think you will be quite pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Not sure that it&#x27;s doing anything. I bought this hoping that it would help with acne scars. It does make your skin feel tighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and cannot believe the results already.  I&#x27;ve got a significant amount of mildly deep scars on my cheeks, along with raised, red scars in the same spots, both from acne throughout the years.  The scars are, at oldest, about 6 years.  I&#x27;ve used the roller every other night per the instructions that are included, and then follow that with a copper peptide serum from devita rx to help with the collagen production.      I consider myself to have a very high pain tolerance, so I was (probably foolishly) surprised by how much it did hurt at first.  After the first couple of uses, though, I&#x27;ve gotten much more efficient at the motion of the roller and the process goes a lot quicker.  I just use a little bit of pressure, not too much to draw a lot of blood, however there have been a couple spots with tiny pricks of blood after I&#x27;ve used it.  My face feels and looks like it&#x27;s gotten sunburned for maybe up to an hour afterwards, but after awhile this goes away.  Be sure not to wear makeup for at least 12 hours afterwards so that you&#x27;re not clogging your pores and adding any bacteria into the mix while your skin is in such a fragile open state.  I have noticed over the last couple of days that my skin has gotten a little rough in the areas that I&#x27;ve been using the roller, but this is just the skin going through a healing process and starting to slough away the old stuff.  I expect this to subside as I continue to use the roller.      I can notice a difference already, within ONE week of using this device every other day.  Obviously, it&#x27;s not a drastic change so early in the game, but it&#x27;s more than I&#x27;ve ever seen with anything else, including bi-weekly professional microdermabrasion sessions for over a year.  The biggest difference so far has been with the sunken-in scars.  It&#x27;s truly remarkable, and I hope to continue to see improvements as I go along with the treatments.    If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this product, I absolutely recommend it to you.  Chances are, if you are willing to use something like this to help with whatever skin condition you&#x27;re worried about, you&#x27;ve tried other products in the past that were maybe expensive and probably didn&#x27;t work as well as you&#x27;d have liked them to.  I really felt at this point that I had nothing to lose, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to go for it.  I&#x27;m employed in the beauty industry and spend hundreds of dollars every couple months on expensive products, take pristine care of my skin, and have had tons of various procedures and intensive peels to try to help the problem.  NOTHING has worked like this for me, ever.  I was a skeptic but am now truly amazed!</li>
    <li> This derma roller has many versitle uses on skin and hair. It is very convenient and you can use at home, although if you want the best results, you would need to buy other skin care products like vitamin c lotion and vitamin e lotion. The directions to use this, was very simple and easy to understand. Other people who have used this product, say that it does not hurt at all. From my experience, even with slight pressure using the derma rolla, it can hurt or sting a little bit, but with in time, it gets easier and you will get use to the pain. It&#x27;s like plucking your eyebrows for the first time and as keep plucking them with in time, the pain is gone. Overall, this product was useful. Here is the catch though, if you are not determined to use this product 2 to 3 times a week, following with the other instructions included, the results will vary. It depends how much you put in it, in order to have great results.</li>
    <li> This product warranted a review due to the quality of the product &amp; outstanding customer service! It arrived in Hawaii 3 days after placing my order nicely packed &amp; in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the roller 3x &#x27;s per week, for 3 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results yet, but that&#x27;s understandable as it&#x27;s a process that can&#x27;t be rushed!&lt;br /&gt;At 54, I don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight ....but After doing tons of research &amp; speaking to a certified plastic surgeon.. I do believe that with continued use, a healthy diet, a great anti-aging skin care regime, &amp; exercise, I will receive the results I&#x27;m expecting! I&#x27;ve taken before/after photos with each use &amp; will do a comparison in 3 months. I think the best advice I could share is to be sure to sanitize your roller before &amp; after each use! Keep your treatment area clean...&amp; have realistic expectations! Nothing can compare to cosmetic surgery or enhancements (fillers/Botox) but, you can help improve the quality of your skin &amp; reduce some of the damage inflicted on your skin over the years.&lt;br /&gt;As for my skincare regime of choice, I use  Rodan &amp; Field&#x27;s &amp;#34;Redefine&amp;#34; why? Because it actually delivers on their promises! It WORKS! So much so, I became a consultant!&lt;br /&gt;Wishing everyone outstanding results! Happy rolling!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to write a review but I believe I&#x27;m seeing a little bit of improvement in my skin. It definitely feels tighter and my forehead looks smoother. I can&#x27;t really say much for my acne scars on my cheeks but I hope to see improvement. The needle doesn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s annoying....I use a vitamin c serum after the skin session and my skin looks better after a few days. I recommend not using this if you have to go somewhere the next day because your face will be red...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/13/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 6 months since I bought this product. It wasn&#x27;t until 4 months later that I really noticed that my skin looked better than I remembered. My acne scars (dented and ice pick) look more leveled and less visible. I take fish oil, zinc, and multi vitamin everyday. It&#x27;s a long repair process but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I wish I had pictures. This is no quick fix product. it takes TIME....</li>
    <li> I first got this product because my esthetician told me about it and said she would like me to come in for her to do some intense-sounding sessions of micro-needling to help with some scarring created from a different treatment she had tried on me. She advised me to take a Valium before I came in for it and told me she would need to apply a topical numbing cream. I did some research to see what exactly it was because it freaked me out a bit; and saw that I could do it at home, myself, with a less intense option. Most of the things I read about said that you can do it up to 5 days a week, with slight pressure, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or draw blood. I have to say...it does hurt; and I have a really high pain tolerence. And it does draw blood on ocassion although very slight and not enough to even cause scabbing (and probably just because of my scarring and the thickened skin that has to be broken up). It isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling treatment I&#x27;ve ever done to my skin and immediately after it feels and looks like I have a sunburn...  However, with that being said; I love it. My skin feels great and looks better every time I use it. If you can get past the discomfort, it&#x27;s worth it. It makes my skin feel tighter and it has never been clearer for the length of time that it has been since I started using this microneedle. I haven&#x27;t had to wear coverup on any blemishes since I started using it which is amazing for me. It hasn&#x27;t made any major differences yet on my scarring but it is still early in the process for me. I have a feeling for the scarring, if you want faster results, you might have to do the professional route which can be expensive and intense. But for the look and feel of my skin, nothing has worked better! I plan on continue to use it for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in conjuction with Retin-A, three months ago. The results have greatly exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The roller is made of needles, so it&#x27;s going to take some getting used too, but after you start, it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rolled pretty aggressively, and not so aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you roll pretty aggressively, you will probley need to stay away from the sun and downtime is longer. IE. Your face will become inflammed, since I apply Retin-A after rolling. This will become dry, I find Calendra Oil to be the best moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Rolling aggessively also makes your skin very red and sensitive. I wait about two days and then I really like&lt;br /&gt;Origins, Never A Dull Moment face peel in the shower. You face will be like glass. MOISTURIZE with good quality&lt;br /&gt;face oil, again, I like Calendra Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you roll, it will take approx. 10 days to look \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I tend to roll two or three times a week. My schedule allows more downtime than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my results are smoother texture, I roll up into the hairline, so I feel I have had some slight lift, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews are from Women, but I also recommend the if you use Retin-A, use it with a heavier hand than suggested by/for Women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our skin is thicker and we have hair for it to penetrate. I am not a Doctor, but this has been my experience for someone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help everyone.</li>
    <li> I have a series of atrophic acne scars on my face and I have been using this medieval torture instrument since October 2011, after three treatments at my dermatologist. At first I was optimistic (but realistic), but after many months of use, my optimism gradually vanished. I was using it once in 2-3 weeks, then once a week, but after more than 20 bloody, painful treatments, when rivers of blood were dropping from my face, the effect was negligible. Some mild athropic scars improved, but the deepest ones remained virtually the same, and with the current pace of \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;, it would take several years, until I saw some significant change. This is not worthy of the pain and buying some masking creme would be more rational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue in the future, because I observed that during the first 1-2 weeks after the treatment, the skin is tighter and the scars are less visible, so when I go somewhere among people, it can help a bit (albeit only temporarily). Yet as a whole, it is a big disappointment. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles and you couldn&#x27;t say that I would lack endurance, but I don&#x27;t like doing stupid things that make no sense. And it&#x27;s been almost one year now. (And don&#x27;t tell me that I should have done bigger pauses between treatments; if it took 10-20 years to see any change, it would really be useless, because I would be a pensioner already.) Well, perhaps it could help against aging, but the effect on atrophic scars has been very, very limited.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing on stretch marks! It completely got rid of the red/ purple ones. I still have the stretch marks&#x27; scar but you can&#x27;t even tell unless you look extremely close. as far as old burn scars and hyper pigmentation, it didn&#x27;t work (maybe the needles need to be a different size) but I was so surprised that something worked so well for my stretch marks so 5 stars!</li>
    <li> honestly i don&#x27;t know how people can actually use it on their face, the needle is so thick it&#x27;s ridiculous.... i use it on my but for a acne scar, i feel it&#x27;s extremely painful , let alone use it on my face..</li>
    <li> The needles were bent on the first product I received, so I told the manufacturer and he sent me a 2 new ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products that claim to tighten skin, help with acne and scars.I&#x27;ve had collagen injected a few years back(Sculptra) it last up to two years. This product is great if you have the income to constantly  redo your treatments. Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;But after trying this product I know I won&#x27;t be doing sculptra. What I have collagen under my skinn is absorbing all the good creams I&#x27;m useing.&lt;br /&gt;This product not only helps any product Cream or serum get to where it needs to get under your skin. I&#x27;ve been useing this product now for 5 weeks ,I do once a week and I have seen quite a differance in my skin and fine lines, I have deeper lines in my forehead and they have  gone down at  least 50%, I also drink alot of water since I started this program. Lets get to the pain!!!! your forehead is one sensitive area. and depending on the person maybe you feel it more? I reccommend getting  a Topical anesthetic. Otherwise you won&#x27;t be doing it properly. Once a week seems enough for me.others may like to do more. but like anything it takes time to heal so give it a week ,cover your face with a good cream you like and make sure it has spf in it and keep applying cream . If your lucky to work at home. put a  good amount of cream on you face and rub it in or use a massager which I do . and then apply more cream  when its soaked in you will see a differance in your face. your skin will only obsorb so much at a time. Everytime I use this product and go out people come up to me and say you look great what are you doing your skin glows.I tell them . I have friends who are now just starting this, I gave them a let me show you how class,some liked it others didn&#x27;t like the pain so we numbed everyone up after the first ouch! all4 friends who I tried this on said there skin tingeled and felt like sunburn but otherwise it was ok .The very next day they called and said wow my skin feels  great looks great pores lessend,  my friends that partisipated are 34, 42,46,53, everyone liked the way there skin looked and felt this was there first time. imagine how they are going to feel in a couple of months. I &#x27;ve gone to my sculptra doctor and she was like you look great. what are you doing I told her and for $150 I could get it done in her office but i&#x27;d rather do it myself. and save the money and buy every few months another Microneedle and keep doing the routine. Like i said the only down side is some discomfort. so before you start numb it and go slow you don&#x27;t need to push down like your laying pavement! lol just take your time You will love the results I guarantee you that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had only good results and no irritation. Very easy to use and did not hurt when applying pressure. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i just been using this for 1 month; but i already see some slight positive changes to my skin.  all creams are better absorbed.  i use it for my hair loss as well (not noticeable changes there yet).  i bought the 1mm and i dont use any numb cream... i feel some pinches; but that&#x27;s all, no painful.  will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It really does help the get the product in your pores better and it also helps heal your scares and deeeep stretch marks I have only used it about three times spread out over 2 months time and every time the next day they looked even less visable and smaller.</li>
    <li> Started using this I&#x27;ve heard great things about how it can help absorbtion for Minoxidil and thus making it more effective. Ive used it about 4 times a week for the past couple weeks and everytime I use it I can feel the Minoxidil absorbing better. I have high hopes :)!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother it scared her and first use and made me bleed when taking it out of wrapping! If you like acupuncture feel free to buy but these are real, painful and I destroyed it after 1 use the needles fallout of massager at will be careful and avoid!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about dermorollers from my aesthetician. My first thought was \\&quot;really? how prickling your face can make you look younger?\\&quot; But I broke down and bought it. And let me tell you, there is definitely something about it. It hurts, it&#x27;s true, but I just brace myself and do it really fast. I had some rather deep lines on my forehead and that was my target zone to see if this would work. So I primarily worked on that area and applied my Hyaluronic acid serum afterwards. It says in instruction to use it once a week, but I wanted faster results and used it twice. By the end of the week my lines definitely improved. I guess no pain -no gain.</li>
    <li> A little painful to use, but its a roller full of needles, what else could I expect.  Appears to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this to ally minoxidol with and it really made a great difference. Saw about 30% increase in hair and I have been using minoxidol for 15 years. With this it really helps growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this. I tried it for the first time. I used it everyday for a few weeks straight. Saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Better results than any other derma pen  I&#x27;ve ever used! And I have used several ! Love love love</li>
    <li> Was really excited to try it out but so far no visible results. If i&#x27;d known this i honestly wouldn&#x27;t have order it.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with how fast the product arrived to my house! I was able to try it out immediately and found it wasn&#x27;t painful on my belly when used for stretch marks. It was more of a prickly feeling during and light sunburn feeling afterward. I cannot determine at this point if it will work because I haven&#x27;t had it for very long. I just wanted to reassure those who are concerned with whether or not it was painful because after reading some of the reviews about it, that was my concern.</li>
    <li> I have acne scars, so I&#x27;ve tried everything from peelings to laser treatment. This system is the most effective so far. Although I use it alternating with TCA peeling</li>
    <li> Well i have used it once a  week for two weeks so far and i see a huge difference in my stretch marks. i thought i would have to live with them the rest of my life but there is still hope. it only is uncomfortable for a day until the sunburn feeling goes away but well worth the rolling pain and the sunburn feeling pain.</li>
    <li> It really works for acne scars! I have been using microneedle to acne scars just one time per month and I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome seller! Great product and reasonable price. The case and instructions were very professional. Use it practically everyday. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It worked for a few times and then as other reviewers say, gets stuck. Wrst of all, it is so uncomfortable. And I am not even sure dermarollimg works for indented scars. It just causes microswelling and your scars looks improved for a day or two, but thats pretty much all it does. ot a permanent solution at all. I recently did a deep TCA chemical peel and it has improed my indented scars greatly.</li>
