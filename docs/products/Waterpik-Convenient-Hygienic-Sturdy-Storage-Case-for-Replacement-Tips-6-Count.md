<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great to have so many different tips to use</li>
    <li> I use to be on road all the time, so it is very usefull and hygirnic way to storage them.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Waterpik for my husband.  After trying it myself, I loved it and decided to purchase some extra tips for myself.  I just wish there were more variety than 2 of the same 3 tips.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this add-on helpful.  The original spray heads (come with the main Waterpik unit) do a fine job.  I threw this container in a drawer and have never used it once.  It does not snap on the main waterpik unit so may not be suited to laying around next to it (large and flat).</li>
    <li> These fit our waterpik perfectly. This was the best price, definatly worth it! Would buy it again if needed. Good value.</li>
    <li> My teeth are not &#x27;floss friendly&#x27; (too tight in places) so this works much better than flossing. Plus can add small amount of other things (i.e. baking soda, xylitol etc) into the water to help the teeth. I have used waterpiks for years; had to order this because when I moved, I inadvertently threw away the replacement tips because I had several from previous waterpiks and in my moving frenzy tossed with the older ones.</li>
    <li> There are two each of the three BEST Waterpik tips and a nice storage case. The price made buying the combination of tips and case together very reasonable. I highly recommend this product to all you \\&quot;pickers\\&quot; out there.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted. Super fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great to hold your extra pik heads. I keep mine in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because we needed additional tips for our Waterpik. I figured the storage case would be good for storing tips we don&#x27;t regularly use. However, I now use it as a travel case for my kids when they go on overnight visits at their dad&#x27;s house. Both my kids have braces and the Waterpik makes it so much easier for them to keep their teeth clean. I got them a portable one to take to their dad&#x27;s and they just put the tips in a baggie. By the time they got home after a weekend visit the tips were gross from sitting in a wet baggie for 3 days. I decided to try using this case instead and it has worked out great. It&#x27;s a much more hygienic way for them to temporarily store their tips. Long story short, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is great because I have 3 kids.  The waterpik came with one set of tips.  This gives you 2 more sets.  I just used nailpolish to change the color of one set of tips so each kid knows which are his.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> great deal for the money, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great accessory kit for traveling!</li>
    <li> However, I would have prefered a more diverse group of piks.  I bought my husband a waterpik for christmas (which he loved).  I wanted to get a set for myself, but this one only has 3 types (none really as cool as his) and dups of all three. - It&#x27;s a good beginner set I guess... but I will be searching for some of the better ones that came with his. I can&#x27;t complain about quality - look closely at the piks - if you want two of each of the basics - this is pefect for you.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Aquarius only holds two tips.  This is a must if multiple people will use the Waterpik or if you intend to use several types of tips.</li>
    <li> very convenient storage for the waterpik tips :)</li>
    <li> Love this for the extra tips I have for my tips...Made sturdy and is a must have if you have any extra tips</li>
    <li> I did a little research and found the following info:  tips can be used with: Ultra(WP-100), Kids (WP-260), Traveler (WP-300), Cordless Plus (WP-450) and Complete Care (WP-900).  Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if you could select which tips come in the kit?? :-)</li>
    <li> Just as described and works great!  This is great for a large family,  Keeps them in a clean case free from debri.</li>
    <li> My father buy the waterpik machine and this replacements I buy for able to use all my family. Its perfect for a good Hygienic bucal.</li>
    <li> Great deal and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The case is great. I was super excited to see the different tips that came inside the case. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the tips too.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the store - I gave the blue tipped ones to hubby, the white are mine.  It travels with us (along with our Water Pik).</li>
    <li> The case is sturdy and very handy. .</li>
    <li> Replacement piks in a handy case.</li>
    <li> this was a good deal unfortunately it did not fit my water pick model so I had to return the item.</li>
    <li> I know this review is for the replacement tips and the case in which they are stored.  It&#x27;s fine; it works.  More importantly though is the fantastic waterpik on which these are used.  My mouth has never been cleaner.  It&#x27;s amazing how much food is removed by using the waterpik even after having flossed and brushed.</li>
    <li> I have two &amp;#34;partials&amp;#34; and a bridge, and the ONLY thing which cleans out the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; underneath is a WaterPik.  Floss, shmoss, this thing WORKS, and, if you add a little mouthwash to the reservoir, it really cleanses your mouth, getting the little bits your brush missed.  Buy it.  Use it.  Remember, any kind of &amp;#34;falsie&amp;#34; can NEVER match the real thing.</li>
    <li> Love the case they came in great for traveling and the work great with my waterpick!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Packaged well. Shipped fast. Very good value.</li>
    <li> Convenient! And a great storage to keep all your waterpik attachment. Not too bulky, saves space in my med. cabinet.</li>
    <li> We purchased these to go with our new water pic.  Having all the tools you need to keep your mouth and gums clean and healthy in one place is awesome.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by his water pik so I got some additional replacement tips and keep mine separate for my use.  Thank you...</li>
    <li> Great replacements for my waterpik</li>
    <li> A great way  to store WaterPik attachments.  I was also pleased when it arrived to find that it was not JUST a storage case, but also came with an assortment of WaterPik attachments.  A nice Plus.... Only thing I would wish for is to be able to get just the storage case without the extra tips since I was looking for a way to cleanly store the attachments that came with my WaterPik Cleaning System.</li>
    <li> Great for storage of attachments</li>
    <li> Very handy way to keep the family piks organized and neatly tucked away.</li>
    <li> Lost my original attachments. They fit and more economical you get likr six attachments.</li>
    <li> The box is perfect for storing my tips neatly, a big plus for me!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted-the opportunity to try the different tip without having to look everywhere to make sure we had the correct model number.  Just so easy!</li>
    <li> Love this, it was just what I wanted.  I use my waterpik twice a day and need to keep acessories available.</li>
    <li> I was surprised after receiving the waterpick brushes how much they remove items that the toothbrush does not reach.</li>
    <li> It contains really needed items, that we use frequently. They are 3 sets and paired with different color. So it was easy for me and my husband to divide for each other, like I take white ones and hubby blue.</li>
    <li> good replacement tips for your waterpik!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  It was a nice case but the pic I needed was not in it so now I am still looking for the kind I need.</li>
    <li> Great deal nd works like its suppose too. Very sturdy and swivels easily while in use making it very efficient.</li>
    <li> Great price and I like the storage case.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of heads.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the piks!</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of tips. Doesn&#x27;t include one or two that come with massager, but doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this extra set of piks with the storage case. This set of piks does not come with the pik pocket flosser though.</li>
    <li> I needed extras and even though it only had the same three; I still love it, I will recommend this so anyone.</li>
    <li> thx! I bought in KOREA, delivered in good condition!</li>
    <li> Works just fine for storage of the picks</li>
    <li> Good for spare parts.</li>
    <li> Am sold on this product.  Never used waterpic before, but I am very pleased with the product and each tip has its own function.  I am a clean nut and this product meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is very functional, seems sturdy enough, but I wonder if it would hold up in a suitcase while traveling and being subject to airline baggage handlers. If packed well, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  And with space to hold six different &amp;#34;piks,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s very handy.  I&#x27;d buy another one if I needed to.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an extra set of attachments for my wife to use. The case looks the same as what comes with the flosser when new. This kit does not have the large brush attachment that most people would use most often. Most of the the attachments in this kit she does not use. I would trade all of the attachments in this kit for one brush attachment.</li>
    <li> worked great thank you.</li>
    <li> nice wish it had the small orthodontic pik</li>
    <li> This is a wonerful product. Unfortunately it was the wrong size for my waterpik Flosser. Seller was wonderful.</li>
    <li> nice amount of replacement water pik heads for the price. We customized ours with little vinyl stickers so the whole family can use the waterpik.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what a family needs for each person, then know ones tips get used by someone else. Great product.</li>
    <li> great storage item for your tips.  and a real bargain considering the cost of purchasing extra tips separately.  stores neatly in a medicine cabinet too.</li>
    <li> Double of the most commonly used pik types. I&#x27;ve found it very handy and the case is very sturdy. I was surprised at the quality too. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome set and you can use whichever one you thinks works the best for you.  Beware, when you first start using it you&#x27;re going to get wet!  I would recommend this kit to everyone that buys a waterpik.</li>
    <li> good  tips for water pick</li>
    <li> I love that this is easy to store and holds multiple tips, plus it came with replacement tips too.  I definitely won&#x27;t need to be buying any new tips anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Allows my husband and I to have access to our waterpic without cross contamimation. Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived with out it.</li>
    <li> Good really recommend as it keeps tips clean and protected</li>
    <li> nice to pack with us and just what we needed</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Waterpik Ultra Flosser and my children wanted to be able use it but didnt have enough tips for everyone.  This is perfect, I purchased 2 so they each have their own now.  Very convenient!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband to use the waterpik after he saw how much I really loved mine. My waterpik has helped firm up my gums that were giving me problems being so sensitive.  They really work at keeping your mouth feeling clean!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Case with 3 different kinds if Piks and a pair of replacement Blue Low Pressure tips.  I had misplaced (lost) the blue ones.  I swapped out the blue ones for the Denture Cleaning Piks - no dentures..  Now none of the piks get lost, and I&#x27;ve grown fond of the Plack Brush pik.  it works quite well.  I still use the Blue tips when I have some sore gums.</li>
    <li> This is value for money! 6 tips and a storage case for $20.&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little too flimsy. It might not last long, but it beats placing the tips haphazardly on the kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> I appreciate customer reviews on most Amazon products.  I have used them to decide whether or not to purchase some items.  But a review on Waterpik tips?  Of course I love them, and am satisfied with the purchase!  They work just as well as the original tips that came with my Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I do like the storage case, and appreciate the variety of tips.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case, nice assortment of tips. Does not fit the Waterpik Classic or any model under WP-100. Like a fool I was so excited to get this that I tore the package open and now am stuck for the purchase. Perhaps another project for my Dremel. Sigh. I still want the tips, it is just that it will take a bit of technology to make them work with my machine. I assumed that all Waterpik tips fit all Waterpik devices. Not so.</li>
    <li> I guess these are the three tips that Water-Pik felt would be most commonly used. The tips are the angled one with the narrow tip, the one with three small sets of long bristles, and the one where the tip is completely surrounded by bristles. You get a pair of each, and they all work great. They are also color-coded in two sets (ours are white and blue).</li>
    <li> Bought this as a spare....</li>
    <li> On Off switch on handle is almost impossible to work do to stiffness,&lt;br /&gt;Even my dentist complains about his.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great value, quality just as expected from waterpik.  Comes with 6 very useful tips and I will buy again once we&#x27;re due for new ones.</li>
    <li> Handy little case, it helps keep everything stored nicely!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to my friends, it keeps your teeth healthy and clean.  I really like it a lot</li>
    <li> Since we have 3 users for our waterpik system I got everyone their own set of tips...the case is perfect for storing and keeping the tips protected! Plus, I labeled each one with our kids name so they wouldn&#x27;t mix them up or complain someone used their tips!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy, I hope this Storage case will prevent the picks from breaking while travaling</li>
    <li> Convenient for storage. The opening and handling are good. Access to accessories is easy. I recommend this item. Best regards</li>
    <li> love it bought as a gift my wife uses twice a day</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised. The component that come with the case are of quality construction and work well with the water pik. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace some of my Waterpik cleaning heads and found this set.  I think it is a great value and like that it comes in a case to keep them cleaner.</li>
    <li> I thought it was just a case to hold piks but it includes several pics, a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> This was reasonably priced for an assortment of tips for our Waterpik device. We enjoy using a variety of tips, not just the jet tip.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected, nice look, hard case, strong against falls, and pretty&lt;br /&gt;As described and comfortable for your teeth.</li>
    <li> For what you&#x27;d pay for just four tips if purchased separately, you get a case with six tips. It&#x27;s a no-brainer. It&#x27;s nice to get two of the most commonly used tips, especially if you share the WaterPik with a spouse.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product to use</li>
