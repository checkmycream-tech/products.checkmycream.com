      <li>sephora even gives you a free mini makeover.</li>
      <li>the box can literally fit in the palm of your hand and you can get free samples from Ulta</li>
      <li>Love, love ,love bare minerals!</li>
      <li>They are small but the perfect size to stick in the purse or travel.</li>
      <li>The product is great but the size of the containers isn&#x27;t what my wife expected.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten a starter kit before from Macy&#x27;s, and it was full sized items with full sized brushes.</li>
      <li>Light and stays on and makes me feel pretty.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals is a great product but the size of the pods were much smaller than they lead you to believe..</li>

      <li>Very natural looking and light on the skin.</li>
      <li>I went to Ulta and found the right product, which includes more items for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used bareMinerals products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had pretty skin</li>
      <li>The products are light yet covers well and makes my complexion look young.  </li>
      <li>She can go to our local mall and by the starter kit for about $15 more and the containers are five times the size.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>All stores which carry bare mineral makeup should color match you for free.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have average complexion--nothing troublesome to cover, however after application I looked like I had no makeup on</li>
      <li>but the product runs out too fast</li>
      <li>Products are decent, but what a rip off.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the same thing, but what came was 3 teeny tiny sample sized products that I could&#x27;ve gotten for free at a make up</li>
      <li>Item was smaller than expected but am satisfied.</li>
      <li>Got it earlier than expected, was what I had expected and the product is good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY purchasing this product.  </li>
      <li>When I realized my supply was running low and didn&#x27;t have time to stop by the store I decided to browse my Amazon Prime fast shipping options.  </li>
      <li>It will really last you about one month depending on how much coverage you want.</li>
      <li>but, maybe that&#x27;s a technique problem on my part-I&#x27;m new to bare minierals.</li>
      <li>I was able to go to my local Ulta Store and get this product in a hard case and in bigger product sizes for $49 well worth the extra $9.</li>
      <li>You barely get any product, I realize it is a starter kit, but you don&#x27;t really get enough to judge it</li>
      <li>I usually burn threw makeup so fast that within a few weeks I find myself having to go back to the beauty store to get more.</li>
      <li>I made the switch to Bare Minerals and will never leave.</li>

<li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a whole work day (mind you</li>
<li> Much much smaller than what I expected for the price.</li>
<li> Delivery on date specified, however I felt it took too long.</li>
<li> Not sure if this is normal or something that happened during processing.</li>
<li> Much smaller than expected!</li>
<li> Well a month and a half later</li>
<li> I have to admit I was skeptical of using bare minerals because it didn&#x27;t look like much.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t use very much so it is too expensive for what you get.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how this could be considered the 30 day starter pack when the box barely holds a few products.  </li>
<li> I was not pleased with this purchase as I felt the size of the products were very small and the price was a bit high.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>

<li> They are very small as in mini sizes, I was expecting a bit bigger size!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
<li> doesnt feel heavy.</li>
<li> Quite disappointed in that especially for the big amount I paid :/&lt;br</li>
<li> Ridiculously small sizes for the money!  </li>
<li> Very small containers, but will give it another chance</li>
<li> What was really annoying is that on the package it was clearly marked $22 and they sold it to me for $35 something?</li>
<li> I have been using BareMinerals for almost 2 years now and I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; for the price I was paying, I was getting what I would get from Ulta but living out in the sticks now, unable to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
<li> Also, I was giving this item as a gift for an exchange and the box looked like someone had kicked it around for hours and was badly beat up.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Deeply disappointed.</li>
<li> but when I opened the package, I was disappointed on the sizing.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with the quantity for the price.</li>
<li> The color and coverage were horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as magical as advertised. Very small containers, but will give it another chance</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Buy the larger kit instead.</li>
    <li> Tiny sample package. Definitely not worth the price. The color and coverage were horrible.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item, it did arrived on time but when I opened the package, I was disappointed on the sizing. They are very small as in mini sizes, I was expecting a bit bigger size! It doesn&#x27;t look like a miniature size on the pictures. I did not want to pay $35 for this so I returned it for a refund. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love bareminerals that&#x27;s why I ordered this product but I didn&#x27;t read the part that say SAMPLE SIZE or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this. the box can literally fit in the palm of your hand and you can get free samples from Ulta</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used bareMinerals products.  The products are light yet covers well and makes my complexion look young.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product came quick just did not read the description well and was shock to see them smurf size seriously the smallest brushes and containers I have ever seen  Oh well product is awesome</li>
    <li> Love it! received it on time however, it&#x27;s very different from the pictures! It appears to be much bigger in the photos but when I received it..It was sample size..Quite disappointed in that especially for the big amount I paid :/&lt;br /&gt;however, the product is great to use on the face but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a bigger kit i guess.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this makeup! Got it earlier than expected, was what I had expected and the product is good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS TINY  NOT WORTH MONEY</li>
    <li> Love, love ,love bare minerals!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected! Very disappointed with the quantity for the price. Box says $22 but i paid $33 plus shipping! Containers are the size of eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Deceiving was only trial size. Could have gotten fullsize in local store for same price. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> Great and shipped fast</li>
    <li> great buy for 30 day trial. works well with oily skin. doesnt feel heavy. color great. would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Delivery on date specified, however I felt it took too long. Item was smaller than expected but am satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap and looks cheap upon arrival.  I was able to go to my local Ulta Store and get this product in a hard case and in bigger product sizes for $49 well worth the extra $9.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this purchase as I felt the size of the products were very small and the price was a bit high. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a mistake when it came in the mail. I have gotten a starter kit before from Macy&#x27;s, and it was full sized items with full sized brushes. I thought I was getting the same thing, but what came was 3 teeny tiny sample sized products that I could&#x27;ve gotten for free at a make up counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total rip off. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I have used bareminerals exclusively for about a year now. When I realized my supply was running low and didn&#x27;t have time to stop by the store I decided to browse my Amazon Prime fast shipping options.  What I thought I was purchasing was not what ended up arriving to my door. $40 for sample size - literally the sample Ulta gives you with your purchase - is what this kit is composed of. Should have listened to the tiny reviews. :-/&lt;br /&gt;Feel ripped off!</li>
    <li> Best make up ever worn</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have average complexion--nothing troublesome to cover, however after application I looked like I had no makeup on and I really like a flawless look and got none.</li>
    <li> Bare minerals is a great product but the size of the pods were much smaller than they lead you to believe.. What was really annoying is that on the package it was clearly marked $22 and they sold it to me for $35 something? Atleast take the sticker off if you&#x27;re going to rip me off!!</li>
    <li> Love bare minerals. Light and stays on and makes me feel pretty. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the size of the containers isn&#x27;t what my wife expected.  She can go to our local mall and by the starter kit for about $15 more and the containers are five times the size. The make up is great but we won&#x27;t be buying from here again</li>
    <li> These are SAMPLE sizes. I have been using BareMinerals for almost 2 years now and I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; for the price I was paying, I was getting what I would get from Ulta but living out in the sticks now, unable to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply disappointed.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  You barely get any product, I realize it is a starter kit, but you don&#x27;t really get enough to judge it</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical of using bare minerals because it didn&#x27;t look like much. I usually burn threw makeup so fast that within a few weeks I find myself having to go back to the beauty store to get more. I started out with this and kind of laughed because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t even last me a week. Well a month and a half later and I still have plenty left. This make up is awesome. I&#x27;ve never had pretty skin but my complexion looked amazing and my skin just glows. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Much much smaller than what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I like it but the product runs out too fast and I don&#x27;t use very much so it is too expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Love it love it will order more....</li>
    <li> package was destroyed when it arrived</li>
    <li> Ridiculously small sizes for the money!  Products are decent, but what a rip off.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to Bare Minerals and will never leave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this could be considered the 30 day starter pack when the box barely holds a few products.  The box doesn&#x27;t even say its a starter pack, it appears to be a sample box.  I went to Ulta and found the right product, which includes more items for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY purchasing this product.  Also, I was giving this item as a gift for an exchange and the box looked like someone had kicked it around for hours and was badly beat up.  Not sure if this is normal or something that happened during processing.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals is the best!</li>
    <li> Good set for the value. The powders are pretty small. It will really last you about one month depending on how much coverage you want. I have cystic acne and the product does not cover the acne all the way. It is a very good product though. Very natural looking and light on the skin. I recommend that you get color matched before buying the product. All stores which carry bare mineral makeup should color match you for free. sephora even gives you a free mini makeover. No appointment needed. I like that this set comes with 2 brushes. They are small but the perfect size to stick in the purse or travel. I would buy this product again. I recommend it to people who have never tried this kind of makeup and as a travel size on the go makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it out. I have olive skin and the color match is ok. The coverage I get isn&#x27;t great but, maybe that&#x27;s a technique problem on my part-I&#x27;m new to bare minierals. It does appear natrural on my skin. I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;dewy glow&amp;#34; they refer to in the ads though. I&#x27;ve appled the make-up with and without the primer...I don&#x27;t see a difference either way to be honest. My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a whole work day (mind you I do work 12 hr shifts) but, even after 8 hrs I feel like there is a difference and I&#x27;d like to see it last longer, especially after using a primer and following all of the application steps.</li>
