      <li>It&#x27;s a great natural color.</li>
      <li>and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove with acetone, cotton pads, and foil.</li>
      <li>I am trying to learn how to use gel polish at home but am finding out its not as easy as they make it look in the saloons.</li>
      <li>The gel is definitely better than the normal kind.</li>
      <li>In my opinion it is too light in shade for me and my coloring.</li>
      <li>The color is light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I noticed that after my son was born and I was washing a lot of bottles in hot, soapy water, the paint peeled off more.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>I have this polish in the normal kind and the gelcolor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s even better in gel formula!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stays on pure shiny and sleek</li>
      <li>It is a simple, neutral color that looks good with just about everything.</li>
      <li>This color has a bit of a shimmer to it, and is pretty light in tone.</li>
      <li>While the color is off from what I believe I had from the nail salon - I still like it very much and often get compliments on the color!</li>
      <li>you will love this polish already gave myself manicare and its so natural looking</li>

      <li>Love the color, looks very natural and does not show chips much.</li>
      <li>Classic and clean.</li>
      <li>Also good to mix with other more bold colors to tone them down.</li>
      <li>I love this color in regular Opi nail polish</li>
      <li>-- yes, that&#x27;s how much I must have this color!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty color, but isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have a non-OPI LED gel system, but it works with many different brands of polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more or less a light gold color.</li>
      <li>but I added some A Good Madarin is Hard to Find.</li>
      <li>The polish was very durable and lasted almost 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>It covers so much nicer and dries smoother.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very allergic to nail polish</li>
      <li>Very neutral.</li>
      <li>it thank you sooo much</li>
      <li>Much lighter than I thought.  </li>
      <li>The color was much more transparent than I expected.  </li>
      <li>To me the color is a peachy pearlescent color--much, much prettier than I imagined</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t add much but it made it somewhat more opaque but not much.</li>
      <li>Very subtle and barely-there, but can do more layers for a more beige-y look.</li>
      <li>With two coats, it is a light pink, (flesh) tone, and of course, still shimmery.</li>
      <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t seem to dry completely under the light I bought and stayed sticky.</li>
      <li>It still lasted the expected 14 days but will add more of another color next time.</li>
      <li>You only need to remember OPI and know it never fails.</li>
      <li>The color that is shown doesn&#x27;t really do it justice, but that&#x27;s what you get when you order something such as a color of polish online!</li>
      <li>Makes a great base coat under sparkles for a night out or basic mani for a working professional.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> OPI is always the brand to count on.  The color, Cosmo not tonight Honey, is a good neutral.  Also good to mix with other more bold colors to tone them down.</li>
    <li> I have a non-OPI LED gel system, but it works with many different brands of polish. I saw this color in an Ulta store but they don&#x27;t sell it retail. The color swatch on the bottle is a golden honey shimmer color. Unfortunately, the polish color has pink rather than golden undertones. It&#x27;s still a pretty color, but isn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Just for reference, I did not rely on the product pic on the web to judge color. I am going on the actual color on the actual bottle. The polish was very durable and lasted almost 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this color in regular Opi nail polish&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even better in gel formula!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stays on pure shiny and sleek&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments every time I have this on my nails&lt;br /&gt;Great for most skin tones</li>
    <li> The color is light and not overpowering. It is durable and looks good. You only need to remember OPI and know it never fails.</li>
    <li> Loved the color!!!!  I will def buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very neutral. Does not need second coat.  Perfect for work  and every day ware.  stays  more then a week without chipping off ( I have  a little one and  my hand are always in water - cleaning, scrabbing, washing smth...).</li>
    <li> I have this polish in the normal kind and the gelcolor. The gel is definitely better than the normal kind. It covers so much nicer and dries smoother. Love it!</li>
    <li> Much lighter than I thought.  In my opinion it is too light in shade for me and my coloring. Hard to buy online if you never tried it before.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect neutral color, and it looks good even when it starts to grow out.  It&#x27;s a subtle polish that looks classy.</li>
    <li> Did not like color, it&#x27;s yellow not tan or beige:( picture of color was really off, lover Opi colors, but this one was a poor color choice .</li>
    <li> This color is not the same as the nail lacquer.  Wish they would make them the same. It&#x27;s the same with the color Bastille my heart.  Very disappointed in the product because I think the gel will match the polish and it doesn&#x27;t. Will not buy it any more.</li>
    <li> Love the Opi Gelcolor! Buying them all. Others charge same price for less product.  It&#x27;s easy to remove with acetone, cotton pads, and foil.</li>
    <li> This color appears at first glance to be pale pink, but actually goes on as peach.  It has a great sparkle to it, and if you like peach polish then go for it.  It just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me personally.</li>
    <li> Except for the reviews, I never would have purchased this color even if I had seen the bottle in a beauty store.  Sometimes the lid color doesn&#x27;t do the color justice.  To me the color is a peachy pearlescent color--much, much prettier than I imagined it would be.  This will probably be my everyday color especially in the summer.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the champagne color my Grandma used to wear. It&#x27;s got a sparkle to it. It&#x27;s a great natural color.</li>
    <li> It is a simple, neutral color that looks good with just about everything. Classic and clean. Very subtle and barely-there, but can do more layers for a more beige-y look. Makes a great base coat under sparkles for a night out or basic mani for a working professional.</li>
    <li> While the color is off from what I believe I had from the nail salon - I still like it very much and often get compliments on the color!</li>
    <li> Nice colour, good product</li>
    <li> this is a good polish and good color.  I should suggest not using too many coats.  I like to product and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I am trying to learn how to use gel polish at home but am finding out its not as easy as they make it look in the saloons. The polish doesn&#x27;t seem to dry completely under the light I bought and stayed sticky. Maybe I missed a step.</li>
    <li> did not realize what i was getting into there are no instructions just thought it was nail polish.didn&#x27;t know had to have a machine to dry them.will find out more about products i purchase on internet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair and this is a lovely color against my skin. It is a peachy-pink, but not too peach for me. Nice shimmer</li>
    <li> you will love this polish already gave myself manicare and its so natural looking just love it thank you sooo much</li>
    <li> Love the color, looks very natural and does not show chips much. OPI gel is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m very allergic to nail polish and this gel does not give me any problems.</li>
    <li> With one coat, this is a shimmery, translucent, pink tint. With two coats, it is a light pink, (flesh) tone, and of course, still shimmery. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a neutral and if you want to see some color on your nails, you&#x27;ll need to mix it with another of opi&#x27;s polish because it was close to invisible except for the shine. It had a slight peachy tone to it but I added some A Good Madarin is Hard to Find. I didn&#x27;t add much but it made it somewhat more opaque but not much. It still lasted the expected 14 days but will add more of another color next time.</li>
    <li> The color was much more transparent than I expected.  And no matter how many layers I used I couldn&#x27;t get a color I liked because the nail bed showed through.</li>
    <li> This color has a bit of a shimmer to it, and is pretty light in tone. The color that is shown doesn&#x27;t really do it justice, but that&#x27;s what you get when you order something such as a color of polish online! It&#x27;s more or less a light gold color. Opi has great products, and I am an Opi snob. I was not disappointed with the quality of the product. I had to remove the gel after 1.5wks for work purposes, but it still looked just as great as day 1.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish color.  It is so neutral and it blends right into my skin tone (which is very fair).  I bought this just in case the nail salon I go to doesn&#x27;t have it when I go in to get my nails done -- yes, that&#x27;s how much I must have this color!  It stays on well for me too, so long as I don&#x27;t have my hands in water a lot.  I noticed that after my son was born and I was washing a lot of bottles in hot, soapy water, the paint peeled off more.</li>
