      <li>This shampoo is simple to use and does a great job.  </li>

      <li>shampoo has a mild scent and was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I cant wait to use this product smells lovely and just appropriate for my newly bought wig.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells ok (no weird odor) but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as most human hair shampoo.</li>
      <li>Will get your weave or wig clean.</li>
      <li>This is just the ticket for keeping your wig clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>While it did clean it, it also removed some of the luster.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo worked well to clean wig and remove wig spray.  </li>
      <li>This is nothing special.</li>

      <li>was fast and uneventful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first shampoo i have ever used</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It was incredibly easy to use and requires barely any product.</li>
      <li>I was always told to get rid of the synthetic hair if it even starts to nap up so quickly then go out and buy a new on.</li>
      <li>I have never seen my hair so beautiful before, and I only need to use less than 1 tbs!</li>
      <li>Extremely gentle on my synthetic half wig but gets the oils out and cleans nicely.</li>
      <li>I am breast cancer survivor, and I have been used the shampoo to wash mi wig, and its absolutely amazing, they supplier also sells a conditioner of the same brand I didn&#x27;t buy it only to save money, but a don&#x27;t need it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, thank you!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very curly and</li>
      <li>It definitely cleaned it and left it smelling fresh and looking better.</li>
      <li>Used this the first time I washed my new wig.</li>
      <li>I got the hair clip from a street vendor in Las Vegas for $50 and it&#x27;s decent quality.</li>
      <li>It works really well on wigs, leaving them feeling soft and shiny</li>
      <li>Leave wig feeling harsh, smell is okay.</li>
      <li>She came out like new.</li>
      <li>I used this last night for the first time on a wig that I recently bought and washed for the first time.</li>
      <li>Ordered this thinking it would keep my new wig soft.</li>
      <li>Since I didn&#x27;t know how long it had been on display, I felt the need to wash it right away.</li>
      <li>This is definitely not a one-step process, you absolutely NEED the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this and it only takes a small amount.</li>
      <li>I will go back to my old way of washing it.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it felt kind of stiff and the ends got puffy.</li>
      <li>The hair is not exactly as before washing, but I don&#x27;t know if that is normal.</li>
      <li>However, I will say that it does leave synthetic wigs feeling a little &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and very tangled.</li>

    <li> Does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of using my regular shampoo on my synthetic wig.  While it did clean it, it also removed some of the luster.  DeMert Wig Shampoo was inexpensive and revived my wig quite a bit.  I will not make that mistake again.</li>

    <li> Shampoo worked well to clean wig and remove wig spray.  I used on both synthetic and human hair wigs.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I could see the hair was actually softer after treatment. Good product. I have several wigs for different shows.</li>
    <li> great shampoo and good price</li>
    <li> works perfectly on all wigs</li>
    <li> I am breast cancer survivor, and I have been used the shampoo to wash mi wig, and its absolutely amazing, they supplier also sells a conditioner of the same brand I didn&#x27;t buy it only to save money, but a don&#x27;t need it. after 1 year mi wig is just perfect. My wig is made from human hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I use on my wigs. ever.  It&#x27;s gentle and it has a fresh clean smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does work! It does not strip the hair it revives! If you want to bring your synthetic hair back from bad! This is for you!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and uneventful!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simple to use and does a great job.  Just soak the wig, rinse it out and hang it to dry.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.</li>
    <li> I have worn wigs everyday for about 17 years. This is a very good shampoo and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for many years with no complaints.  My wigs love it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was putting away my wigs after recovering from chemotherapy and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on wig shampoo since I hope I never need to use them again.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on shampoo and conditioner, so took a chance on this product.  It worked great, just as advertised.  The wigs retained their color, shape, and luster.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my baby sister to care for her wigs and she loves it!! I happy with the purchase and price!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked perfect for my wig. It&#x27;s the first shampoo i have ever used but it worked great. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it had a bleachy smell to it. The smell didn&#x27;t show up on the wig so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Cleans wigs very nicely</li>
    <li> Ordered this thinking it would keep my new wig soft. It seemed to make it dry. I will go back to my old way of washing it. This is nothing special.</li>
    <li> the wigs were easy to comb and brush and my wig hair color looks great and it felt like smooth feather running my fingers through the hair. so to me it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this with but it seems to be fine for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> I cant wait to use this product smells lovely and just appropriate for my newly bought wig.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the bother of these products. After taking/advice from stylist, friends, and ect... I was always told to get rid of the synthetic hair if it even starts to nap up so quickly then go out and buy a new on. They probably knew about this brand beofreI even found out and were just being jerks about it.d</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my wigs yet, but may I just tell you it works wonders on human hair! I have never seen my hair so beautiful before, and I only need to use less than 1 tbs! This is a great product and I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Used this the first time I washed my new wig. I think it did OK. The hair is not exactly as before washing, but I don&#x27;t know if that is normal. I bought another shampoo and will use it next time to compare.</li>
    <li> I found the DeMert Shampoo worked well cleaning and softening my wig and left it with a nice light ,clean scent.</li>
    <li> Love this product... It makes your wig smell so good after washing it.. I love this and it only takes a small amount. Try it and you will see!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well on wigs, leaving them feeling soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Aweful!!! Messed up after use.</li>
    <li> I bought a synthetic hair clip with tons of curls and this was perfect for it. I got the hair clip from a street vendor in Las Vegas for $50 and it&#x27;s decent quality. Since I didn&#x27;t know how long it had been on display, I felt the need to wash it right away. I&#x27;m sure it was full of dust and probably absorbed odors (drunken breath and smokers? lol) even though I didn&#x27;t smell anything. It&#x27;s very curly and all the curls and color remained as good as new. This shampoo smells ok (no weird odor) but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as most human hair shampoo. I think it&#x27;s a very good wig/extension shampoo!</li>
    <li> Left my synthetic wig looking good.</li>
    <li> My issue isnt with the product, but the packaging. when i got mine in the box (which was also ordered with a wig) one of the bottles was opened and some of the liquid fell out. the bag it was in saved my wig.</li>
    <li> I have two costume wigs that had been stored in a box in the garage for a couple of years, and had become musty. I didn&#x27;t want to wear them again without washing them first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the DeMert Wig &amp; Weave System Shampoo for Natural and Synthetic Hair and used it on both wigs, with great results. One wig is just a cheap Princess Leia costume wig. The other is a bit more expensive and is a long, red, wavy wig. I was worried that the waves would frizz or flatten after washing, but it turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a mild scent and was easy to use. Because the red wig is so long, I used a bucket instead of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo for wigs.</li>
    <li> This is just the ticket for keeping your wig clean and shiny. I would recommend this to everyone.who wants their wig to look nice</li>
    <li> Works as good as the other wig cleaners. Has the same smell. Will get your weave or wig clean.</li>
    <li> First time using it works great</li>
    <li> Loved it very nice results. Arrived on time and as promised</li>
    <li> Good for price wasn&#x27;t worth shipping and Handel ingredients and it leaves wig dry honestly I&#x27;m growing my hair out from chemo so I use products if your looking for a good wig cleaner etc I would say go to a wig store</li>
    <li> Left my wigs (all 7 of them) less manageable than before washing.  I had to buy another product to spray on them to get back softness, shine and manageability (flyaway tendency).</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that will restore a worn out old wigs luster.  I highly recommend it, thank you!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, just follow the directions.  Easy as can be.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Leave wig feeling harsh, smell is okay. I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> I used this last night for the first time on a wig that I recently bought and washed for the first time. It definitely cleaned it and left it smelling fresh and looking better. My only complaint is that it felt kind of stiff and the ends got puffy.</li>
    <li> after washing with this hair is shinny and restored!!</li>
    <li> This wig shampoo works well and the price is great!  It is the only wig shampoo that I use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so good!!!!  Extremely gentle on my synthetic half wig but gets the oils out and cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m please with this product.  Thank You</li>
