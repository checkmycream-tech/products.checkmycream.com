<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Last until you wash your face. Wish it came in different colors though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyebrow I&#x27;m wash away. Other problem is  doesn&#x27;t have a little brush and hard to put on a eyebrow, the liquid going on the skin to. I think so is better if make with the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this product and plan to add it permanently to my makeup supplies.  Like other reviews, the fine tip draws very realistic &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; that look natural for filling in those patchy areas of the brow.  I have very dark brown/black eyebrows, and I ordered the dark brown which matches perfectly for me, but be warned that this color would be too dark for many.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, which is fine by me.  I keep forgetting to apply it first before lotion and foundation like another reviewer suggested, so maybe that would be the trick for longer-lasting wear.  Still, this is an awesome product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Thanks Beautynetkorea</li>
    <li> Nice, but not exactly what I expected. It looks good when you put it on, but it&#x27;s not sweat proof. I put it on a couple of hours before bed. Then I went for a run when I woke up. When I looked in the mirror afterwards, it was bad. I look like I cried wearing non waterproof eye makeup, but coming from my eyebrows. It was embarrassing and awful. I had let it set for over 8 hours and it bled/ran. So I don&#x27;t recommend wearing while working out, unless you washed it off and have the less harsh tinted remains and it lasts for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in all, I like how it tints your brows lightly, but I do not like how it runs when you sweat.</li>
    <li> I love how brush is very sharp so I can draw my eyebrow with details. Color was ok. Price is fantastic thou shipping price is high and it takes too long to receive it.</li>
    <li> Best brow tool/makeup ever!!! Ive use so many different brow fillers from dip brow, aqua brow, high end to low end. They were okay but this blows all of them out of the water. Looks great and really does STAY in place and DOSN&#x27;T SMEAR!!  Also it dosnt look cakey and drawn on like the others. All my other products are double the price or more and dont deliver like this does. Just Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Dried up quickly. I only got 3 uses out of it</li>
    <li> This definitely does not last 7 days. It looks great when you first put it on and for a few hours.  But if you sweat just a little it fades to a light brown orangish color. It would be the perfect brow marker if it didn&#x27;t fade and would actually last 7 days only doing touch ups</li>
    <li> Some of the pictures online are misleading to the color of the product on, and the color that is left over when it is taken off. I don&#x27;t notice any red tints from using this, instead, it is a very light golden-beige. I dissolves once it touches water, so I often only apply it at night. The color is beautiful and matches my hair perfectly... and it must be put on with a light hand. You can build up the color, which is something I would recommend. I usually cleanse, place toner over my eyebrow and let it dry. Then I place the product on my eyebrows. I draw it on with small stokes, imitating my own eyebrow hair. When I draw it and then put a little translucent powder, it looks beautiful. Otherwise, there is a sheen that can make it look like freshly tattooed liner. I&#x27;ve used it for day and night, and I like it because even though the color that deposits into the skin is very light, it gives a good guideline of how to shape my eyebrows for the next day. I also like it because you can make mistakes and erase it with ease.</li>
    <li> This product rests between so-so and pretty alright. I bought it in April, and it&#x27;s just now starting to dry up, and I use it pretty much every day. On the first week of wearing it, I wore it for three days-- and my eyebrows broke out in minor bumps. Woah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had a full-cycle experience with this pen, I&#x27;ve learned to clean my brows gently with almond oil when I wash my face at night (it&#x27;s a treat because the follicles are nourished, and this product&#x27;s lightweight compatibility has helped my brows grow stronger on their own). As previously stated, this product is great for a day-- however, I&#x27;ll reiterate that it is NOT good to leave on for more than two days. It will clog your pores. I used to use Rimmel to fill in my brows, but this is much softer, and does not wipe off as easily ((note: I have very oily skin, and the product still manages to remain intact when applied properly)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also enjoyed mastering the craft of drawing my own hairs, as opposed to coloring them in fully, because I love the way the product evens out the sparse areas, creating a more natural appearance. I personally despise the way powder/gel products cake on and look/feel fake, and pencil often upsets my fine hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[As a side-note, I&#x27;ve also made bold brows and even tried various shapes, drawing minor angles a little beyond my own natural hairline, etc. It&#x27;s pretty fun when you&#x27;ve got the time to give it a go. Hardly time-consuming after you get the hang of it.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor, initial complaint I had was that the color isn&#x27;t quite dark enough for my taste, but I suppose I prefer it now to obviously colored brows. I&#x27;m also no expert, but I think a lot of doors would open if they made multiple shades. My red-headed roommate adored the permanence of the product, but the color did not match as she likes to utilize reddish, auburn shades for her brows. A much wiser option than dyeing (thus damaging) the brows, personally, but hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: This is great for day-to-day use, and does stay when applied properly. Requires some practice, but easy to work with. Versatile when making different brow shapes. Those with sensitive or oily skin should take extra precaution and cleanse wisely. Not recommended to stay on skin for more than a few days due to bacteria and clogging pores. Half a shade lighter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this four stars as opposed to three because I currently haven&#x27;t found anything better for the product:price ratio, as well as ease of use and portability. Tada!</li>
    <li> Honestly I have like no eyebrows and the hair I have is blonde. I pencil every day... If you are like me and have to do this you are already used to being careful not to rub off your brows.  Well this product is AWESOME I put it on Monday night and its sunday, I have only minimally touched up once in a week! They look great!! I don&#x27;t wash on the brow.. No rubbing ect. I am more than happy! Little dark for a blonde on day one. But they fade perfect! In love best I&#x27;ve used. First photo is day 1,2,3... Then day 6(one touch up on day 4)</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;  So with this product, get the dark brown because it fades to a natural brownish with a HINT of orange, just a HINT. This is my second day wearing it, and I am happy with it. My technique is to put it on after I wash my face (with face wash) and  then with a cotton pad rub rubbing alcohol. It will stay much longer on your skin and eyebrows. Will I purchase again? Probably because I like how my eyebrows looked this morning.</li>
    <li> It takes multiple layers of application to be apparent. The color was off (more of a reddish brown). Because of the stain it adds to your skins, it appeared almost comical after washing one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> It does not stay on when you go Ito the water.  But the look is great because it can be applied precisely. I like this very much..but wish it were totally waterproof.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for an event I threw in culinary school. It was a Bollywood theme and I hired my tattooist to do &amp;#34;henna&amp;#34; tattoos. I got these to use since it would be much easier to use than henna. They worked great! Mine washed off the next day after a little scrubbing. We only used one, so I&#x27;ve been using it as eyeliner for my lower lid. Works wonderfully! No need to smudge or blend it either! As far as brows, I have pretty thick and dark brows naturally. I used it for definition last night and I really liked it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last for 7 days not even 1 to be exact.. Or perhaps you don&#x27;t expect people to wash their face daily.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. . If you wash your face it comes off.  but i will buy again , because it is easier to use than an eyebrow pencil, and it goes on smoothly It is not worth the price though.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow make-up is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It really only lasts 1 day but, at least it stays put all day.  Even if you wipe it with a tissue, it pretty much stay visible.  However, once you wash your face...it&#x27;s gone.  Goes on really easy and with a little practice you can make it look like tiny little hairs thanks to the design of the brush.  Product is darker when wet and lightens as it dries so keep that in mind.  Package is written in Korean so, unless you can read it, you have no idea what is in it.  Hope it&#x27;s safe but, have no clue.  Other than that aspect, I love it.</li>
    <li> The best brow pencil I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a liner ink pencil, therefore it has a very light feel and touch.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted a lot longer than some reviews.  This is my 2nd purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice but washes off at the end of day.still love it</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time which was great. I liked it when I first apply it because it is dark and nice, not too glossy so your eyebrows don&#x27;t look fake ( I have sparse brows). However, after a day it fades to an orangey color. I ordered the dark brown too and it is not dark brown, more of an orangey brown. Even my boyfriend noticed and said my eyebrows looked light brown (because my hair is black). I liked it for the fact that if Im going swimming or going to be sweating a lot, I can apply this overnight and wake up with dark eyebrows and wear that for the day. However, by the end of the day, I have to reapply it. It just doesn&#x27;t last 7 days as it claims so that&#x27;s the disappointing part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue I had with it was that as the color fades, the ink that has seeped into my pores on my eyebrows looks very weird. I don&#x27;t know if other people have this issue but it if you look very closely you can see it and it looks fake. I would have to apply more of the product over it to get rid of that grainy look. Other than that the product is waterproof, I would keep some of this product in stock for those swimming days.</li>
    <li> First time use pen was almost dried out already.  Not waterproof either!</li>
    <li> we do not understand the Korean language. We hope that you will  send with the pen instruction in English. we need instruction on the use of writing in English. and Russian language too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Doesnt say on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;Also &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; is pretty light. I would look elsewhere for a eyebrow enhancer</li>
    <li> It does not work. Does not last 1 hour. I was so excited when I received the pen but it was so disappointing.</li>
    <li> Finally used it, it did stay on three days, one side a tad lighter as my face was in the pillow!  I did remove it when I showered, I am certain had I not done that, it would have lasted the seven days!</li>
    <li> First of all this really does not last seven days but it does help. If you give a good shake to move the liquid forward it provides nice brunette dark precision line. It is easly removed/shaped with a q-tip if you make a mistake well applying it, but when it drys it becomes a little more difficult to remove. It drys within 30seconds to a minute. You can easily brush it right through you eyebrow hair and make it as dark as you want.&lt;br /&gt;What I do kinda like about it is that even though it mostly comes off with soap, it still leaves behind a light brown dye to your skin under the brow hair giving the effect of fuller brows. And If you dont use soap it lasts a bit longer like 2-3 days but still not 7.&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest issues is with swimming/going to the beach since I live in Florida. I hate having no eyebrow makeup left after swimming, but this product has held up the best out of the many I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I deducted two stars because it does not last more then a few days like it claims, but it has still made wonders in my eyebrow issues and I do like the product a lot. For $10 it is a good option.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for roughly two years now. I used to use a pencil, or even the Milani brow pen (don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it - especially if you have oily skin), but the pencil would always smudge, so I couldn&#x27;t touch my face, and the Milani brow pen would change color if my face started to get hot. I work in fast food, so having makeup that will stay put is very important for me. This brow pen is great. It stays put for as long as I have it on - I can even touch my face without worry. I use this a little differently than instructed. I have little to no eyebrow hair, so I have to draw them on everyday, and I wear foundation (and sometimes powder as well), so there is a layer between my skin and the \\&quot;ink\\&quot;. It washes off, but just enough stays behind that I can use what stays behind as a guide, rather than having to freehand it like I did with the pencil or Milani pen - even though I have it down to an art and can do my brows perfectly everyday in under two minutes. I suppose if I didn&#x27;t wear foundation everyday and my skin wasn&#x27;t oily, it would stay on for at least a day or two longer. I love this product so much. My only gripe is that the product itself runs out quicker than I would like. I just received a brow serum that is supposed to help me grow my brows out again, so hopefully in the future, I will only need this (or similar products) just to fill them instead of drawing them on.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown brows, I have over plucked them and it was pretty noticeable so while they are growing back out I still want to look like I have nice brows. I decided this may be a good idea. I wore it while swimming, not all of it came off but it did fade out to a lighter brown. Also the next day it fades so you do have to reapply it to get the dark brown. Applying it is very easy and I like the way it looks when I&#x27;m done. I perfer this over the eyebrow pencils which smear or come of easily during the day. You can touch your own eyebrows and not have to worry about them coming off with this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last two overnight</li>
    <li> I like this item, I just wish it had a little thicker tip.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyebrow pencil, but does not last for 7 days. I even washed my face and removed any excess oil off my eyebrows and applied a heavy coat of this before bed and slept with it on, and I have to say it looked like a tattoo, so I was hoping I could splash water on my face and not have to reapply to my eyebrows, but most of it did wash off my skin. I do like using it everyday as an eyebrow applicator. Will buy again, but not because it lasts like a tattoo</li>
    <li> These arrived yesterday and I am very pleased with them so far. The ink in them is a true dark brown, that fills in my very very thin (almost invisible) brows. I noted what the aother reviewers of this product have said and I will be practicing the little short feather like strokes for a more natural  look. This pen(cil) combined with a brow powder or a regular wax pencil (play around wiith it) helps me to achieve the look I want. I will be ordering more of these. Best I&#x27;ve found thus far and it does have good staying power even on my oily skin. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product. I gave it 4 stars because the product has tattoo misspelled which isn&#x27;t very professional. How it&#x27;s spelled: tatoo. How it should be spelled: tattoo The stuff really does NOT last even close to 7 days. It&#x27;ll last you all of one day, and only ONE day. As soon as you wash your face with soap and water, or use your makeup remover it comes right off. I&#x27;m so disappointed because I really wanted this to work.</li>
    <li> This is fine if you&#x27;re just looking for a general eyebrow pencil not much different than what you pick up at the store, but it&#x27;s not long lasting. This product, at least with me, needs to be reapplied during the day because it fads to a barely seen color. I have no idea how it could last 7 days. I have oily skin and have to blot with oil sheets during the day, so maybe that has something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;But with something stating that it&#x27;s long lasting and 7 days, I expect it to at least stand up to oil and face blotting for one day.</li>
    <li> The tip is excellent for very fine brush strokes. On clean skin it does create a stain. I, however, have ver dark hair and brows and the color it faded to after 24 hrs was quite pale and red. Did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> Fades in about 4 days unless applied again.</li>
    <li> Flat out doesn&#x27;t work. Waited a long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Goes on very easily and stays all day with minor touch ups. My eyebrows are already cosmetically tattooed and this product helps in darkening and shaping them just a little bit more. Over the course of 3 years, I&#x27;ve continually purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> Good but it doens lasts 7 days...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but I would not purchase this product again. Color pigment is too light.</li>
    <li> good stuff. This item works perfectly and I would buy this again for sure. Nice item for sure. two more words</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I give it 2 stars for staying on all day UN tell the morning. When you wash your face it comes off easy but it leaves a orange stain on your skin. Kinda like a bad at home self tan.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;7-day&amp;#34; claim is transparent horse puckey, but it&#x27;s still a really great product. For the sparse-browed such as myself, it&#x27;s easy to beef up your brows in a bold but reasonably natural looking way. Also, despite not living up to the absurd claim, it still is smudge- and sweat-proof, and is still longer lasting than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> 3days. good with natural mehundi henna ( if your a redhead) for eyebrows</li>
    <li> If you like Paul Brown eyebrow pens, this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> This would have gotten a 5-star rating if it actually lasted more than two days on my brows.  However, it is an excellent brow pen.  Looks very natural, and stays put even on my oil slick of a t-zone. I&#x27;ve used pencils and powders before but nothing beats this pen.  It gives you enough time to wipe away mistakes but when it&#x27;s dry it stays put through sweating (from my workouts), moisturizers (I apply it just after washed and dried face) and even through my toddler&#x27;s rough playing.</li>
    <li> Love the effects one can get with this eyebrow pen. It doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, but it does hold up very well under extreme circumstances.</li>
    <li> It was a little dark for me, which I had expected, but it lasts well maybe into the next day certainly not 7 days like it says, but that&#x27;s fine.  Apply daily  (My eyebrows are medium brown, and it darkened them slightly without making them look unnatural)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, save your money. Last only one day, gone after I washed my face. Might last longer if you don&#x27;t wash!!!  Should be able to get my money back. This is FALSE advertising!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this!  Doesn&#x27;t last you 7 days not even close but it has a natural color and a fine tip. Easy to give a natural gorgeous shape to my eyebrows.  Loooveeee and happy to have found it. Hope it doesn&#x27;t dries on me soon though.</li>
    <li> It does not last for the whole day and I looked like I had tattooed eyebrows when I had it on. I used it per instruction. When I first applied, I would put a lot to make my brown look extra dark ( like fake tattoo eyebrow) Then I just let it do the work at night.  The next morning when I woke up, my eyebrow got a lot lighter. It does not even worth to put on because the color is not showing.  If I reapply the color on top of what I have applied before, my eyebrow will look fake because the first application is always so dark! I totally wasted my money!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase (02 Dark brown). I bought 6 of these for Mom and myself. It gives a natural color. It lasts safely along the day. Mom has an oily skin and she loves this product. I&#x27;ve a combination skin and it goes fine so far! We never face any skin irritations or hair loss. I was hesitant to buy it at the beginning because it&#x27;s drawing in a thin line, but I noticed how comfortable to use it in a natural way. Thanks God for this product!</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this was the fine tip so it was very easy to apply. It says 7 days long last but let me tell you, that&#x27;s just not true. I read a ton of reviews on this and they seemed ok for the most part so I gave it a try. What a waste of money!  This rubbed off way faster than my regular cover girl eyebrow pencil. I don&#x27;t have much eyebrow hair due to over plucking. While it goes on very easy, it just isn&#x27;t worth the time or money since it comes off so easy. It also look like marker so your eyebrows look very unnatural.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product. As I lost most of my eyebrows from a medical treatment and they still haven&#x27;t grown back.  After the 2nd day, it didn&#x27;t seem to apply well. I had to draw on paper to get it to start working. Then I could apply it. I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times. Honestly applying before you go to bed on freshly scrubbed skin (put on slightly heavy) then it did seem to help with lessening the &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; the next morning. It comes nowhere close to 7 days. It washes right off. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the pool/ swimming, but my best guess is that as long as you didn&#x27;t touch your brows is that it would have some color still remaining after- it doesn&#x27;t smear- which is great.  I&#x27;d expected more than 10 uses out of this, so I&#x27;m giving 3 stars. However- I having found s product that works any better!</li>
    <li> Does not last several days....maybe if you never shower or sweat. I&#x27;d say 48 hours max even if sweating (without wiping your brows hard, just patting with absorbent cloth will do). At the end of 48 hours, the brows will have lightened significantly if you are an active person, but they still look filled nicely... just more natural looking I suppose since no longer colored in boldly. You can paint it on and run a lash/brow brush through and it softens the looks, I like it and it lasts a VERY decent amount of time for makeup even if not several days. I outline/fill my brows in every day boldly, and I am still using the same pen from March (6 months ago).</li>
    <li> Makes hair stroke lines. And last throughout  the day. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> This really has saved my eyebrows! I have been trying to grow parts out and this felt tip is perfect for filling in! I just ordered another one!</li>
    <li> This product is nice for filling in eyebrows,  however it doesn&#x27;t last more then a day unless you apply it every night and even after 3 (correct) applications  it fades when you wash your face after one time .  I like it as a filler pen for sure but dont get your hops up for anything semi permanent.  Better off going with henna.</li>
    <li> I like it as an eyebrow enhancer, but it does NOT last as stated.  The fine point does make very realistic eyebrows as you can just draw on fake hairs.  Really.  Not at all like a pencil and I will keep using it in this way, but disappointed it didn&#x27;t last more than a day.  Comes off in water, comes off if you rub, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost dry,and the tip is too fine,it looks like an eyeliner.color is not dark brown,it was sort of orangey brown the next day.easy to apply tho,doesn&#x27;t smear and doesn&#x27;t give me headaches and blurred vision which other brands do.maybe I can mix black and dark brown?</li>
    <li> I have very thin and sparse brows due to the &#x27;90&#x27;s trend of rocking skinny brows and years of tweezing. I have for almost a decade tried tons of eyebrow filling techniques possible. This is by far the best and longest lasting product I have ever come across. Now, take into account that I have oily skin and started using this during humid 95 degree heat wave. During that time it lasted about a day and a half and that is saying A LOT!. Now that the humidity has gone down and my oily skin is more balanced, i find it lasting about 2-3 days. It doesn&#x27;t rub off if I have an itch nnd scratch my brows, stays on during naps and won&#x27;t melt in the heat. I&#x27;m already on my second purchase of the dark brown color and my third purchase overall. (The first one of the dark brown isn&#x27;t even done with but im so in love with the product.) I had initially ordered the natural brown since I have Auburn hair but it was a bit too light for me.</li>
    <li> There was no ink in this Korean Pen. Not even for one use. A complete waste of money. Don&#x27;t have time to return .</li>
    <li> The color is too light and instead of dark brown it looks a bit reddish.  I had to do several passes, I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> No way!!! The product did arrive before the schedule arrival date.The color is as stated and glides on easily.That evening after washing my face,i applied the eyebrow pen,went to bed.The next morning it was gone!! So then i applied it first thing in the morning,washed my face that evening and it was gone.I have tried using it at diffetent times of the day and night,to no avail.This product does not last even a day!!&lt;br /&gt;This was s complete waste of money, time and effort.It does not work!!! I gave it one star for prompt delivery!!</li>
    <li> Photo misleads purchasers into thinking they will get more than one pen.  Only one is included.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause irritation. It looked very natural and stays on for a few days. Though, It washes of fairly easy.</li>
    <li> The add read that it was tattoo like and would last 7 days. Since I was going on vacation to Hawaii I needed a long lasting eyebrow pencil since I don&#x27;t have much hair on my own brows. It did last the day but surely not the 7 days it claimed. I still would and will continue to use it for any water functions I will do as it does last the entire day.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, but it dries quickly</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, because I though it would be long wearing. It is not. Has a nice brush, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to stay on during swimming or something, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has kept the shape of my eyebrows so all I have to do is fill them in where it&#x27;s wearing off.  I just wash my face around my eyebrows and let clear water hit them. At times it cakes up a little but I use a regular eye brow pencil to smooth them out again. It works together fabulously. I wish Amazon had the natural brown color as the dark brown is a little too dark for me.  Until I find something that&#x27;s a little lighter and works the same way I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
    <li> Nice concept, but this product does not meet my expectations. Pen was dried out, so the color wouldn&#x27;t flow evenly. Money refunded.</li>
    <li> Stays on for couple of days.</li>
    <li> The color and brush tip are spot on; however, it wears off and does not last for 7 days. It will last 1 day, more if you do not use products to remove your eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Does not stay long on oily skin.</li>
    <li> I Was So Hoping This Product Would Work. But Unfortunately It Washed Right OffIn The Morning. I Followed The Directions PreciselY And Even Tried It Again The Next Day With No Luck. To Bad Cause It Looks LikeA Nice Color But Too Dark To Just Use Like A Pencil And It Wipes Off Easily.</li>
    <li> Because they dried out after a few uses</li>
    <li> If you have medium to dark brown hair I would suggest getting the darker one not the &amp;#34;natural brown&amp;#34;.  This one has a tendency to fade to a henna reddish on the second day.  This is OK for me because my hair is henna red too.  But I got a second one in the darker brown for evening wear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to getting this stuff to stay on is to put it on first, before any moisturizers, foundations, powders, etc.  It needs to hit completely clean and dry skin.  I was actually surprised it stays as long as it does.  And it looks way more natural than pencils.  Works as an eye liner too.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesistant when I first ordered it and I wasn&#x27;t so convinced while I &amp;#34;painted&amp;#34; my eyebrows with this pen. I looked quite funky with very dark drawn in eyebrows but when I woke up and washed my face, I was quite surprised with the &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; portion of this pen! I just wish the color was a bit darker or more greyish/blackish for my dark brown hair. The stain came out to be more reddish lighter brown.</li>
    <li> Wow! I thought I was out of luck in finding a product that really helps to define my over plucked eyebrows. With this eyebrow pen, I am able to easily fill in my eyebrows. It helps to create a natural look and is easy to fix if the application becomes too heavy. The pen has a fine, soft tip. It&#x27;s reassuring knowing that it will last for several hours/days without having to reapply. I plan on purchasing several more of these.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I only have one concern and that it after it fades it leaves little dots behind, but that is understandable because its kind of like that is what is still in the skin&#x27;s pores. At first I thought it was too dark but actually the tint is perfect for me! I have just purchased another pen.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical at first when I received the Pen as when I removed it from the packaging and examined it, it appeared empty (weightless)!?!  I then attempted to use it, and so far so good! Nice, smooth, fine tip brush. I would suggest using a brow guide to ensure proper shaping when drawing on your brow.  will check back in, in a few days to rate the &amp;#34;long-wearing&amp;#34; feature of this product.  Stay tuned...</li>
    <li> Not really a &amp;#34;tatoo&amp;#34;. Gone pretty fast if u have oily skin. Plus the ink will get lighter &amp; run out quick.</li>
    <li> It works! Just as long as u don&#x27;t use soap. Amazing product! It stays on and won&#x27;t rub off! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Although this pen does not leave a dark henna tattoo, it is easy to apply due to the great tip.  I love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> It does not last for 7 days</li>
    <li> I get a couple of days out of this, IF I don&#x27;t rub my face very hard when bathing/washing my face. It&#x27;s a nice shade, not too dark. There&#x27;s no irritation, and though it&#x27;s definitely NOT 7 days wear, I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t sweat off or rub off easily. I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything lasting 7 days, unless you&#x27;re just nasty... and never bathe, so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It turns orange on my skin.</li>
    <li> To be honest..this pencil is very easy to use and control....It actually stays all day...just don&#x27;t touch it...and will wash out at the end  of the day...when you remove your make up..</li>
    <li> I really like how long this product lasts for. I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts for seven days, but will hold up to 3 days with a couple touch ups here and there. Best eyebrow marker i&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Useless. Even if I paint my brows as dark as possible in the night(looks like a black duct tape), it only leaves faint color after a wash in the morning. And the faint color doesn&#x27;t even last over 2 days.</li>
    <li> It works 3-4 days. The color is lighter than you expected.&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep this product well because liquid is leaking.</li>
    <li> Not even stay for 24 hour, last for 7 days is absolutely a lie</li>
    <li> I really did not think that this was going to stay on my eyebrows very long, but it does. I refresh every 2nd day which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Do you have an eyeliner that stays on for a long period of time?</li>
    <li> The product is very good for the price. Fine quality and strong color. The only complaint is that it does not last for 7 days, but 1 full day including humidity and exercise.</li>
    <li> This is not a stain and rubs off.Does not last as long it&#x27;s claim to last,not satisfied......and will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last the next morning. Did as told on the directions. The product did not last at all. I was very upset I spent my money on this product. FALSE INFORMATION FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.... NOT HAPPY AT ALL........  do not expect this to last it will not and did not for me.. not even one day....</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with it! Super fine tip so you can make your eyebrows look very natural. I used to hate filling in my eyebrows cause it looks unnatural and sometimes I&#x27;d just sweat them off. I will be buying this product again and again</li>
    <li> I like the color of this product but it doesnt last for 7 days as it states it does last for a day.  I would say if you like to tint your eyebrows you can use this to get the shape you want and then use tint over it and it works wonders that way.  It is very easy to use and I like the color it is just like the pencils I use.  I would buy another even though it doesn&#x27;t last 7 days it still works with my tint which I love!</li>
    <li> Gets dry when not used after a few days. Tip of the pen is the thinnest I have ever come across for a perfect natural look.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to purchase a &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; style eyebrow pen for some time. I have considered hennaing my spaces in my brows, and may still have to try that. I was thinking that henna would fade and turn reddish or golden brown. So when purchasing this, I chose the darker shade. I have light brown hair, but dark brown brows. Your brows are usually darker than your hair. Even though I only put this on AFTER showering and using alcohol/drying my brow, it goes on in tiny clumps. I wait to set it and even put a little eyebrow powder over to seal it and protect it, but by day 2 it&#x27;s already faded to a light reddish golden brown. The individual lines you may attempt to draw will blend into one smooth area no matter what you do. Maybe the one I have is older or maybe I haven&#x27;t got the technique down. However, it is a thin soft point and it does go on dark at first. I guess this should be thought of as a base and needs to be used daily. The color doesn&#x27;t really build up day after day. I only hope it isn&#x27;t full of toxins, as it is used so close to the eyes. Will try henna once this pen is used up, unless I find a better-reviewed version. I don&#x27;t think I would actually tattoo my eyebrows - that can look good on certain people, but as you get older it can look clownish or bizarre. It would be AWESOME if they combined a tattoo pen like this that really worked as it should with those lash/brow conditioners that claim to help improve hair growth/thickness.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly as announced, is very easy to apply and looks ver natural.  The brush is very delicate and allows you to paint in hairlike strokes. Recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> I only last for a day&#x27;s wear. Washes off at end of the like a regular pencil.</li>
    <li> Average performance like other liquid brush-on brow products, no lasting power as claimed.</li>
    <li> Horrible! !! Waste of money</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pen is fantastic!  I was first introduced to eyebrow pens from my aesthetician and was shocked to see how natural these &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; like pens fill in your brows.  I would think thought pens would cause a draw dark distinct line, but they are just the opposite.   Because the pens are so fine and you put it on by drawing in many fine lines allows you to fill in your eyebrow while creating a natural brow effect.  I do recommend purchasing a eyebrow brush (it does not come with it) to blend in the lines.  The korean branded pen recommended by my aesthetician $25 and only lasted a month while this one lasts a few.  I was hesitant at first to purchase Tony Moly as I was not sure if it would work as well, but took a chance based upon the price and so happy I did!  I am asian with dark brown eye brows and the #2 dark brown provides a natural look.  I am giving this 4 starts because it states that it is 7 day tattoo, but it does NOT last more than 1 day for me.  It does seem waterproof (once it dries), but comes off easily with my soap and water.  I am a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> If you just want to fill in your eyebrows it&#x27;s ok. You have to make sure your eyebrows are absolutely dry and even then it still spots after application. You have to reapply twice for it not to look spotty. It&#x27;s not permanent not is it semi permanent. It&#x27;s basically a marker for your eyebrows. I honestly do not think its worth the money. I apply it and then I apply the eyebrow shadow over top of it so it can look more natural. The last picture shows other items that was suppose to come with my purchase but it didn&#x27;t. I only received the marker In a plastic bag so don&#x27;t expect anything more.</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to use it, it works well.</li>
    <li> Product does not last 7 days but it was still worth the buy... Also it it very light so you may have to put on a few coats to see a difference.</li>
    <li> It seems nearly dried up when I got it.</li>
    <li> The pen came almost empty and dry....</li>
    <li> It works! Although, since I have an oily T-zone so it only last a few days which is not the products fault. I used it on my mom and she doesn&#x27;t have an only T-zone and it lasted longer. Only thing is that as it fades, it becomes a bit coppery looking. The brush is nice and pointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last 7 days but I will say as a cancer survivor with zero eyebrows... This is the only brand I can draw on my skin and it last all day with no issues. So for that reason thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I applied the eyebrow pencil two hours before I went to bed. The next morning, to my amazement it didn&#x27;t fade, even when I washed my face. The next day, I noticed the dark brown color faded a little bit.  On the 3rd day, the color faded even more and on the 4th day, it was completely diminished.  It only lasted to 3 days, not 7.  But, I can say this is a good eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve every had. I would buy it again.  Thanks to Amazon for selling this product.</li>
    <li> Ok so this company is cool I like how if your not happy with what you get you can at least get some of your money back they aim to please you and I was clearly wrong about my first review so if you see my old review don&#x27;t pay it any mind these people are great after all and I&#x27;m the dummy for jumping the gun instead of emailing them first about the problem I had that until now I didn&#x27;t see cause I didn&#x27;t check my email so before you make a fool out of yourself like I did email them if there is a problem I made them look bad for nothing and they was willing to work with me but I didn&#x27;t check so for that I&#x27;m sorry</li>
    <li> they go on smooth as long as you stroke it on ...to make it look like hairs...and it stays on all day even in very humid weather like here in the south. thanks</li>
    <li> Does NOT last &amp;#34;7 days&amp;#34; it is just like any other eyeliner. It even came off when I rubbed it with my finger. Very disappointed, especially when I paid extra for next day delivery. I would not give ANY star rating if I had the option.</li>
    <li> Wish this was &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; ink!! Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Dark color</li>
    <li> The product is very nice and smooth and the felt tip applies with soft strokes but the effect did not last 7 days as advertised. It only lasted 1 day and it washed out easily</li>
    <li> It realyy comes out when you wash your face. It;s good fo the day.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a one because it is not what it is advertise 7 days not really.</li>
    <li> Love the color but does not last 7 days but will definitely last almost all day long, I have dark brown brows</li>
    <li> I will say that this product definitely does NOT last 7 days.  It does leave a hazy, barely noticeable residue of what I applied the day before, but that&#x27;s better than any other product, including Henna Penna.  I workout intensely 6 days per week so it&#x27;s very difficult to find a product that will stay for even more than 1 day so this is pretty good.  What I was REALLY impressed with was the application.  You can actually apply one hair at a time and it looks absolutely real.  I draw portraits and so I&#x27;m pretty good at creating a brow that looks exactly like the real thing.  Like many women, in the 1990s, I over-plucked the brow hairs at the inner-corner where they are thickest.  I used to be a Xena impersonator and I was attempting to achieve the same look that Lucy Lawless had, which was brows that start right at the inner corner of her eyes. Unfortunately, I ruined my own natural brows in the process since they stopped growing back once I got sick of impersonating the warrior princess.  With this pen, I can replace the 1/4&amp;#34; of what I lost and then some, and the super thin application brush makes me create each hair at a time for an authentic look.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay at all. I have dry skin and I thought it would help stay longer but nah. disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great, but it does not last 7 days, it only lasts until you wash your face</li>
    <li> The ink came out when i shake it and it does not stay 7 days long. it removed when i wash my face. but still like it</li>
    <li> Long lasting product.</li>
    <li> I normally prefer eyebrow pens, but these don&#x27;t seem to look right. Im wondering about the ingredients. They seen more like a marker than an eyebrow pen.</li>
    <li> Like but does not stay on long.</li>
    <li> Great color&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Stays all day&lt;br /&gt;You have to go over sparse spots a few times to get desired darkness&lt;br /&gt;Lasts seven days? Only if you want orange brows! Or to not wash your face....</li>
    <li> This works perfect, it goes on easily and this is my brow liner of choice.  I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not stay on through face washes as well as it claims.  Otherwise, perfect! :)</li>
    <li> This product stays on all day, that&#x27;s good enough for me, would be nice if it lasted 7 days but it doesnt</li>
    <li> Really good, and color matches perfectly. but It will only last for one day and washer away.</li>
    <li> Lovely on but Defo doesn&#x27;t last, u get a day out of it like most other eye penicils disappointed</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, BUT it does last all day and others that say they last all day DO NOT.  I love this and can use anything else on my eyebrows.  I wish they had a taupe color but the light brown works great for me too.  super easy to apply.  I have tattooed eyebrows that have faded and I fill in where needed with this pencil and it lasts!  gives the look of a tattoo.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on for 7 days. It is easily removed with water.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would last for a week without rubbing off and fading but really...it faded a bit after I washed my face once and was really faded after two days! I&#x27;ll just be using it as I would a normal brow pencil.</li>
    <li> This pen did not have the staying power that I expected from others reviews. I live in TX where humidity is a big factor for much of the year. I received my pen in December with record low weather conditions.I also have somewhat oily skin so I prep my brows with rubbing alcohol to remove all traces of residue before doing my brows. I also use a setting powder by Make-Up Forever and a setting spray to give my make-up that extra hold. Unfortunately the brows began fading by mid-day. The color of the dark brown pen was a perfect match for my hair and skin. I am not surprised or overly disappointed that the brow pen did not work. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands that state they are waterproof, long wearing etc., but I am still on my quest to find one that truly works. I gave my brow pen to a friend and maybe it will work for her skin and daily use. It just did not work for my skin. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Very good on me, smooth and color is just nature. Love it so much. I will buy another one for spare.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND IS EASY TO USE.  LASTS ALL DAY.  Since I wash my face every night, it does not last, but during the day stays on just fine and much better than a pencil.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. The color is great, but the fact that it washed off in the morning really defeats the purpose of &amp;#34;7 days long lasting&amp;#34; title. I have oily skin, so I listened to the other reviewers and decided to clean with alcohol before applying. I did this after I washed my face with a face wash and made sure I had no makeup on. I took a cotton ball and cleaned my eyebrows with alcohol, to clear out the oils. And then applied the liner before bed. During the shower in the morning I attempted to avoid getting soapy water on my face, or shampoo, and it still came off with water. What it did leave behind is a yellowing tint. I think they use henna in the ingredients for this pen and that is what leaves a yellow tint on the skin. I still had to use my eyeliner to fill in the brows, but this pen did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Rubs off. No tattoo action whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I wish the dark brown a little bit darker to blend better with my natural eyebrow color. The product last until you wash  your face, so just one day.  Still a great product since it does stay on all day .</li>
    <li> At this point I don&#x27;t even want this item.</li>
    <li> If you wash your face at night like any normal person, this will wash off. I don&#x27;t know what this 7 day stuff is all about. THAT BEING SAID...I still like it, because it has the tiniest little brush that is amazing at filling in and shaping my brows by what you could pass off as individual hairs. I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> its like a hena tatto . looks really good , make sure to get a darker color than your natural one . once the naxt day the color will fade lighter .  !</li>
    <li> Came w/o directions.  Went on line to find them.  Followed directions, &amp;#34;put on at night&amp;#34;.  Next morning, now brows! Waste of money.  May have to try again but as of now, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money.  Also, if it worked, would be nice if it came in darker colors.</li>
    <li> Using this as instructed- on cleansed dry face. I don&#x27;t find this lasting longer than the day, definitely not days.  But it does last without rubbing or washing off to easily for the entire day.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Just like regular eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I like it sooo much .its stay a long time</li>
    <li> this thing didn&#x27;t last long at all. I used it every day for maybe 3 or 4 days and the ink seems to be gone. Also this crap does not stay on, going back to a regular cheaper eyebrow pencil. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Did not last that long.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for half day or one day.  mine, never last more than one day!</li>
    <li> This took a long time to arrive. When I first used it, it looked great. Perfect dark brown color, and the fine tip makes application look very natural. However, this certainly did NOT last anywhere close to even 1 day. It washed off when I washed my face that night. I can rub it off if I try. But, it looks very nice when applied. Just not a long lasting pencil at all. Also, it seems that there is hardly any product inside the tube at all. After just 3 applications, it seems to be running out already. I have shaken it, and tried to get more product out, but now I can only do one eyebrow, then there is not enough product on the applicator. No idea how to get more out of the tube. A waste of money. It&#x27;s a nice product, if it actually lasted longer, and if there was enough product in there that it didn&#x27;t run out after 3 uses. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ran out in less than a week!</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfied...don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> I bought many already....</li>
    <li> There is nothing lasting about it.</li>
    <li> I definitely love using this brow pen!. Helps me achieve that well defined arch.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but doesn&#x27;t work. Stays on for a day just like regular make up and then washes off next morning in the shower. I used it anyways though so it wouldn&#x27;t go to waist and I ran out with in a week. Waist of money for such a small amount of product that doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t last 7 days...maybe 4-5 but still better than drawing them on every day. I used to dye my eyebrows but this is more convenient. Will order again.</li>
    <li> 7 days? Absolutely not. In my case, it washed off after one shower. Because of that false claim, I had to give it four stars instead of five. However, as far as eyebrow pencils/pens go, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. The tip is so fine that I can draw individual hairs that look completely realistic. And there&#x27;s no smearing or running, even after mild sweating. The color (dark brown) blends perfectly with my existing eyebrows. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i used on some client and the during was less that the brand anuncied,&lt;br /&gt;In the same day was off of her eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;i Wanted more results and during</li>
    <li> I am a week into using this product. I have had to reapply everyday. I have not scrubbed my eyebrows at all. Only rinsed that section of my face with water and dabbed to dry. The product does not stay on dark enough for my taste after water hits it. If you are looking for something to apply for a day at the beach or boating or something so you are not left completely eyebrow less...I suppose this product works. BUT it WILL fade if it gets wet and people will realize you had something on your eyebrows because it is significantly lighter. I will continue to use it. It does stay on better for the day than any other product I have found if you are not doing water activities. I suppose I&#x27;m used to reapplying everyday anyway.</li>
    <li> Color was not as expected, and the color lasts max 2 days. My skin is dry, and I only moisturized after applying the pen so I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with having oily skin. I think if you wash your face at least once a day, this pen lasts about 2 days but even still the color fades. I also got shipped the wrong color, so I don&#x27;t know if that affects how dark I would prefer the color to be.</li>
    <li> it has a great color, but on my does last no more that maybe 12 hours.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m a sweater and for the most part the product stays. Yes if you&#x27;re sweating you will wipe a little away, but dab instead. Also I pair with &amp;#34;model in a bottle&amp;#34; you can find here also on amazon.</li>
    <li> It took me couple of trials to figure out how it to works with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have normal/combination skin. My forehead gets oily overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very first trial was scary because I like my eyebrows to look natural. So, I drew my eyebrows in lightly and carefully after reading the directions. I was very disappointed at first because thought it didn&#x27;t work because everything washed off the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it again after reading reviews saying that it doesn&#x27;t have long staying power on oily skin. So, for the second trial, I drew them in with a little more confidence. My eyebrows looked as if I drew them in with Sharpie (I didn&#x27;t want to scare my husband so I waited until he was asleep. lol). I was very happy with my second trial after rinsing my face in the morning. I&#x27;m going to purchase more!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these to last a week as they claim so my expectations were adjusted.  But, these do last longer than just the regular pencils.  For hot days, this pencil will do the trick.  The dark brown is a good color and blends well with my near-black eyebrows.  I plan to get more.</li>
    <li> It works good and the color shows well on African American skin tone.  It comes out in a liquid form as would a liquid eyeliner. It last 2 1/2 days for me but I also put it on sparingly and mixed it with my other brow products for a softer look.</li>
    <li> Does it last 7 days: NO, it lasts one and a half days if you don&#x27;t scrub it or wash your brows on the first day, just clean your face around with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it as a everyday makeup: YES, cause it does last the whole day and it has a fine tip, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an ok product, I mean, it stains your skin a little, so you can keep applying and following your first trace (if you don&#x27;t have very steady hands)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again tho, I rather save my money to spend a little more when I find one that really works as advertised</li>
    <li> I bought one for my sister and she did a great job with the application that I just had to get one for myself!  Didn&#x27;t look as good on me since I have darker hair. The darkest shade was dramatically different from my natural eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and a great match for dark brown/ black hair, only problem is the next day it does leave a stain on your brows [ light reddish stain]. The stain itself reminds me of Henna because of its color, I was not able to rinse the stain with either an oil based or cream makeup remover. It&#x27;s not an issue for me seeing as I apply my brows everyday and when I do apply this product it it lasts for at least 6-9 hours. It takes me about 2 minutes to apply and no touch ups needed.</li>
    <li> It has a beautiful color.  However, it only lasted until the end of the day not 7 days.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would last longer but it wipes off really easily if you sweat at all.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations, it smudged and wore off as easily as any other.</li>
    <li> I bought the Dark brown and I really like it, the color gets lighter the next day so you will have to do it again if you want it to look dark brown.  It works for me!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than those stupid pencils that dry out. It&#x27;s easier to apply, and it  looks so much more natural, too.</li>
    <li> The details says 3 to 7 days.... It lasts about 3-4 days. Has made my life a whole lot easier. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone suffering through drawing on brows daily. You want the skin where your brows are to be clean and dry...no lotion. I&#x27;ve touched it and it stays put and I&#x27;m pretty sire if will work in the pool or on the beach.</li>
    <li> I love this! I love how easy it is to create individual looking eyebrow strokes, because my brows are very thin and sparse. When the color first goes on it looks a little orangey or a hint of red BUT after about 1 minute it was dark brown! Awesome! I will be ordering more of these! No more pencil for me! The brush is perfect also! Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay it has been a few days of using this and I want to just make a few more comments to those interested: the ink does last about 2-3 days on my skin, it fades a little but it&#x27;s still there, you&#x27;d probably have to go back over it to make it darker. My skin is very oily though so if its dryer, you might not have to. I noticed that even while working out, taking a nap, scratching my face the ink does a great job of staying put. I took a shower the first night with it on and I had washed my face in the shower and it was still on. I had to scrub harder to get it off afterwards just to see how much it would take to remove it. It&#x27;s great. Really I love is product. I have such think barely there eyebrows and the first thing my sister and boyfriend told me was \\&quot;wow it looks like real hairs\\&quot; after doing little individual strokes with the brush. I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/17/13: it&#x27;s been over a month or so since I&#x27;ve been using the same pen, I am still obsessed with this pen and will be ordering a new one soon. The pen itself has help up very nicely, the tip hasn&#x27;t bent or dulled. I&#x27;m very impressed, The ink doesn&#x27;t last as long on my skin anymore, it&#x27;s still lasts all day but washes off in the shower at night, I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s 90 degrees in Texas or because the chemical agent making it last is slowly running out. Either way, it&#x27;s still literally the best pen I&#x27;ve ever had for my eyebrows. If you do it right, light feather strokes (look up reviews on YouTube if you&#x27;d like!) it&#x27;s so amazing. I&#x27;m scared to try another brand but this one works just fine for me!!</li>
    <li> This semi permanent eyebrow pen is welcome into my cosmetic bag.  It really does stay on longer than your typical eyebrow liqid liner.  Would purchase again.  However possibly in a darker color, color seems to run lighter than advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s watery... I put it on, let it dry and wipe it off. This is not permanent or long lasting. It&#x27;s like a watery ink marker.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just followed the instruction on the back of the box. It lasted not 7 days but it lasted 3~4days. When I first got it and tried it after wash/remove make-up, it seemed little bit too dark for me. But next morning it looked great real natural looking. I am actually so excited about this product. I am sure i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I always used powder of the antasia brow wiz but i stopped doing either after I received this product. The brush really mimics hairs and its so easy to use. It takes a lot less time to apply than the previously mentioned methods. It its also long tasting. It does not last me 7 days as advertised but i do have oily skin so if something lasts all day I am more than sated. I am going to buy the lighter one next time because the darker one was a little too dark for my brunette hair. The darker one did work wonders on my raven haired sister.</li>
    <li> I use the darkest color because the light is too light.  Then I have to powder it to tone the color, and shine down.  It goes on with ease but does not last past 24 hrs.  Needs to be applied daily but only takes seconds to do.  It can be shiny so I put powder on top.  Works well.  I am blonde with fair skin.</li>
    <li> Works good for me I&#x27;ve used them for yr now</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 star however it only lasts about 5 uses. The color is nice, I got the dark. I would compare this to the Anastasia brow felt tip pen. It does not last 7 days, not even if you didn&#x27;t wash your face, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to so I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The pencil is the right color for my asian eyebrows but it doesn&#x27;t come out very well. It doesn&#x27;t fade on me throughout the day so that is nice.</li>
    <li> It was nice while it lasted, maybe&lt;br /&gt;a week,  but the pen dried out too quickly.</li>
    <li> Stays on for a long time, easy to use I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again if I need this.</li>
    <li> I love the way it glides on and the color is perfect when it is applied.. My complaint is that it does not hold up to it&#x27;s declaration of staying on for 7 days. It comes off overnight as it fades to a very pale brown, almost orangey in color. It has to be applied everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the dark brown I ordered.  It matches so well and i love the super fine tip of the pen.  The tip allows for me to mimic hair strokes very well.  My only complaint is that the product doesnt last 7 days, and doesnt last even a fay really if you wash your face.  Even though the pen doesnt last as ling as seven days I will most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product does not have the staying power as advertised. The product itself is easy to use, even looks okay on, but still rubs off. It does work better than your average pencil, but definitely not 7 days. I think this product would work much better to fill in sparse brows verses creating a line with next to no hair. Having some hair would probably help it stay. The color seems true to description, the dark is quite dark. I just wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easy. I would love a product you apply once a day and just short of cloroxing your face, would not come off. Oh well, still searching for my miracle product.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s perfect eyebrow pen stay very long. I will buy more of this product keep making more and more I need it :)</li>
    <li> Once the brows are drawn, it stays almost for three days, though I touch up every night (just at the edge where there is less brow hair). I usually draw brows with brown and graphite shadows/pencils, so \\&quot;Natural Brown\\&quot; is a little lighter for me. I&#x27;ve ordered a Dark Brown. The seller is excellent, too, and the shipment arrived super quickly!!!</li>
    <li> This product it good. It does last long but I would NOT say 7 days long. Maby 24 hours, which is still good considering it is hard to find a product that even lasts just 24 hours. I use it to fill in my eyebrows. Because I have tattooed eyebrows, I use this to make fading spots stand out better. The tip of it is good and definitely does take practice to use it because once you put it on, it is hard to was off immediately to make corrections if you make a line too long. I am pleased with this product and would buy it again. The only issue I have with this is that it does not come in black, only dark brown. It would be great if they had a black or smokey product for us black hair&#x27;d women, so that it can match my hair color. I just use this then add a little black eye brow pencil from Maybelline on top of it then blend it a bit with an eye brow brush and it sets well. Does not smudge or fade off oily, I even left it on one night while I was sleeping and it was still there in the morning. (not as dark as when I first applied it tho) Package came fast, 2 days after ordering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work! Bad decision! I needed for my eye brown but it did not work, it was complely dry!</li>
    <li> Former cancer patient who&#x27;s eyebrows did not come back in. Not a fan of this product at all. Much lighter than expected, very watery so you have to go over it and over and over it and it does not stay on for 7 days, 1 if your lucky. Henna make up a much better choice. Definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow creater I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, it wipes completely off when you wash your face.  It doesn&#x27;t do a semi-tattoo at all, and I can&#x27;t understand why it has that in it&#x27;s name.  I have oily skin.  Maybe it stays after washing for people with dry skin, but I doubt it.  I don&#x27;t care, though, because the pointy little applicator is absolutely perfect for painting on tiny little hairs.  I&#x27;ve always wanted something like this and will be recommending it to everyone I know who doesn&#x27;t have eyebrows.  I work in a cancer infusion center, so that will be a lot of people I will be recommending it to!  And I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and there is no indication yet that it is running out.  Hopefully it will last at least a month.  Even if it lasts just two weeks, I would buy it again.  It cracks me up how the entire &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; on it state, &amp;#34;Fill the gap between the eyebrow.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The dark brown is a great color for me--I am fair and my hair color is espresso and sugar (much nicer than salt &amp; pepper:)).  The fine line brush works very well; it has a feathery touch.  It looks very realistic and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;drawn on\\&quot; look.  The package was crushed, but the pen was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT there is no way this would last 7 days.  It does last all day; but for me, it is gone by the next morning.  I followed all the instructions and do not have oily skin.  I use Peter Thomas Roth products; but didn&#x27;t scrub my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy another one. I might go back to my usual pencil when this is finished.  I want to see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t come close to preforming as advertised.  Product states it will last up to 7 days but you&#x27;re lucky if it last 1 day.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have thin brows and I use this to darken prior to using a smudge proof brow-liner and it stays on until I remove my make up.  It even holds up during my workout!!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for something like this for years. I can fill in thin areas or color white hairs. This looks so natural.</li>
    <li> It just ok for me to using it.</li>
    <li> This was NOT waterproof and turned blue after a while...</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can draw individual hairs to make it look natural but sometimes it is hard to control the thickness of the brush.  You have to have a steady hand.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but definitely not good for 7 days. The fine tip is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> The product specs say it lasts 7 days; it didn&#x27;t last more than ONE day.  I awoke on the second day and it was all gone.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Good product, certainly doesn&#x27;t last 7 days on me.  I have tattoed brows that have faded and use this until I can get a touch up.  You can draw fine, hairlike strokes which look very natural.</li>
    <li> My pen was empty!!!  It was a waste of money on product and shipping!  I didn&#x27;t get even one use out of it!  I threw it out!!!  Would not recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> It does stay on but the ink seems a little dry, i.e., it doesn&#x27;t draw on all the time so I have to use it in conjunction with my pencil liner. I would recommend using Maybelline Brow Drama over this one.</li>
    <li> This is a total waste of money - junk!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be more of a henna or stain. More like liquid eyebrow pencil. Nice brush, easy application, and shipped quickly. Today is the first time using it so I am not certain if I will buy again but it could be worse.</li>
    <li> The dark brown is too light for my complexion but, it lasted longer than any other product I ever used before.</li>
    <li> **** Update, this company was the nicest most wonderful company I have done business with in a long time. I appreciated their quick response, and making sure they have a happy customer. I will use this company again for my cosmetics. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this company is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About this product the brush tip of pencil (thought it would be felt tipped) is as soft as a feather, so it&#x27;s very hard to draw small strokes without the tip bending. It seriously will bend if you breathe on it. The product wipes right off no matter how long it sets on the skin. It was used on clean, non oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly the same as using a wipe off marker on a white board. Those markers that look permanent,but wipe right off with your finger. It took ZERO effort to wipe off with the tip of a finger, lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this product is the color was perfect, not too brown, not too orange, a real natural dark brown. If you need something that looks natural for photographs this would work really well, as long as you don&#x27;t touch the product on your face.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this product arrived on my mail.  I was soooo dissapointed hoping that this will really last long, I immediately tried it on my brows and wait for about 5 mins. to dry... by the way this is not the kind of pencil that you can sharpen, this has ink and with felt tip.  After it dried I rub it lightly to test as other said that it last for 3 days... Wow to my surprise it disappeared right after I rubbed it lightly.  Dont waste your money on this... Try Mally eyebrow pencil, expensive and yet foolproof.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried many things on my eyebrows and this is by far the best. I literally gave birth (12 hours in labor) and my brows looked as good as they did when I applied this product 24 hours before. No, it doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, but it does last a couple if you don&#x27;t wash too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light, thin brows as a result of over plucking when I was a teenager. I have had them tattooed in the past as well, but that is a very expensive and painful procedure that only lasts for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it says lasts up to 7 days, I would be happy with 3-4, but this thing barely lasts 7 hours and then your brows look dirty after because of the tiny spots left on... Waste of money :(</li>
    <li> I over plucked my brows when I was younger and have always struggled with keeping them filled in and looking natural.  This product is great, but certainly does not last 7 days for me.  Even two days is a great help.  I will keep using.  Just had to experiment a little with the colors as one was too light and one was too dark.  I use the light one and a tiny bit of the darker one.</li>
    <li> They say it lasts 7 days? That is not true. It only lasted a day on me.</li>
    <li> i liked it , but this isnt as stated , this doesnt last 7 days not even 1 day , maybe u can say its a waterproof pencil ,&lt;br /&gt;i just liked it because the color matched my eyebrow perfectly , and its so thin, so i was able to draw hair by hair ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m korean. This product is from Korea so I thought it would work on my skin. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The product is very precise because of the felt tip. But it doesn&#x27;t stay on like it said it would. I read the instructions and applied the liquid on my eyebrows after I had washed my face, left it on over night, and yet in the morning when I wash my face it came off and left no trace of making my eyebrows looking more filled or darker.</li>
    <li> I love this product ordered from reviews. I order first the light and was too light then I ordered the darker color was great! takes a little time and a steady hand make sure it dries then stay nice.</li>
    <li> i just edited my four star rating down to one. i order the pens four or five at time since shipping takes several weeks (well over a month). when the pens are fresh they work great, but two of the four pens i ordered on my last shipment are completely DRY. they&#x27;re cheap and all, and i appreciate that, but i would rather pay more for a U.S. brand than have to take my chances with a foreign vendor. i sent an email to the vendor and i&#x27;ll see how they respond. i would like replacements that actually work. if it doesn&#x27;t go to my satisfaction i will go back to STILA.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stay on for those 7 days, it fades away, I need to touch it up each day, but it&#x27;s easier than&lt;br /&gt;doing your brows from scratch each morning.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and I foolishly bought 3 of them based on another person&#x27;s review. Not only does it not stay for 7 days, it did not even withstand one washing.</li>
    <li> I like these. Very thin tipped pen. Definitely doesn&#x27;t last 7 days but does last at least the entire night which is a lot for most eyebrow wear.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very light. Thin coverage.  Looks like a marker.</li>
    <li> Found a winner here! I drew it on around 6 pm it looked like magic marker left it all night and when I washed my face in the morning my eyebrows looked great but still a tad light so I repeated the process and let me tell you I shower daily this is day 5 and I havent had to use pencil at all! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love love. Great stroke.</li>
    <li> excellent! I don&#x27;t need real tattoo</li>
    <li> stays on for 3 days 😃. Easy application.</li>
    <li> I love this pen! I have very oily skin, so most eyebrow pencils and inks don&#x27;t last long for me. They often smudge and disappear, especially in areas of my brow where I don&#x27;t have hair! I tried henna ink for eyebrows, took a shower and came out with the ink running! This product however, is amazing! I can apply it in the morning, have a busy work day on my feet, shower and it still looks great. (It&#x27;ll smudge if it&#x27;s damp after the shower, but is fine after it dries) I can even wear it overnight without seeing it on my pillow. The pen doesn&#x27;t have a super long life, but honestly, it&#x27;s worth purchasing if you&#x27;re super self conscious about your barely-there-brows, like I am.</li>
    <li> Oh my this stuff is great! It took a while to get it, but I loved it.  Its a prefect shade of brown, not too dark and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this type of product forever. Eyebrows look natural, not like you used a Sharpe. 7 Days? Yeah that aint true but the product is so amazing a day will do for me! If u have questions.....  https://www.facebook.com/ThaliaDoesMakeUp</li>
    <li> this says it stays on for a week wrong no even a whole day would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;this item to anyone</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions carefully and was very disappointed when I woke up and only saw traces of the brows I so carefully applied. I have used it twice since then, morning and evening, to see if more than one application would leave a stain. It doesn&#x27;t. In short, the product does not do as promised. I gave it two stars because I like the color and it goes on easily enough for me.</li>
    <li> The color tended to turn reddish.</li>
    <li> i love this very much, i have a problem with my eyebrows almost being non-existant. this stains my eyebrow area that i draw on, like henna. i still have to aply it every day to make sure they are dark, but now i don&#x27;t look too weird wihout anything on, becuase there is a light stain over my eyebrows. i&#x27;m sure it would be really awesome for people with a little more eye brow than me, helps just stain in a little more full. anyway i do love it!</li>
    <li> The pen shape and is so small, I have been able to fill in for individual missing hairs and it looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t smear or streak, but it is cold weather here so I do not know what summer would bring. The dark brown color is great for my black eyebrows. It blends well and does a fantastic job covering grays. Only downside, it does not stay on for 7 days. And, I really wish it would so I could save time in the morning. Instead, it seems to disappear every night and have to be reapplied the following day.</li>
    <li> Goes on over existing brows, but does not last 7 days, and turns an ugly yellow brown in one day.</li>
    <li> This is not a good product and you should remove it from your site, it does not last 7 days it does not last a day it will come off the same day that you put it on as a matter of fact I had to shake the pen to get the liquid to come to the tip. I will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t last 7 days.  It washes away easily</li>
    <li> Love this pencil dynamite I want another one would love this color in black. Great great great outstanding please contact me if you get this in black</li>
    <li> Washes off easily after regular daily face wash.</li>
    <li> Did not work. I drew my eyebrows on with the marker, like I would with a eyebrow liner pencil, and within an hour or two it had smudged. Then completely washed off. Didn&#x27;t last 7 days let alone 1 hour! I will stick with my eyebrow dyeing kit.</li>
    <li> It does not last 7 days even little smudge gets it off.</li>
    <li> It is not waterproof and it doesn&#x27;t stay long at all. Very disappointed. Nice color but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I am in Love with this pen, it last so long on my eyebrow touch up slightly and it stays forever , it is the right color for my blone hair, so pretty.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this was sitting in a warehouse, but I can tell you, mine arrived dry. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be dripping wet, but when applying it, hardly any liquid came out at all.  Besides that, the color is too light for me. If I use it at all, it will be used as an eyeliner under my eyes. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on it.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Stays All day. But won&#x27;t stay on all 7 days. :(</li>
    <li> It stays on all day and works great!  In the ad--it sounds like it will stay on for 7 days and does not need to be reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would stay on longer--but I still would recommend it and will order it again</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money, After a couple of use its empty...&lt;br /&gt;Product is not as advertised in my opinion ..but its your money.&lt;br /&gt;I always try to leave an honest opinion.Plus i had to wait a decade lol for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the darkest color. I have olive, oily skin.  This product didn&#x27;t even last close to 7 days. More like 2 face washes. The color was true. It went on almost black and it is very fine. Overall I like it because it still last longer than the average eyebrow pen, which is 1 day, or 1 face wash.</li>
    <li> WRONG!!!!!! JUST WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I tried 3 days in a row to make natural eyebrows tattoo without pain part&lt;br /&gt;unless you want bright orange eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY!&lt;br /&gt;I Think they don&#x27;t  even tested before sell</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  This stains just your brows yellow after washing.</li>
    <li> Color is too dark. the ink does not come out easily so you have to flip it for awhile.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come close to lasting a week, but looks great for a few days - and definitely great for long days! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Definitely not 7-day... not even overnight, but this is the BEST brow marker of them all! I&#x27;ve tried NYX, Colormark Touchback, and some others, and this one: looks just like your brow hairs when applied correctly, is the easiest to apply, matches the closest (my shade is dark brown, this is the truest match I&#x27;ve seen), is water-resistant, is relatively cheap, and lasts a good bit (lasted me two months+ of daily use). I love it!</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t last 7 days... maybe 24 hours.</li>
    <li> No, the tint doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, BUT it&#x27;s perfect for a day at the beach when you&#x27;re sans makeup and need a waterproof brow filler and even better for daily wear. You can touch and rub your eyebrows all day without having to worry about removing the color-fantastic!</li>
