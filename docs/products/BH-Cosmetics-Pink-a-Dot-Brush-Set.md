<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> got these as a gift and i love it exactly like the picture cant wait to use them :D</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush set so soft on the face.</li>
    <li> SUPER SOFT BRUSHES! THEY WORK EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I loved this came on time They are super soft they work soo great !!!! Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Great bargain. These are great brushes and cute. Shipped fast and have all basic brushes needed.</li>
    <li> These are really high quality brushes for the price. I am not a professional make up artist and these are just for personal use. I love how soft they are. The brushes are thick and really help me apply my make up with more coverage and skill.</li>
    <li> These are so soft, I love them. The tube is so cute, but I didn&#x27;t realize how small they were, they&#x27;re travel size brushes. The handles are kind of short, but it isn&#x27;t too bad. The softness of the bristles and how well they&#x27;re made makes up for it. It&#x27;s a decent brush set for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes and the quality seems great! I am so excited to use them. I received my order 2 days after I placed it. Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Shipping came on time and everything was packaged very well so that nothing spilled out or broke. The brush case is so cute and compact and fits the brushes perfectly! Some of the brushes work better than others and some work better using them in a different way than they are intended to be used. For me, the brushes are suuuper cute and the perfect size! Great for every day use and for travel as well! If you&#x27;re looking for a brush set that has everything you need in one cute travel brush set, I say get it!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made! I don&#x27;t like them at all. $25, I wasted. These brushes are useless. They feel cheap, and there horrible quality. You can find better brushes on here for less.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! As someone who&#x27;s had both expensive and very very cheap, I can definitely say these are well worth the price- which is more than reasonable. You have a multitude of different brush options that are of, from what I&#x27;ve seen, very high quality and very cute design! I have had minimal to no shedding and fairly easy cleaning. And I love the carrier case- I&#x27;m so bad at keeping up with makeup brushes. With the cute little round, I can simply put them in, click the latches, and slip it in my purse. Love these and will be exploring more BH products in the future for sure!</li>
    <li> Love, Love the brushes!! Very easy to use and so soft. When I clean them they are just like new.</li>
    <li> I first bought this brush set mainly for the fan brush alone but quickly have fallen in love with the whole set. the colors are beautiful and the brushes are so very well made. Such soft bristles that place your powder products with such ease. This is my 3rd set of BH Cosmetics brushes and I am sure will not be my last especially if they continue to make such great quality and attractive brushes</li>
    <li> Love this brush set.  It was a gift for a a beauty novice.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes so soft and pretty... I wish the handles were longer but I can get past that... The container however is harsh because of the smell I don&#x27;t like that but otherwise I&#x27;m in LOVE</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow flat brush is too big it is difficult to use and eyeliner brush I don&#x27;t like it at all .&lt;br /&gt;Other brushes is fair good .</li>
    <li> Great brushes, would highly recommend them and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have some mixed feelings on this brush set. I really love the roll case for travel. It is the perfect way to protect the brushes and I also put my liners in with them. The crease shadow refiner brush is amazing. It is even better in my opinion than the travel IT cosmetics for Ulta double ended brush set crease brush. The quality and density of the brushes are where I am mixed. I feel like they are good quality but like ecotools and e.l.f. Brushes better for softness yet firmness of the hairs. I have not yet found a great use for the biggest brush, the fan brush. Smaller brushes are so similar not sure that all are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good but with some caveats.</li>
    <li> Cute, stylish,unusual and sturdy .worth every penny. Sassystulla</li>
    <li> Great brush set received them today and had to redo my makeup just to test them......I&#x27;m in love with these brushes already the only downfall is the cup part feels a little flimsy but the brushes are great!!!!! Worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Soft. Really quality</li>
    <li> very soft and good quality. the case is perfect for traveling or just to keep it on top of your dresser and it looks so pretty</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic.  I purchased these brushes 9 months ago and they are still like new.  They don&#x27;t shed and mine did not have the strong chemical smell that some people have complained about.  The container is really cute (as are the brushed themselves) and don&#x27;t take up a big footprint on your bathroom counter.  I leave them open on the counter all the time and when I travel I just grab the lid, put it on and it is ready to go.  It is super convenient.  I loved them so much I bought some for my sister and niece for Christmas and they love them too.  They have every kind of make up and non professional could want.  I especially think these are a must have for anyone learning to put on make up.  Discovering  and experimenting with all the different sized brushes just makes putting on make up super fun.  They are a great gift option for any super hard to shop for teenage girl or adult girl for that matter.</li>
    <li> Soft yet sturdy easily washable , only con their is no description on what or where to use the brushes but eyes and face brushes are easily distinguishable love the case quite compact the fan brush is excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a different feel in the material of these brushes. I feel like the  material is not going to last long.</li>
    <li> Best brushes they work perfect and they look good</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell- but no fallout from my brushes. The fan brush, though, is quite thick if you ever wanted to use it for highlighting. I would compare the brushes to the quality of Ecotools.</li>
    <li> Missing some brushes.. but other than that they are good to have..</li>
    <li> Extremely soft and great for blending</li>
    <li> love bh cosmetics this is my 3rd brush set from them i order this one cause it comes with more bush than the 2nd one i order from them its so easier to carry and applies make-up beautifully</li>
    <li> Omgoodness these brushes are soooo wonderful. They are soft very pretty and fun to look at. And the construction of the brushes and material used allows your makeup to look wonderful! the only thing that I wish is that BH cosmetics would write the names on the brushes of each brush! would defiantly purchase again!!!!!!!!!! Oh yea I look for fullness of brushes and they are very full and DOES NOT SHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEA!!!!!! Bought some brushes from Mac was very very very disappointed! As Mac is super overrated in my opnion</li>
    <li> Very soft brush, really good product</li>
    <li> Thank you very much it is in great condition and it&#x27;s beautiful! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift for a coworker. I was so impressed, I got one for myself. Brushes are great for the price.</li>
    <li> Loves these brushes, use them all the time and they are so soft. Plus so cute!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the absolute best! they are the greatest deal you can find online They are super soft and the ultimate fan brush works great to remove fall out from shadows and to apply a pressed powder after liquid foundation for that matte look. I would most definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Wish it came with a description of which brush to use for a beginner like me!</li>
    <li> Great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: fast shipping, all the brushes we&#x27;re in packaging not to much shedding. Travel sized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smelled really bad of chemical even after being washed.&lt;br /&gt;Would of received 5 stars but the chemical smell is rough.</li>
    <li> Cute brushes arrived super quick, just in time for a trip I had. Set has everything you need.</li>
    <li> Awesome set. Everything you need is in here and the brushes are so full and soft! The case is also a bonus, keeps everything in place an its small enough to fit in my purse!</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly, The smell was terrible but I would recommend always washing new brushes before using them. These washed great no issues. No shedding. The face brushes are ok I doubt I will use them that often. I prefer my eco tools or real techniques face brushes. The angled contour brush is great though. Fan brush is to big to really get a good precise highlight with. I threw the container (the reason for the horrible smell.) away, but the clips and everything on it worked fine. the eye shadow brushes specifically the fluffy blending brush are great have used them everyday since getting it. Overall I would buy again and recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These are some of the cutest brushes and they&#x27;re very soft. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Love this! The order shipped fast and arrived a day or so early than what was estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes themselves they&#x27;re pretty awesome! They are nice and soft yet dense. They apply and blend my makeup very well. Even with all of the brushes that come with it there&#x27;s still room in the case for me to fit a few extra brushes in there for travel.</li>
    <li> The softest brushes ever. The pink color is beautiful.  Priced just right, I love them.</li>
    <li> Received my package earlier than I anticipated &amp; I&#x27;m excited to use them.</li>
