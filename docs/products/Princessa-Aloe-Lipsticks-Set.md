<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great colors but comes off easily.</li>
    <li> These are all really pretty lipsticks. Its difficult to purchase lipstick as they are never the color on as they are in the tube. I like neutral colors. Most of these I can use, and what I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll give to my daughters. For the price you can&#x27;t beat the deal! One tube of lipstick is the price of this. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> its nice lipstick i just wish i didnt have to keep rubbing to get the clor</li>
    <li> The order arrived within a few days - the items were intact and not damaged.  However, the lipstick is not long-lasting.  It is ok.</li>
    <li> Lipstick in great colors, but doesn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Excellent an on time very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> awful!!! i got weird colors. i wanted shades of pink like in the picture, but i got rainbow mood lipstick. wth. it doesnt even make sense. i got purple,pink, green, blue, orange and yellow. i just dont understand what went wrong here....</li>
    <li> Glossy sheen but with enough color Really like these</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have the colors in the picture. I still liked it.</li>
    <li> At first they look cheap but they&#x27;re actually extremely good! They&#x27;re all similar in color but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> very good! colors are so great! /buen producto</li>
    <li> My wife says she loves this product.</li>
    <li> the colors are very light</li>
    <li> amazing color, creme easy apllication and stay power. I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> More of a lip gloss then lipstick the colors they sent are basically all the same doesn&#x27;t really show on your lips</li>
    <li> I had expected that these colors would be darker than what they came in, but I&#x27;m not afraid to mix and blend colors. These apply easily and blend beautifully. They aren&#x27;t that long-lasting, but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> the lipstick as a whole suck.</li>
    <li> They were not any thing like what I expected.  When I ordered them they were dark colors, mauve and not 6 pink and a orange. I was very dissatisfied  .Bea Grindell</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Loving all the colors.</li>
    <li> very good , I love it</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are very nice and they feel nice as well. The shipment came 4 days earlier than expected which was really awesome and the product is great, it looks really nice on and all the colors are very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Not much color. Very transparent. Needs to go over your lips at least 10 times to show some color. Smells very nice. Very smooth on your lips. . Needs to be reapply many times. Many of the colors are ugly and out of fashion, but a couple of them are pretty.</li>
    <li> All colors look good on me. I&#x27;m brown skin with a red undertone. The lipsticks have a nice variety of naturals, pinks, and purples.</li>
    <li> I hate the colors. None of them looks nice on me and you have to apply every 20 mins</li>
    <li> Love them!  Apply smoothly and stays on!</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift, thanks.</li>
    <li> Iam a makeup nut.i love to experiment.I recommend sets like this to experiment,and have fun</li>
    <li> Cheap. I really dont need to say more. It was melted when I got them. They also chapped my lips.</li>
    <li> Not the best lipsticks</li>
    <li> i dont really expect much from this product after i read all the reviews but what i love about this is that it is actually cheap for a set of 12 shades of lipstick. It is more like a sampler that you can use everyday. the shades that i got was actually nice. more on pink shades and i love it. it doesnt last long on your lips but i can say its a good purchase for a great price</li>
    <li> My lipstick came today and one of the lipsticks #12 to be exact, was missing from the box. So not happy</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them. They smell weird and they all look the same</li>
    <li> just what i have been looking for</li>
    <li> Honestly this lipstick set is pretty decent for the price. They go on smooth and are a bit shinier finish. Although the colors look diverse many of them go on the same or very similar, they are in the light red/orange spectrum. Even the ones I hoped would be darker were pretty light. I will likely keep and use them all though. They are also pretty thin and need a few passes for more intense color. All in all if you want to experiment with this color set it&#x27;s a good set to try especially for the price. I did get a few hrs out of the wear without reapply also.</li>
    <li> not the best quality but great for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this but received something else, but from what I DID receive I love the colors! But if i had received this i would love it even more.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with this order. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I would not recommend to buy the colors don&#x27;t show on your lips their more like chap stick.</li>
    <li> I only ordered one set and was sent three.  I was very surprised when I saw the warning &amp;#34;this product may cause Cancer&amp;#34;! What a surprise.  I didn&#x27;t think Amazon would sell this product!  Thanks Cindy Tillquist</li>
    <li> Makeup, is really good</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and creamy! I would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great color choices. These lipsticks have a very smooth application. They aren&#x27;t long lasting like some others but of course easy to take along for re-application. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> the colour was not bright</li>
    <li> The product is okay you cannot complain for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors and stays on pretty well!</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed.  The lipsticks set are not the same at the ilustration. Not the colors that I wanted.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t show too well but still nice</li>
    <li> I didnt really like the product</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are very creamy to the touch but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as I&#x27;d like. I have to rub them on my lips a few times just to get the desired color on my lips. They are more like tinted chapstick.</li>
    <li> Most of them were melted by the time I got them.</li>
    <li> So upset the lipstick quality is not as great as I thought ! It doesn&#x27;t go on and breaks and had to throw away a few already because they literally break as I put the product on :/ so upsetting</li>
    <li> The product needs to be applied between occasionally and frequently. This comes on VERY smooth and when applied the colors are not as strong of a color its almost like a lip-gloss with a little added color to it but there is a distinctive difference in color for each of them and worth buying if your like me, and like to change the color of your lips everyday, sometimes just wanna a simple color but want it to be a little noticeable, then, this is the product for you. love it thank you for shipping on time too.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick, however it is really soft and doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of the higher quality lipsticks might. I do love that I got so many colors for such a low price though, I&#x27;ll probably wear this for my daily makeup so that I can save my more expensive colors for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to buy it since it was $6 . So the ones that are brown, when applying them they appear Orange on my lips. But the pinks and reds look nice on my lips. One did break when I put it on. A lot of the shades are very similar color. For the price not gonna complain. Buy at your own risk. Quality is okay and applies well.</li>
    <li> Appeared darker one I got them</li>
    <li> The product was very light and barely visible. It also stated on the package that it could cause cancer. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister as a birthday gift!  I personally didn&#x27;t use them. However she said that they were super creamy and that they had good staying power.. she also tells me that they moisturize very well because of the aloe. TheY are very pigmented and she is very happy with them! Score one for the best birthday gift ever!</li>
    <li> Cheap to oily to light better at 99€ store</li>
    <li> I received this product on time. The colors are so beautiful and they look great on. You have to put a few coats on for the color to really show but the actual lipstick stays on so well and feels very creamy, unlike others lipsticks I&#x27;ve used. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> These are really light and watery, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. Not pigmented enough, they have the feel of the cheap makeup you buy for 6 to 8 year old girls.</li>
    <li> No complains. I have read the (very useful) previous review and know what to expect from the product. Colors are clear, what I like. They don&#x27;t last to long on the lips, but it is really not a big deal, despite is what they promise. But they do a good working moisturizing my lips and fit well on my bag.</li>
    <li> I like the varied colors but only wish I could have selected lighter shades.</li>
    <li> it does not go on vary will and is more like a lip gloss kind of thing&lt;br /&gt;BUT it did come with everything,and it came on time.</li>
    <li> Not the same colors as pictured. Did arrive early. It still has a couple cute colors</li>
    <li> Just a typical lipstick. It&#x27;s a cream type which accentuates the flaws of my lips. It dries my lipd, too.</li>
    <li> They look great but go on like cheap lip balm</li>
    <li> I love them so much! I was nervous at first since I couldnt really see which colors I was getting but I love them all!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to order these because i am very picky when it comes to lipstick. They arrived in a reasonable amount of time. First things first, the packaging/style: the lipstick is very fragile and light. When you twist it up, it feels like it is going to break. Also, the caps dont stay on but thats not too big of a deal. Longevity and feel: this lipstick does not last long at all. It does however, go on smoothly and it feels very hydrating. I like the consistency of the lipstick but the lasting power doesnt impress me.</li>
    <li> Just picked it up from the mail carrier. Beautiful colors. Will add to this review once I try. Packaged well.</li>
    <li> Its an okay product its more a tinted lip gloss than an lipstick, however they do feel very moisturizing which I do like but i wish they had more color payoff. I probably only like 1 or 2 out of the 12 and I have yet to wear any of them. And I would only recommend this if you are looking for a lipstick that is moisturizing and a very light tint lip color then I say go for it other than if you want to purchase some cheap lipsticks just stick to some other drug store brands.</li>
    <li> They all broke once I would open them</li>
    <li> Too many similar lipstick colors but they&#x27;re all really good and stay on for a long time :) I would purchase more if I could lol</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter as a birthday present. She loves them. She especially likes the fact that there are so many colors to choose from. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Love all the colors !</li>
    <li> I love the lipstick, and I will be sending for more. I love shopping for  lipsticks, and any other things that I can find that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> the lipsticks are super pigmented &amp; pretty.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they don&#x27;t really last a long time on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a sheer to full coverage type of formula, and are pretty comfortable on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great if you want to build your makeup collection. You get&lt;br /&gt;12 lipsticks for a great &amp; affordable price.</li>
    <li> This is for white people r mixed not black people</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lipstick for the price. The package was totally different from the picture.I was not too pleased with the colors as i did not get much of the bright reds or pinks which i was looking forward too. I got more pale colors .they are okay but not what i expected. It&#x27;s still a good product, goes on smooth,feels light. If i were to get brighter colors i would order again.</li>
    <li> Great variety of colors!!! These are very very moist. The colors are sheer to solid.. stay is a bit weak. But overall happy.</li>
    <li> Colors were very similar, kind of ugly. Don&#x27;t like how bright they were.</li>
    <li> i did not like this product, the lipsticks smelled weird and were poorly made</li>
    <li> Has the strangest smell. some people would find it pleasant but I think it smells like overwhelming fake herbs. Rubs off easily, I suppose it could be a good thing, but the colors are great and they look vibrant. I do agree it is kind of like a lip tint, but at this price, these are awesome!</li>
    <li> Yes the price was good for 12 lipsticks and came right one time, pros cheap the reds and plums are a lil more pigmented than others, cons really moist and comes off super fast, you can&#x27;t drink anything without it all coming off on one sip or bite  overall what i did get the reds more pigmented i used concealar on my lips and pressed powder but they still won&#x27;t last on and you have to apply it over your lips many times to get the color you want  😕 recommend for those who like glossy lips.</li>
    <li> Not long lasting but great color</li>
    <li> Cheap was not worth 17 dollars all of them look the same color i use them to add to the little bit of my  not cheap lip stick i use.</li>
    <li> very cheap lipsticks. The colors are not bright and best used asa glorified chap stick with color</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Came promptly.</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
    <li> Color range is nice, but advertising them as long lasting is a joke.  They wear away very quickly!</li>
    <li> They are OK lipsticks but a lot of the colors look exactly the same</li>
    <li> Comes just as it looks and on time</li>
    <li> There is a variety of colors but there is not a lot of lipstick in each one. The lipstick fades very quickly and you&#x27;ll have to keep applying it. This reminds me of more about the quantity than the quality.</li>
    <li> Nice lipstick.  Bought it for my mother and she was tickled with all the lovely colors.</li>
    <li> the colors is not not what i excepted.</li>
    <li> The quality of these lipsticks are very cheap even the lipstick color was leaking around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is so loose &amp; light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot of lipstick for the price, but the colors are bad and the texture is worse. I guess you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
    <li> I loved them they came then next day and all the colors came it was perfect</li>
    <li> I love the texture(the aloe makes it feel as though its chapstick) but they&#x27;re lighter than expected and a bit transparent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Show up as well I like but I like em! And should&#x27;ve had more variety of colors!</li>
    <li> This was super cheap and it smelled weird. don&#x27;t ever buy this !!!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors and the texture of the lipstick is great :)</li>
    <li> Although most of the colors were a little too sparkly, light, and pinkish for my taste I DID find that many are GREAT with my skin tone. Easy to apply, no icky scent. I do have to apply a few times during the day unless I use lip liner as a base, but the formulas are nice and creamy.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly. My wife liked using this lipsticks loved she  had a lot of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color selection-very wearable and not too dense as thick. Lite wear with great color stay.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors seemed almost identical and a few were a bit tough to apply. Other than that, I love them!</li>
    <li> They just ok nothing I&#x27;d get again.  But at least your lips is soft for a bit.</li>
    <li> I like make up. I Like lipstick! This set is fun.lots of wearable colors and very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I like red (I&#x27;m older and need deep color), I use lighter colors for around the house.  Big assortment at right price.  Great for me</li>
    <li> Excellent all the way</li>
    <li> I ordered this set to see which colors looked good on me before buying a more expensive department store brand.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked most of them.  They do need to be reapplied somewhat frequently, but you definitely get more for your money than you expect.</li>
    <li> I wasnt really a big fan of the Princessa Aloe Lipstick, the color you see on the tube isnt the color you get on your lips. the packaging of the lipsticks feels super cheap &amp; the smell of the product smelled horrible</li>
    <li> so many color options</li>
    <li> Did not get the colors I wanted. The colors are ok. I did like the price, came earlier than expected. I got none of the browns. They are smaller than regular lipsticks but that&#x27;s not a problem at all. Overall I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Very nice Lipsticks that my wife LOVES and appreciates.</li>
    <li> Horrible lipsticks! They have absolutely no color and are so sheer you might as well not wear anything.  The texture is really waxy and cheap!</li>
    <li> They are good,but could be darker.</li>
    <li> I loved .. The product is original and meets my expectations .. in excellent condition it was received the package in time for holiday gifts</li>
    <li> it dosent have colors.</li>
    <li> These colors are okay but just okay. The ones I received were completely different colors than the ones pictured. Would have been nice to have some actual brighter colors.</li>
    <li> Nice colors.  Wears average to poor.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for colors</li>
    <li> What to expect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Delivery: Fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST PART: I tried it on for a couple of minutes, took it off and my lips were really soft and moisturize. I was shocked how they healed them. No longer need ChapSticks !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: the lipstick will be a shade lighter on your lips. Keep in mind not every color of lipstick looks great on every skin tone so choose wisely for your skin tone. Don&#x27;t blame the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: really smooth and soft, does moisturize your lips very well, not heavy at all, easy removal but does last if you don&#x27;t try to wipe it off, DID NOT BREAK ON ME. I was scared to try them on since I read on some reviews that they broke. I applied it how I would apply any other lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: add foundation or concelor to your lip if you want it to last longer and for a darker shade.</li>
    <li> I got this product for $6.07. For the amazing price, 12 lipsticks that are different colors and moisturize is fantastic! Though the colors are all pretty similar, they are really nice and pretty. There&#x27;s not a lot in the tube itself, but it&#x27;s a nice display. The package was light and the lipsticks were in plastic then in bubble wrap, not damaged or melted at all. It definitely feels like my lips are moisturized. It&#x27;s more like a chapstick-lipstick than a lipstick completely, but for $6.07, this was a great deal. It also came on time.</li>
    <li> The colors are too light</li>
    <li> colors and quality awful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of how it smells or feels on my lips. The pigmentation is fairly decent, though.</li>
    <li> ATTENTION CUSTOMERS!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  ON AMAZON IT DOES NOT SAY THAT THIS CAN CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS!  WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS!  I PUT IT ON ONCE AND I TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY OFF!!  THEY PUT THE WARNING ON A TINY SLIP OF PAPER.  WASTE OF MONEY, DO NOT EVER BUY THIS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a lipstick girl, but these lipsticks look like lip gloss when applied. The difference is they last longer and are far more moisturizing. They come in an assortment of colors, and because of the lighter color, each compliments my skin tone. They suit me better in the workplace as well because they are not as shiny as lip gloss and not as heavy in color as most lipsticks. Also, they arrived 3 days after ordering them and were in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It was a nice set. I had to return it immediately because it had a big sticker that said it may cause cancer. If i had know, i wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  But if you don&#x27;t mind the probability of getting cancer, then please,  by all means buy it.</li>
    <li> So they are not &amp;#34;long wear&amp;#34; lipsticks don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a few hrs. But I did get several different colors I do like. Some of them came with the lipstick stuck to the top cap I had to fix atleast 4 of them, but all in all I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> The packaging is a bit cheap, and it isn&#x27;t like you pay for top of the line stuff, but I sure am happy with this purchase. I&#x27;m not a make up user at all, but some thing about lipstick just makes me happy. I received it in good time. One of my lipsticks actually doesn&#x27;t work, meaning that I can&#x27;t get the lipstick up as I twist the bottom, but I really don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;ve received so many other functioning pretty colors. I don&#x27;t regret this purchasing at all and I probably buy it again if I needed to.</li>
    <li> received timely would recommend.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re more like a tinted color. I did a video review for these since there weren&#x27;t any check it out !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> not the colors in the picture and takes more than 5  or 6 times to have the color show</li>
    <li> It is lovely but I thought I would have darker colours too</li>
    <li> Some color aren not shiny..some are very good. Overall average</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t the quality I expected them to be. It&#x27;s very hard to produce a great look with these colors.</li>
    <li> Good price for product</li>
    <li> Loved them colors last all day &amp; are a little hard to get off lol</li>
    <li> Worth the money spent</li>
    <li> love em! arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. However, i expected them to be more richer and longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this set! I am a freelance MUA and I needed lipstick for my kit. Not only was the price affordable but the colors are perfect for bridal makeup and senior makeup. I recommend this for everyone who likes a lipstick that is light but also nourishing.</li>
    <li> Love the colours..nice</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!!!!DONT BUY OR WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Great selection &amp; nice finish</li>
    <li> Honestly, I LOVE these lipsticks but the colors are way darker then I expected. Maybe make the pictures and description a little more clear.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, there are maybe 6 good colors and the rest are too red or don&#x27;t suit me well.</li>
    <li> Bday gift for my daughter, she liked it</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for cosmetology class. It was at a reasonable price. I used it and i was disappointed.This product has little pigmentation. It function like a lip gloss instead of a lipstick.</li>
