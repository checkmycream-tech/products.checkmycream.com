<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. It absorbs in quickly and makes my face feel awesome. I use to use a $10 Olay product that I had to add essential oils to keep pimples from popping up but now I don&#x27;t need to add anything. I also don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much to get the same moisturizing feel. A tiny dab is all I need, I also have very dry, oily skin, it normally takes a lot to keep oil down and my dry skin at bay but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it&#x27;s a lot more than I&#x27;d spend on any skin care item but I bet it&#x27;ll last me 6 months or longer. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  My skin absorbs it quickly.  I rub it everywhere on my face.  All over my eyes and lips.  No stinging or burning! I assume that is because of all the natural ingredients!  One of my favorite things about this moisturizer is to put it on my lips.  I have never done that with a moisturizer before,  but when I put it on at night, in the morning when I lick my lips I get the sweet taste of honey. No chemical taste or feel.  I also have sensitive acne prone skin and my skin loves this product.  I will never use another facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product fro several months on scars from a bike accident.  They are fading away.  The cfream absorbs readily into the skin and is not oily.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! It is gentle on my skin. It keeps fine lines at bay and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have used the facial cream and I really like it; a little bit of cream goes a long way and it is nice to know that it is natural and I am not putting chemicals into my skin.</li>
    <li> Best face moisturizer I have found. I use it on my neck and hands too. Does not break me out and wears well with makeup. no greasy feel, very natural.</li>
    <li> First time purchase.  Chose item based on product ingredients,  and then the reviews.  Excellent for sensitive skin.  Feels healing,rich,  yet very light , non greasy for winter skin,  but light enough for humid AR summer.  I will repurchase.  Not a wrinkle wonder cream, but if you are looking for healthy feeling skin ( I am 53)&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Awesome, mid-weight face cream.  Perfect for my reactive, sensitive skin, especially in winter.  Might be just a wee bit too much moisture for summer, but I&#x27;ll still use it despite my shiny face.  Faint aroma of cocoa, which wasn&#x27;t present in the first jar I ordered (may have changed formulas?).</li>
    <li> Perfectly nice moisturizer at a reasonable price. This is my first try of this product and am half way through the jar after more than a month. Absorbs very well considering it is a natural product and has not caused my oily skin to break out. Yay! Has a very faint smell that goes away quickly and is fine under make-up or for overnight. From reading some other reviews it seems it could benefit from an expiration date and if one day i re-order and get an old one it will not be too shocking. But will re-rder anyway because it is very hard to locate natural creams that do not break out my skin. :-)</li>
    <li> I now use in place of my tinted moisturizer during the day. It has no color but the effect is still amazing. Only wish is that it came in a larger container. LOL</li>
    <li> Well right out of the gate, the jar was a lot smaller than I imagined. My fault for not paying closer attention I suppose. The bottle/ labeling itself looks like it was made strait out of someone&#x27;s basement. Didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all. I am a big &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; person, meaning if it smells the least bit unappealing I will get headaches. I believe this lotion is not supposed to have a scent, but to me it smells awful. Kind of a plastic/black licorice smell. Hard to discribe, but it&#x27;s not good. The texture is thicker, almost like a toothpaste, so for me it takes a very long time for my skin to absorb it, which can cause problems it I&#x27;m trying to put makeup on. If I don&#x27;t wait lining enough, my makeup begins to flake off. It does however work pretty well. I live in the upper Midwest where the winters are harsh on my skin. My face often becomes flaky, and with this lotion I only have to put it on once and it lasts all day. Doesn&#x27;t cure my dry skin, but it does help it feel much better. Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product. Just wish it was bigger for the price, and smelled better.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has a light honey smell - not too strong - which is good, as I don&#x27;t like heavy smelling products. Once on your skin, you don&#x27;t feel it - it&#x27;s not heavy, very light. They use mineral based SPF 8, so you aren&#x27;t having a chemical based SPF. You still need more SPF than 8, but this is a good start. This is my favorite moisturizer now. I have noticed a difference in my skin, including less breakouts. I have been using this for a few months, but noticed the difference in my skin quickly. Great as a hand lotion too. A little goes a long way, so one jar lasts a while. And it&#x27;s very affordable for the quality ingredients. You are supporting a small company - not a conglomerate. The customer service is exceptional! Very personalized!</li>
    <li> This product I think is probably not good for those who have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin, I expected that since this product was all natural it would not burn my skin. But it started to burn my cheeks, nose, forehead and become bright red directly after applying it. Please test this product on a small part of your face before applying it all over like I did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few days and am enjoying it so far.  I have acne prone skin and this does not break me out.  It feels refreshing on the skin and keeps my skin moisturized.  It also seems to absorb very well.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The cream has a very nice texture, thick but goes on your skin easily and is absorbed nicely.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy, just a nice soft feel.  It has a very nice fresh smell, natural ingredients and no artificial fragrance.  Another good point ---- made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. This is a really good moisturizer. Thicker than many, more of a cream. My sensitive skin does well with this. This is one of two of my go-to moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love it!! My skin has been doing great! I also use the Wild Naturals face wash and it goes perfectly with it!</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way, easy to absorb, smells delicious (because of the cocoa butter in it!), and most important natural ingredients, not like most moisturizerS in the market made out of 95% ingredients that you can&#x27;t even read because are just chemicals.. TRY IT !</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, like most folks, when they see all these positive reviews. But I would have blown $20 on something else to try and balance my skin, so what the heck. I have combination skin, and my fake-chemical expensive stuff was just leaving me with clogged pores and uneven skin tone. I bought this stuff on a whim to get more natural lotion on my face, and wow, was it worth it! Do be aware, 2oz is not a whole lot of product for the price, but still, you only need a little to go a long way; also price per ounce, this stuff is cheaper than department store makeup brand moisturizer. It smells great, like chocolate and goes on nice and creamy. It absorbs in seconds and leaves only soft skin. I am soooo happy I got this, as my 35YO face wasn&#x27;t looking any better. Give it a try, it really, really will make your skin nicer. And you can feel better that you&#x27;re not putting any junk on your face that you don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Great company.    The lotion did not work for me but the company contacted me and made the situation right.</li>
    <li> No smell like some other unscented creams.  Goes on light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for nearly 3 weeks and I love it. Just in case this helps anyone, I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have oily skin and an uneven skin tone from having acne when I was younger. So while my face is breakout free, I&#x27;ve been very into skincare and products that featured aloe vera and manuka honey to work on evening my skin tone. Spoiler alert: This stuff is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get into that though, I will say that the packaging picture is misleading as hell. It&#x27;s not an all white container, it&#x27;s actually clear with a white label and cap. Minor, but noticeable. The first thing that registered when I opened this product was the smell. Subtle and unoffensive. I actually really like it because I have a natural body moisturizer with the same smell, I think it might be the shea butter. The product itself is super whipped which means that you need to use next to nothing to get the job done. Seriously. Swipe a DAB onto the tip of your finger and then apply to each side of your face and you&#x27;re good to go, especially if you&#x27;re rubbing it in successfully. If you are usually heavy handed with your application of cremes, ect, don&#x27;t be with this product. You can easily overdo it and end up clogging your pores which translates into pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product has seriously improved my skin tone, nothing life-changingly amazing, but it has definitely made my skin brighter as well as much smoother. The smoothness is something you feel instantaneously after you apply this on the skin. There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34; glow that my face has now that I have never, ever experienced before with any product (to give you an idea, Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar was the only thing that brought my skin close to this level years ago, but I found it left my face too oily and clogged my pores) and because of this I can easily apply the barest amount concealer or foundation to just the spots I need to on a light makeup day and STILL get compliments on my skin. I&#x27;ve actually considered switching to a powdered foundation (like a Mineralized Skinfinish) for the summer months because I don&#x27;t feel like I need much coverage since this moisturizer has taken care of some of the pigmentation and texture issues I initially had. It&#x27;s honestly remarkable for only 3 weeks of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that by the time I finish this first jar, my skin will be in amazing condition. I&#x27;m actually considering the face wash as well and it wasn&#x27;t even something that was on my radar at first. If I need to, I will be purchasing this again. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who is searching for a moisturizer with these two ingredients. Can&#x27;t speak more highly of this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s thick going on, but soaks right in and feels great. Not oily at all and my skin looks so much better after using it. Will definitely get this again!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It&#x27;s only been a few days that I&#x27;ve been using it and I love it and I know it&#x27;s nourishing my skin ! Also, it came very soon so that&#x27;s a plus :-)</li>
    <li> not bad but not as amazing as I expected</li>
    <li> healing up within a few days so far its working fast shipping</li>
    <li> Product is super creamy, smells nice and is very hydrating to my skin. It has a light smell which I prefer in a skin product. I&#x27;ve used it during the day when it&#x27;s dry outside and every night since I bought it. Makes my skin feel great. And I have to say, the customer service is one of the best I&#x27;ve experienced on Amazon and I buy a lot of stuff here. The delivery was on time as well. Highly recommend product and buying from this company. We need more small businesses like this making quality natural products. Kudos. :)</li>
    <li> just a little goes a long way.  Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean and does not feel oily.  Very natural feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream. I&#x27;m 29 with de skin but it is also easy to clog and this moisturizer works great for me. Sinks right in. I will be ordering another jar soon and I&#x27;m happy that it is all natural too.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It isn&#x27;t greasy and made my skin super smooth. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really love the consistency of this product. It absorbs quickly into my skin and it seemed to have calmed some redness and irritation on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have bought it a few times. It works great and lasts a while, a little goes such a long way.  I just wish that as a re-pete customer, that instead of sending me new jars, if they could send me a refill bag instead.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Very light once it dries you never know you put it on. Nice soft scent. Was suffering from Perioral Dermititis when I purchase it. Brought great relief to my dry sensitive skin with out any breakouts. Will definitely buy again. Goes a long way so your getting a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice daily moisturizer! I use it almost exclusively at night. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin, but I&#x27;m kind of using it to prevent future skin problems. My skin definitely feels nice and soft in the morning, though!</li>
    <li> wonderful face cream,wonderful service</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this cream!!!  Beautifully moisturizes and it is light and not greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a lite and more natural cream!!! Considering buying other products in this line!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream,it does not leave my skin greasy. Since i just started using it i do not see very much difference yet. Once i realize something i will come back and post the update.But this cream is definitely making my face feel good.</li>
    <li> At it&#x27;s discounted price, I thought this product was still a bit pricey. The container is decent and a little really does go a long way. The consistency is really light, almost like makeup primers which I kind of like.  I do notice that the redness on my face improved.  I wear foundation over it and it works almost as good as a primer.  My only criticism is the smell. It&#x27;s hard to explain, it&#x27;s almost like stale milky honey but at least it doesn&#x27;t last long.  The smell is the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream. It&#x27;s very light, and it has a nice subtle scent. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Cream,  very gentle and light. Excellent moisturizer as i live in NYC where summers are hot humid and winters are super cold and windy, this cream is perfect skin protector.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  I have to say I&#x27;m a bit of a skin care snob so I was skeptical!  What I noticed was that my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and still felt soft many hours after I applied it - kind of put my pricey department store brand to shame.  I will continue using it and see how I like it over the long term, but definitely optimistic after a week or so of daily use!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great feeling, smell is pretty good.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!! I use everyday and my skin is glowing. I&#x27;m fixing to start my second bottle!!!!! My skin is prone to breakouts when I put anything on my face this is the only thing I have used that actually works!!!! I will use this forever. I highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> Very creamy and soothing to my skin. It tones down redness and makes my skin very supple. I will be buying more :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my skin had a horrible reaction to this moisturizer. I am not sure what the cause was, but I had red, itchy burning skin for several days after use and I dealt with a breakout for almost a week as well. Not all skin is the same, so I guess I am the minority here. For the experience on my skin, I give the product one star. I give the excellent customer service I received regarding the situation five stars. They were truly great, I just wish I could have used the product and not had a reaction.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I have been dealing with dry skin for a long time..This has helped tremendously.  Shipping was super fast too.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my mother a second jar. She is 83 and due to bad treatment at a hospital (long story) she lost a significant amount of skin from her shoulder to her elbow on her left arm. She had to be treated at a wound care facility and the doctor wasn&#x27;t sure she would be able to grow skin back. The treatment did begin to work. I also began rubbing this cream all over the area as well. It seemed to help the skin regenerate and now she is all better. Everyone is amazed at how good her skin looks. I know this is not for the treatment of things like this but it helped her skin so much that I wanted to leave this review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the Holy Grail of moisturizers. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 3 days now.  Wow.  my face looks like it has new skin, I am not kidding you.  I am 60 years old and my face glows.  The texture is different, the tone is different.  I wake up in the morning with the same hydration I went to bed with. Amazing.  I hope this cream keeps performing!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Its creamy but lite.  My skin feels nice after.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have eczema and have been searching for a cream that doesn&#x27;t make me bumpy. Seriously the best I&#x27;ve tried!!!</li>
    <li> There are two major reasons this product is getting 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: It truly is a skin saving product. I have extremely dry skin, and this is the most moisturizing and nourishing cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I recently went all organic/natural, so this was one of my first steps. I left it on my face overnight, and the next morning it was soft and without a flake of dry skin. The ingredient list is easy to read and you know everything that is being put on, which makes it all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: The amazing and kind customer service. When I received the product, it had a slightly off smell. I did not know if this was normal or not, so I emailed the company and they responded right away saying that during shipping it could have been left out in the sun for too long. The immediately sent me a complimentary jar with 2 day shipping. The smell in the second jar is now a faint, earthy smell as all the rest of the reviews have stated. Thank you WildNaturals, for being a great company behind a great product!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever used!  I LOVE it and will definitely be ordering again!  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product so far! Its creamy, not greasy, and a little really goes a long way! I was using Proactiv for acne and complexion for 8 months, with some benefit, but I found my face looked malnourished and dry. I decided to try a more organic approach to skin care, trading in Proactiv for organic facial products.  I have been using this and an organic facial wash for 2 weeks and already feel that my face is softer and more nourished. I will be continuing to use this product!</li>
    <li> I love that it is rich. I love that is smells so pure and natural. I am very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks. I am 63 years young. I found that my skin tone improved, color improved ( healthier) , and that i really thought some wrinkles were lessening. I loved the fact that the cream absorbed immediately and that it left no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I&#x27;m 78 years old and had a dry spot on my ankle which was starting to look pretty bad. I started using this cream about a month ago and it has healed up. I highly recommend this product for smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizing cream, light and goes in quickly, all good ingredients. I am content with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I want to use more natural products and replace my existing toiletries with ones using less chemicals. This moisturizer goes on beautifully: not too greasy, not too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;. It wears well throughout the day with or without makeup. This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Like the consistency and definitely seems to last throughout the day. Disappointed that there are so many chemicals listed on the label when I thought it was made with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very good. My mother likes it.</li>
    <li> Highly disjointed and feel like I wasted my money.  It doesn&#x27;t moister the skin very well because I have dry skin.  I feel like having to put on constantly because it feel dry.  Also, after couple hour if you try to apply more over the old one, it come off like dry flours.  Like scaping dry flor off of the surface and it flake and become a big messed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good con about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t smell and irritate your skin too much, it just too bad it doesn&#x27;t observed very well and dry out too quickly.  Been using for a couple of days and it doesn&#x27;t seam to do much for my face, hesitate to return it now, but with shipping don&#x27;t know if it worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and smells so good.</li>
    <li> My favorite mosturizer now! I love how it&#x27;s all natural. My face is acne prone so I am always sensitive to what I put on my face. I have a few acne around my face and scars from past break outs. After using this product, not only did my face get clearer, but it&#x27;s super soft! I don&#x27;t even put acne medication anymore because I believe this mosturizer will naturally do the work. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this cream.  My face had a bad reaction to an expensive cream bought in a dept store, and this cleared it right up.  No chemicals, not too greasy, and it feels very good going on my face, and is working very well!</li>
    <li> Very good cream. No allergy. Feels great on a face,</li>
    <li> I think it broke me put! Stopped for few days and it cleared up .. Will use it up for body instead</li>
    <li> The jar is small but thankfully only a little is needed. I use it in the morning and at night and I love how soft my skin is when using this moisturizer after a wash. And it also holds throughout the day. I&#x27;ve even worn it under my makeup and it does great! They&#x27;ve gained a loyal customer!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product, absolutely desapointed:((, I returback this product</li>
    <li> This is a very good face cream, notice the first ingredient is not water, I will order again.</li>
    <li> I want to like this product based on the good reviews it receive on amazon, but my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with it. It clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I wear it as a night cream after cleansing, and toning my face. Leaves it feeling moist and rejuvenated. This is a more thick moisturizer so I highly recommend if you have dry skin like me.</li>
    <li> Although I have only started using it I like the way it fights dry skin and the tightness in my face.  It is gentle, non greasy, fragrance free, and has no harsh chemicals like paraben.</li>
    <li> It does not absorb well into my skin and it feels like it is drying it out instead of moisturizing it.</li>
    <li> Seriously have tried every prescription cream from the pediatrician, dermatologist and other all natural lotions online.  This one finally made a dent in our toddler&#x27;s eczema.  It looks significantly better.  Can&#x27;t say 100% yet as we&#x27;ve only been using this about a week but I&#x27;d say 80% improvement this week alone.  No more bright red and itchy blotches on his legs.  By far the best treatment we have come across.  Exceptional customer service too.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have been using The Wild Naturals Face Cream for a couple of months and I really like this product.  I have sensitive, easily irritated skin and this product has proven to be very healing and moisturizing.  I have Rosacea and Eczema on my face and scalp and had to stop using the prescription products because they were just too irritating.  Using the Wild Naturals Face Cream on my face has been more healing and moisturizing than any of the prescription or over-the-counter products I have tried.  The ingredients are not irritating and they are very healing for my face.  My Rosacea has improved so much that the burning and irritation have been greatly reduced.  Also, the appearance of the little red veins has been greatly reduced.  I highly recommend the Wild Naturals products!</li>
    <li> Very good product and service. This is the best moisturizer I have used for treating dry skin and eczema.</li>
    <li> Love it!! This face cream helped me a lot,through out the winter time.my face is hydrated and I am very satisfied with it!  I would recommend it to anyone who would want glowing skin!</li>
    <li> False advertisement.  Look at the ingredients. it is full of chemicals. This product is a marketing scam.  It is anything but natural.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THIS FOR A WEEK, BUT I NOTICED MY  FACE FEELS REALLY SOFT.  I HAVE SKIN ALLERGIES, AND THIS DIDN&#x27;T BOTHER MY FACE AT ALL.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  IT WAS PACKAGED REALLY WELL AS I WAS CONCERNED WITH THE HUMIDITY BUT IT WAS FINE.  THE COMPANY  SEEMS LIKE A GOOD COMPANY THEY EMAILED ME TO SEE IF I RECEIVED MY ORDER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONLY MY FIRST WEEK, BUT I THINK I AM GOING TO LIKE IT , BEING ITS ALL NATURAL, CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SEE THE RESULTS IN A MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer. Another reviewer said it best, &amp;#34;it melts into my skin.&amp;#34; Instantly moisturizes and absorbs, no waiting to apply my makeup. Smells delicious.</li>
    <li> The Wild Naturals Manuka Honey Face Moisturizer is thick and creamy, but glides on light and smooth and absorbs quickly. My skin was baby soft almost immediately after the first use. After a few days, it cleared up a breakout that had been caused by another product I was trying. I highly recommended this product for any skin type, especially ultra sensitive skin like mine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer!  It&#x27;s not too drying or oily.  It&#x27;s matte which is perfect for me because I have oily skin.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out or make my sensitive skin red. Love it!! Definitely going to buy again.</li>
    <li> Very light and creamy, love the fact that it is natural. Smells great. Haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know of any results yet. No reactions so far.</li>
