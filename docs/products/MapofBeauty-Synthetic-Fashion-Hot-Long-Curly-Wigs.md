<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really nice and realistic wig</li>
    <li> looks ok...not a natural look...but it is good to wear between doing my hair...and going to a salon...which is way too expensive.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig.&lt;br /&gt;Looks exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;But it is very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with 2 wig caps:)&lt;br /&gt;Worth what I paid.</li>
    <li> Looks good for the first to days but after that it all goes down hill. Hair just falls out everywhere. I couldn&#x27;t even brush or comb it.</li>
    <li> Lovely hair and for the price, it is a good buy. I love the look and the fact that it is not so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of the hair.</li>
    <li> This was perfect with my Halloween outfit and I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality for what I paid !  It was fabulous !</li>
    <li> the curls are together in big chunks out of the package which was what I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;It worked for my Asami Sato cosplay when I clipped the bangs (which are pretty long) up to the side to to make them look a little like a widow&#x27;s peak</li>
    <li> I pay 40 for $9 dollars item!</li>
    <li> Must figure how to style the long blinding bangs but hair feels of nice quality and cap is easy to adjust. See how holds up on stage being thrown around on head.</li>
    <li> Not what i thought it would be</li>
    <li> Great wig for vriska or aradia cosplay. A bit thin, but that&#x27;s the only complaint i have.</li>
    <li> Good quality and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> Very tangly and it sheds quite a bit. No where near real</li>
    <li> This wig LOOKS like a wig. It&#x27;s frizzy and knots very easily. It&#x27;s great for a costume, but I will never wear mine again. It looks sooo fake and just a slight breeze makes a huge knot.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a friend and she is loving it, the texture of the hair is very nice and she look hot in it. great delivery service as well.</li>
    <li> Tangle one time wear than it was done for me a mess. Wig is in the trash can now waste</li>
    <li> The hair on this wig is very tangled and doesn&#x27;t style easily. The hair falls straight in the face unless pinned back, at which point you can see the hair or hair cap beneath it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this wig but it is not made for everyday I will order more I wish the color was darker</li>
    <li> Bad day hair ?? . NO MORE !!! , excellent product .</li>
    <li> Given that this is an inexpensive synthetic wig, I thought the quality was really nice and the wig appeared pretty much as pictured right out of the package.</li>
    <li> Did not do a thing for me! I thought I could cut it it did not work. Still trying to figure out what else to do with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costumes. The synthetic fibers used for the hair isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s silky and shiny. However, it does shed and tangle a bit more than human hair. The wig fits well. The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I feel there could be more hair. It&#x27;s not thin, but it&#x27;s not as thick as I would like it. The thing i dislike the most is that the layers in the front aren&#x27;t as pictured. They are very weird looking because they just seem to look like a blunt ledge in the front and they do not flow or blend into the rest of the wig, but hey it&#x27;s wig for less that $10.</li>
    <li> Used this wig for my Catwoman and Mileena cosplay and just have to say I just love this wig. It feels real and easy to take care of</li>
    <li> for such a low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and I didn&#x27;t get much. very cheaply made. on the positive side though, the texture is wonderful and it&#x27;s really full; no wig cap showing through. but I won&#x27;t wear it, b/c I can&#x27;t. the wig cap is so small that it won&#x27;t fit on my head. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice wig , for the price it was a steal. The hair was a Lil long so I cut a Lil off. It&#x27;s still in great shape after wearing it a few times . I have even wore it half up . Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair . Will be buying this again soon .</li>
    <li> I was in need of a black wig for a cosplay, so I ordered this one, as it seemed to be the cheapest with the style that I wanted. I loved the wig as soon as I tried it on; it&#x27;s very glossy and the curls are cute. However, there is just one issue with it: It seems a bit less thick at the bottom, and is more full towards the top of the wig. For this reason, I&#x27;d rate it as 4.5 stars if that option were available. If you&#x27;re okay with that look stylistically, then this is definitely a great wig for you, but if you&#x27;d rather have fullness all around then I&#x27;d recommend more expensive options on Amazon from other sellers.</li>
    <li> loved it easy to put in different designs and color was nice.....would buy from here again....I still wear them and I get asked all the time if it is my hair</li>
    <li> This wig comes with so much hair its crazy! Does come pretty curly so i straightened it and put most of it in a pony tail to make it look less bam! but its perfect and great quality</li>
    <li> its super soft&lt;br /&gt;looks exactly like the pic&lt;br /&gt;there are so many options to wearing it and it does not look like a cheap wig at all! perfect for anyone for any use</li>
    <li> This wig is more straight then it is curly. It will do but now I have to still try and find one that is curly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty wig. Much longer than pic shows.  It doesn&#x27;t shed too badly. It&#x27;s a little bit shinier than I prefer them to be. You can see into the top and see the wefting, I couldn&#x27;t get that to lay right. I wish they all had a skin part, instead of the crown, dot.  For the price It&#x27;s a pretty decent wig.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last terribly long. I wouldn&#x27;t select this one as an everyday wig for someone. Probably best for cosplay.</li>
    <li> Bought this black wig couple of weeks ago today I put it on and  I&#x27;m so surprise how great it looks on me  I did cut  the hair  to the shoulder the curls still bounce going to order another one</li>
    <li> Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about wigs, but it seemed like I got what I payed for.</li>
    <li> Worst wig ever. It sticks to all your clothing. Looks fake. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> It sheds a little but looks so natural I think this was a steal for the price l I do love it and so does my husband</li>
    <li> Longer than expected and tangles really easy but easy to revive the curls by a simple moose and plaid. Took extremely long to get to me.</li>
    <li> Good material! The curls stay strong and bouncy, too! Use this for Homestuck cosplays and I&#x27;ve done it up I&#x27;ve let it hang and no matter what, worth the money. Again, the material is very good, so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you are unfamiliar with materials. It&#x27;s not cheap material, it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
    <li> wig was actually very nice for the price!  I actully had someone think it was my real hair, which was pretty shocking to her when I took it off and am actually very blonde. lol!</li>
    <li> I was ok for the price... Gets tangled really fast</li>
    <li> If your primary reason to buy this wig is the length...then don&#x27;t ! It&#x27;s 25% shorter than in the picture an unpleasant surprise for me.</li>
    <li> Was much longer than expected, very tight on an average head; great price!</li>
    <li> I got this wig for day-to-day wear and cosplay, and it is SO SO CUTE. the curls fall a little differently than in the picture, but maybe I just need to style it some. It&#x27;s easy to brush and moves beautifully! I got so many compliments the first day I wore it &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It was for a gift for my mother in law and she loved it. Will order one more for me this time</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume. I was very happy with how quickly it arrived and the quality. It was very soft, not itchy like some other cheap wigs. Worked great for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Great wig for Halloween use. Not a daily wear (as it is prone to tangles and very synthetic looking/feeling), it lays nicely and is easy to put on. Comes with a wig cap to keep your hair neat underneath, this wig worked perfectly for one night.</li>
    <li> Nice thick wig can straight back out don&#x27;t last A year</li>
    <li> Great wigs, looked awesome on and they shape well.</li>
    <li> i like how it looks most of the time but i have a couple problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i got it, it was fine and it loked lovely but it was a bit tangled&lt;br /&gt;i tried brushing it (big mistake) and like half the wig came out&lt;br /&gt;;-;</li>
    <li> Good quality, very shiny and long. Only bad thing it shreds alot and tangles</li>
    <li> great wig...looks real</li>
    <li> This is just the right kind of wig I was looking for. I was impressed as to how great of a quality it was for such a great price.</li>
    <li> Very cute! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it took forever to come in and then I didn&#x27;t recieve it because went somewhere else, and when i finally did get the reshipment i was very disappointed... It was very thin and looked nothing like the picture, the bangs were a straight cut inside of a long side sweep......</li>
    <li> I liked it. It showed up fast and looks adorable! Don&#x27;t brush or comb it too hard and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Great costume wig.. for Halloween</li>
    <li> Beautiful wigs. They came with a free sewing cap.</li>
    <li> good wig but took about a month to get here and was annoyed by that but other then that pretty good</li>
    <li> Got this as a multi-use wig to use for various Homestuck characters. It&#x27;s nice and looks as pictured if not a little thin in the back, but still an over all good product. Tangles EXTREMELY easy and is hard to detangle even knowing what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> For me it was just a one time use for a fundraiser. If someone were to use it for multiple days, or recurring use they may run into problems with upkeep.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! I really love it, looks natural and it fits well. I would recommend this seller to anyone. For sure</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for cosplay and it has worked very well so far. Styling was easy, the hair doesn&#x27;t shine, and the curls are exactly as it looks.</li>
    <li> Love the curls and nice long length</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG!!! It&#x27;s so beautiful!!! It makes me feel so pretty!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but not really one of my mom&#x27;s favorites. She liked the waves but she thought it fit too loose for her taste.</li>
    <li> the wig is perfect and matches my cosplay perfectly while looking like real hair as well! i get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Got my wig on the earliest day it said it would arrive, it&#x27;s thick and really soft. Bangs are long and that&#x27;s because they are made that way so you can trim them to your face so please keep that in mind!! I love this wig, it&#x27;s natural looking!</li>
    <li> Got this wig early which was good but it sheds way too much n bangs too long I&#x27;m disappointed. About this purchased....</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing.  I bought it for a mystery dinner I was attending and we had to dress in character.  The quality was wonderful and it was thick.  I was surprised at how terrific it looked.  People did not recognize me.  If you are looking for a long black wig, I would not hesitate to purchase this.</li>
    <li> THIS WIG IS FAR BETTER  THAN  OTHER SYNTHETIC WIGS I PURCHASED FROM BEAUTY SUPPLY.ONLY CON IS NO COMBS ONLY DRAW STRING CAN BE SECURED WITH BOBBY PINS.DELIVERY WAS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE. I WILL BE ORDERING MORE!!!</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s : I received my order in a reasonable time . Less time then the dates i was given.The hair is silky and longer then I thought. Looks just like the picture.  I love the style.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s : No combs for good coverage.  Very shiny. Tangles easy. Ultimately you get what you pay for. I will say it is well worth the money</li>
    <li> Lmao, extra long my booty.  This wig isn&#x27;t long at all.  It is straight, not curly as described.  Bad stitches and thin.</li>
    <li> I need to make a few alterations to it but overall I love it :)</li>
    <li> I stand by that!! There are NO other wigs I will ever use for Vriska Serket. This one comes practically styled and the curls are absolutely gorgeous. Its well fitting and doesnt tangle easily.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig with my Halloween costume last year. In fact, I want to wear it all of the time!! Great Product!</li>
    <li> I love it ! It&#x27;s long and the colors amazing! It got nappy at one point I just took a brush through it and BAM perfect again . It came a lot earlier then expected!</li>
    <li> I got this wig and it arrived right on time! I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t, but the UPS people who come to my house are slow sometimes but I got it!&lt;br /&gt;I got it to wear with future cosplay&#x27;s I get or even just for fun and I tried it on and took a picture and all my friends and even family liked it. It&#x27;s nice and long and if you keep it in the fabric it comes with it helps it not tangle! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more wigs from this company if I need to &#x3D;D I love it!</li>
    <li> The wig didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture when I got it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for a costume drama and it works well.  I think I may wear it again!  Better than I expected and the hair is glossy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Love the wig it looks so real</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality. Ample room to make alterations/ cut if needed.</li>
