<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 &amp; love this moisturizer!!  I had a problem with some creams not absorbing &amp; getting flaky when applying makeup.  This absorbs well and feels great &amp; I get compliments on my skin from others asking what I use.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizing lotion ever used for my face I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love the feel, how quickly it absorbs, How my skin looks since using, and the price compared to the store price. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I Love this moisturizer...The absolute BEST!!👍</li>
    <li> Really love all dermalogica products. I usethis every morning.</li>
    <li> A light, quickly absorbed moisturizer.  Great to use at night because it soaks in rapidly and doesn&#x27;t get on the pillow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica for about 6 months and have worked hard to fine-tune my daily regimen.  For years I used lesser (cheaper) quality products and while I never had really bad acne I would always have one or two nagging pimples, tons of tiny clogged pores and dry skin.  I always associated heavier moisturizers with clogging pores and feeling greasy so I&#x27;d opt for lighter weight moisturizers and always dealt with that taught, stretched skin feeling (which in hindsight wasn&#x27;t helping my clogged pore issue).  As soon as I started using the Intensive Moisture Balance with the Clearing Skin Wash (along with an electronic facial brush) and rotating the MultiVitamin Recovery Masque and Skin Refining Masque as needed, it was as if I had magically unlocked the secret to dewy, clear, healthy skin.  The key is routine.  You have to wash you face twice a day and MOISTURIZE!  Rarely there is a overnight quick fix to healthy skin but I saw improvement quickly and in a matter of weeks it was obvious I was on the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is thick and and feels very hydrating when you put it on.  I have sensitive skin and found this moisturizer very soothing.  Ideally you should let it absorb for about 5 minutes before putting make-up on, which is the case for most moisturizers.  Once it absorbs it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy but leaves the skin feeling dewy and ultra-hydrated.  My skin looks younger, healthier and doesn&#x27;t feel dry by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product and have enjoyed the complements I&#x27;ve received about my now-healthy skin.  Thank you Dermalogica!</li>
    <li> Intensive Moisture Balance is a great moisturizer that really does have a perfect balance in moisture without being greasy.  Great for dry, pre-maturely aging or combination skin.  After my pregnancy I found that my skin became much more oily and then this product started to cause me to break-out.  I then switched to the Active Moist, which is better for oilier skin.  I use many of the Dermalogica products and think they are a great skin care line.  I recommend the line to anyone looking for skin care products.  My least favorite part is the high price, but amazon always has some great sales, making them more affordable.</li>
    <li> If I get stuck on an island this is my must have! This makes my face so hydrated and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Many moisturizers irritate my skin, including products like Clinique.  This is the one moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t!  It is NOT greasy or smelly.  My face feels soft after I use it and I only need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> over priced,&amp; results are zero!</li>
    <li> Great product! As a male, I find it difficult to find face lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or like some sort of fruit. This works for me as it has a very neutral scent. It also doesn&#x27;t have an oily appearance and it is wonderful post-shave.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this product!!  It is a great moisturizer that is not too heavy or greasy!!!  My skin absorbs this moisturizer, so there is no sticky feel to it.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the demalogica intensive moisture balance for years. The price is really good, only half comparing buying from saloon. It was sealed and it is so important to have seal on this kind of product. I like it and I use it every day and night.</li>
    <li> it is smooth when it goes on. I have really dry skin and have to use a lot at once for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not oily, and don&#x27;t break my skin out.</li>
    <li> Super hydrating without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Use it at night.  This is the best lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and its one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever done.  The price was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it at night, it does not have SPF. It is great if you have dry skin. You can feel the difference the next day. Really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  Never go a day without it!  I have tried other of their products with success also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynne</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! I have lived in the mountains with gusty winds...I currently live in the city...whatever the environment- this moisturizer is the best. I have been using it for over 3 years. I&#x27;m 31, but most people think I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s! Besides that, you can feel it&#x27;s really working...and I feel like it is preserving my skin. I can justify the price because one bottle lasts about 6 months. Dermalogica creates amazing products!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for twenty years  Brought my dry sensitive skin back to normal</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the name, Intensive Moisture Balance.  This is just what my dry skin needed.  I will never go back to other product lines now that I am using Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> came in sealed dermalogica package, seems legit. works great.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product as expected!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I consider it a treat for myself since it costs more than my usual Oil of Olay (that&#x27;s why not rated at a 5).  I do recommend it but not if you are on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and never irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for my face in the dry winter weather. Not only does it moisturize but it even improves the textural appearance! love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
    <li> As most women have, I too have used many a moisturizer in my 49 years and this is my absolute favorite.  It is absorbed quickly, non greasy, does not clog up my pours, feels light on the skin and has no smell.  I use it straight out of the shower and at night so no need for multiple products.  Just wish it was not so expensive</li>
    <li> Good product - promptly shipped</li>
    <li> This one is favorite cream for about a year now. My skin is hydrated throughout  the day. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nothing is better.  Spend the money and have a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My favorite line in skincare</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase. The seller gave me some sample packs for road trips. The price was right, and don&#x27;t have to travel to the local hospital to get them. I don&#x27;t have a salon or boutique that carries Dermalogica. I&#x27;ve been a Dermalogica user for the past fifteen years.  I use this moisturizer mainly at night, but if my face gets dry will use it morning/night. I also use a toner and Skin smoothing cream for day use. I&#x27;m a guy who gets compliments on my skin. My wife now uses Dermalogica products too.&#x27;My doctor told me about this years ago. I&#x27;m very happy with this product purchase and price. I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I do NOT recommend buying this product from here. I have tried it before but It doesnt feel the same as the original product I purchased from the beauty supply store. It may be cheaper here, but the quality is cheap also!! This product is suppose to relieve dry skin, which I have, and it hasnt improved my skin dryness at all. Actually made it worse. Unfortunately, I cant return so its a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I could feel the chemicals on my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Dermalogica has the best products for skin that i;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I had redness on my face for years tried many mant products with no good results.&lt;br /&gt;1day someone gave me a sample pk. and thinking it will be the same as the others i left it there fo 1 month before I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use my face felt totally different, and within 1 wk the redness was gone that was 2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have never stopped using it after that.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years at night and it&#x27;s great.  It moisturizes the face well and it not greasy.</li>
    <li> this was highly recommended by a make up artist and i will&lt;br /&gt;continue to use it for a life time.&lt;br /&gt;great product.</li>
    <li> As promised.  Great face cream.</li>
    <li> I have ben using this lotion for years. It works so good and has no scent. It really does a great job providing the moisture it provides.</li>
    <li> product is excellent, arrived when expected, dermalogica is great.  this moisturizer is the best for very dry skin, I live in the desert.</li>
    <li> My skin is a little on the dry side and this helps tremendously.  I use it during the day, it works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and I have no intention of changing to another brand.  I suggest any woman with dry sensitive skin should try the Dermalogic line of products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and it still works well.  In the summer months, I use it as a night cream and In the winter months, I use it during the day.  I have combination skin that gets really dry.  This moisturizers so well without making me look greasy.  My face drinks it up.  It might be too heavy for normal skin (try Active Moist).  I love Dermalogica products and this is one of my favorites.  A bottle lasts me about 2 months using it once a day.</li>
    <li> The moisture cream has been in my &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine for years and this is a very economical way for me to get it.  It is one I always come back to every time I think I will try something cheaper.... I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try a premium product.</li>
    <li> Been using Dermalogica for over 20 years now.  Just love their products!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite moisturizer and I have tried plenty. I have dry skin and this leaves it well moisturized without feeling greasy.  I use it both summer and winter.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because I love the way if feeling on my skin.  I use to buy it from my dermatologist for a lot more money.  Thank you Amazon vendor for making Dermalogica affordable so that I can apply it much more generously.  My skin is very happy!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, my skin is very sensitive and this makes it feel so soft and controls the dry and oil.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my very dry skin.  Only downfall is price, but I suppose you get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
    <li> I use Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance lotion in combination with Dermalogica Ultra Calming Cleanser and I&#x27;m very happy with this regiment. It&#x27;s soothing for dry or sensitive skin. I use a little extra on my hands, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My only concern when I try to buy products like these on line is that I&#x27;m not sure how old they are.  I wish sellers would indicate stuff like that, since products tend to lose their efficacy after 6 months, and then you&#x27;re just putting a bunch of crappy radicals on your skin.</li>
    <li> Definitely adds moisture and provides soft skin. I have very dry skin in summer and winter and this actually makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s been moisturized. Also recieved this product in a timely manner with no issues.</li>
    <li> Very good product!&lt;br /&gt;I have ecezma on my face and product is very soothing, non -irritating and moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone with dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin. Absorbs quickly and skin feels smooth. I love all dermalogica products</li>
    <li> One of a very few face creams I can use on my ultra-sensitive skin. It&#x27;s heavier than the Active Moist, but a light layer can be achieved by a few dots on the face. Skin temp warms it up and produces a lovely moisturizing cream for day or night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and never disappoints.  I live in the northeast and the climate for a complexion can be trying, which is why I use this very reliable profduct</li>
    <li> I purchased this product the first time - when my suitcase was lost and I was staying at a hotel and this was my only choice from their spa. I love the product and think it is well worth the money. I will continue to be a faithful user.</li>
    <li> First time user for this moisturizing cream. It does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I finally found a moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout. My skin feels so soft and moisturized now. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
    <li> I had been using Dermalogica for over 15 years, so I KNOW these products well. I decided to save a few bucks (really?, after S&amp;H is not much of a savings) and I can tell you that this was not the same product. The texture and scent were very different. Not sure if it was expired or altered, but definitely NOT what I am used to buying from the regular authorized professional. I learned my lesson well.</li>
    <li> I have been recommending this product for years. My only complaint ever- came with this last purchase- It felt a little watered down. I am hoping it was just a one time thing because I want to keep using it!</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer at night for my mature skin.  It&#x27;s a thicker cream for long lasting recovery overnight.  I use it every evening.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied both with the product and the deliverytime.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and spent years trying a variety of lotions.  This was recommended to me during a facial a couple years ago and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  My skin feels smooth and moisturized without being greasy or waxy.  And I never breakout with this lotion.  Amazon is also a great place to buy this, much cheaper than my salon.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for me.  I have been using it for years and just wish I could buy it in the larger size.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it daily. At 66 I&#x27;m told I look 40.....</li>
    <li> Goes on thick, but doesn&#x27;t truly lock in moisture long-term (for my fairly dry skin).  Was hoping this would be more concentrated.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever. Not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. There is no unpleasant taste (I&#x27;ve used it on my lips as well...) and it has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica for some years as suggested by the best esthetician I ever had (she is now a nurse.). This product is wonderful. Nothing better.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a skin specialist at a spa I frequent. I&#x27;m 50 and my skin had begun to become a little dry and less elastic. I use this every time I wash my face and I receive compliments all the time about how beautiful my skin is. It absorbs quickly, and your skin instantly looks brighter and more supple. The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat, spas charge $65-$75 for same product.</li>
    <li> fantastic product...been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this moisture.</li>
    <li> It works well, and my sensitive skin is not allergic to it. A good alternative to more costly moisturizers. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Have been a Dermalogica user for years love it.</li>
    <li> Not really wirth the money spent for this one - but its s till good</li>
    <li> Love this moisture cream.  Not too oily and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> in the dry southwest, we need all the moisture we can get.  An application of this in the morning, nourishes the skin all day long--and makes you look as if you just had a facial.  Try it--you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> It is good face cream for the winter, a bit thick for the summer. But wish the price was a bit lower.</li>
    <li> Love this Age Smart line.  Have all the products.  They are great for my skin.  I live in Nevada and it&#x27;s really dry here, so to have products do as advertised is sometimes hard to find.  These Age Smart products are just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin unhappy! :) It is just thick enough that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but not too thick that it feels like olive oil - haha.</li>
    <li> Recently it came to my attention that my beauty routine needed some serious help. As an adult acne sufferer in my mid-twenties I have shied away from any moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t Olay for years. But the addition of some prescription acne products in the last couple years and a cross country move into a completely different climate have wreaked a slow havoc on my skin leaving it both oily and flaky - especially by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night after work I shuffled into an Ulta, embarrassed by the condition of my skin, but desperate for some help. Lucky for me, their staff esthetician was still there. Still reluctant to jump on a new moisturizer, I took a new, gentler cleanser ([[ASIN:B002PBHQEK L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, 6-Fluid Ounce]]) - and a sample of some high priced moisturizer. Enter Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the wash liberally that night and the moisturizer VERY sparingly. As I smoothed and then patted it into my tired, reddened, skin I waited for the burn. For the strong smell... That never came. It soaked right in, leaving my skin with a wonderful elasticity and yet no grease. The smell was not overwhelming --not even necessarily pleasant-- just sort of plant-ish in a comforting, non-chemical way.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I went to bed fearing the breakout that was sure to make itself evident in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t come! In FACT, my skin actually looked decidedly calmer. It still felt nice and elastic and soft...&lt;br /&gt;This went on nightly for a week before I ran out of the sample. And after one day without it I knew the splurge would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third week now, and not looking back.&lt;br /&gt;My skin, though not zit-free, has improved enough to garner remarks from co-workers and family, not to mention restore some of the self-confidence I didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d lost. It feels soft and fresh, looks more evenly toned, dewy, and much less red.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, myskin is rehabilitated enough that I only put moisturizer on the drier patches around my mouth and cheeks, then use what is left on my hands after for the rest of my face. This 3.4 oz bottle will last me a year!&lt;br /&gt;So, SO worth it. At least for me. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered my Intensive Moisture Balance on November 18 and it arrived on  November 22..  THIS IS AWESOME.... Will order again from this  supplier.  Thank you!!!!! I have been using Dermalogica for a year now. I  have dry and sensitive skin and everyone comments on how beautiful my skin  looks.  Love love love Dermalogica!!!</li>
    <li> LOve Love Dermalogica!  I have very dry skin and Dermalogica seems to be what works for me!  :) Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Perfect product! I have been using it for years. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  I have very dry, prematurely aging skin.  Everything about this moisturizer is wonderful.  Good, thick texture but still absorbs completely.  Does not irritate my skin.  Gets rid of that tight feeling, and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth.  I also love that since the last tube I bought (did I mention it lasts forever?), Dermalogica has removed the parabens from their formulas.  Love, love, love.  And love the Amazon price!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> As an older woman I have issues with dry skin.  This is the best product I have used to help restore moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> This has been the most wonderful facial moisturizer which I began using in 1998, and it has been very helpful for many years.</li>
    <li> Very Nice moisturizer.  Dermalogica is an excellent product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with dermalogia products and this one is no exception. It is moisturizing without being heavy. I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s dry and this product keeps my skin looking refreshed and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I have extremely dry skin and have tried so many different products.  This is the only moisturizer that works for me</li>
    <li> This is one of those staple products that I don&#x27;t want to live without. It lives up to its moisture benefit promises. It&#x27;s non-greasy, light weight and makes me feel like I&#x27;m really taking care of my face when I used it twice a day. Doubles nicely as a day and then night cream. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer! I have been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> Dermalogica this is the best anti aging lotion... You won&#x27;t be disappointed  on any product you purchase&lt;br /&gt;With the dermalogica name on it....</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product. i was on active moist for a long time but since i turned 40 i needed something more and switched to the moisture balance which i use morning and night. in my opinion a great products</li>
    <li> Love it, can&#x27;t complain. It was $10 cheaper in October, I recently bought one again last week. Amazon seems to have price switches.. I&#x27;m starting to wonder. But overall, this product is great for my dry, but also combo skin. My skin is normal, but on the surface very dry. I still tend to break out at 28. But this provides the perfect balance of moisture. I have bad allergies, it does not mess with them at all. Very happy with this product, and I&#x27;m completely obsessed with products.</li>
    <li> Good product which my wife enjoys using.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical. There was some chemical smell that I thought i havnt noticed before. Then, I went to Ulta and smell the same product. There was no difference. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Was not  as moisturizing in winter as I&#x27;d hoped for but still a good product for summer, spring and fall.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for winter, especially is your skin is dry.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife while it was on sale, she uses it a lot and loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife three years ago and she loves it. I have also tried it since we are in a harsh winter climate here in the Midwestern US. I have to admit it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. She likes it because it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. I like it because it&#x27;s not fragranced and goes on cleanly after I shave.</li>
    <li> i love this for my dry face. No alcohol to further dry my skin. Keeps the elements at bay and my skin looking younger.</li>
    <li> Hydrates my skill really well.  I especially notice that when I apply it at night after a very long day, my skin is refreshed and pepped up again in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has been excellent for me</li>
    <li> This cream works great for my dry winter skin. I haven&#x27;t found anything that is more effective in fighting the dryness.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for 18 years. My face is smooth and always moist but not greasy. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturiser, but I have only been using it for a month and reserve 5 stars for products that are better than originally expected.</li>
    <li> high quality product, and very swift delivery!</li>
    <li> Wonderful facial lotion and the price was good</li>
    <li> I have been using the moisturiser for last several years, extremely good for dry skin, I had a severe dry skin, it got healed with the cream.  The cream has made my skin very smooth and shining, I get lot of compliments for my smooth and glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old and have very dry skin following chemotherapy. This cream has conletely revitalized my skin and made it look younger and fresher than ever. I don&#x27;t look tired and dehydrated anymore. It is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried all the other expensive products and this is by far the best!!!!  Worth the cost for sure.</li>
    <li> Dermalogica provides great products for people like me who have sensitive skin.  Wish the products weren&#x27;t so expensive though!  Glad that I can buy them on Amazon which is cheaper than buying them at a retail location.</li>
    <li> SOFTENS AND IS LONG LASTING!!&lt;br /&gt;It is the only moisturizer that is long lasting and softens my skin.  A great product!  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good product - price is right also.</li>
    <li> This product did not smell like it normally does when purchased in store. It does moisturize and hydrate well, but not worth it overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product on Amazon for several years with no issues.  This order was not the genuine product - watery consistency, different smell, etc.  I should have known when the packaging was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the reviews, it looks like this has happened to lots of people.  I&#x27;m really disappointed with Amazon for allowing this to happen - if it says Amazon fulfillment, then I should be able to expect it is genuine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order says - Sold by Skin Fantastic</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica products on my face for years and have been getting compliments on my face for years.</li>
    <li> My box did not have the derma seal sticker which makes me very uncomfortable in the validity of this item...</li>
    <li> I was shocked ...I&#x27;m still looking for my return label. It did nothing for me...</li>
    <li> This was more than 50% less than at the local store and it is the exact same thing a real money saver here</li>
    <li> This seller ( CHARSUA-SKINCARE-SALON ) sent me the creams without the boxes, which I thought was suspicious.  The consistency was different from before.  I contacted Dermalogica and gave then the code on the tube, and they are all expired past the shelf life.  That is why the seller took them out of the boxes because otherwise I would have seen immediately that they were expired.</li>
    <li> At least, not for me. I have super, super dry skin (made worse by my desert surroundings), so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for really hydrating products. Intensive Moisture Balance does a fairly decent job of combating dryness, but I&#x27;d argue against the word \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; in the title. Personally, I always require more than one coat of this, along with some sort of oil mixed in, to really moisturize. I think it&#x27;d be a good moisturizer for someone with normal-to-moderately-dry skin, but for the driest of the dry like myself, Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance doesn&#x27;t quiiite cut it. 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2014: IMB is still my moisturizer, but I very rarely use it. Instead, I simply use argan oil for my facial moisturizing needs. Haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
    <li> I had red, dry, flaky, sensitive skin. This along with a clarisonic made my skin perfect!  I will never switch skin products again.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned me onto this product and I am hooked.  My skin is dry and this adds the moisture back.  My mother uses it daily, too.  She is 86.  Best prices for this are online.</li>
    <li> Also use this daily and my skin looks pretty good for someone who is a sun worshiper!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. Why? I don&#x27;t lotion. But when I do, I use this because of my also sensitive skin. Dermatologist (mine) recommended, so I do what I&#x27;m told. So far so happy, and my problem areas are getting addressed!</li>
    <li> Great people to work with !!!!</li>
    <li> I got a consultation at a beauty store and was told this was the best selling skin care line.  It took me a few different products to try before I got my right combination and now I would not switch for anything.  Stores are great at returning products if they do not work for you.  I have found I save more money buying this product online.</li>
    <li> Been buying Dermalogica for years.  Was a bit apprehensive to order through Amazon because of some negative reviews, but seeing as how it was $20 bucks cheaper and I could always return it, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will be buying this through Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m satisfy.</li>
    <li> I love this soothing moisturizer for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great, no breakouts!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the price.  Which was a great price.  I will definitely order again.  It arrived on time also.</li>
    <li> Have used this product since 1984.  The price offered was at a substantial discount.  It was the authentic product. The product arrived without the exterior packaging (box) but that was known to me at the time of the order.</li>
    <li> Used to love this, but I didn&#x27;t realize that I was having an allergic reaction.  Burning eyes even when I avoided the eye area.  Use something else now and the problem went away!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. Never sticky or heavy on the skin, even in summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and I live in an altitude of 7,000 feet.  The air is so dry and it wreaks havoc on my skin.  Also, I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts.  Joy.  So I&#x27;ve always been cautious of using a heavier cream.  The lighter ones just don&#x27;t cut it in this climate.  I&#x27;ve been using Intensive Moisture for about 4 years and it&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m a loyal Dermalogica client and it&#x27;s products are the best match for my skin type.  No more breakouts.  And my skin feels soft and quenched by this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philosophy and DDF which both were alright, but this leaves my skin with the right balance. Not too oily, but never feeling dry. Ships promptly and gets to me on time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is great. It does not leave your face dry or sticky.  Great in  Arizona or dry climate for sure.</li>
    <li> Great fast service  Great product.  Will use again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it excellent for mature skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica for a long time. Great overall product. Keeps your face moisturized. all the products are worth the money!</li>
    <li> With this moisturizer I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry spots around my chin and mouth any more. It can sometimes feel a bit greasy if I used more than necessary, but never heavy or cakey. I love it.</li>
    <li> I had been spending $45 a month on department store products only to find that my dry skin still persisted.  This was not only a lot cheeper and lasts much longer, but has also solved my dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and love how it keeps my face moist.</li>
    <li> I usually use Philosophy, but it hadn&#x27;t been working out so great in a humid environment.  This lotion keeps my face moisturized and my skin pH balanced so I don&#x27;t break out as much.  Love it.</li>
