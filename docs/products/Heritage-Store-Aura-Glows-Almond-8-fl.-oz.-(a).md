<ol>
    <li> LOVE this product.  I use it on my body and face as a nightly moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I would not use any other oil. I feel it is the best. Have used it for years</li>
    <li> Love this oil - has a nice almond scent</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well.. I get so many compliments on my skin and I can see the difference when I don&#x27;t have it. .love this product</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower after I&#x27;ve washed. I am older and my skin tends to be dry, but with aura glow my skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I teach Qigong classes and occasionally give health tips to my students. I always recommend Aura Glow for the skin, especially in winter. Leave a piece of bread out overnight in January, by morning you have toast. Same for your skin. I use Aura Glow every morning and it lasts the entire day, even while riding a bicycle in a stiff freezing wind.</li>
    <li> i used this oil for 25 years at least. Then tried other products and forgot about my almond oil. Its been very dry here 4 the last few years and my skin started showing it. No matter what i rubbed into my skin (some very expensive) it stayed dry, itchy and flaky. Then i remembered the almond oil. Wow. My skin is revived, glowing and feels good to be in it. I shower and barely dry myself then start working the oil into every inch. Btw this is the best massage oil you could imagine!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell but I like the product</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is light on the skin; not too fragrant. I&#x27;m able to add essential oils for the mood I want to create. It washes off easily and still leaves the skin smoother than before.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for a decade, but stopped using it because the local store no longer stocked it. The oil came up when she mentioned how ineffective the moisturizer she was using at the time was, so I looked it up - this was my first time trying the product, and I was very surprised at the quality and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has a very sweet amaretto smell, which could be sickly sweet if you don&#x27;t like the smell of almonds (my wife and I do). If you use a little bit, it will rub right into the skin; too much will leave you oily but can be wiped off. It won&#x27;t pill up unless the skin it is being applied to is very dirty. This product keeps skin smooth and comfortable, works well as massage or shaving oil, and is a very effective and delicious smelling replacement for moisturizer (my wife uses it after showering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best massage oil I&#x27;ve ever used - I immediately bought another bottle after trying the first so we won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my hubby. He had really dry skin and regular lotions dry his skin out even kids. He loves this product. It last on his skin all day. And it had a nice scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it on my shin &amp; in my scalp. It relieves dry itching skin &amp; makes my entire body smooth. The scent is perfect.</li>
    <li> Yummy smell. Great gift for Mom. Edgar Cayce fan.</li>
    <li> I use this on my massage clients and myself.  It is terrific.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for twenty years. It&#x27;s excellent for massages, but I mostly use it to massage my joints (knees, shoulders, etc.)</li>
    <li> I use it after I shower it makes my skin feel youthful and glowing skin.  The heals of feet are baby smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It has replaced my old moisturizers! I love the fact that I can use this on my hair and skin..it keeps my skin and hair hydrated without weighing it down or a greasy feeling.. and oh my it smells amazing!! I just recently ordered another bottle as both my daughter and I use the product.. it last quite a while so for the price it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> wonderful on skin as a moisturizer the scent is not heavy and does not linger. also use it in my bath water and it does not leave a ring like other bath oils</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I love it!</li>
