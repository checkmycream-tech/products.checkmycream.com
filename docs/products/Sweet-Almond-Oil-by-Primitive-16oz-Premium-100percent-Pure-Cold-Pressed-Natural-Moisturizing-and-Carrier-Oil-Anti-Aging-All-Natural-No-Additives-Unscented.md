<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in return for my opinion. Let me start by saying it smells good enough to eat. I use this as a carrier oil for lots of things, mostly massage oils. Smooth application, not sticky or tacky. This size is perfect too, for those who use them in lots of stuff. I use it in my body butters too...</li>
    <li> Beautiful conduit for essential oils. I mix it with my Young Living oils for application after shower to the body. Use it on my small children as well. Lux and unscented. Light feeling oil. Non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This Sweet Almond Oil is wonderful. I was going to make a mixture using essential oil and use it in my daughters thick unmanageable hair but the smell of the oil itself is nice. So I used it alone in her hair. It didn&#x27;t leave it greasy or nasty feeling it actually left her hair soft and manageable. Her scalp looked more moisturized. Overall it gave her hair a much needed healthy shine and look. We don&#x27;t use it daily 1-2 times per week is more then enough. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never tried this amazing oil. I will be looking into more ways to use it. I am impressed! I received this at a reduced price for review purposes all views expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> There is a good amount in a bottle to last awhile. Great product to use as a skin moisturizer and hair treatment. It helps keep hair manageable and easy to comb. It absorbs well on the skin upon applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this at a discount and I’m sharing my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> great price for the quantity,  great delivery, great packaging. What I expected. Wish I could have found the organic almond oil I was looking for, but after reading reviews on the organics and their delivery, product quality, I decided to go with this one. It does not have a strong almond smell, I have never had an almond oil that had one, so this is perfect for the body oils I make.</li>
    <li> Great for hair!  Since I retired I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair or use electric curlers or flat irons.  Nothing-Just wash &amp; let dry.  So why do I still have dry hair &amp; split ends?  Who knows? Probably age?  I love this oil for my hair &amp; skin.  It keeps my hands looking &amp; feeling moisturized.  This summer I&#x27;m sure I will be using my Sweet Almond Oil even more.  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  Right now, this oil is at a great price on Amazon so I won&#x27;t feel bad about using liberally! Thanks!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very fine carrier oil.  Seeps into the skin almost instantly to leave no oily residue.  Softens skin and helps to give a more youthful look to face.  I use it all over as a carrier for my essential Vetiver oil.  It works very nicely.</li>
    <li> Received my oil earlier than expected and the packaging was great - no leaks!  This oil makes my skin feel so good!  I would purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I like very much that it is pure 100% almond oil and nothing else. I use it daily after shower. I use it in my hair as my hair is brittle with age. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Used to make my own bath salts and really like this oil.  Works well with the salt and essential oils.  Doesn&#x27;t interfere with the scent of the essential oils.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!! My skin feels amazing and leaves me with a beautiful natural glow. I will definitely be buying this product from primitive oils again!</li>
    <li> Great oil! I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I use it on my hair and skin. Silky oil absorbs quickly..</li>
    <li> Received it in a timely manner. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, it is very light and has a light smell. Use this on my skin after a shower it makes my skin very soft. If you have dry skin like me I would recommend this.  Also  you could add a few drops of coconut or vanilla to the oil. Thanks</li>
    <li> I liked the way that it moisturized my skin and hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My wife like this better than her normal Jaffra. She says it lighter and less oily. It&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My skin has never felt better</li>
    <li> Certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like Almond. Very disappointed. Sorry.</li>
    <li> size for the amount was pricey</li>
    <li> true almond oil. Moisturizes skin and hair well</li>
    <li> At the risk of the demand of this product causing the price to soar; I can neither confirm, nor deny that this is the best skin moisturizer on the market. I use it for my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the Primitive Sweet Almond oil.  This is a very good oil and there are many uses for it.  One of the main things I use it for is as a carrier oil for certain products but my favorite thing to use it for is as a moisturizer on my face at night.  I wake up in the morning and my skin is so soft.  I can&#x27;t wait to find out all the other ways I can use this wonderful oil!</li>
    <li> Great oil for cosmetics, base oil for perfumes, no additives so great for massage and lubricants. Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> I have very cracked hands and feet and used the oil as a lotion for a few days and can see a big difference in the cracks of my hands. It needs to be a daily moisturizer. Would like to see a different bottle top on it to make application easier. THe product itself is great. Used it on my hair as well and slept all night with wet hair and woke up with my hair feeling soft and almost straight so it made getting ready much quicker. Normally sleeping with wet hair I wake up with a matted mess. Highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This Sweet Almond Oil is amazing on my hands!!!  For years I have had a huge problem with dry and splitting skin especially on my hands and in just a few days my hands feel better than they have in a very long time!!  I am so happy with the 16oz bottle I received to review especially since I know none of it will go to waste.  Every night I just rub a small amount onto my hands and they no longer hurt.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone that has dry &amp;/or cracked skin!!</li>
    <li> We love this oil! It is awesome for my daughter&#x27;s dry damaged hair. She rubs her head when she sleeps. It is wonderful on our skin also. My husband got a cold and he used it to help his nose not be so sore. I am going to use it in a foot scrub for mother&#x27;s day. No smell so very neutral.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, a great value. Not over powering smell, just right.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Gyn for personal dryness.  Works like a charm!  I have seriously dehydrated skin due to a kidney disease.  I have begun to use the almond oil as my after bath moisturizer.  It is not greasy nor does it leave an oily residue as one might expect.  It absorbs into the skin leaving it feeling smooth &amp; looking more healthy.</li>
    <li> I use Sweet Almond oil right after my shower or bath, it absorbs very quickly &amp; it has no scent.. No greasy feel &amp; my skin is very soft...even the rough spots on my feet &amp; elbows are smooth. It keeps my skin totally moisturized. I even use it on my face, &amp; I have had no problems with any breakouts. I received a sample of this product for my honest opinion &amp; I was very happy bc the bottle was bigger than I expected, and I like the price. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil. I have really dry skin and sweet almond oil just moisturizes my skin very well. I apply this a oil after I take a shower it gets absorbed very quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel all greasy it just makes it feel so soft I also apply it a small amount on my split ends and it moisturizes and softens my very dry and damaged ends.I really do recommend this sweet almond oil it works very well it&#x27;s a great deal you get a huge bottle of great quality oil.</li>
    <li> I have purchased twice and love it</li>
    <li> This is a generous portion and it is 100% pure almond oil, like the bottle says.  It&#x27;s a wonderful alternative to lotion after a shower.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m using it in my homemade body scrubs and it&#x27;s fabulous and so healthy for my skin. My friends are my guinea pigs and they&#x27;re loving the way their skin feels. So yes, I HIGHLY recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> Works well but wish I would have noticed it has no scent even though it says &amp;#34;sweet almond oil&amp;#34; but regardless does the job</li>
    <li> Love love love!  I stopped using all expensive moisturizers and creams and switched to this.  It has been said this is the only thing Jackie Kennedy used.  Anyway...I love it.  It makes my skin feel like absolute silk.  The oil is absorbed completely and quickly and people are constantly commenting on how soft my skin feels.  I even use it on my face and I have seen real changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil is great. Even better than the argan oil i have used. Just hope they can improve the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for dry skin.  I have been using it as a body lotion and can really see a difference.  i also love it because it is not greasy and soaks right in--my clothes don&#x27;t stick to it like they do with lotion.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for moisturizing sensitive skin.  As long as you don&#x27;t use too  much, it goes on without feeling greasy and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my extremely sensitive skin. In fact, it is one of the few products I can use to soothe my skin when it is irritated.  It&#x27;s also great for hair.  After leaving it in as a conditioner for 15 minutes, my hair was super soft and manageable.  I didn&#x27;t even have to use a straightener on my usually wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Truly my go-to oil! This is the best quality oil. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Received w/i week of order.  Have used once.  Oil is fresh.  Results forthcoming.</li>
    <li> little or no scent, I use it in my hair before bed if I am to shower in the a.m. also on my knees elbows and heels and after the shower it works great all over the body. I will be purchasing again when I run out but I have more than half a bottle left after few months so it does last a longtime with everyday use.</li>
    <li> This item is UNSCENTED.  This information was not posted online but a sticker attached to the product says &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  Would have been nice to know BEFORE I ordered this item.  I would not have ordered it.</li>
    <li> An excelent product and we do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used these oil a few times as my carrier oil in essential oils and it holds the oils good and I enjoy the smell of it more then coconut oil. My daughter also loves to add a little to her lotion she is crazy about the smell and says it makes her skin softer. I haven&#x27;t tried this so I can&#x27;t say for sure but she swears she loves it so if you enjoy the smell I would definitely recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt; I received this at a promotional cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, leaves skin smooth, good price. No extra, harmful ingredients - just oil. A bottle with a cap that doesn&#x27;t pour out a much would be helpful.</li>
    <li> I only used a few times so far, but seems like a good product.  FYI - It leaked in the shipping package.</li>
    <li> A clean supple oil. Not greasy. Perfect for adding to lotions and potions!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that is hard to manage most of the time. I tried this oil and it made my hair not only managable after using it, but it was soft to the touch and the oil acted as a detangler as well. Great product to use to enrich your hair by look and feel.</li>
    <li> Use this for my lotion everyday.  I don&#x27;t feel oily either.  Soaks in quickly.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product..highly reccomend</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite almond oil.  I replaced my previous brand with this when it ran out, and I&#x27;m loving Primitive one even more.  I use it to tame flyaways in my hair, as a carrier oil for essential oils, for oil cleansing on my face, and as a general body moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great stuff! I would recommend a different bottle top for easier dispensing.</li>

    <li> This is a very generously sized almond oil! It shipped out to me very quickly, and arrived in nice condition. It came in a very generous 16 fl oz bottle, and didn&#x27;t leak at all during shipment. The packaging is very rustic looking, which goes well with the company&#x27;s theme of &amp;#34;primitive&amp;#34;.. I am definitely a fan of a good theme, so I can really appreciate the thematic labeling. The sweet almond oil itself is pleasantly hydrating on its own. I can apply it directly to my skin, and it gives my skin a richly hydrated feeling while not being overly greasy at all. The almond oil has no noticeable scent, which makes it perfect for use as a carrier oil or additive to body scrubs and butters. This is a great deal for this price! I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this sweet almond oil and would most likely repurchase. (I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> Nice stuff and not greasy.</li>
