<li> These brushes are so soft and fluffy.</li>
<li> I use them evey day one has a loose handle</li>
<li> Only thing is it smells a bit odd like they just made the brushes.</li>
<li> I bought the same ones but in black &amp; the black seem to shed for some odd reason but these ones dont.</li>
<li> I know people complained about how long it took to get them, but I had them within a week.</li>
<li> Each brush is packed tight with bristles, so they feel substantial.</li>
<li> The glue connecting the brush tip to the shafts sucks.</li>
<li> Unbelievable quality for the money!</li>
<li> Received my order this past Sunday I gotta say theses brushes are awesomeeee!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a shame I had to trash them because the brushes were soft. :(</li>
<li> Was a little skeptical about using a brush vs a sponge for my foundation</li>
<li> Received this today and all 4 brushes were broken.</li>
