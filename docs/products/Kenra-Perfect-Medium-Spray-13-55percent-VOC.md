    <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold my style at all. the kenra 25 is superior</li>
    <li> I have used Kenra&#x27;s extra strong hairspray for years and I love it. But I tried some of the medium spray and liked the scent better. I have VERY straight hair and use a volumizing mousse and curling iron followed by hair spray. I gave it a shot but it literally fell flat in a few hours. This spray is probably good for someone with some body to their hair; it&#x27;s just not strong enough for mine.</li>
    <li> Hairspray is much like jeans...it&#x27;s hard to find that perfect one.  I can&#x27;t even tell you how many different brands of hairspray I&#x27;ve used over the years...everything from expensive brands bought at the salon to less costly brands from the drugstore.  This is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had held my hair all day today and it&#x27;s a very windy day....BUT it&#x27;s not a helmet head!  My hair is actually moving in the wind but it just falls right back in place.  Also I can run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for hairspray that holds your hair but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff...this one is for you!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find Kenra Perfect Medium Spray.  It gives me the flexible hold that I like and is a great product.  I highly recommend it - try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> The spray can didn&#x27;t work.  The company refunded my money, but I would not order again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite like the smell of this.</li>
    <li> The only hairspray that I will use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I have baby fine hair and this spray helps to set my style without leaving my hair stiff.  This hairspray also last all day with running around.  I carry the small one in my purse in case it is raining and I need a touch up...works great!</li>
    <li> Best product. easiest way to find.</li>
    <li> This is my fave hairspray!  Excellent hold without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Great flexible hold spray.  Leaves your hair with great shine!  I will re-purchase this!</li>
    <li> this is the only hairspray i use it holds my hair and yet it doesn&#x27;t  make my hair stiff  i only use number 13 the other ones  # 25 makes my hair like glue thank you</li>
    <li> Just enough hold to keep the humidity from frizzing hair.  Spray before styling,  then style, then spray when done. great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray. Medium hold, with no stiffness. Leaves hair soft and manageable. I can also use my blow dryer later if I need to touch up the style.</li>
    <li> Great service, they delivered the product right away.  I have always used Kendra 25 hold and wanted to try the lighter&lt;br /&gt;type hold hairspray. It&#x27;s good, but I still like the 25 hold.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Decent smell and the #13 is perfect weight for my fine long wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair sprays since the one I used to use was no longer made.  Kenra 13 is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It keeps my hair in place, but doesn&#x27;t make it so stiff that I can&#x27;t run a comb through my hair.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it. Not sticky or stiff. Hair still has movement and shine.</li>
