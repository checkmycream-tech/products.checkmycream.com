      <li>I love this soap and watch for it to be an add on.  </li>
      <li>I work mostly with acid, phosphate, and lime.</li>
      <li>I was a bath and body works gal for many years)</li>

      <li>it was worth it to find a scent I liked.</li>
      <li>Love the clean non slimy way it,leaves your skin feeling</li>
      <li>Great way to try all the different kinds.</li>
      <li>I had patchouli,oatmeal lavender (my favorite) charcoal,dragons blood,frankincense,and patchouli-orange.expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>Plus they are free trade and are philanthropists.</li>
      <li>I always have a box available in the house.</li>
      <li>Great deal, each bar is a different scent.</li>

      <li>My soap was intact and the one in using now is great for my dry winter skin</li>

      <li>This soap I can use on my face  and it has transformed my skin to baby soft.</li>
      <li>Love the scents but the bars are very thin, they break apart the first time you use them.</li>
      <li>Was going to gift but will not due to condition.</li>
      <li>Add to that, there must be some sort of gluten cross contamination of the soap or in the original ingredients because both my husband and I have been having our typical gluten reactions on the days we shave with this soap and it gets into tiny cuts.  </li>
      <li>Really am enjoying this sample box of thin &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; .  </li>
      <li>Was listed as new and soaps were flaking outside the package, the box was torn at the corners and held together by a giant piece of tape.</li>
      <li>It all smells heavily of the mint and every bar smells exactly the same now.</li>

    <li> I got this to try. My work environment is very damaging to my skin. I work mostly with acid, phosphate, and lime. With all the chemicals my skin has become super sensitive. I had luck with oatmeal soaps but wanted something that smelled nice(since I was a bath and body works gal for many years) I came across this and for the price it was worth it to find a scent I liked. Of course I like them all lol down side none are the mini bars are marked what they are so you have to look them up online. This soap I can use on my face  and it has transformed my skin to baby soft. Cleared up blemishes on my face and has smoothed fine lines I was starting to notice. I am in love with zum bars. I don&#x27;t think I will go anywhere else from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the scents but the bars are very thin, they break apart the first time you use them. Wish they were the sizevof regular soap bars.</li>
    <li> Very nice assortment.</li>
    <li> Yes, the individual pieces are small, but the price is great compared to a full size bar from Whole Foods. The scents are great and the soap is really moisturizing.</li>
    <li> LOVE Zum Bar Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap.  This is a great way to experience many scents.</li>
    <li> My favorite bar soap!</li>
    <li> Really am enjoying this sample box of thin &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; .  There were a couple minty bars that did tend to overpower the others, but I removed them from the box promptly. I&#x27;d buy this again..fun to try them all.</li>
    <li> The arrived in packaging as shown on the web site.  It&#x27;s a sampler pack, so many different slivers of soap in various shapes and sizes.  The soap has a nice rich lather to it and seems good.  I like the scent I am using now but the scents all seem to mix together, so it is hard to tell them apart individually for a reorder.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff came with box too</li>
    <li> Nice when they come out of the box,but don&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear well&amp;#34;. The bars start out with ridges that quickly disappear with use; they then stick to the soap holder.</li>
    <li> Was listed as new and soaps were flaking outside the package, the box was torn at the corners and held together by a giant piece of tape. Was going to gift but will not due to condition. Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> We love Zum bars and this is a great way to sample a variety of scents!</li>
    <li> Very thin bars of soap.  I would also like them labeled.  I wanted to try various scents.  I have no idea what kind they are.</li>
    <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL!  Smells divine.  I want more.</li>
