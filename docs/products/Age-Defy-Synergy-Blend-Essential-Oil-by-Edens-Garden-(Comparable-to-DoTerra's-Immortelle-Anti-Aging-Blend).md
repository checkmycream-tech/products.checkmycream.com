      <li>I love the proce and is a good oil.</li>
      <li>If this blend is what you are searching for, Edens would be as good as any, or better, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I use this to create my own anti-aging serum.</li>
      <li>and I think they are equally effective.</li>
      <li>Love this, use it in my homemade face oil.</li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>I love it and it is working</li>
      <li>The company has excellent quality oils and their prices are such that they allow the consumer to experiment with them without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this oil blend.</li>
      <li>One of the key ingredients in this is helichrysum, which is known to help block UV rays, a great bonus!  </li>
      <li>and I love what it&#x27;s done for my skin.</li>
      <li>just ok, nothing to write home about</li>
      <li>I love Edens Garden essential oils and they have excellent customer service!</li>
      <li>This is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;There is some oil in the blend that I do not care for the scent of ...</li>
      <li>I placed 4 drops in a 10ml roller bottle and filled the rest of the way with rose hip oil also by edens garden.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much I&#x27;ve shared it with my mom and ordered her a bottle of her own!</li>
      <li>I mix it with hemp oil, but it has a strong smell</li>
      <li>DoTerra oils still smell more pure and more interesting in their combinations.  </li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any huge difference in wrinkles or anything</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>It smells great and when you add a few drops to your favorite carrier oil and apply it your face will love it.</li>
      <li>I am 27 with not so great skin from teenage acne and what not.</li>
      <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Nothing unique.</li>
      <li>I am using for my vision, but excited to see what it might do to my skin</li>
      <li>but it smells nice and my face is soft.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and scent does not last so strong all night long.  </li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>As usual, Edens Garden is great.  </li>
      <li>Really like Edens Garden oils but buy direct from them because to many times oils get opened, diluted, resealed and sold again.</li>
      <li>Most products I tried seemed to just address the top layer of skin, and might be fine for my face, but nothing ever addressed my tired, worn hands.  </li>
      <li>I use the OZ vitamin C serum first and then the oil.  </li>
      <li>I love Edens garden and will buy again in future.</li>
      <li>I love essential oils</li>
      <li>Man in my life enjoyed a facial massage with this oil.  </li>
      <li>Truly and deeply moisturized and healthy.  </li>
      <li>all have certain when promised.</li>
      <li>This mixed with argan oil lifted and took away fine line and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>see how much he relaxes,</li>
      <li>Love it must have for the evening face skin, I feel rejuvenated in the morning, and save me the time from all the other product..</li>
      <li>If you research the main ingredients in this product, you will see Edens has blended a very desirable blend, just as well as the competitor, at a fifth of the cost.</li>
      <li>I do have other essential oils  from  Edens Garden that I have been  very pleased  </li>
      <li>It is a bit greasy in this form, so I mainly use it at night.</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Age Defy if you&#x27;re searching, like I did, for a product that makes a visible impact, and penetrates your skin beyond the surface.  </li>
      <li>Skin seems a little more even toned.</li>
      <li>I have used nearly the whole bottle with a once a day application and can tell no difference at all .</li>
      <li>/&gt;PS - Buy directly from Edens Garden, it is 19.98</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I do know that Do-terra&#x27;s anti-aging oil blend in nearly $100.00.</li>
      <li>I follow this with some all natural lotion, to act as a sealer.  </li>

<li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
<li> the down side, not sure this blend actually is defying age, BUT, do any of them?</li>
<li> I mix mine with a little bit of coconut oil and massage all over my face and neck in the morning and at night.</li>
<li> I add a few drops to my body lotion before applying and add to my night-time moisturizer too for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been using this oil, on my face, everyday for 2 months and have seen a difference in my complexion.</li>
<li> This blend is very similar to Doterras immortelle and it is much less expensive.</li>
<li> I usually add a few drops to some carrier oil and apply it each night.  </li>
<li> Men tend to shy away from fragrance, rub his sore back with muscle relief aapnd</li>
<li> 1 drop in my night cream leaves my skin dewey in the morning, but without the oil slick that usually accompanies over-moisturisation.</li>

    <li> Really like Edens Garden oils but buy direct from them because to many times oils get opened, diluted, resealed and sold again.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day with almond oil on my face and elbows.  I use the OZ vitamin C serum first and then the oil.  My skin has vastly improved with brightness and lightening of dark spots.</li>
    <li> I use this to create my own anti-aging serum. I like it.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference in my skin but it is moisturizing</li>
    <li> Great product!! Loves the way it makes my skin look and feel</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil blend. I am 27 with not so great skin from teenage acne and what not. I have been using this oil, on my face, everyday for 2 months and have seen a difference in my complexion. I have even gotten comments that I&#x27;ve never gotten before like &amp;#34;you are getting younger&amp;#34; &amp;#34;you look so relaxed&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;your skin looks smoother&amp;#34;. I love it so much I&#x27;ve shared it with my mom and ordered her a bottle of her own! I definitely recommend giving it a try! I mix mine with a little bit of coconut oil and massage all over my face and neck in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> just ok, nothing to write home about</li>
    <li> Works great.  My mom loves these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>

    <li> Great purchase experience.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for long but I will keep using it. I like it. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used nearly the whole bottle with a once a day application and can tell no difference at all .</li>
    <li> Nothing unique. DoTerra oils still smell more pure and more interesting in their combinations.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long either.</li>

    <li> Within two days of using this, people started making comments on how great my skin looked!</li>
    <li> I like this blend and hope that it works.</li>
    <li> is a great oil,. I mix it with hemp oil, but it has a strong smell</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet.I do have other essential oils  from  Edens Garden that I have been  very pleased  with.&lt;br /&gt;They all have certain when promised.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> My skin looks increditable.</li>
    <li> Love this, use it in my homemade face oil.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for some time to find something that would provide deep, penetrating moisture to my hands, face, neck, etc. Most products I tried seemed to just address the top layer of skin, and might be fine for my face, but nothing ever addressed my tired, worn hands.  That is until I tried Age Defy.  I am truly amazed at the results.  I place a few drops in a little Apricot Oil (also purchased from Eden very inexpensively) and massage it into my hands, face, neck every morning and evening.  I follow this with some all natural lotion, to act as a sealer.  My hands and face look so great now.... Truly and deeply moisturized and healthy.  I highly recommend Age Defy if you&#x27;re searching, like I did, for a product that makes a visible impact, and penetrates your skin beyond the surface.  I will never be without this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful blend of oils and true to its description</li>
    <li> Love it must have for the evening face skin, I feel rejuvenated in the morning, and save me the time from all the other product..one steep.</li>
    <li> As usual, Edens Garden is great.  I usually add a few drops to some carrier oil and apply it each night.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any huge difference in wrinkles or anything but it smells nice and my face is soft.</li>
    <li> If you research the main ingredients in this product, you will see Edens has blended a very desirable blend, just as well as the competitor, at a fifth of the cost. One of the key ingredients in this is helichrysum, which is known to help block UV rays, a great bonus!  I add a few drops to my body lotion before applying and add to my night-time moisturizer too for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found this blend, not trying to regain youth, but because I had read this blend is great for failing eyesight if applied to cheek bone areas. The company has excellent quality oils and their prices are such that they allow the consumer to experiment with them without breaking the bank. I have 7 bottles of Edens on my desk that were combined the same price of 1 from the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, not sure this blend actually is defying age, BUT, do any of them? If this blend is what you are searching for, Edens would be as good as any, or better, in my opinion. I am using for my vision, but excited to see what it might do to my skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Buy directly from Edens Garden, it is 19.98</li>
    <li> I like all Edens Garden essential oils.  They do what they say they are going to do and you don&#x27;t have to pay a king&#x27;s ransom to purchase them.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days but my face has gotten so soft and breakouts seem to heal faster. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I placed 4 drops in a 10ml roller bottle and filled the rest of the way with rose hip oil also by edens garden.  I roll it on to my face and neck every night - it&#x27;s incomparably wonderful.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good blend ... That being said, I have not used Do-Terra&#x27;s blend and cannot compare them.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do know that Do-terra&#x27;s anti-aging oil blend in nearly $100.00. This is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;There is some oil in the blend that I do not care for the scent of ... but it does not stop me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with fractionated coconut oil and apply it liberally to my face, neck, chest, and arms. It is a bit greasy in this form, so I mainly use it at night. My skin drinks it in.</li>
    <li> I love Edens garden and will buy again in future. I love the proce and is a good oil.</li>
    <li> Great price and I love what it&#x27;s done for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Soaks in doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy smells wonderful and makes my skin look and feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for how this smells.</li>
