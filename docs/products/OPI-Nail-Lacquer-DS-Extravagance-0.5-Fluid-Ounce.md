      <li>I love this color.  </li>

      <li>This is more like a purple.</li>
      <li>I love it, and I am always on a quest to collect every DS Series color there is.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be instantly in love.</li>
      <li>and I love this color</li>
      <li>I love purple and this has an added sparkle to it.</li>
      <li>love this purple color.</li>
      <li>Love OPI polish and topcoat and this color is another addition to my &amp;#34;collection.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>This is top quality polish.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the colors that make you stare at your fingers all day :)</li>
      <li>I get many compliments on it when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Such a great color!</li>
      <li>Love this purpleish color with flecks.  </li>
      <li>This is very elegant, and not tasteless like some glitter polishes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made even more lovely by the finely scattered holographic glitter.</li>
      <li>the color is gorgeous, especially in natural sunlight which brings out more colors in the glitter.</li>
      <li>Looks even better in the sun light.</li>
      <li>For a sparkly polish it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove also</li>
      <li>It is sophisticated, elegant &amp; quite mesmerizing to stare at once on the nails.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful deep mauvy purple with a hint of iridescence.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful cross between purple/berry/maroon with lots of matching holographic fine shimmer particles in it.</li>
      <li>I am a January baby and wore the color for my birthday, and it was the perfect garnet color for my birthday, and it wore well for a few days before beginning to chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>The price was fantastic for a discontinued HTG item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it on my toes and fingers</li>
      <li>In direct sunlight, there&#x27;s a nice sparkle to it, but blue sparkle seems to be the most dominant; the contrast between the blue sparkle and the berry tone of the polish is beautiful!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the good wear is just with this particular polish or if that&#x27;s a trend with all OPI polishes because this is the only OPI I own.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy, dries quickly, and the color is absolutely gorgeous, especially in the sun - however</li>
      <li>, you do need two coats to get the full, sparkling effect.</li>
      <li>and I got full opacity in two coats.</li>
      <li>The color of Extravagance is beautiful and reflective in the sunlight in ways that exceed expectations for a shimmery dark magenta polish.</li>
      <li>Almost full coverage in one coat.</li>
      <li>OPI polish is easy to use because it has such nice brushes.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly and was the color I looked for everwhere.</li>
      <li>Super pretty in person!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and thicker!</li>
      <li>By far my favorite color.</li>
      <li>It has different sparkle tones and a nice maroon color.</li>
      <li>i think it&#x27;s my favorite, and prettiest OPI nail polish so far.</li>
      <li>Not only is it beautiful, it is quite durable; I put my nails through hell and back and there hasn&#x27;t been so much as a chip or scratch.</li>
      <li>OPI is a good brand name and wished it was a little cheaper.</li>
      <li>I can barely get my manis to last a good five days.</li>
      <li>Darker than it looks on screen, more a very deep eggplant purple.</li>
      <li>and this is the first time I had that occur with any product I have purchased.</li>
      <li>I goes on smooth and covers completely in 2-3</li>
      <li>I love the deep magenta shade of this polish.</li>
      <li>This is my first purchase of OPI nail polish.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color like a deep pinkish-purple, kind of a berry color with tiny flecks of silver.</li>
      <li>Pretty color a Berry/Plum with little golden flakes not glitter and looks so pretty when the light reflects off the Nails.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this polish!</li>
      <li>is on the very tips</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and</li>
      <li>so you can get a real feel for the color</li>
      <li>It very purple/berry/dark magenta.</li>

    <li> Such a great color! Couldn&#x27;t find it retail so I bought on here. It&#x27;s so pretty and thicker!</li>
    <li> OPI DS Extravagance is a beautiful color! It very purple/berry/dark magenta. It has some very fine holographic glitter in it that makes it seem like the polish shines from within. In direct sunlight, there&#x27;s a nice sparkle to it, but blue sparkle seems to be the most dominant; the contrast between the blue sparkle and the berry tone of the polish is beautiful! The formula was awesome on this and I got full opacity in two coats. It dries pretty fast, too, and with a top coat my manicure lasted nearly 10 days with very little tip wear, which is unheard of for me! I can barely get my manis to last a good five days. I don&#x27;t know if the good wear is just with this particular polish or if that&#x27;s a trend with all OPI polishes because this is the only OPI I own. But if the long lasting wear is true of most OPI polishes, I&#x27;m definitely stocking up on them. I highly recommend this polish!</li>
    <li> love this purple color. The glitter helps keep the polish on longer, too. I&#x27;m going to be 60 years old. No one&#x27;s too old to wear this. It&#x27;s just a slight glitter look. Not that heavy glitter.</li>
    <li> I Love OPI and I love this color, however the bottle I received had some issues with the brush bristles. Not sure how this happened and this is the first time I had that occur with any product I have purchased.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color and a quality polish. I love glittery nails but hate the sand-paper quality that so many have. Oftentimes you need a base coat or two, plus a coat of glittery polish plus a top coat which would take over an hour to dry. This has a very fine textured shimmery glitter. I am not a big fan of nail polish on my hands but this color matches my skin tone perfectly. It&#x27;s not to light not to dark and just the right shade of pinkish purple.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It&#x27;s a sultry purple with berry tones that sparkles in the sun due to crushed diamonds in the polish.  I love it, and I am always on a quest to collect every DS Series color there is.  If you see it, just buy it.  You&#x27;ll be instantly in love.</li>
    <li> I knew I liked the color because I had tried it at the salon, so it was not a surprise to me that I loved it.  It is a beautiful deep mauvy purple with a hint of iridescence.  OPI polish is easy to use because it has such nice brushes.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!!!  Worst OPI product I have ever owned.  They won&#x27;t refund me either since it&#x27;s after the 30 days.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t use it sooner to see how awful it is</li>
    <li> The quality of this polish is outrageous! The color is a deep, rich purple with red tones and a holographic shimmer that covers well in one or two coats. I will be buying more from the DS series! OPI nail polish is top quality and lasts forever on my nails without chipping. It can be helpful to google images of the particular color you want to buy so you can get a real feel for the color you&#x27;ll be getting if you haven&#x27;t seen it in stores.</li>
    <li> You never know what you are going to get when buying a polish online, but this one is really cute.  I have loved it and would buy more.</li>
    <li> I love the deep magenta shade of this polish. It&#x27;s made even more lovely by the finely scattered holographic glitter. It looks gorgeous in the sunlight. This polish also applies like a dream and isn&#x27;t gloopy or hard to work with.</li>
    <li> The formula is smooth, streak-free and a perfect consistency.  Could have full coverage in one coat with great application, but I prefer two coats to get the best sparkle and color accuracy.  The color is awesome, this is a dark magenta linear holo polish and its beautiful.  It&#x27;s one of the colors that make you stare at your fingers all day :)</li>

Not only is it beautiful, it is quite durable; I put my nails through hell and back and there hasn&#x27;t been so much as a chip or scratch. Nothing!</li>
    <li> Love this purpleish color with flecks.  It wears well-- I have acrylic nails and the only time I have to touch it up is on the very tips</li>
    <li> This polish came out to a lot of fanfare in 2008 and let me tell you, it&#x27;s well-deserved.  It is a berry-purple base enlivened with red, pink, gold, silver &amp; blue holographic sparkles plus a sprinkling of real diamond dust.  It is sophisticated, elegant &amp; quite mesmerizing to stare at once on the nails.  It is easily one of the prettiest polishes in my collection, and the bonus is that it&#x27;s made by OPI, the best formula in the business.  You simply cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! My wife loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this, its a very pretty color, and the diamond dust does give it a 3d look, I have has lots of completes on it!!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! Darker than it looks on screen, more a very deep eggplant purple.</li>
    <li> Pretty color a Berry/Plum with little golden flakes not glitter and looks so pretty when the light reflects off the Nails.Easy to remove also</li>
    <li> Very pretty color like a deep pinkish-purple, kind of a berry color with tiny flecks of silver. Applied how I expect from the brand. It wore well I used a base and top coat and it stayed on my nails just over a week with only my thumb chipping (my own fault I was putting keys on a keyring and I used my nails to try and pry the keychain open.) I normally make my boyfriend do things like that for me specifically for that reason but he wasn&#x27;t arround.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  It is absolutely as beautiful as hoped.  Also came in mail sooner then estimated.  Cant beat that (0;</li>
    <li> The DS collection is immaculate. I believe it has diamond dust in it! The color of Extravagance is beautiful and reflective in the sunlight in ways that exceed expectations for a shimmery dark magenta polish. The brush is rather wide too- which makes for easy application.</li>
    <li> OPI colors are so vibrant and this is an example.  Little change from color on line to color on nails.  Would purchase it again especially at this price.  Fast delivery and well wrapped for no breakage.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. the color is gorgeous, especially in natural sunlight which brings out more colors in the glitter. i highly recommend this polish. i think it&#x27;s my favorite, and prettiest OPI nail polish so far.</li>
    <li> I found a nail design online that uses this polish, I have looked all over my hometown for this color with no luck, was so happy to find it here and for the great price &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of OPI nail polish.  I have to say I now see why it is a few dollars more than other brands.  This is top quality polish.  It is a beautiful cross between purple/berry/maroon with lots of matching holographic fine shimmer particles in it. The polish is very smooth.  You could almost get away with just applying one coat but two coats is amazing.  This is very elegant, and not tasteless like some glitter polishes.  My nails are fairly long right now and I just keep looking at this polish on my nails.</li>
    <li> This is just a beautiful shimmery color, so happy I bought it.  The price was fantastic for a discontinued HTG item.</li>
    <li> This is more like a purple. I thought this was a reddish purple, but still very beautiful and sparkly. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is several shades darker than pictured. Too bad! The color shown is a pretty deep pinkish ruby color. What arrived is a deep purple.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color. Almost full coverage in one coat. Looks even better in the sun light. For a sparkly polish it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I saw this color on Pinterest and loved it! OPI is my favorite and this didn&#x27;t betray me! It&#x27;s shimmery, but not rough like glitter polish. Very smooth and shiny! In the sun, the little crystal things look like multicolored shimmery diamonds! Very nice purple color too.</li>
    <li> Love the polish. Delivered quickly and was the color I looked for everwhere. It will be a good color for summer even though it was part of a holiday collection.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite color. I get many compliments on it when I wear it. It is nice for both summer and winter depending on how you accent it.</li>
    <li> I love purple and this has an added sparkle to it. I used it at a spa in January and went home and had to order my own!</li>
    <li> Love OPI polish and topcoat and this color is another addition to my &amp;#34;collection.&amp;#34;  I have acrylic nails and am always looking for a color that is different.  OPI wears absolutely wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome nail polish color.  I&#x27;m always looking for different colors to add to my addiction, errrrrr my collection,  and this fit the bill.</li>
    <li> It has different sparkle tones and a nice maroon color. OPI is a good brand name and wished it was a little cheaper. Can not complain about the shipping and would recommend it to anyone. Did a test on my finger nail and liked it. I&#x27;m excited to use it on my toes and fingers</li>
    <li> My favorite color!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of three of the DS collection that I picked up, and I think I like this one the best. I goes on smooth and covers completely in 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very pretty, especially with the holo effect. I am a January baby and wore the color for my birthday, and it was the perfect garnet color for my birthday, and it wore well for a few days before beginning to chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a deep maroon color with some bluish shimmer to it. Super pretty in person!</li>
