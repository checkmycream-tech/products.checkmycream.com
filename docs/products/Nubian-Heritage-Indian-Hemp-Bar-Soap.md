      <li>That&#x27;s what I love about this - after a</li>
      <li>I love all the Nubian Heritage soaps.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making a good, healthy product.</li>
      <li>Very mild scent and somewhat moisturing.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing, foams up nicely, and is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is not only lovely soap that smells great, it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  </li>
      <li>Lathers nicely, rinses off completely leaving a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling.</li>

      <li>I found this brand at a local vitamin/supplement shop, and loved the fragrance.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love this soap so much.</li>
      <li>A lovely soap that I would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver Soap smells great, cleans well, not too harsh.</li>
      <li>The scent is so fresh and it lingers for a bit after my shower.</li>
      <li>Indian Hemp &amp; Haitian Vetiver Soap by Nubian Heritage has a gentle scent and leave my fresh clean face - feeling moisturized.</li>
      <li>Decided to try this after some good results with other hemp products for eczema.</li>
      <li>If you are bothered by fragrance, like I am, no need to worry about the scent lingering - it is gone right after use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also contains shea butter,but IMO is far better than a pure shea butter soap bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this first from Wholefoods.</li>
      <li>African black soap in the past,but THIS PARTICULAR SOAP IS THE BEST SOAP</li>
      <li>Great soap but go locally its a widely carried brand</li>
      <li>It really reduces inflammation and it is all NATURAL (chemical free).</li>
      <li>IT REALLY</li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling fresh, it has seeds in it to provide exfoliation and it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Smell is very neutral so can be used by men and woman.</li>
      <li>It may not smell like a true vetiver (which I adore), but I still like this soap, especially its moisturizing and skin-softening properties.</li>
      <li>but I got busy and did not have a batch ready when I needed it</li>
      <li>I have made more improvement in my mobility in the few days of using this soap</li>
      <li>I think that the combination of Neem &amp; Vettiver is the key to this product that is giving fresh feeling throughout the day.</li>
      <li>it is a nice subtle smell</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>skin is soft, hydrated (used it initially during the winter months when my skin normally can get very dry) and itch free.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this soap for anyone who has had surgery or in the near future will have surgery.</li>
      <li>Amazon apparently made a typo and then did not inform the folks who thought they were ordering 5 bars!</li>
      <li>Even my doctor barely noticed my scars from the surgery.</li>
      <li>So my girlfriend picked this up from the local hippy food store for her use, and we found out by accident, it completely fixes mechanic hands (The grease, not the myriad of cuts and nicks).</li>
      <li>The exfoliating bits are nice but it can be a little rough as the soap wears down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty green color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this soap six weeks after my shoulder surgery and I am quite impressed with its properties. Since I have been in physical therapy I have been looking for ways to reduce my pain medicine intake. I was always having lots of swelling which prevented me from making the progress in my recuperation. I&#x27;ve started using this soap because of its anti-inflammatory properties and guess what? IT REALLY WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I shower with this soap prior to going to physical therapy. I have made more improvement in my mobility in the few days of using this soap then I had four weeks prior to using the soap. I have not even taken anymore pain medication since. Even the moisturizer properties are excellent. So many people ask me where are my scars. Even my doctor barely noticed my scars from the surgery. Using pure Aloe Vera Gel, Raw Shea Butter, and this Indian Hemp &amp; Haitian Vetiver Soap with Neem Oil, my healing and recovery has been shorten and soon I will be returning back to my regular duties and lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this soap from a local grocery store for $2.99, and I&#x27;ve just learned that the same grocery store has the soap on sale for $1.49. Looks like I will be stocking up this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap for anyone who has had surgery or in the near future will have surgery. It really reduces inflammation and it is all NATURAL (chemical free). Nubian Heritage, PLEASE do not change the properties in this soap or I will not longer buy it. Thanks for making a good, healthy product.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling fresh, it has seeds in it to provide exfoliation and it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients. Smell is very neutral so can be used by men and woman. I can&#x27;t go back to body wash soaps after using this product!</li>
    <li> Decided to try this after some good results with other hemp products for eczema. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it has helped, but as a soap it seems to do the trick. Lathers nicely, rinses off completely leaving a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling. Also has a mild and pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I bought this first from Wholefoods. This product is great.Totally refreshing and creates vigor. I think that the combination of Neem &amp; Vettiver is the key to this product that is giving fresh feeling throughout the day.</li>
    <li> RIP OFF and misleading listing!     I ordered 5 BARS of two varieties of soap and received two bars of soap instead. Amazon apparently made a typo and then did not inform the folks who thought they were ordering 5 bars! BOO!     Locally I can buy a single bar of soap for a dollar less than listed with vitacost so the only reason I ordered was because of the discount for a bulk purchase. Ended up paying almost $15! for what I could have bought around the corner for $6.00.  Great soap but go locally its a widely carried brand I will NEVER ORDER FROM VITACOST AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I found this brand at a local vitamin/supplement shop, and loved the fragrance. Brought it home and tried it out, and love it. It is refreshing, foams up nicely, and is very moisturizing. If you are bothered by fragrance, like I am, no need to worry about the scent lingering - it is gone right after use. I have found it to be cleansing, but does not strip my skin or leave it try or tight-feeling. I also find the scent to be neutral, maybe leaning towards feminine just a bit. But again, it does not linger after use. It may not smell like a true vetiver (which I adore), but I still like this soap, especially its moisturizing and skin-softening properties.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the soap and the ONLY soap to use.  Once we pass that &amp;#34;Middle Age Mile&amp;#34;  it seems women&#x27;s skin &amp; face dries not matter what moisturizing lotion or soap one uses after washing up.  That&#x27;s what I love about this - after a I&#x27;ve washed my face I do not need to apply gobs of moisturizing cream afterward.  Indian Hemp &amp; Haitian Vetiver Soap by Nubian Heritage has a gentle scent and leave my fresh clean face - feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I am going to continue to purchase this soap. The beads do not hurt when scrubbing.</li>
    <li> I love all the Nubian Heritage soaps. They last forever and smell great and pretty strong! A very great buy!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It has nice fragrance and lather and is good for my skin!  It isn&#x27;t drying, even used daily.</li>
    <li> So my girlfriend picked this up from the local hippy food store for her use, and we found out by accident, it completely fixes mechanic hands (The grease, not the myriad of cuts and nicks). This stuff out does lava, gojo, goop, all that stuff. I know this is a strange use for it, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on it as a body soap at all, but I have been buying it regularly for a hand soap when I get home from work!</li>
    <li> Very mild scent and somewhat moisturing.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so good on your skin and Indian hemp leaves your skin feeling so smooth and soft I plan on buying more of this Indian hemp soap.</li>
    <li> Eases muscle pain and is a perfect soap for after a workout. I recommend it for all serious physical fitness enthusiasts</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this soap so much. The scent, the ingredients and the moisturizing benefits are amazing.  I recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Healthy, supple, amazing skin. Almost instantly with this marvelous bar. You can&#x27;t afford not to risk the 3-4 dollars. WAY worth it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that as I age seems to be reacting to almost everything.  I was making my own soap but I got busy and did not have a batch ready when I needed it, I purchased this as a hopeful stand in until my soap was cured.  This is not only lovely soap that smells great, it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  I think it smells kind of like a floral cucumber but it is not so floral that it is off putting to the men in the house.  As long as you don&#x27;t leave it in a puddle of water, it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a film in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, hydrated (used it initially during the winter months when my skin normally can get very dry) and itch free.  A lovely soap that I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver Soap smells great, cleans well, not too harsh. It&#x27;s a pretty green color. Has little rough bits in it, I guess for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I have used there (N.H) African black soap in the past,but THIS PARTICULAR SOAP IS THE BEST SOAP IVE EVER USED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From body washes and soaps from MANY companies (take your pick with the names) this soap makes the skin on my body feel so clean and GOOD and healthy (you can just feel it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a little &amp;#34;zesty&amp;#34; in the smell department but not at all lemony or citrus! Its the vetiver and it isnt over powering! it is a nice subtle smell which LATHERS very well and the cut up hemp seed and vetiver are a great exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains shea butter,but IMO is far better than a pure shea butter soap bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will from now on keep a few of these on hand being I can find them for a reasonable price (under the 5 dollar price tag I purchased on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap but 5 bucks a bar smh is kind of pricey! But even at that price you get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing! The scent is so fresh and it lingers for a bit after my shower. It&#x27;s not sweet or flowery so it is a good scent for both men and women. The soap lathers well and doesn&#x27;t melt away after two or three uses when left in the shower. The exfoliating bits are nice but it can be a little rough as the soap wears down. The drawbacks are that it leaves some heavy duty soap scum in the tub and it&#x27;s a bit drying for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, ...slight exfoliating.  I found by accident and immediately bought 3 more bars and the body lotion.  Love it.</li>
