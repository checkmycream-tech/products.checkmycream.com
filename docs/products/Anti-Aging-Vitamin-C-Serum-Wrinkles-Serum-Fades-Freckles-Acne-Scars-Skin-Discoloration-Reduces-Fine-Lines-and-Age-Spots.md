      <li>With premium ingredients like vitamins C and E, hyaluronic acid, amino complex, ferulic acid and more, I will absolutely be purchasing this serum many times over!</li>
      <li>My skin has more of a glow and fine wrinkles are less.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about this product is the 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product a few days ago , it was just as described .I have been using it and I already find my skin smoother and softer .This is a great beauty product to have in your makeup kit .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a unique blend of  a facial serum  of Vitamin C, Ferulic Acid, and Vitamin E which provides up to eight-fold antioxidant protection, a 96% reduction of sunburn cells and prevent the formation of new free radicals in sun exposed skin; This will fade age spots and dramatically improve discoloration leaving your skin with a youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply a drop under my eyes, I do noticeably see a difference. Vitamin c has always helped with that problem in the past, and this one works perfectly as well, as it contains 20% vitamin c&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The directions are clear as to how to use, if you want nicer smooth and soft skin this product is for you .I highly recommend this product you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my  honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll need to update this in a few months to see how it works long term, but this Vitamin C serum goes on smoothly, smells wonderful, and feels terrific.  It gets 5 stars for &amp;#34;first impressions.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received as a free sample for evaluation and review</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  I like the way it &#x27;feels&#x27; on my face and neck!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly two weeks just about everyday.  I like the way it feels on my skin.  It goes on and my skin soaks it up in about a minute - its dry to the touch.  I have not used any other products on my skin while using this product so I can&#x27;t attest to how it wears under makeup but I can tell you I love the way my skin feels and I can tell you this is the ONLY product I used that made it feel this way.  It feels exfoliated and I haven&#x27;t exfoliated since using Beauty Max!  It feels like I used a day cream and I haven&#x27;t used a day cream since I started using this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any irritation even when using around my eyes!  I have a small blemish on my chin since starting to use this product but I find that normal when I start using any new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may use this a little more liberally than described.  I use about a whole dropper full and apply it to my face, neck and some on my decollete area.  I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the bottle thus far so I figure it would easily last me a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle states that it was produced in the USA and has the GMP stamp (Good Manufacturing Practice) along with Certified Organic Ingredients.  My only question is that is has this organic stamp but the label also states its &amp;#34;98% natural derived/72% organic.  Maybe the seller can indicate below more detail to their labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product states its an anti-aging serum.  I can&#x27;t really tell if it kept me from aging in two weeks but I did have a friend who had not seen me in a month tell me my skin looked great!  I am stay-at-home-mom, 36yrs old and a mother of three little ones (and I run a business on the side)  so I appreciate hearing my skin looks good because I don&#x27;t really have much attention to give it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely a product I would reorder.</li>
    <li> As a woman in my 40&#x27;s, I have noticed these nasty little things on my face called age spots so I was so excited that I was given the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price for my truthful and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came bubble wrapped, not in a box which I found a little odd, but it was received undamaged so no big deal.  Just odd.  It has a very nice scent which I like since it&#x27;s on my face.  Nothing is worse than using a product on your fact that stinks.  The oil absorbed easily into my skin.  I found that it only took about 6 drops for my entire face and neck.  I am focusing the serum on one particular age spot that I am trying to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for a few days so I cannot attest to the long term effects.  What I can tell you is that living in Indiana in the winter causes extremely dry skin.  By using this product twice daily, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have the dry patches on my cheeks that I usually have.  I put it on before my make up in the morning and after I cleanse my face at night.  Very pleased so far and am hopeful that my age spot will fade.</li>
    <li> I started using this on my face because I started getting breakouts. Within 5 days my faced started to clear up and dark spots were fading. It didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling which would of been a deal breaker for me. I used 3 drops and massaged it into my face for 2 minutes. I can definitely see a difference in my skin and will be using it in my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Goes on quickly and smoothly. Easy to use for day and night. Gentle, non-irritating form of vitamin c serum. Smells wonderful. This is my favorite Vitamin C product. Out of the four that I own. Please only use a small amount that is all you will need :) .I received the Vitamin C serum to sample and give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great Vitamin C serum! It does not dry out my skin as many others do. I apply this in the morning after I cleanse and then put moisturizer on. The benefits of vitamin C are wonderful for your skin and I never get that much so this has been wonderful. I apply it at night too before bed. You do not need very much at all because a little does go a long way. My skin soaked it up right away. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and it was easy to spread on my face. I have not had any breakouts since using it. I had no irritation from this either. I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review. I&#x27;m excited to see what improvements my skin shows after a month or two.</li>
    <li> This serum is everything they promised. I use it after my Derma rolling treatment &amp; it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I bought it originally for my youngest daughter but then my eldest daughter AND I all starting using it.  It works for all kinds of skin ailments.  The consistency is also really great as it absorbs into the skin very quickly.  We will definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for different ways to help the appearance and health of my skin. I have tried masks, lotions, and taken supplements. I still have not found the true results I am looking for. I saw this product and was interested. Vitamins you apply to the face. I decided to give it a try. The serum come on time and the packaging was intact. Good sign! It came in a brown bottle with a squeeze dropper on the lid. I red the bottle. It has 20% Vitamin C, 11% , Amino Complex, Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. There is a 96% reductions of sunburn cells and prevention of the formation of free radicals in sun exposed skin. Fades sun spots and discoloration, refines skin texture and reduces wrinkle formation as well as minimizing existing wrinkles. I like the sound of that. And I then red the directions. Apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned face, neck and decollete areas. Avoid direct contact with eyes. Allow time to absorb prior to moisturizer. I was ready to try it! So, I went into the bathroom and washed my face. Followed with toner. Open the top while squeezing the top. The serum was a cloudy white color. I put some on my fingers and was surprised. I expected it to be greasy or thick and feel heavy on my face. What I found was, smooth, thin liquid. I rubbed my finger and thumb together and was happy to note how smooth my fingers felt after rubbing it in them. There is no smell. Another plus! I immediately started to put on my fingertips and applied it to my face and neck. No residue feeling. That was another thing I was concerned about. It had none of that. So, I have been continuing to make this one of my daily routines. I have to say, I really have noticed a change in my skin. It is healthier looking and smoother feeling. I know it is still early for full results to show, but I am continuing to use this serum. I just wanted everyone to know how great this product is and the results that I have seen in this period of time.</li>
    <li> Have only been using the serum for about two weeks and I have already begun to get complements on my skin, something that has never happened to me ever. I like the feel of it on my skin and always follow the application with a moisturizer. Very glad I made this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I am so Happy to have received a chance to review this product !!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;INSANE SALE Only $15.97&amp;#34; Expires on Sunday 11.59pm PST ★ Beauty Max Best Vitamin C Serum For Face &amp; Neck ★ Best Anti-Aging Serum  by Beauty Max  I&#x27;ll be 42 in a few days and its time I start taking better care of my skin !! the skin on your face really takes a beating not a lot of people realize that and another thing people do not realize is most of the products we buy for our face are full of heavy toxins that cause more damage causing you to buy other stuff ! its a vicious circle !! I like the way it makes my skin feel and the scent is nice and light ! One of my favorite things about this product is the 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!! That really tells you a lot about the Company !! another one of my favorite things about this product is its MADE IN THE USA using ONLY THE FRESHEST BOTANICALS AVAILABLE in a FDA Approved and GMP Certified Manufacturing Facility. Our Topical Vitamin C Face Serum is Paraben Free &amp; Only uses the very Best and Highest Quality Organic, Natural Ingredients and is Cruelty-Free . This is so important to me ! Not to mention the POWERFUL &amp; EFFECTIVE ANTI-AGING BENEFITS!!  I truly can not find one reason not to try this amazing product !!</li>
    <li> I just received my serum in the mail,  and i cannot wait to use it!  My friends have used or before and they loved it.  I hope to see results on my skin</li>
    <li> I waited a bit before providing my feedback on this serum. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now, and while I haven&#x27;t seen instant results, I have seen some fading of tinier wrinkles and spots. The serum is silky and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with breakouts. You do NOT need to use a lot of this at once, a little goes along way. I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something natural and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where this serum has been my whole life! I noticed improvements in my complexion immediately. The two sun spots I had are hardly noticeable after 2 weeks. I will definitely be a return customer for this product.</li>
    <li> I am loving  the results of this  product. I  will continue  to buy it. I just recently  ordered my second bottle  and can tell the difference  it has made on my skin.</li>
    <li> It seems to absorb very well and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> Having tried many different skin care products, I&#x27;m now simplifying my routine with a few products that have excellent ratings, and have been created with ingredients known to work. Vitamin C Cream Serum is one of those quality products. After washing and toning face in the morning, I use the serum under my daily moisturizer. It leaves my skin silky smooth, hydrated, and healthy looking. Its ingredients are recognized by experts in the field as essential for anti-aging, and since I&#x27;m in the anti-aging age group, quality is important. I also appreciate the affordable cost. In the past I&#x27;ve tried other serums at triple the cost. The results with Vitamin C serum are the same, if not better. Give this a try; your skin will thank you! I also have to add that I&#x27;m almost 69 and most folks take me for being in 50&#x27;s. One of the most important things we can do for our skin is to eat the right foods - more fruits, veggies, legumes and grains, drink plenty of water, and stay clear of those foods that create free radical damage. Those are the foods filled with saturated fat, sugars and oils. What we eat has a profound effect on our skin. Eating right and using quality products like Vitamin C Cream Serum will give you that healthy glow!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is awesome! It has a nice scent to it, but not too strong. The serum is smooth, not greasy and applies easily. Its packed full of vitamins. The dropper is fantastic, I think that it helps use the small amount needed. I am glad I recieved this product to review.  Im excited to see resilts!</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C serum gives my face a healthy glow...I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> I have been using for a few weeks now and I can see an improvement in my skin.  My skin has more of a glow and fine wrinkles are less.</li>
    <li> This is a nice Vit. C Serum.  It is unscented which I really like since I have allergies.  It only takes a little.  I apply it to my face and is absorbed right into my skin.  It dries quick and no greasy residue.  My skin is smoother,  looking much better and not as many acne breakouts.  It gives you a more youthful appearance.  I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I try to make a point of buying products that are not only manufactured here in the U.S. but also cruelty-free, which means not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have tried other serums that did not cut the mustard, so to speak. While in the middle of panic mode over other signs of aging that have popped up, the sale on this product was brought to my attention so I took a leap of faith and bought it, with the intent of trying it out and giving my opinion via review. My only regret is not stumbling across it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, pleasant fragrance and comes with a dropper that easily controls the amount of product that is dispensed and it also quickly absorbs into your skin. I used it on my face, neck, and decollete areas as well as age spots that have come up elsewhere. While it did not take away the spots entirely, they have noticeably lightened and when encountering someone I hadn&#x27;t seen for a couple of months, the first thing she mentioned was how much brighter and even-toned my skin looked. With premium ingredients like vitamins C and E, hyaluronic acid, amino complex, ferulic acid and more, I will absolutely be purchasing this serum many times over!</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C. My face is brighter and the tone is more even in a very short time. I use all over my face every morning and follow with moisturizer. I use at night after washing and cover with an overnight Vitamin C mask. My skin looks radiant. Try it. You&#x27;ll love it. I hope this company has more products. Also the customer service is awesome which is really important to me</li>
    <li> Great turn-around on product.  Seller also provided excellent advice for use of product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already seen a difference around my eyes after only 1 week.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have already placed a second order for Beauty Max.  I actually see a diminishing of fine lines on my face.  When I looked in the mirror, I thought what is happening?  My skin looks so much better. What have I done different?  This was the month I used Beauty Max.  I used a whole bottle in a month.  Did I use too much? For the price, I could afford to be generous. I hope Beauty Max keeps this great price !  Thanks for the awesome product !</li>
    <li> Excellent..&lt;br /&gt;My skin has changed  for better.</li>
    <li> Great product with a reasonable cost! I use it with combination of hyaluronic acid serum &amp; moisurizer &amp; am getting really good results with it. Improved &amp; more even skin tone and reduction of fine lines &amp; wrinkles noticed after just a few weeks of steady use . I apply every am &amp; before bed along with a mosturizer and it does the job. It&#x27;s also easy on the face, no stinging or burning, when applied like other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll continue to use this, it works well!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth as silk. Great product!</li>
    <li> As I get older I can tell my once very oily skin is changing.  It is now somewhat dry.  I was not sure how to treat the dry patches since I have never had them before.  I had been reading about the vitamin. C serum and how it is good for all skin types and was good for fine lines..  I had fines lines also so when I was given the opportunity to set this at a discounted rate I was very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came wrapped about three times in bubble wrap so it was not going to break.  The dropper was very easy to use.  It only allowed a small amount to come out ,so I would use to much.  I used as directed slowly rubbing in circles around my face.  It did not have a strong smell which is a big plus for me.  It also did not take a longtime to dry before putting my makeup on.  This was important to me in the mornings when trying to get ready for for school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about two weeks and can tell a difference in my face.  The dryness on my cheeks is so much better.  My makeup goes on a lot smoother and my face is brighter.  I will be buying this again when this runs out.  I think it will be awhile though because it takes a small amount and the bottle will last a longtime.</li>
    <li> great product, just what I wanted</li>
