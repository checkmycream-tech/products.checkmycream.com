<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the far most best eye lash curler I&#x27;ve every use. The others I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t curl the end part of my lash it always pinch my eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best eyelash curler I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Love it, this is the first time an eyelash curler actually fit all of my lashes at once, without pinching my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Makes my eyelashes look so luxurious!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great eyelash curler.  I have very big eyes and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to curl all my lashes and this one gets them all. I&#x27;m very happy with this</li>
    <li> I have been using eyelash curlers for years and years.  This one is the best!!!  It even keeps my long (but very straight) lashes curled all day when I am home for the day. not wearing mascara.  No more curling just one half an eyelash and then the other half.  This curler fits my whole eye!  I think it opens wider than others, too, because there is no pinching.  One more thing, I like the pink color very much because the curler stands out among my tools!!!</li>
    <li> Works great love the color</li>
    <li> It is better than any eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used before. Does the job perfectly!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The smaller size is much more comfortable to use.Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s pink either. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve had- I&#x27;m buying another one for my sister</li>
    <li> Great eye lash curler - gives great length.</li>
    <li> I have to start off by saying that this purchase has come with the best customer service for anything I have ever bought off Amazon. I used this curler right when it arrived and didn&#x27;t apply mascara just to see how long the curl holds and it was still there the next morning. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars though because the curl is just barely better than my cheap Revlon curler.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this after reading all the positive reviews, however when I tried using the curler it left pink marks around my eyes.. It wiped of and then I realized the pink coating was coming off of the curler.. Maybe I received a defective one? &#x3D;( Alot of money to spend on a dollar store quality item.. Not a happy customer***************Update, Seller went above and beyond for me and sent me another curler..FREE OF CHARGE.. The new curler does have some flaking of the coating as well so a little disappointed with that but it does give a decent curl and the seller was willing to work with me on the issue.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product. Better than any curler I have bought from the store. I think I just squeeze too hard because the little pad got a split in it right away.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  The movement is smooth.  The only complaint I have so far is that some of the pink paint flaked off on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product--the curl is more even and covers more lashes</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and comes in an attractive pink color.  The replacement pads for life is a plus too!</li>
    <li> Tons of eyelashes came out each each time I would use this. I finally just went back to using my old one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl at all, complete waste of money.  Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife. She said it works good. It would work better if it had rubber on the finger holes.</li>
    <li> Works great. Have to be careful of pinching though.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good eyelash curler, but still shu uemura ones are better.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is amazing!  I&#x27;ve being using it for three weeks now and have not lost an eyelash.  I had a Revlon eyelash curler and would lose at least 1-3 lashes each time I used it.  I highly recommend this product if you want to keep your lashes.</li>
    <li> Not only is it my favorite color, it works very well. I am happy with my eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> this is one of my very few reviews on amazon (heck, i dont even remember if i&#x27;ve ever written one before this). i just have to write how i love this curler. i&#x27;ve had drugstore curlers before and they have so far discouraged me from ever curling my lashes as they never gave me the results i wanted. with this one, i dont even have to wear mascara (which i really dont like to put on anyway, unless for a night out or for a photo op). i just curl my lashes, line my upper lash line, and i&#x27;m good to go! this has been the fastest i&#x27;ve ever done my lashes and eye makeup in general. can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get this curler. i do have to say i havent tried shu uemura and shiseido curlers (or any of the ones for asian eyes), so i can only compare it to the drugstore ones like revlon and sally hansen.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift but was told it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Gave it away as a gift and my friend likes it. It is a little flimsy but does the job.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this product would live up to the reviews, but it does. What drugstore/name brand item I&#x27;ve always bought now let me down in the form of pinching and eyelash removal, this one doesn&#x27;t. It is smooth, gets all of the lashes and curls perfectly. Picking it up for the first time showed the heaviness  factor that the others are lacking. It feels as though it will be durable and will last. The bonus is that it&#x27;s pink!</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler didn&#x27;t work for me, it wouldn&#x27;t open far enough for me to get my eyelashes in, however the customer service with this company is top notch and you can be assured they will refund you if you are not 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best eye lash curler out there, I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one really doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out your lashes. Gives a really nice natural curl.</li>
    <li> Curls the sides of my lashes but the middle is flat.  I keep retrying another day cuz I think maybe it was just me but I can&#x27;t get my lashes to curl well with this thing :(</li>
    <li> The curler is very comfortable and easy to use! The seller is also very helpful and super involved with the purchases. Customer Service is an A+ along with their products! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler..It does not &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; or grab my upper lid while curling..I noticed zero lashes lost in curler. Lashes curled easily without alot of &amp;#34; torque&amp;#34; , which caused previous curler cushions to split and trap eyelashes.. I wish they supplied more cushions just because I hate having to find replacements in the future.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like the shu uemara it was compared to, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash  kit  works great. easy to use</li>
    <li> much better than expected!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected dint curl</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Shimarz eyelash curler!! I have short lashes that are hard to grab with the eyelash curler and have been pinched many times in the past. Since I have been using the Shimarz eyelash curler I have not been pinched not even once! The curling tool opens farther than other curlers and makes it easier to grab all the lashes on the first try. Have already recommended this to tool to friends and family and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good eyelash curler. Not sure it&#x27;s the best one ever, but for the price it is great!</li>
    <li> Creates amazing curl without pinching the lashes.  Best curler I have used yet.</li>
    <li> BEST eyelash curler I have used in quite a while (and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I currently have no less then 3 in my bathroom!) I&#x27;m about to chuck all the others because this one is definitely my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have short eyelashes. Mine will never be featured in a long and lush mascara commercial. And, as I age, they are thinning, so I need all the help I can get. And help arrived in the form of an adorable purple eyelash curler, along with an extra refill pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use is simple, Fit the curler to curvature of your eye, grab the lashes, squeeze, release, and voila, curled eye lashes that make them look longer. Curled eyelashes going up also help the eye look larger and leave less shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shimarz is thin but sturdy, the color is great, and it curls the eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent for evaluation</li>
    <li> Because Shimarz sent another email (relentless) asking for feedback - here it is.  It&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m a bit surprised - this eyelash curler does what it purports to do.  Amazing.  Use it once a day and the eyelashes stay curled the entire time.  Curl them then apply mascara.  It does not pinch, pull-out lashes, or crimp.  I would buy it again (and probably will).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one week and can honestly say it works better than my Maybelline curler that I have been using for years. The replacement pads for my old curler were cheap junk and didn&#x27;t curl well or last long. My Shimarz is much gentler on the lashes and takes less time to get the results I want. I am very pleased with this product and recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler! The best by far!  I recently order the FUSCHIA LINE and the Bella and Bear curlers, and although they both,&lt;br /&gt;had positive reviews, I did not like either of them.  The Bella and Bear had a weird spring to it, it might have been defective, so I returned it.  The FUSCHIA line just seemed like any standard eyelash curler, so that went back too.  The Shimarz was the best by far for me.  My new go to eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Not that great. Still rips eyelashes out and doesnt curl to well either.</li>
    <li> Excellent eyelash curler.  Really opens the eye.  This one grabs all the lashes. I have owned several and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I decided to order this because my older eyelash curler went on a hiatus.  It&#x27;s one of my staples because I wear very little makeup and want my eyelashes to look good.  This doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyes and I love that it comes with an extra pad.  The pad seems like it will stand up for many uses.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed this pretty eyelash curler was difficult for my older eyes to see and use.  Without prescription lenses I couldn&#x27;t see my eyelashes well enough against the fuchsia curler and black pad; and since I did pinch myself more than once in the process it&#x27;s obvious my eyes and this curler aren&#x27;t a good match.  It&#x27;s a pity; it seems to be well-constructed, and its pretty color would have certainly have added to the pleasure of using it each day had we been meant for each other.  The seller understood my problem and my money was refunded promptly; and for that HE merits 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I received my eyelash curler quickly and well packaged.  Test drove soon after receiving.  No pinching; painless, curled lashes nicely.  Followed up with coat of black mascara and eyelashes popped.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever used!  It holds your lashes perfectly, without pinching your eyelids.  I highly recommend this one.  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> works great and such a pretty color!</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Works good just some of the paint is slightly chipping off. But good product :)</li>
    <li> Curler works well but I could easily pinch my eyelids if I wasn&#x27;t careful because the design is straighter than others I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve got round eyes.  Eyelashes though do get curled and stay that way!</li>
    <li> First, this one is classy, with the hot pick chrome; second, it is the perfect curl for standout lashes and eyes! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an Eyelash Curler before... But now that I&#x27;m getting older, I think I need a little help. I&#x27;ve used this a few times, and found it very easy to operate and it does a wonderful job of curling my eyelashes without pinching.</li>
    <li> It didnt pull my eyelashes out as another brand i had before. it works amazingly curling my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Nice products. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> very nice curler, works well on my older eyes no pinching</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is so far the best one I have used as far as pinching is concerned.  I am in my late 60&#x27;s so don&#x27;t have the firmest skin around my eyes.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Turns out, this curler really is good.  It looks like a purple version of everyone else&#x27;s curler.  It isn&#x27;t the same, though.  It has smoother action than my Sally Hansen or my Revlon.  I have yet to pinch my lids or pull my lashes.  My lashes don&#x27;t stick to it.  And I can even curl the lashes at the inside corner of my eye without poking myself!  I need another Shimarz for my gym bag...</li>
    <li> Love these eyelash curlers! They are very sturdy and curl my lashes very well! Highly recommend them to anyone looking for more length!</li>
    <li> My favorite color, makes a huge difference on my lashes and well made! So happy I made this purchase, it was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Not wanting to spend 20 on a certain eyelash curler that you can&#x27;t buy refills for (looking at you shu uemura) I decided to buy this one. I like that it doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and I don&#x27;t have to take special care to ensure it won&#x27;t hurt me. It fits perfectly to my eye shape; though I do have to squeeze pretty tightly to get just the right curl. I would recommend this for the price.</li>
    <li> Im so satisfied with this product, its working properly and the quality is amazing and the color is woooow , each of you girls should have it</li>
    <li> I have never had a particularly horrible eyelash curler, although some have absolutely been better than others.  At my age (59) I am noticing that the skin on my eyelid is looser and that my mascara would leave spots.  So I have been focusing on how to change up my make up to look natural yet still enhancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler is very cool.  It curls very naturally.  I use a waterproof mascara and am very happy.  I have tossed out my other two eyelash curlers.</li>
    <li> I do like this curler, but it is not much different than any other.  However, the color is beautiful and girly and it serves it purpose well.</li>
    <li> VERY EASY TO USE, THE RUBBER PAD FEELS A BIT STICKY AND A FEW EYELASHES HAVE BEEN PULLED OUT.LOVE THE COLOR.</li>
    <li> so I have always bought cheaper lash curlers, always had problems with pinching and not getting all lashes in the curler at once. I have only used it a couple times but is best I have had, no pinching, no problems grabbing all lashes, and it is pretty pink!</li>
    <li> I started looking for a eyelash curler when I noticed my eyelashes were not curled but sticking straight out.When I found this product I decided  to give it a try and found it to be a success.Shimarz doesn&#x27;t pinch your eyelids because of the soft cushion and its cool that you get an extra cushion.I also like the pink color  thought that was pretty neat idea.I just love the product and am very happy with my purchase. Also for a tip heat the curler with a blow dryer and wait till it gets somewhat warm before curling  because it provides better results.</li>
    <li> Yes it does work, but it is hard to get close to your eye and is really awkward to use.  But when I do use it I get results.</li>
    <li> It is very nice and I love the color, however I cannot use it because I heat my eyelash curler so the curls holds for the day. When I try to heat the curler, the black silicone pad starts to melt</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since I (the wife, not the husband) have used an eyelash curler. I don&#x27;t think it works perfectly, but it could be operator error. There is probably a learning curve to it. I will keep working on it. I have to admit, it was not just the super high reviews that got me to buy this lash curler instead of the Shiseido,  but the deal closer was the vibrant pink color. I love it! Why be ordinary when you can be extraordinary?</li>
    <li> Good eyelash curler no pinching</li>
    <li> Great product! And Great customer service! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler!  Had a Shu Uemura curler for years and the Shimarz is much better!  Opens wider and longer and has a much more comfortable feel.  Great curl, too.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that for once I have a eyelash curler that the pad doesn&#x27;t pop out after I use it.  And the compact size is easy and comfortable to use and I love the pink color.  Should have bought this before.  Delivered quickly and very well packaged.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler is perfect. Works great, and the sparkling pink is a perfect and fun color! Great addition to any make-up bag. The customer service with Shimarz is exceptional. I received a thank you email from the co-founder, and a follow-up email making sure that I was completely satisfied with the product. I highly recommend this product and company!</li>
    <li> While the personal follow up from the company founder was impressive, this eyelash curler was anything but.  Even after wiping the pad off my lashes still stuck (painfully so) to the pad and i noticed little to NO curl in my lashes at all.</li>
    <li> There work perfect and help make my eye lashed beautiful! They are very easy to use and I did not pinch my eye lids. It doesn&#x27;t grab or pull out hairs either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye lash curlers I have ever used. It curls my eye lashes perfectly. It makes my lashes look longer. It is made of high quality materials, and I love the color. it is easy to use and there is just the right amount of space in the holes where you place your fingers, giving you more stability and less getting you eye lid caught in it. It makes my lashes look longer, and it gives me the confidence to bat my eyes at all the cutie pies I see. I highly recommend you trying THE BEST EYELASH CURLER TOOL. It stands up to its name, it is the BEST I have ever used.</li>
    <li> love them! curled my lashes just like i would want them too! highly recommend! easy to use and no pinching!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Sent back waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever purchased. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great for long lasting, every day looks.</li>
    <li> works really good!!!! i would recommend. since the week of owning it it only pinched me once. lol. thats not bad. keeps a curl. impressed.</li>
    <li> I love my new eyelash curler. Works great and I was in need of a new one badly. I am very please. Shipped quickly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I really love this, beautiful color and it curls quite well!</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive the eyelash curler so quickly.  I loved the hot pink color and was anxious to try it.  Unfortunately it did not work for me. It seems to be a bit too large for my eyes or perhaps it is the fact that I have smaller than average eyes. Sadly, I will not be able to use this pretty pink curler.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will give 5 stars for extraordinary customer service to Nick, the co-founder.  He stands behind this product totally and even offered me a refund. Thank you Nick!</li>
    <li> ♥ this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> High quality and works great!  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler</li>
    <li> This thing curls without pulling. I&#x27;ve always been really scared to use an eyelash curler but this takes all the worry away. Great that it has a rubber edge where the eyelashes go.</li>
    <li> This lash curler curls like many other drug store curlers. I like that it takes a light squeeze and that is it, not to mention the bright pink, metallic color is fun. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it pinches the skin near the corner of my eye if I am not very careful. May just be my eyes and shape though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best Eyelash Curler Tool Kit! I&#x27;ve tried so many eyelash curler and this is one the best one. It&#x27;s worth buying for the price.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for a promotion.  I&#x27;ve always wanted my own eyelash curler and was SOOO excited to try this one out!  I was not disappointed and now use it daily!  I&#x27;m definitely not a eyelash curler expert but I&#x27;m definitely happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler especially the color!  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used but the seller is excellent, great communication and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I have very long eye lashes that turn and get in my eyes so now when I get out the shower or before I go off I give my eye lashes a quick curl and it keeps them out my eyes</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this product.  You can tell it was carefully and methodically designed.  It opens wide so I can see where I am positioning it, and because the metal is pink and not a darker color, I can see my lashes when I am curling them.  It is lightweight and I get good results with just moderate pressure, so I am not squeezing my lashes to death.  Great price too.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great item........quick delivery!</li>
    <li> So far so good, evenly distributed pressure and good connection with the rubber pad.</li>
    <li> Great quality, I love these for my eyelashes. Makes them look so long!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE,  this eyelash curler.  My eyelashes have actually begun to grow again after using this Shimarz Curler. I think the other&#x27;s were pulling to much. Shimarz is AWESOME!!! One of my best purchases at Amazon! Thank&#x27;s Shimarz and Amazon for offering it to us. :D</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL eyelash curler! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I would recommend it.  Not sure how it compares to my previous Revlon curler but seems to be better.  reason I can&#x27;t compare is because I read a curling tip on line.....use your hair dryer to heat the curler....i did and it makes a nice difference.  s.o is it the heating tip or the curler????  I think it&#x27;s both and certainly worth a try</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried/owned! I can&#x27;t even put it in word! It grabs on my lashes super well and doesn&#x27;t pinch on my skin at all. You just need a little squeeze, not too tight, and it creates the most awesome and natural looking curl! Best part, the founder of Shimarz personally email you and follows up on your purchase AND YOU GET FREE UNLIMITED LIFETIME REFILL PAD REPLACEMENTS! All you need to do is let the guy know and he&#x27;ll send you a pack of 10 replacements at a time including free delivery! How amazing is that!</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler is superior (and I have used many over the years).  BUT, the customer service is the best I have ever experienced, in person or on the internet.  I wrote an email on Sunday morning, with a problem I had with the rubber insert, it seems like not even an hour went by and I had a response, a very nice response, asking if I wanted another curler (not charges for anything) or if I wanted my money back.  I chose to receive another curler since the reviews were so good, I thought I should give it another chance.  That was Sunday afternoon, by Monday, in the a.m., I had a new curler delivered to my home.  Now I ask you, who can top that.  I am very pleased with the curler and needless to say, the customer service.</li>
    <li> works great, looks cute, and curls that stay all day long</li>
    <li> Not just another eyelash curler. I have had my old curler for years and when i used this I finally seen what an eyelash curler is suppose to do.  i would recommend this product for those of you that want lusciously curly lashes ;)</li>
    <li> Did the job designed to do... :)</li>
    <li> Good quality!  Does the job!!</li>
    <li> Good eyelash curler. The space is smaller than any one I&#x27;ve used before, but it doesnt cause any problems. It only takes an extra second to make sure everything is lined up before curling.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use this everyday and it works great. I love the pink it came and and the fact that they provided an extra pad. They shipped everything really fast!</li>
    <li> I really wish this item was better than it turned out to be. It pinches and it doesn&#x27;t really curl my lashes. I&#x27;m frustrated I spent so much money on this eyelash curler and I still don&#x27;t have a curler that works.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, made well.  I like how easy it is to curl lashes--no grabbing skin on eyelid. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler it works great for me. I haven&#x27;t have any problems with it so far. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my eyelashes at all and there&#x27;s an extra pad included. I love the color &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; and would definitely recommend it. :D</li>
    <li> Definitely a better eyelash curler than what you can get at the drugstore or even Sephora, but it is not perfect for me. I have very short straight lashes and I find that the curler doesn&#x27;t open wide enough to get my inner and outer corner lashes very well. I have to do sequential curling in sections, first the middle lashes then the inner and finally the outer lashes. A bit of a pain, in my opinion, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Curls my lashes just okay. Arrived after a week of ordering</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyelash curler because not only did I want to try something new, but it also had rave reviews. My usual go to is the Shu Uemura, and this is pleasantly comparable. It creates a nice curl for my lash, it&#x27;s gentle, and it does come with replacement rubber piece.  I love it!!!!!  Hopefully in the future it comes out in other colors such as black, red, or purple.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars! Perfect grip and curled my lashes with ease.</li>
    <li> This lash curler is great! Easy to use and no pinching!</li>
    <li> Had terrific results using this product. I have long straight eyelashes and this product made them stand out and much more visible. I am very happy with the results. I will recommend this item to my friends and family that want to have terrific looking lashes!</li>
    <li> great product so far...</li>
    <li> After having my previous eyelash curler for 10 years or so, I decided to purchase a new tool from Shimarz. The curler works well and even comes with an additional black pad that can be swapped out in the future. The only complaint is the color, I am not a pink fan! All in all, I do like the compactness and the professional communication of the seller. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a beauty upgrade.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.Love it.</li>
    <li> Super curler... the best I have ever used because it is wide enough to comfortably curl all of my lashes. The pink makes it easier to see my dark lashes and it is sturdy.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this eyelash curler!!!  It&#x27;s easy to handle and use and works like a charm!!  Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 different brand of eyelash curlers during the 20 years I&#x27;ve been curling my eyelashes.  This was one of the worst, and one of the most expensive.  I found that even when I applied a lot of pressure, my lashes didn&#x27;t get curled.  The only thing I liked about it was the fuchsia color!  Also, the company sends you a least 3 email after you order it (I guess to try to get you to review the product).  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;The one I bought instead was: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q0IDADA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1  (&amp;#34;LiveWire Beauty Eyelash Curler&amp;#34;), and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler did not meet my needs.  It arrived timely.  It&#x27;s very cute and pink!  I used it for about a week and realized it did not work for me.  It did pinch me.  I have very straight and thin eyelashes, it did not give me the curl that I expected. Through it all I am very happy to see that a company still values customer service! Though I was not completely satisfied with my purchase of this eyelash curler, they granted me a refund without any questions asked. This was greatly appreciated. Thanks to Shimarz!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few months ago, but I wanted to use it a while before I reviewed it.  In the past I have used a Tarte eyelash curler and various Revlon curlers, but I have to say I have been happiest with the Shimarz curler. I have thin, straight lashes and I have found that this curler really allows me to grab all of my lashes and curl them very well. Other curlers tended to pinch my eyelids but I have yet to have that issue with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price and the extra silicon pad is nice too!</li>
    <li> Thanks for such a great offer!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This works better than other eye lash curlers i have. I will continue to use this one, great product!</li>
    <li> I have really thin, short lashes and no curl whatsoever!  I have always admired women that have perfect lashes!  Now with Shimarz I have the lashes I have always dreamt of. Easy to use and I transform from no lashes to Glamorous, Gorgeous, long flowing curls in Seconds!</li>
    <li> Better than any lash I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> I love these lash curlers they curl my lashes really nice I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. It&#x27;s really lightweight and pretty easy to use. And for $1 it was a great cheap buy!</li>
    <li> finally a curler that does not rip out my lashes!</li>
    <li> The curler curls very well. Very good product. Nick is amazing, very understand and exceptional on customer service. Would definitely deal with him again. Thank you again Nick :)</li>
    <li> Works very well, well made, festive color, great value. If you use a curler, I highly recommend. I used Shu Uemura for  Years and would not go back.</li>
    <li> love the color, so pretty. Comes with an extra pad and great instructions on how to properly use an eyelash curler.  Perfect.  was given a promotional discount In exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The pads were great, bounced right back, no pinching my eye lid. Gave me the pretty curl/lash lift I was seeking  .  Will be getting some as stocking stuffers for the ladies in my family</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Without a doubt, this is definitely THE best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I bought one for my daughter, too, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service.  The curler opens very wide which I liked, but did experience a bit of pinching.</li>
    <li> Great curler, excellent quality!  I needed a new one and am glad I got this one.</li>
    <li> does the job&lt;br /&gt;cute</li>
    <li> i love it. my first time ever eye lashes curler. thanks for letting me have the opportunity to try it. i love it and it&#x27;s like a gift to me. thanks!!! i could curl my eye lashes everyday</li>
    <li> Product is ok, not the best. Not the worst... Comes with an extra pad, so that is definitely appreciated. Def made for 6 month replacement.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, disappointed.</li>
    <li> Literally....the BEST eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m 50+ yrs. old so I&#x27;ve bought a lot of &#x27;curlers&#x27;!!!!!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is HANDS DOWN the best I have ever used! I had been buying drugstore quality eyelash curlers for years, and my eyelashes were starting to fall out and become sparse. I was ready to splurge on a really nice one and came across this one on Amazon. I read the reviews and decided this was the one for me. I received it in the mail and could not wait to try it! It gently curls your lashes and preps them for mascara. I repeat GENTLY curls them LOL. Does not rip them out and does not hurt at all. Best purchase I have made in a long time. Customer service is great, too, I did not have a problem at all and did not contact them, they contacted ME to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase! I was blown away by the customer service! Thank you Shimarz, and I will surely be passing the recommendation of this product along to my family &amp; friends!</li>
    <li> never had an eyelash curler that actually curled my stubborn eyelashes-----love it</li>
    <li> Service was fast and it works great!</li>
    <li> works great and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> The BEST Eyelash curler I have ever used!!! No pinching and perfect lashes everytime!  Love, Love, Love!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler for an outstanding price! Easy to grip &amp; use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several eyelash curlers in my lifetime and this is one of the best. The pretty color is an added bonus that makes it slightly more special than my other stainless steel ones. I was able to get to the bottom of my lashes without pinching, and was left with nicely curled lashes. An eyelash curler is such an essential beauty tool to me to help open up my eyes while making my mascara look better, and this curler delivers great results. I also liked that they send an extra pad to use once the original one wears out.</li>
    <li> this come in handy the best eyelash curler i ever used. no need for false lashes. since i&#x27;m going on a natural flawless face journal. i will recommend this to any one who trying to get sexy long lashes. all you do is add mascara</li>
    <li> Love this curler!  I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in years!  The pink makes it easy to find in my make-up drawer-mess!  I haven&#x27;t pinched my eyelids once &amp; it is smooth to use.  it does curl the lashes upward &amp; make them stand out &amp; more noticeable.  Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have ye t to use it with fake lashes hence the 4☆. But work wonderfully with your natural ones.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to handle.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I had a old Elf took before I received this one.  It had bit the dust days before I found this one.  This curler works very much the same.  It felt a little thinner and cheaper to me but it totally did the job.  As a young teenager, I used one of these once without the rubber portion and cut my lashes so I am very careful for quality now and this one fits the bill</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! It is very gentile and I swear it makes my eyelashes look darker &amp; fuller somehow. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the black rubber refill pad things. Anyways I really like the quality of my latest eye lash curler!</li>
    <li> Always thought eyelash curlers were the same, no matter what brand. Apparently I was mistaken. I ordered this to replace my old one and am pleasantly surprised how well this one works. I wear glasses, so curling my lash is needed so that don&#x27;t touch the lens as I blink. My left eye&#x27;s lashes tend to be stubborn and won&#x27;t curl, hence the reason to try a new product. It actually curls those stubborn lashes. So glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these eyelash curlers, 1 for me and 1 for my daughter. They work pretty good, the one I received for my daughter pinches her eyes each time she uses it. I tried hers, and it pinches me too. The rubber pad is on correctly. Disappointed in the quality control I guess. I think it works pretty good the one for me.</li>
    <li> I received this for only $1.00 in exchange for a review.  It is very nice quality and arrived quickly.  It is easy to use and curled my eyelashes as promised.  Unfortunately, my eyelashes aren&#x27;t too long to begin with and I&#x27;m sure results would be more noticeable if they were better.</li>
    <li> My first impression of the curler as soon as I open the box it was &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; came to my mind. the curler does a great job on my eyelashes. The pnly thing I would suggest is to work a bit more on quality. It is very light, which is great for traveling. It doesn&#x27;t have the retractable spring that some curlers have. When I pressed my eyelashes sometimes the front  finger holder goes to the back too far that it passes the back finger holder. But like I said does a good job curling my eyelashes. Overall is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love my eyelash curler!  Works well without ripping lashes.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler at a amazingly great price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler for many years but had recently started looking as my lashes are thinning a bit.  When this arrived the package was really mangled but the product was in good shape.  First thing I loved was the color!  The second thing I love is how soft the pad is - you feel a really nice soft &amp;#34;squish&amp;#34; when you curl and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my lashes.  I also haven&#x27;t pinched my eyelids which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> BEST EYELASH CURLER EVER !  It truly does curl eyelashes better than any I&#x27;ve ever used. It &amp;#34;fits&amp;#34; the eye/lash area beautifully.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this curler.  I have used eyelash curlers for many years, lots of different brands.  This worked well for about 2 weeks and then it sort of felt like the tension in the curler gave out.  This was a disappointment to me as most of my curlers last for at least a year.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money since I don&#x27;t need to buy another one again.  There is a quality difference between this and the ones I have pitched in the past.</li>
    <li> This curler works smoothly without pinching or tugging. The lashes don&#x27;t stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a comfortable grip and opens wide. I am also loving the color. And curls the lashes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
    <li> Love these so much got them free!</li>
    <li> The curler worked great. I had no pinching on the lid it fit very well on the lid</li>
    <li> feel solid and the arch is not curvy (this is important being asian without deep eye sockets so inner and outer corner lashes fits in the unit well), thus comfortably getting all my lashes. no pinching. soft gentle squeezes working from base to tip gave nice natural curl. just have to get used to no padding in the finger hold. great curler!</li>
    <li> This was the worst three it out</li>
    <li> Really cheaply made, fell apart almost immediately. Made an OK curl while it lasted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s make the lash is curl but it take your real lash off</li>
    <li> When I first received this curler&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of disappointed.  It seemed kind of flimsy and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few months Ii couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes were fairly long but they were always thin and got thinner and thinner.  I had about 6 lashes left and they were pointing in weird directions.  I am seriously talking giant gaps with no lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased curler after curler and still no lashes.  I even changed mascara a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this curler..My Eyelashes Are Back!  It took awhile... but within a few weeks I could see them coming in...and no additional lashes fell out.  Now..After a few months they are pretty much back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thinning eyelashes definitely try this curler...and don&#x27;t judge it until you&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved this eyelash curler...great quality</li>
    <li> Very nice, it works well and their customer service is very helpful and fast!</li>
    <li> This is the very first eyelash curler that I have been happy with. I always had problems with my previous curlers either not getting all of my eyelashes in them, pinching me or being a bit painful, or just not curling the lashes at all. These have been absolutely fantastic and the pink color is so cute too!</li>
    <li> I simply love these eyelash curlers! They work so well compared to the other brands I have tried. I highly recommend them to anyone when looking for a new pair of curlers.</li>
    <li> got this eye lash curler last week, it is the best one i&#x27;ve ever used. once you get used to the right way to use it, it works great love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Finally one that does not pinch! Thanks Shimarz!</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived on time &amp; it looks exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyelash curlers. This is the best ever. It fits the eye, no pinching and a great curl. It makes my lashes look longer and thicker. Amazon is great as always!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this, great product!</li>
    <li> This provides better curl than my Lancôme or Tweezerman eye lash curlers. I like the design, fits my hand better. Does not pinch my lid and a few gentle pumps and my lashes are curled.  Curl lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Really like this eyelash curler.  My eyelashes stayed curled all day unlike others that I have used in the past.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone considering buying it.</li>
    <li> Very cute eyelash curler! It was a breeze to put together (so hard right hahahaha) and I love how cute and pink it is. I used it for the first time the other day and I was surprised how comfortable it was and how long it made my lashes. Great product, it gets an A+ from me!</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. No fancy tech, just a reliable and effective curler.</li>
    <li> Great for curling lashes. Gentle and very girly! This would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many lash curlers over the years and this one is very good. It doesn&#x27;t pull eye lashes out and it curls them on the first try.</li>
    <li> I love my eyelash curler, I have seen a noticeable difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> Best and works wonder helps shaped the lashes!!!</li>
    <li> it would be very useful if the color of the metal  ( now hot pink) were lighter so you could see your lashes clearly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size. The finger holes are big unlike other curlers where I could barely get my fingers in. I love the color. It does a great job curling as promised. Customer service has sent emails making sure I am completely satisfied. I have no doubt that they would fix it if I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> To be a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> This will give you a great curl without pinching your lashes. You also get an extra pad insert. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyelash curler. My eyelashes look fuller and thicker and I have fairly short lashes so this is awesome!</li>
    <li> The design of this eyelash curler is similar to many others and works well. My eye lashes are difficult to curl, but this seems to work.</li>
    <li> The color (pink) makes it easy to find in makeup bag.  I have short, thin eyelashes so.....curling them is a necessity.  This curler does a great job!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really buy the hype around this because I thought an eyelash curler is an eyelash curler, but this one works better than any I&#x27;ve owned before.  It&#x27;s solid, operates smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid.  My eyelashes rarely stick to the cushion so a lot less are pulled out accidentally.  The cushion itself is set securely and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will budge anytime soon.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the color but can live with it.</li>
    <li> The Shimarz pulls out more lashes than any curler I&#x27;ve ever used.  The cute color doesn&#x27;t make up for that.  I&#x27;ll be going back to Japonesque.</li>
    <li> I like this curler since it doesn&#x27;t crush my lashes, but it&#x27;s a little too big for me.</li>
    <li> It works great for me, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. I find it comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my eyelashes at all. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> pro- it doesn&#x27;t pull out my lashes- but most don&#x27;t if you have a new rubber stopper versus an old split one&lt;br /&gt;con- it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes any more than any other eyelash curler</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I was skeptical about spending so much money, but it is money well spent.  Because the curler is bright pink, I can clearly see my lashes as they are being curled when I use it.  It is also easy and comfortable to use without pinching me.  The owner of the company contacts you after purchase which is good PR.  Thanks Shimarz.  Will never own another brand!</li>
    <li> The girly color might turn some people away, but I&#x27;ve found that this product is easier to use and position than other curlers I&#x27;ve used because my eyelashes stand out against the pink frame much more than they do against a silver one.</li>
    <li> This curler really made my lashes look great</li>
    <li> Great Eyelash curler!!!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it works just like it should. The material feels sturdy, like it would last for a while.</li>
    <li> Great curler, works perfect! Company ships SUPER fast! And BONUS...it&#x27;s really pink and really pretty! I love it!</li>
    <li> Very simple to use. Sturdy and well built.</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyelash curler curls my lashes without pulling on them has a really wide base that actually fits all of my lashes and the pink color is a nice touch so that it isn&#x27;t only visible amongst my other beauty tools and brushes but also cute to have</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler..i love the pink color too</li>
    <li> Its okay. It is not in comparison with my Shu Uemera , but it&#x27;s good for the price that I got it at.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and is very comfortable in the hand.  Love the color!</li>
    <li> Does the job, is very sturdy, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with anything pink. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although I have pinched myself a couple times, the curler does curl fine.  Unclear if it is worth the cost difference from a drugstore brand.  I probably used my drugstore curler for 15 years without any issue.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this eyelash curler. It comes with a set of replacement rubber pieces for when the original wears down. They do exactly what you expect them to do without any problems. On top of that they are a pretty metallic pink color(come on who doesnt love that).</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews I was excited and hoping for a miracle eyelash curler, but it&#x27;s not that for me. The shape does not work for my eyes. I need a curler that is more curved. I also found that my eyelashes stick to the pad and feel like they are going to pull out. I was really hoping to replace my current curler, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not. However, I will say it is a beautiful color and feels well made.</li>
    <li> The metal cut completely through the rubber pad on the very first use.  Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that curls my lashes quickly and painlessly. I had been using an old curler for quite a while (years) when it broke forcing me to buy a new one. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old one was until I used this new one. All I had to do was press for a few seconds and my lashes were curled. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars was because I am not sure of the durability for the long haul, hopefully it will last as long as my other one did because it is a lot better.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money i use shu urema and its way better. When i contacted the company never heard back</li>
    <li> I liked this eyelash curler very much.  It is not heavy as other curlers and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great curler! Color is fun and cute.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> believe the ad! best curler ever! coming from a 50 yr old woman thats saying a lot! had an issue that needed attention and NICK, the founder of this product, addressed the problem immediately to my satisfaction. great job!!</li>
    <li> it curls my lashes well. It has a lovely color and I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Shu Uemura eyelash curler for years, occasionally trying different ones to see if I could find a curler that fits my eyes better.  I have small eyes and straight, short, thin eyelashes.  It&#x27;s been very hard to get them looking &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34;!  The Shimarz curler does a better job for me, and I love the color.  Hint: for those of you who have eyelashes like me, heat your curler with your hair dryer before curling- you get a better curl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I purchased this eyelash curler.  Design is pretty much like any other curler, except I noticed right away the top part was flatter, not as curved as most other curlers I&#x27;ve tried.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that design would work for me but it did.  It made it easier to place on my eyelid and easier for it to evenly catch all the lashes to curl.  Other reviewers mentioned the lack of pads on the finger holds but I like it unpadded better.  The other ones I&#x27;ve tried that had pads for your fingers would always loosen and I&#x27;d have to shape it back on.  More trouble than it was worth, in my opinion.  I also love that they offer lifetime pad refills.  I&#x27;m definitely going to take advantage of that.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected didn&#x27;t curl eyelashes very well. Felt flimzy to me.</li>
    <li> Nice product and quality!</li>
    <li> An eylelash curler is just an eylash curler.....I always hope for something more but I never find it. It works fine though and I like the pretty pink color.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler ... I&#x27;m really able to curl the whole lash. I use the sephora brand which works pretty well but I found this one to work better .. You have to use carful use or it can pinch your skin.</li>
    <li> So far I really do like this curler. I just got it and have used it a few days. This curler seems to already work better than the other one I usually use. I had to buy another eyelash curler from Amazon because my favorite one fell from my purse and was run over in a parking lot. I was so upset. I got this one to try and it arrived so quickly. I am very pleased with it. I love that I can order refills for it at any time too. Customer Service from Shirmarz is great too!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not trying to be negative just honest. This was definitely not worth the money. I have purchased much cheaper curlers&lt;br /&gt;that work much better. I am using my old one again as I do NOT like this new one. I HATE it. It does nothing for my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;might as well not even use anything if that is the way it works.</li>
    <li> Such a great little curler.  No pulling or tugging.  Easy to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye Lash curlers and this one is not only  pretty but it works. I have had many that just failed at curling my lashes or stopped working this product i had none of that.. I love the way it crimped my lashes without pulling on them or sticking to them. its light weight and does exactly what it says it will do and that&#x27;s a big plus to me..and it&#x27;s pink ...I love Pink lol  Great Product and i will buy from them again for sure.</li>
    <li> I gave this one to my daughter.  I guess I&#x27;m pickier about eyelash curlers than I realized!  The finger holes felt small to me, and it just didn&#x27;t feel like &amp;#34;it fit me&amp;#34;.  My left side could never get a comfortable curl.  It always felt like it was pinching or pulling the lashes.  Just not for me.  I do, however, LOVE the color!  I&#x27;m stuck only loving a specific gold one, that isn&#x27;t terribly easy to find anymore.  But it fits me perfectly, has double support around the fingers, never pulls, curls perfectly, and is just my favorite.  Sigh...</li>
    <li> I had a nice eyelash curler that I had splurged on a couple of years ago but a someone recently took it. I was bummed but I still needed an eyelash curler so I started looking. Found this one and the reviews looked good so I took the chance. The curler arrived but sadly it was damaged in shipping. I contacted the seller and they were very courteous and got another one out to me right away. This is by far the best eye lash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned! I use it twice on each side before I apply my mascara. It curls my lashes perfectly and they look so long. If you want an eyelash curler that works, look no further!</li>
    <li> it curls a little different thank my old one I like it but I have to constantly clean it because I loose few lashes if I dont</li>
    <li> I had never used an eyelash curler before I got this one in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Yowsa! I should have been curling my lashes before now! Amazingly pretty lashes that make me feel beautiful! The problem is that my nieces keep borrowing it so that they can have beautiful lashes, too!&lt;br /&gt;I think I know what I will be getting for a few young ladies over the holidays!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to clean and easy to leave the house looking great!</li>
    <li> Not great very flimsy thought it would be better quality.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my 14 year old, she loves the way it curls her lashes</li>
    <li> The pads on this did not align with the way it clamped down so the pads wore through. It was good at first but would not purchase again unless there were a new, improved design....</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d the product quickly. Very nice eyelash curler -- curls the lashes with a more natural looks than other products and does not stick to lashes or pull. Very pleased with the purchase. The hot pink color is a fun bonus!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift.  She enjoys it.  The packaging was nice so I could give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Advertised as a Mini curler and for me it wasn&#x27;t.  Too thick and can&#x27;t get close enough to eye lid.  Same size as my Tweezerman one.  Same length only thicker.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Nothing new with this eyelash curler.  Similar to the drug store brands I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, so I&#x27;m not sure why it is rated so high online.  I get results similar to the other curlers I used and really can not pinpoint any difference.  Based on this, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the product, but time will tell if it lasts longer.</li>
