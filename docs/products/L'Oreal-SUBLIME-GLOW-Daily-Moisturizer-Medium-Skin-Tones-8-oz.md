<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and love it.  It gives you a light &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; - nothing obvious and makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Blotchy and dried and cracked my skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cremes I have ever used! It looks absolutely like a real tan and does not streak. Use gloves when you apply it and make sure you really run it in everywhere. Most trouble spots are the ankles and feet. But if you put on at night and apply as directed and make sure you cover all areas. Let air dry for ten minutes then go to bed, it works perfect. Not stains on clothes at night. Take shower then you will see a tan. I use on face also and works good. No breaking out either. Love this product and for the price...cannot beat it!</li>
    <li> I used this today for the first time.  Wanted something that would provide more color than the Amir Argan (which i will happily go back to).  I showered twice and the awful smell from this has lingered on.  If you can stand pungent smells, you may be ok, but if not, i would strongly recommend Amir Argan touch of tan, over this product.  It definitely did not pass the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; test.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. Gives your skin a healthy glow.  I use it everyday.  Wish it was available in a local store like it used to be.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Walmart used to sell it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except on Amazonl.  Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I just love this product! It is easy to apply,and has a pleasant odor. The result is a nice ,even tan without any streaking or funky orange tint .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male who wanted a good base color for a beach trip so I decided to try this product.  Given the glowing reviews and mild description I figured it would be a nice, subtle change of skin tone.  After applying yesterday I noticed on my commute to work that I&#x27;m glittery as hell. Luckily I didn&#x27;t apply this to my face, but I&#x27;m forced to wear long sleeves for a while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unless you want to look like your from a Twilight movie I suggest you go with another &#x27;natural looking&#x27; tanning product.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer works great.  I buy it all the time.  For some reason, I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so I am ordering it off Amazon.com.  You will love it.  It gives you a natural looking tan--no orange--and no odor.</li>
    <li> Natural golden tan until the next shower!  Best of the three or four brands tried.  Buy it.  It does color your clothing and bed sheets, however.</li>
    <li> Love this and also the version for face.  I am very fair skinned but the medium is perfect, so don&#x27;t be afraid to use this if you are similarly pale.  Very natural color, typical self tanner smell so I only use it on my legs so that I can&#x27;t smell it as much.  Since buying this I have found a product I like a lot better and it&#x27;s cheaper - I have switched to the Malibu Hemp Golden Glow, which is also available on Amazon but also at WalMart.  No self-tanner smell with that one at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have fair skin that tans only after it burns, and this product is by far the most natural looking I have ever used. The result is tan, not orange-ish, and I love the subtle shimmer. A few people have commented on not liking the scent, but I really love the mango scent.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NPWQU4 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Glow Daily Body Moisturizer and Natural Skin Tone Enhancer, Medium, 8-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used just about every self tanner on the market and this one rocks!  Awesome true to tan color and leaves a nice moisturized feeling along with a subtle sparkle.  Absolutely LOVE this product.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!  By the way, the sparkle only shows if you are looking for it.</li>
    <li> I was slightly hesitant to buy this product because of other reviews mentioning that that this product leaves your skin smelling like fake tanner, but this seemed like the self-tanning lotion with the best reviews and I didn&#x27;t want to be pasty white this winter, so I decided to go for it. Sadly, the other reviewers who say that it kind of smells were right- its got that very distinctive self tan smell but it isn&#x27;t out of control strong (although for sure is noticeable) and it definitely gives your skin a nice tan color, not too splotchy or orange. If you look really hard you can see the sparkly thing other reviewers talk about, but I can&#x27;t even tell unless I&#x27;m in really bright light and looking at my skin super close up. I would (and will) buy another bottle of this stuff.</li>
    <li> woah, I am fairly light skinned since I am asian, I did not know my legs were orangeish until someone commented on the back of my legs. I had used it three days in a row, the smell is tolerable, and it felt great application, but the results not for me....</li>
    <li> Came broken! Don&#x27;t Buy! CVS sells it just as cheap and it&#x27;s not gonna be damaged that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few self tanning lotions and this is by far my favorite. I ran out and had to buy a different L&#x27;Oreal self tanner and it was terrible! I&#x27;m embarrased to go in public. So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, it smells great and does not make you look orange.  Make sure that you use an exfoliator first. If you use this every other day, you will look tan all year  the medium tone is best</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner. It looks natural and is easy to apply. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reasonably pale, but I wanted to look like I don&#x27;t have to stay inside all day since it is summer. This product gives a nice color and goes on evenly. No one knew I had used a self tanner. Everyone just thought I had been able to spend a few hours outside. The only downsides to this product are the scent and how long it takes to dry.</li>
    <li> I have an incredibly light olive complexion. It makes me look sickly at times if I don&#x27;t spend time in the sun, but we all know too much sun can cause skin damage. Regrettably, I used tanning beds for awhile because I was so frustrated with the results from self-tanners. Never went on even, always blotchy and usually a bad color. I&#x27;ve used expensive self-tanners before...and they were never like this. This is by far my favorite self-tanner. It did not have me looking orange or yellow, streaky or blotchy....rather it even seems to add a bit of rosy undertones to what looks like a very natural looking tan. Best of all....Not only is this self-tanner superior, it is also affordable.</li>
    <li> As far as these types of moisturizers go, I feel this one is the best by far.  I have tried at least five different brands, and L&#x27;Oreal seems to have the best texture, scent and color.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy anything else.  Also, it really looks pretty natural in the winter months.</li>
    <li> Even though I have light skin, I am using the medium tint and I do not find it too dark.  I use it for 3- 4 days in a row, then take a break.  You will notice results the next day or even earlier.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it has a nice scent.  I like the size of the product, it should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, and streaks way too easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to the reviews and they were correct. I am 52 have fair, freckly skin that can look ghostly (ghastly) if not getting any sun, but my dermatologist said no more tanning for me. Not only does this product leave me with a gentle change in color, it absorbs quickly, has a little bit of shine that is not greasey AND makes my over-exposed wrinkly skin look less so. There is a very faint odor that is not noticeable unless in close quarters, much less than any \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; I have used, which can be unbearable. The only down side is the distributor who sent the product sent a bunch of 2 oz bottles! What a waste of plastic. Love the product, will buy more when all my little bottles run out : )</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a novice at sunless tanning lotions, so I think that the streaks are probably my fault because I didn&#x27;t do a fantastic job of rubbing it in evenly...  But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I&#x27;m now at work and my body is covered in shimmery specks.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff! I have fair skin. It gives you a hint of light color when you put it on and by the end of the week you have natural, non-streaky light tan. Havent noticed the smell so it can&#x27;t be bad. I order it as soon as I&#x27;m running out.</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. I order it from amazon because most stores carry the Jorgensen bronzer n it is horrible compared to this product. I would def recommend it to anyone who wants to have bronzed with a slight shimmer flawless looking skin. This lotion is a winner</li>
    <li> I just started using this product after asking another mom waiting in the car line at school, how she stayed so tan year round .. I could have sworn she was going to tell me that she goes to a tanning salon ... when she told me about how this product is her secret, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try ...  I LOVE IT!  It does still have a slight \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; scent, that I think is unavoidable with any of these products due to the nature of its contents.  The color does build up over 2-3 days time, with repeated daily use, to a great (non-orangey) looking tan.  Leaves your skin nice and soft too.  I really like the *very, very faint* soft shimmer ... that is really only noticeable in bright daylight.  It is not like sparkles or \\&quot;stripper glitter\\&quot; at all, and is just a slight shimmer effect.  I&#x27;ve noticed that you do need to keep up on it, like any other self tanning product that will start to fade after 1-2 days of missed use, especially with showering, sweating etc ... other than these points I feel that it is a great product, well worth the price point, and a great alternative to the salon.</li>
    <li> I used to tan in tanning beds, and it always took me quite a bit of time to work up a nice tan, and the tan always required frequent visits back to the tanning bed to maintain it.  I finally made the decision to stop subjecting my body to the UV rays and decided to try out sunless tanning.  I&#x27;d used the Sublime Glow years and years ago and remembered liking it, so I purchased it--in the medium, NOT the fair, even though I&#x27;m pretty fair naturally.  Even with the medium, I don&#x27;t get a really deep or orange color.  I always start applying it at my feet and then work my way up to my neck, so I&#x27;m not bending over and don&#x27;t get creases or anything.  It dries pretty quickly and the smell isn&#x27;t initially bad, though I prefer to apply it in the morning then take a bath at night, because I think the smell starts to get strong later in the day, and I don&#x27;t like sleeping with it on and getting the smell into my sheets.  It lasts several days and provides a good glow, but nothing shocking.  If I want a deeper color--which I often do--I apply this, then immediately afterward apply the Sublime Bronze Pro-Perfect Airbrush in medium. and I get a very even deep tan which actually looks real.  A bottle of this will last me maybe two months with consistent applications.</li>
    <li> Easy to us and makes your skin feel and look soft...&lt;br /&gt;Love the Color TONE it gives your skin..&lt;br /&gt;Very Natural and HEALTHY LOOKING...</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have been using it for years. A little more expensive to order it online, but its great</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion by L&#x27;Oreal is by far the best one I have tried. It goes on evenly, moisturizes, and with repeated use, gives you a gradually darker tan look~with NO orange undertones. I have had people compliment me on my tan, which makes me chuckle. After being a sun worshiper all my life, I find myself now actually allergic to the sun (makes me me break out in hives) so this product is the perfect alternative and it doesn&#x27;t lead to excessive wrinkles and skin damage like the sun&#x27;s rays would. I have tried other brands of self-tanning lotions (Jergens, which seems to be in every store), and they all have some ingredient that causes a rash. L&#x27;Oreal is the only product that I can use and I can only find it on Amazon. Great great product. Just ordered 3 more tubes for the summer.</li>
    <li> I love this. Once I&#x27;ve reached my target tone, I only use every couple/few days to maintain.</li>
    <li> I have orange, somewhat streaked legs after using this one time.  I LOVE Dove energy glow, but they stopped making it and now you can only find it at outrageous prices.  I am on the hunt to find the next best thing and this is not it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this,this tube lasts quite well and much longer then others.&lt;br /&gt;It does better job then others on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use them when you have the orange splotches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 days now, and I&#x27;m just beginning to see some color. This is the first self-tanner I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare to others, but there definitely IS a smell, and I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as particularly pleasant. As for the shimmer, I noticed for the first time when I was in direct sunlight that I was super glittery. Even in normal lighting, you can see tiny sparkly flecks. I don&#x27;t mind this; in fact, I think it&#x27;s really pretty, but I doubt guys would appreciate it. Overall, I neither hate or love the product; I&#x27;m just curious to see how much color I can accumulate with continued use.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, gradual color, however has a &amp;#34;glittery sheen&amp;#34; to it which is most noticeable in natural sunlight. The glittery look seemed to last even after a shower.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I start to see results immediatley and it last a couple of days, has a shimmer too it that i like</li>
    <li> LOVE this.  Moisturizes very nice with the extra color kick.  And no unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and I use this product about 3 times a week for the past 3 years.  It keeps my skin at a slightly darker tone so that I can wear shorts, skirts or cropped pants without having the glowing white skin I normally have!  It works without streaking as long as I make sure to exfoliate (shaving my legs works too) and to dry my legs completely before applying.  It doesn&#x27;t have the normal &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look you get with some tanners.  Make sure to apply less around the knees and ankles because it tends to build up and become darker in these areas.  Apply more often if you want to look really tan.</li>
    <li> I use this in the summer for a beautiful glow. It doesn&#x27;t get streaky and gradually darkens fantastically if you&#x27;re afraid of self tanning. It also smells like green tea.. So yummy.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use it on your face or your skin will become dry.  takes about 3-4 applications on the legs/chest, etc. to develope  a good tan, but once it dos it lasts.</li>
    <li> Very minimal smell and a nice glow. No streaking like the Jergens one gives you. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shimmer it leaves on your skin. Thankfully it&#x27;s not sparkles, just shimmer.</li>
    <li> This is it!  I go through it fast because I put it all over, and Amazon allows me to receive one every two months.  Stores run out of it quickly because they only get six per -- it seems like -- year.</li>
    <li> Before I noticed a difference. I have naturally olive skin and found this to be the right shade. I love the shimmery appearance when I put it on.  I put it on every day and in less than a week I could see a difference so I changed to every alternate day.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t make me orange, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad! It works quickly with minimal usage.</li>
    <li> I had to write a review for this after what happened to me yesterday. This product works great and gives you a nice gradual medium tan, as promised. However, when I was sitting in Easter Sunday mass I looked down at my arms and they were sparkling like Edward Cullen! I think it&#x27;s only noticeable when you&#x27;re in a well lit area like I was in church. But still I&#x27;m sure most people would not want to be that shimmery!</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I will use after failed and orange attempts with other brands - it builds up nice tan gradually, adds a bit of moisture to the skin, and never comes out looking orange (if you&#x27;re careful about application)</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need an expensive tanning lotion. This one works great, as long as you wait for it to dry. If you try to get dressed before it dries, it will look a little uneven in spots. I love how you can gradually build your tan over a few days. That helps to give you nice, even coverage. As far as the smell goes, I think this product is better than most. The lotion actually has a pleasant smell when you first put it on. The stinky tanning smell develops later, but it is less intense than with some other products I&#x27;ve used. This lotion gives you a nice, long lasting tan. I think L&#x27;Oreal makes great tanning products. I usually use the spray a couple of times a week and supplement with the lotion a couple of days in between. I think the lotion takes a little longer to dry, and maybe looks a tad less natural. I like this lotion instead of the darker Sublime Bronze, because of the ability to let the color build over more applications, and the color doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. Another good tip I&#x27;ve learned is to scrub your hands and around your fingernails with a nail brush after you apply this. That will keep your palms from turning super orange.</li>
    <li> Other than &amp;#34;True Blue,&amp;#34; this is the only sunless tanner that I&#x27;ve used that does not leave tale tale signs of demarcation on hands and/or feet. There is a great dewy finish that does not glare or glitter-sparkle in the sun. Also, the sin tone is a very natural suntanned look.</li>
    <li> Only brand that will not turn skin orange</li>
    <li> After 12+ years of tanning beds, i decided that as much as i like being tan, its just not worth the risk. I researched all kinds of self tanning products and decided to give this one a try. I only applied it to my pasty white legs and noticed a difference after the very first use. I apply it before bed and then again in the morning. I have had several people ask if I had been going to back to the tanning bed! I love this stuff and i really like that it has a light feminine shimmer effect to it.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does have that self tanner smell when i sweat. But i only noticed it the first day or two.  I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
    <li> This tube lasts quite a while and does a great job on my legs.  Do not put gobs on your legs as you will see the orange splotches.  Use every other day in small amounts.  I live in Florida, very rarely sit in sun to get a tan and my legs look great all the time.  When you shower, it does not all come off, just add small amount day after showering and you are good to go</li>
    <li> Sad that this is so hard to find in stores these days, but i&#x27;ve tried at least 15-20 different ones, and this by far gives you the most natural color, has the least horrid smell, and has a great price. There is a ever so slight shimmer, ive read a f</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink, and it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. Most most impressive thing about it is after applying it twice I can see a difference. I don&#x27;t look blotchy or like an oompa loompa, just a bit healthier. I&#x27;m also really pale, so that is probably why it was noticeable so quickly. I only applied it to one leg so I could watch for progress. Considering I already see some I will start using it all over so I don&#x27;t look crazy.</li>
    <li> This product give a great subtle color that gets darker with repeated use.  I have very fair skin, but this shade still looks fine if I don&#x27;t over do it.  I have to disagree about the \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot;. the sheen is very mild and hardly glittery.  Just my experience, but friends have said the tan looks good and no-one has ever mentioned sparkles.  Easy to apply without streaking as the color effect is subtle and only builds over repeated applications and you are unlike to \\&quot;miss\\&quot; the same area repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Nice cream. Goes on well. Wish it were a little darker but will perk up my tan once I get it going. Still waiting for tanning weather.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I purchased this product versus the other leading brand. In reading reviews of the other brand, some users claimed the product was more of a self-tanner, and I have never had good results with those.&lt;br /&gt;However, I ordered fair/medium and medium was sent so I was concerned as I am VERY pale. I&#x27;ve only used it once (this morning) and can see a slight enhancement of color already. I project I will have a nice, natural-looking glow in about 3 more days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am very pale (not pasty) and do not tan well. I turn red, have some color for 2 days, then its back to being Snow White. The medium shade appears to be perfect. The fair shade may have been too light and the results minimal, so I&#x27;m not upset that I received medium.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product does not make you sparkle like a 6 year old pageant contestant either. The scent is very light and non-chemical-like.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not tan well I highly recommend this product. After my 2 bottles are gone I definitely plan on ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if I start looking like a carrot in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I am now back, a week later, looking like my ankles are rusted!! This is nothing more than a self-tanner. You WILL indeed turn orange and you WILL indeed sparkle as if you&#x27;ve rolled in glitter. I put this on extremely carefully, making sure its on evenly, yet it looks like I have coffee and rust stains around my ankles. VERY disappointed. A complete waste of money considering I ordered two tubes and have only used 1 for a week. Maybe I&#x27;ll save it for Halloween and put it on a white ball so it can turn into a pumpkin too.</li>
    <li> I you a natural looking color, that is slightly tanned, this is for you.  It also does NOT bleed onto clothes.</li>
    <li> I dont like the smell of it. I havent actually even used it because it has a weird smell. I would only use this if i was home for the night and planning on showering the next morning.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product and used it up pretty quickly. Gave me a good glow gradually and definitely looked very natural. I got a bit addicted and was using twice a day and it did look a smidge Orange on my forearms/wrists, but I cut back and it was good and went away. It was very gradual but could see results within 3 days.</li>
    <li> It gave me a great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking tan!</li>
    <li> I was about to write that I found no glittery effects, then I went outside! Yes, there is a definite sparkle in the sun, but I like it. However, this may not make it the best choice for guys. I am very pleased with the results. No orange with this one - unlike many others I&#x27;ve tried, including Jergens.  It soaked in within 5 minutes, didn&#x27;t come off on my clothing or bedding, and the smell was quite nice initially (although it did eventually fade to the typical self-tanner smell).</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanning things but this is by far my favorite.  I love that it is not too dark and that I can use it at any time and it dries so quickly.  Has a faint smell but not too bad.  Recommend this!</li>
    <li> Personally, I detest the smell and the fact that it has glitter. I tend to use it when I know I&#x27;m going to 1. be wearing long pants/sleeves for a day and 2. doing laundry soon.&lt;br /&gt;  While the smell isn&#x27;t the worst of them all, I find it to be a very pungent, obviously-she&#x27;s-using-self-tanning-lotion odor. It tends to linger on clothes and sheets as well, which is inconvenient if you are sensitive to the smell. I could certainly do without the glitter- I think I was 6 years old the last time I wanted glitter all over my skin for the world to see. However, I have bought this product several times for the simple fact that it works well in giving me a natural-looking color, and it&#x27;s dirt cheap as far as self-tanner goes.&lt;br /&gt;  If you can afford to try the more expensive self tanning products, like the one&#x27;s by St. Tropez, I&#x27;d recommend those over this lotion for sure. The smell just bothers me way too much to give this product anything above 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned with pink undertones, burn rather than tan, and have rosacea to boot, so sun bathing is not an option. Had tried another self-tanner a couple years ago but was left with streaks and a fake-looking orange color. I bought this product on the basis of the reviews and am pleased overall. After using three nights in a row (and then skipping the next three nights) I still have a light tan that is very natural looking. Because the color builds slowly, I was able to go back and use more where I&#x27;d skimped too much(above the knees) and use less where I looked too dark (below the knees). I didn&#x27;t mind the sparkles--they&#x27;re kind of fun and they&#x27;re gone within a half day. The smell isn&#x27;t too bothersome--on me, it&#x27;s a slightly musty smell that I notice but my husband doesn&#x27;t. I gave it four instead of five stars because I dislike the way my skin feels, both the night I use it and the whole day after--it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky or tacky and wishing I could shower. (Note for other rosacea-type people: I did not use the product on my face--I used Rosacea Care&#x27;s tinted Zinc-o for that and the colors match pretty well.)</li>
    <li> I was surprised on how well it works. After the first day I am much tanner with no streaks or blotchy color. The smell is not strong just smells like lotion. Another thing I like is my hands didn&#x27;t turn orange like other self tanner products. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am very fair so the color builds up a bit faster than it might if I had a medium skintone, but it never looks orange or fake. I use this to maintain my tan, either from the actual sun or from the regular self-tanner I use. It seems to remedy the dreaded patchiness I always experience when it starts to fade. It smells really good when you first apply it but does dry down to a the usual self-tanner smell after a couple of hours. Yes, it is shimmery. I personally like this and think it gives you a nice glow, but in direct, bright sunlight you will look shimmery from up close. I&#x27;ve used several gradual tanners over the years and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my daughters. I love how natural it looks.</li>
    <li> I love this gradual self tanner.  It looks so natural on my pale skin.  It wears off very evenly too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted a natural-looking tan, and it was rated highly. I was impressed at first with the smooth and subtle tan. However, when I stepped in the sunlight I noticed that my legs were covered in glitter. I was at a professional conference looking like I had stolen some pre-teen&#x27;s lotion.  Very disappointing.  I wasn&#x27;t even able to return this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase if you are looking for a natural look!</li>
    <li> Well, it works. But the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; part is glitter. And despite the package saying &amp;#34;Superior Scent&amp;#34; this actually smells pretty much like similar products. It&#x27;s a strong bad smell that lasts a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you rub your skin, the darkness comes off pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it would be wise to look for something else.</li>
    <li> All great. No funny color. Applies evenly. Great moisture additive. 5 stars. Prompt delivery. Only drawback...too many ounces for travel carry on.</li>
    <li> This Tanning lotion seems to do much better than others I have used. It seem to tan more evenly and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Simply stated, this product met all my expectations. Color starts after two applications. Very natural looking, no \\&quot;painted\\&quot; effect. Excellent texture and a pleasant, subtle fragrance. I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing compares.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who do not want exposure to the sun.   Make sure before using to exfoliate your skin.   It goes on nice and does not streak.   It gives you a nice sunkissed glow without the sun.   Looks like you have been to the beach, but you really weren&#x27;t.    Caution, it does have a yucky scent to it, my advice, after applying, spray yourself with a fresh body spray, and no one will know.</li>
    <li> Superior scent?  Not really.  You will still smell like a chemical plant.  But your legs will look great.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this moisturizes as well as self-tans. As long as you rub it in thoroughly, you don&#x27;t have uneven coloring. I&#x27;ve had to exfoliate before using other products and still have had some problems. It smells decent. Kind of like tea, to me. I use it every other day and get very nice results.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this product.  I really like this daily glow moisturizer, my skin feels fantastic &amp; it has given me just enough color to look very natural.  Absolutely no streaks or weird orangey spots.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t turn me orange and it didn&#x27;t stain my clothing or bed sheets.  I&#x27;d recommend it.  You will look healthy glowing, but not tan,tan,tan.</li>
    <li> I find this results in patchy uneven color. I have fair skin and I  know all about the prep before self tanning. I won&#x27;t use again. I like the subtle shimmer, dry time and scent,  but the uneven color is a deal breaker. I  really like the Jergens version. It results in a more even color.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just be careful to apply it evenly and wash your hands well after applying.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, and I love the outcome of the Medium tone.  Does have a bit of a smell that I am used to, but the boyfriend does not care much for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore so I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon offers it. I love how it provides just a slight tint  Not the streaky, orangey look that self-tanners often do. It also has a slight \\&quot; sparkle\\&quot; that I love!  I get lots of complements on my skin tone.</li>
    <li> works well to moisturize and add the right amount of color to your skin.  No offensive odor is associated with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and I use the medium shade. It makes my skin look beautiful after one use. I use it every other day to maintain an even, tan skin tone. Love love love!</li>
    <li> For me, a much better alternative than self-tanning lotions.  It seems to go on more smoothly with no streaks and is more moisturizing than self-tanners.  You can increase or decrease the amount of tan and the end result is a good look.</li>
    <li> Works in the long run. If you are looking for a quick fix this is not for you. It took me about 9 days of continuous usage before the color really developed. It does have a smell to it which makes it nearly impossible to use during the day time at work. I only use at night and then shower in the  morning to rid myself of the smell. It isn&#x27;t an overwhelming smell but enough for me to take notice.</li>
    <li> Its okay but could do without the glitter</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it would work so I only put in on my legs, and like within a few days I noticed that my legs were a lot darker than my other body parts. It works really good, and results are seen quickly</li>
    <li> Subtle shade that blends in nicely and does  look fake.  A light tan for your skin.</li>
    <li> shade of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is realistic, but a little darker than I like</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not dark complected, by any means. I am olive toned and tan easily. I&#x27;ve used different brands in the past and thought I had used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime and it worked well. But, I&#x27;m not seeing very good results with this tube. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I just need to apply more than I have been to get the results I want.</li>
    <li> Great scent works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  If you want just a little color, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have pale skin and if you rub this product in well, it does not give you blotchy spots.  Take care to not get it too thick in your elbow and knee creases.  I want to say if you don&#x27;t want your body to have a shimmer then do not use this product. I, however, love the subtle shimmer.  I also just bought the face product of this as well and love that too.</li>
    <li> works well sticks well&lt;br /&gt;just need a light layer</li>
    <li> Works great! A little drying, I put moisturizer on first then the glow.</li>
    <li> It smells great, like mango. It&#x27;s not sticky. Haven&#x27;t seen the tan yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will come.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow moisturizer and kin tone enhancer is the best self tanner I have ever used. It truly moisturizing without being greasy. It dries quickly and never stains my hands. It is very natural, never orange. This product is much better than the L&#x27;Oreal bronzers now available in the stores. Love!</li>
    <li> The 3 tubes of self tanner came very quickly and was packaged extremely well to keep from spilling.  Not used to paying for shipping however frim an online marketplace but could not locate discount shipping promo code, so gave 4 stars for this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two summers, plus the winter in between, and just love it. It leaves a very even color, and looks natural, not like orange or bronze. I only use it on my legs, and it gives just enough color to even out my skin tone without looking like I have anything on. It&#x27;s not like my legs are super dark and my arms bone white. If you want that super dark look, this is not for you. But, if you just want a hint of color to even out your skin tone this is it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t wash off if you properly apply it. I shave my legs in the evening, then apply this product (tanning lotions work best after shaving which also removes all the dead skin). I let it dry an hour or so, sometimes apply a second time if I want a tad darker, then put on my PJ pants so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on the bed sheets. When I get up the next morning, I have a good tan. No funny smells and it moisturizes well. I have used many of these products for years and this is the best one I have found that you can do at home. REMEMBER that you must wash your hands well after applying because it will turn your nails and the palms of your hands very dark. Also, go easy on knees and feet until you have tried it because thicker skin like knees (same as your palms) will turn darker than thinner skin.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my experience with this tanning lotion hasn&#x27;t been as positive as most reviewers. This stuff streaked like nobody&#x27;s business, and it left horrible patches on \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; areas like my neck, the outside of my armpits, and inside my elbows and knees that made me look like a leper. I was thoroughly disappointed in this lotion and won&#x27;t use it again. I hate wasting products I spent good money on, so it pains me to throw this stuff in the trash, but I just don&#x27;t have a choice.</li>
    <li> I liked it but didn&#x27;t love it, used up the product but wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. It the job done but not as nice as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I was expecting to end up looking like a carrot that had rolled around in glitter. After two weeks of regular use, it wasn&#x27;t *quite* that bad, but the results were still disappointing. First of all, the application process is a pain. It takes forever to dry, and you have to awkwardly stand around with your arms and legs out to avoid messing up any spots. Even after careful application (I went the whole 9 yards each time, shower, shave, exfoliate, apply carefully, let dry), I still ended up with streaks and splotches. At first, I didn&#x27;t think the color was too bad, but I quickly realized that it turned me completely yellow. I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, but when I tan I turn brown, not yellow. So if you are looking for a natural appearing tan, keep looking. This product does not deliver. Not to mention the smell and glitter, which other reviewers have pointed out.</li>
    <li> Between this and Jergens natural glow, L&#x27;oreal is definitely superior.  It&#x27;s not streaky, my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange, and it doesn&#x27;t smell weird.  The smell is pleasant and not strong.  My skin feels smooth and it comes the closest to matching a natural tan - without the sun damage!  I don&#x27;t use it every day.  I use it perhaps every other day once I have the base color on.</li>
    <li> Did what it said! Loved it, the smell could be better but all tanning lotions smell haha This product shipped fast and I still have it and use months later. Very subtle glow and has a little sparkle to it so you look glowing and not overly orange and burnt.</li>
    <li> I like this product especially in winter when my skin is dry and pale as can be.  Applies evenly and does not leave an orange tint like other tinted moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love this. I am very light complected. I have always been very skeptical about using self tanner because of the orange color and streaking. I decided to give this a try and I love it. I have only been using it for about 4 days and I can see the difference. It looks natural. There is a little shimmer, but you do not notice it once it dries.</li>
    <li> The formula has been  changed! The smell has changed now it has the sunless tanner smell that other self tanners have. Very disappointed I have used this brand for years and now I am switching!</li>
    <li> Every day natural glow!!!</li>
    <li> Nice bronzing cream... just remember to spread evenly and wash off hands.. as I did not!</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; love the sparkling glow it gives your skin!</li>
    <li> I went to bed with it and dang it stunk, like that self tanner smell..i even woke up in the middle of the night due to the smell and had to showet immediately!! I&#x27;ll try using it during the day but not at night cus i need my sleep! As far as color i dunno, iv only used once so..</li>
    <li> I like the tan color of the L&#x27;oreal product better than Jergens and it smells better. I didn&#x27;t notice any sparkles but the L&#x27;oreal Bronzer has sparkles and looks streaky on me and the color is fake.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the best. Does not go on even and is hard to apply without a color guard. You have to wash your hands immediately (with a scrub) after applying. Leaves orange-ish bloches.</li>
    <li> For a \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; this is lacking. I would put this on at night after I showered and shaved my legs, and my legs would feel dry again in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent is superior to any other self-tanning product I&#x27;ve used, and I felt like it provided a nice, gradual tan that looked real! If you buy this strictly for the self-tanning properties, I&#x27;d so go for it, but as a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Just make sure to wash your hands as this does stain your fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried St. Tropez, Jergens, Neutrogena, and lots of other costly self tanners from Sephora. I like this better than everything else. The color is natural, it gives you a shimmery glow, the smell is tolerable and fades away in a reasonable amount of time. Those complaining about the smell, your not going to ever find a self tanner without an odor, and this is one of the mildest I&#x27;ve ever found. It dries quickly and moisturizes well. I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about this tanner lotion.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Works great! Not orange on my skin. a little sparkly..</li>
    <li> The only self tanner I use.  They are all orange-y if you ask me, but this one is less so than others I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Good price on Amazon!  Was paying more at a chain supply store.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a fan of gradual tanning lotions.  It seems some areas of the body turn out great while other areas (wrists, especially) just turn out looking bad and obviously fake. I may be applying to those areas wrong though, there are certain precautions you must take if you want this kind of stuff to work well. It&#x27;s totally worth trying for the money but just be super careful with the wrists and underarms and FEET.  Maybe mix it with a normal lotion for those areas or something like that, I always have to look up tips. I have such a hard time with the wrists and feet I swear.  I wish self tanning was easier</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good body moisturizer and tone enhancer, it provides a good skin tone when I mix this with the fair skin one.&lt;br /&gt;For very fair skin I suggest you mix the medium with the fair (equal amounts).</li>
    <li> I used this lotion everyday for almost one month and had a nice even brown tan. It is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. I also use it on a regular basis once I have a tan to keep my skin looking brown and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to wash your hands after or you will notice the color between your fingers.</li>
    <li> This is ok for the price but after it soaks in it stinks. I like how it slowly creates color but not happy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and I used to buy it locally at CVS but apparently they&#x27;ve discontinued or stopped selling it, so I knew I could count on Amazon to keep my skin moisturized and glowing! ;)</li>
    <li> Several years ago I decided to spend less time in the sun (getting older and want to avoid the whole skin cancer thing). But, pale legs and old age don&#x27;t always go hand-in-hand so I bought a tube of Jergens leg tanner, which I liked. This year, my sister suggested I try L&#x27;Oreal instead, so I did. But, after three months, and one used tube of L&#x27;Oreal, I am back to Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, in its defense, the L&#x27;Oreal does a nice job of browning your legs. By the second day I already noticed browner legs. And, the lotion goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the L&#x27;Oreal felt a bit \\&quot;greasier\\&quot; than the Jergens and, the biggest tie breaker for me...the smell There is a strong smell with this L&#x27;Oreal product that lingers all day. This smell was tolerable if I just browned my legs, but if I applied the lotion to my arms, I started sneezing and my nose felt irritated. So, back to Jergens.</li>
    <li> I used to use a DOVE product, that I LOVED, but they quit making it.  I was on the hunt for a self-tanner that worked fast, looked natural, non-spotty, and most importantly, without that horrible SMELL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t smell quite as GOOD as the Dove, but is much better than anything else out there I can find.  I&#x27;m very fair skinned, but this Medium tone is perfect and shows up after only one application.  Second application has me right where I want to be.  I mostly use it on my legs/feet, so I can wear my summer attire without blinding people.  Have also used on my arms, and worked well there, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great recommendations. As it was suggested in other reviews, I first use a bit of moisturizer on my knees and ankles. For each leg, I mix a dollup about a cm in diameter with the same amount of moisturizer. It does the trick to moisturize well and help conceal cellulite and veins.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t smear--even on very fair skin!  Definitely worth the cost of the product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! After even the first day of using it,  I noticed a glow! I am African American with a light complexion. I want to avoid UV ray damage to my skin, so I decided to look for a self tanner. I didn&#x27;t want a deep tan, just something that would make my skin glow. And I have found it! Yes, it is a bit glittery, but you can only tell in the sunlight. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It is a moisturizer that makes you look like you are tan.&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect for me (not a very white girl!).&lt;br /&gt;It is my second time buying this product and it helps a lot in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend! Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product for people who are not sun worshippers.  I used to be, but now the sun is too hot.  I have fair skin and this product works well on my skin.  I use it every day.  When ordering the Sublime Glow Daily did I see a lotion for the face???</li>
    <li> So happy to find a bulk purchase opportunity of this product since its started to disappear from local pharmacy shelves. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice color no horrible fake tan smell with a shimmery color upon application. Would definitely reccomed if you use self tanner</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin and needed a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; for the warm weather without getting too much exposure to the sun. This worked as I hoped with a small shade change each day when using it on a daily basis for a week. Continued use a couple times a week keeps the color constant.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for all fair skinned ladies out there. I am extremely pale, though the medium is perfect. My friends were shocked that I didnt have any orange streaks even using the medium. It really does simply look like I have been tanning. LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and will never look to another product.</li>
    <li> this is probably my favorite self tanner to date. I was using st. tropez for a long time but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.&lt;br /&gt;This one actually smells really good, and has the most subtle shimmer which is nice. My only complaint is that I wish it darkened a bit more. My skin is somewhat olive so I wish there was a darker option. Still, I give this a two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned, but the tanner does a fantastic job.It is not the least bit drying, in fact it is the opposite.</li>
    <li> I use this L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow all over including my face. It produces a natural looking glow to my face and body...I love it. I have used a ton of these products and I really like this one.</li>
    <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a mess... my wife likes to put it on while im at work and then lounge around the house naked so when i come home i see all this crap all over the place.</li>
    <li> This product has such a light smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. After just one application I noticed a  difference. No streaking at all!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely and smells nice (other brands make me smell like a wet dog)! The only drawback is that I do have to mix it with another moisturizer, as it does leave my ultra dry skin pretty dry. No big deal though.</li>
    <li> The glow is rather faint.  I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> does not work as well as Jergens</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It really works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave any of the nasty streaks of other self-tanners.</li>
    <li> I love Loreal Sublime glow. I use it every 2-3 days during the summer and it keeps me looking like I have a healthy glow. It has become one of my favorite moisturizers too. My husband will always seem to comment how soft my skin feels after I used it....great product</li>
    <li> This is very good product and I use it everyday and get many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It adds the necessary moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> This was great for adding a little color to my crazy pale skin without turning me orange. I don&#x27;t apply it every day because I think it would get too dark for my skin tone, but it&#x27;s great to apply every few days to keep a little color.</li>
    <li> Like it but wish it had sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this lotion online, since my local stores no longer carry it. It is like many other lotions like it, but I like it better than the others because it has a very subtle shimmer that people have actually noticed and complimented me on when I&#x27;ve worn it. It also has a very light scent, which I prefer to many of the heavier ones, which can give me headaches. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this self tanner in that it give me a nice color without looking orange. I like the gradual tanners like this as I am fairly pale and also pretty crappy with applying self tanner. With these type of gradual tanners I am much less likely to mess up. I think the color is great but as with most self tanners, I hate the smell.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin so soft and with the added benefit of a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; makes it even better....much better than Jergens</li>
    <li> I use this sunless tanner every single morning when I get out of the shower and I get so many compliments on my tan.&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves, because eventually your palms will tan, even when you wash your hands right after applying.</li>
    <li> Since I bought this, everyone comments on how great my skin looks, which has not happened in a long time.  The glow is very subtle.  I love this and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely HATE self-tanners but this product is AMAZING !! It is a wonderful moisturizer that gradually gives your skin a slow tan.  Absolutely no streaking and the color is perfect. NO orange at all. I will be using this product all summer. YAY</li>
    <li> This is my go to gradual self-tanner. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and in the summer I like to have a little color when I&#x27;m wearing shorts/tank tops. I&#x27;ve tried a few of the drug store type gradual tanning lotions and this is the best, in my opinion. It gives more of a brown glow as opposed to orange like many others. I exfoliate before I apply this to my legs by either shaving or using a scrub and I don&#x27;t get any streaks. If I don&#x27;t then, I will get a little patchy around knees and ankles. But with any tanner type product it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate. It&#x27;s a little shimmery but nothing too obvious and I really like the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect. And it&#x27;s the best smelling of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have olive-toned skin that tans easily and this product doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Plus, it smells really strong. I recommend the caribbean beach solutions self-tanning lotion. That actually worked and didn&#x27;t smell as bad.</li>
    <li> I put it on my face because I particularly like this color, there is absolutely no orange and you have control over the darkness, it is a really natural California Tan. Also, something I like about this is it&#x27;s like a super moisturizer, so if I put it on a bit before bed, give it an hour or so to really sink in, my skin is super moisturized and tan in the morning. That&#x27;s how I do it for best results.</li>
    <li> This works great............if your normal complexion makes you look like you&#x27;ve been embalmed . this will give you some color and it looks natural,,,,It really doesn&#x27;t over do it.People will not know your wearing something, they&#x27;ll just think you got a blood transfusion and finally got some color in your face.......&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> It stained my hands, took over a week to come out. Grrrr.</li>
    <li> This daily body moisturizer has a wonderful smell, leaves my skin smooth and glowing.  I use it year round and I am always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning product.  It&#x27;s the only tanning lotion with a fragrance I can stand.  It still has a fragrance, but I find it to be the mildest one.</li>
    <li> Works really well, even after one use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, have been using it almost daily for the past 10 days and after the first two times, I thought I&#x27;d wasted my money. Wasn&#x27;t expecting to be magically tanned by then, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin tone. Boyfriend said that he did notice that I had a little glow :-) After about 5 uses, where I&#x27;ve exfoliated in the shower, then put one layer on and let it air dry so my skin is just kind of tacky, then putting on another thin-ish layer, I have noticed that I do have what would be considered to be a good base tan, like a late spring tan. It&#x27;s nice!! I have medium olive skin when I spend an average amount of time outdoors but I get really pale in the winter months when I&#x27;m stuck in the house. At it&#x27;s best during the summer, my complexion is something I get tons of compliments on and is something I definitely pride myself on. Due to the fact that I have never used a tanning bed and don&#x27;t plan on it, ever; I&#x27;m looking forward to using this excellent self-tanner sparingly during the winter months to keep my &#x27;little glow&#x27;. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, though: A slight downside of the shimmering effects of this lotion is that once you put it on, it definitely can look pretty shimmery. Not exactly glittery, but there&#x27;s definitely a shimmer to it. Not so good if you don&#x27;t want it on your clothes or people you hug/come into close contact with who don&#x27;t want your leftover shimmer. Definitely a small downside compared to the great effects of this product. It&#x27;s a keeper. :-)</li>
    <li> Nice and subtle. It really does work to gradually create a subtle tan. I&#x27;m not in love with the scent, though.</li>
    <li> Amazing, keeps skin a nice tan color when in fall and winter months.  Smells a bit strong.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best tanning lotion I have tried. Apply just like body lotion but be thorough about it...you don&#x27;t have to spend 20 minutes making sure it&#x27;s perfect, just be a little more even and complete with your application than you would bother to be with regular lotion and be especially careful around the wrists and ankles. I even put this on my face and neck and it gives the perfect bronzed glow. I exfoliate in the shower before using it and I use it about every other to every third day and I am ALWAYS tan. The only thing is it does smell like that tanning bed smell...it&#x27;s not awful, but I find I have to wash my sheets twice as often and the scent can linger into the next day if you don&#x27;t shower in the morning. Still, this is the best out there.</li>
    <li> This product goes on easy and works well on my fair skin.</li>
