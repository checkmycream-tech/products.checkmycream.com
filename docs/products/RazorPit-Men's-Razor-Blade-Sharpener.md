      <li>For me, this is a win.</li>
      <li>You will be happy with this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely experienced shaver.</li>
      <li>But this product has great reviews so I must be using it incorrectly or something.</li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>Works great....</li>
      <li>Looks like someone took that denim strap idea and turned it into a product called The Happy Shaver.  </li>
      <li>It also works on my wife&#x27;s razor, which is great</li>
      <li>Like others have said, it maybe doesn&#x27;t sharpen the blades, but it cleans them and they feel great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>It works as described and is a great product to lengthen the life of your razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great buy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>While the blade no longer has the moisturizer and stuff on it, the blades still give me a great shave</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I use this to sharpen my blade every two or three shaves and it works great on my face.</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>This device is amazing!</li>
      <li>I know 25 uses isn&#x27;t that impressive when compared to the 100 claimed on the box, but even 25 is way better than the 9 to 12 I was getting before.</li>
      <li>I could not be more impressed.</li>
      <li>Forget the &amp;#34;dollar shave club&amp;#34; and electric razors, this is the best solution for sure.</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t gotten my brother-in-law&#x27;s to him (it&#x27;s on my to-do list), but both my Father and my Mother (it DOUBLES as an effective gift, because whoever you give it to, the sharer of their bathroom can use it too!)</li>
      <li>This is super-easy to use and well worth the money!!!!</li>
      <li>Its very easy to use and adds life to yr blades!</li>
      <li>Recommended by my good friend.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will keep looking for a good blade sharpener.  </li>
      <li>Good cost efficient gift.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t give you 150 good shaves</li>
      <li>Good for sharpening razors</li>
      <li>But, I had gotten 26 days out of the blade and the shave quality was good throughout.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I was already doing a good job cleaning my blades, but I have not noticed any difference using this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought it for all my close friends and they are equally delighted with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it one star, but I didn&#x27;t think it was fair without trying it with cartridges.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good.</li>
      <li>It looks good and not out of place in your shower, in your medicine cabinet, or on your vanity.</li>
      <li>There is a good review at &amp;#34;how to shave.</li>
      <li>So, I was dubious of the RazorPit claim that, used as instructed, it will enable over one hundred good, close shaves from one blade set.</li>
      <li>Even at that the blades are still good but the rest of the cartridge falls apart and it needs replaced.</li>
      <li>He loved it</li>
      <li>The price is fair.</li>
      <li>but I reckon I get twice the amount of use out of each blade which is for me really good and saved itself in about 5 weeks.</li>
      <li>On Harry&#x27;s blades it works really good.</li>
      <li>But it does help maintain your blade&#x27;s edge by, if nothing else, encouraging good razor maintenance habits</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It actually works!  I&#x27;d say after multiple shaves with the same razor I get about 90% as close a shave as with a brand new blade. I have at least gone 2 months and try to always sharpen after each shave with 10-12 strokes.  I have average facial hair growth (I can grow a beard, but not like zz Top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lowered my average shaving costs significantly thanks to this tool, and I was very skeptical at purchase.</li>
    <li> It does the job (or so reports my man!) It is saving money on the razor budget.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but the reviews swayed me. I get 3X the use out of my Harry&#x27;s disposable blades and the cleaning/sharpening process is both quick and easy. It&#x27;ll take about four months for the savings to pay for the cost of the product but I see no reason to indicate it won&#x27;t last longer than that. Good product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found it to be effective in keeping my razor blade sharper. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Will save you tons of money.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this product, and I would recommend it to my friends and anybody that wants to save money.</li>
    <li> this product works-- i usually get 3 good shaves from fusion cartridge- i just finished my 19th shave with the same cartridge - the last shave was as good as the first--the cost per shave has gone from 1.04 t0 0.15 and still going down--soon gillette will owe me money</li>
    <li> keeps razor blades sharp for much longer</li>
    <li> Did NOT sharped any of 10 razors... not worth the money..would not buy this ever again...save your money and just buy a new a razor.</li>
    <li> I, like other men, have been shaving for many years, and have come across a many products that promise a smooth shave or some kind of money saving advantage, and then there was the RazorPit. This device is incredible and will not only save you a lot of money, but give you a close comfortable shave time after time if you just spend a few seconds performing the razor cleaning process.  I have been using this product now for about a year and a half and it has saved me hundreds of dollars no matter what kind of razor I use. Currently I am using a disposable Mach3 and have probably gotten 40 primo shaves on it and still going. I bought mine on Groupon for 1/2 the price, bought a couple, wish I had bought a half dozen and given them out to all my men friends, Christmas, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product!! It will pay for its self in 6 months or less!!!</li>
    <li> I general dont like buying things like this cause they never really work.&lt;br /&gt;But i must say it seems that it does it job. I use disposable razors and so far each razor lasts about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since i&#x27;m asian (lol) i can&#x27;t grow thick beards or stashes and i shave usually every other day it might work for someone like me better where as someone that grows thick beards like a cheapet and has to shave everyday i can&#x27;t say this will work on someone like that.</li>
    <li> Someone finally had a good idea and made it happen, I use Gillette mach5 razors for my bald head and I&#x27;ve been using the same cartridge for over a month and it&#x27;s still sharp after using the razor pit, saves aloooooooooot of $, and everyone knows mach5&#x27;s cost</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing really works, improbable as it may seem.  This is no snake-oil product!  I get many more high-quality shaves out of my four-blade refills.  Many of us try to stretch the useful life of our refills because they have become so ridiculously expensive.  Remember when Gillette used to give you the razor free?; they could afford to because the real profit was in  the endless, repeat sale of the blades.  Now, baby, we get nothing for free and the razor companies make profits that are killing us.  And, because the blades are so expensive, sometimes we use them when they are past retirement age just to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This black rubbery thing is a convenient, easy to use piece of plastic/rubber/miracle material (who knows what?) that is as low-tech as you can get.  You basically just run your razor over it a few times and BANG! your blade is restored to almost new sharpness and comfort.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve at least doubled the life of my blades since using this gadget.  I keep it in my shower and sharpen my razor right before I shave -- piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent investment in blade life -- and COMFORT!  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought one, believe me!  As far as those old-fashioned razors they advertise on TV now, and one I bought through Duluth, they can&#x27;t compare with the improved comfort of the multi-blade razors, in my opinion.  And, if you wanted to, you could sharpen those double-edge blades on the RazorPit, too.  But with this gadget, you&#x27;ll save money on your multi-blade refills so that you won&#x27;t have to resort to a less comfortable shave just to save money.  I also now use the Shave Secret Oil, which is better than any of the Edge-type shaving products I&#x27;ve tried; better shave, fewer nicks.</li>
    <li> Good product, no problems with seller, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Product sharpens blades when used on regularly basis.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. I shave every two or three days. I use a Gillette 5 blade razor, and would typically get 4 or 5 shaves out of one blade set, after which shaving became uncomfortable and irritating. So, I was dubious of the RazorPit claim that, used as instructed, it will enable over one hundred good, close shaves from one blade set. I got about eighty, after which the blades began pulling on hairs rather than cutting them. But, I&#x27;m not complaining! A little over five months of not changing a blade isn&#x27;t to be laughed at, especially not by the razor blade companies.</li>
    <li> Extends life of razor about 5 times through my experience</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. I shave my head and was going through razors every week at $20 for 4 razors. I now have a razor last for at least 3 months or longer. Love it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I&#x27;m thinking WOW.  This ought to make my super-expensive blades last much, much longer.  Well...not really.  I mean yes, I suppose that it does offer somewhat of an advantage in that it does keep the razor blades super clean, free of gunk and buildup and therefore they should last a bit longer and feel sharper.  I do notice somewhat of a difference, but it isn&#x27;t a startling difference - like you experience when going from a 3 week old blade to a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it does work to some degree.  I definitely get a bit longer out of my disposable blades - perhaps several days or a week longer.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to start magically making your blades last for months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the RazorPit for some time now and already I see its value.  The blade I was using was ready to be replaced.  I decided to see how well it could be resurrected with the RazorPit.  I&#x27;m still using the same blade and it&#x27;s not even close to giving up its ghost. FWIW, I highly recommend the RazorPit and will purchase it for Christmas presents for various progeny.</li>
    <li> I HATE how much money I&#x27;ve spent on razor blades in the past.  I have thick facial hair so most razors only last me 5-8 days.  Since using this product, my blades have been lasting my 5-8 weeks!  A single pack of razor blades now lasts my months, not days.  I&#x27;ve already bought these for friends and family, and they love them, best money saver I&#x27;ve founding a long time!</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS GREAT CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE MORE PEOPLE HAVEN&#x27;T HEARD ABOUT IT.</li>
    <li> I challenge anyone to take any two fusion blades and sharpen one everyday with the sharpener and cut one side of the face and cut the other half of your face with an un-sharpened blade.  I promise you will not see a difference. Waste of money. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I can use it to rest my blade.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have been using the same blade for more than a month since purchasing this.  You will be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical of this product when I ordered it.  But it had mostly glowing reviews and I was tired of paying for new razor blades every couple of weeks.  I had used it as described and now have over a month additional use of a blade that I was about to discard.  It rinses off easily and is made of silicone rubber so the water runs off it.  The holder for the razor keeps it drained and dry so that the blade doesn&#x27;t corrode as quickly (a significant contributor to blade dulling).  This little device will easily earn back the purchase price in fewer razor blades purchased over the next few months.</li>
    <li> The Razor Pit is worth every penny i spent. My husband and i just love it this is not a gimmick it really does work</li>
    <li> This razor strop works as advertised. I have been using one for 2 years now. I shave my face and head every 2-3 days. I used to get 3-5 shaves out of a razor. Using the RazorPit, I go months using the same razor. I lose count of how many shaves I get. Sometimes, I simply use a new razor to get a new lube strip. The razor is always still sharp well after the lube strip has run out of lube.&lt;br /&gt;Tips for use: always start AND finish your shave by stropping the razor. The idea behind this product is keeping the gunk from building up on the blade and thus effectively dulling it. The RazorPit does not actually sharpen the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, look at this product from the standpoint that every shave you have is like shaving with a smooth new razor. The cost savings is a side benefit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say whether or not this works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt my razor any.</li>
    <li> the Jury is still out on this product for me.  The types of razors I use have a glide stripe that may be damaged by the sharpener, but so far I think it will at least double the life of a blade making it worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I did not find this extended razor life as advertised.  Seems just the same to me and doesn&#x27;t do anything a little hot water wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for over a year. It works wonderful.  I love it. One time I used the same razor for 4 whole months. Best money I ever spent&lt;br /&gt;As long as you use this after every use, you can get a long use out of your razor. Even the expensive $10 razors, they can last a long time</li>
    <li> This product does not work! At no point have any of the razor blades we have tried gotten any sharper so they could be reused. I bought this for my fiance and tried it as well. We were both annoyed at how much money we had to pay for razors so I thought this was a perfect solution. However, it does not seem that it improved any razors we tried. I did however receive it quickly and it looked just like the picture.</li>
    <li> ... because it works, but just a little.</li>
    <li> doesnt do much IMO. it helps clean the razor a little bit but doesnt SHARPEN it per se, just start buying your razors from Harry&#x27;s and youll be set.</li>
    <li> Does the job but need to see if it continues to do so.</li>
    <li> its been a few good months since ive purchased this item. As it turns out, im using the same razors 3 times a week. I used a gillete powered fusion then a double bladed bic for the upward strokes (baby soft). Both are sharpened prior to use and both work like brand new. Im sure by the time I hit the year mark of owning this item it will have paid for itself and reduced landfill by a grocery bags full. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great. Keeps my blades sharper longer. I shave my head every few days and I&#x27;ve been using the same blades for up to a month. Pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised. I followed the instructions on the package and did as it said and my razor got just as dull as if I never used it. What a scam. Certainly not worth the money. I made the mistake of throwing away the package so I had no way to return it otherwise I surely would have.</li>
    <li> This is not a sharpener. It is a rubber item that is supposed to clean your blades of debris so they work better. I can clean it just fine myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a piece of rubber, but it does the trick. I&#x27;ve gotten months of daily shaving from one blade using the RazorPit. Without it, blades would start feeling very dull within a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical and I was skeptical about this as well but it really works.  The name, I think, is misleading as it does not sharpen the blade but simply cleans it so it stays sharper longer.  I used to get 2-3 shaves out of a shaving head before I&#x27;d replace it when it started pulling the stubble instead of cutting it.  I&#x27;ve long since worn the blue lube strip off from the shaving head and it&#x27;s still going strong.  It&#x27;s been over two months since I started using this and the blade still feels like new.  Just read the directions and do it properly and you&#x27;ll save on razors.</li>
    <li> not sure how this works but it does thats all that really matters to me worth the money for it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect with such a wide range of reviews of this device. Admittedly many reviews that intrigued me were positive. So I bought it. WOW! Quite frankly I&#x27;m amazed.  It REALLY DOES WORK. I&#x27;m a retired engineer and I only shave every other day now.  But, since using the RazorPit for about a month now I&#x27;ve gotten about 15 excellent shaves from one Schick Quattro Titanium Cartridge Refill.  Now, there is one thing.  I&#x27;ve noticed that rather understandably, using the RazorPit changes the pitch (angle) of the blades. They blades don&#x27;t quite have the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; they come with from the factory.  That&#x27;s not to say that they don&#x27;t shave close or very well.  You have to repeat some strokes and press a little harder to replicate the closeness/feel of the factory shave. At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found in my use of the RazorPit.  Each brand like Gillette for instance arranges the position and pitch of their multiple cartridge blades a little different the other guy.  Gillette Mach 3 cartridges from the factory more closely resemble the blade pitch of the post sharpened Quattro&#x27;s - a few degrees more of an angle.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve preferred the Quattro&#x27;s over the Gillette&#x27;s because it takes me less strokes for a close shave.  So, I&#x27;ve added a few more strokes for the same shave as an original factory Quattro but, I&#x27;ve already save $6.00 or $9.00 for the 2 or 3 cartridges I didn&#x27;t have to buy!  I do the extra few strokes any day to save that money per month.</li>
    <li> Seems to be making a difference but too soon to say how much.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a tentative 4 stars as it worked very well the first time out. Long term we will see. I get blades from the Dollar Shave Club and start the new blades on Sunday, the last shave on Friday. That Friday shave can send me to work with random nicks and redness, even on Thursday the blades start to tug a bit. The Sharpener showed up yesterday (Thursday) and it was immediately put to use. Today&#x27;s shave wasn&#x27;t like a brand new blade, but it was better that yesterday&#x27;s. If I can get even an extra week out of a blade this sharpener will pay for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. It simply does exactly what it should. Provide a clean sharp razor, for a good shave!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I shaved last night with the same razor blade which I have been using every other day for 3 weeks; almost as good as new.  Note: some reviews did mention that the lubricating strip will wear out before the blade does, which is true, but the product does not claim that that will not happen; to be expected.  BTW -- aside from keeping the blades really sharp and clean, the unit acts as a great little cradle for the razor.  I would buy 10 of these, but all I need is one!  Absolutely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but the cost of blades persuaded me to try this RazorPit. It works precisely as advertised. Easy to use, light, and just plain great.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expections.  I have using the same trac3 blade for 4 weeks, only skipped 4 days.  My wife used it on her deposable venus and said better than a new blade, my granddaughter agreed.  I will be ordering 3 more for the rest of the family.  Will worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This has extended the life of my razors literally ten fold!</li>
    <li> I been using them on my mach 3 razors, they tend to last 6-8 weeks. Does not work so well on my cheaper shaving club razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for over three weeks now with no problems at all. I use this to sharpen my blade every two or three shaves and it works great on my face. I&#x27;m going to see exactly how long that blade will last.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and remember to have soap foam or shave cream generously-spred on sharpener surface before each pass.</li>
    <li> Since I got it a month ago, my husband is still using the same blade!!  It&#x27;s like a smaller version of the old straight edge straps that barbers used to us.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> but havent used it long enough to really tell if the blade is staying sharp...it seems to be working better than not using anything...the claim is 150 shaves with one razor which seems to be a pretty high number.  I use this in conjunction with cleaning the blades with alcohol and then storing the blade in baby oil to keep it rust free</li>
    <li> Works great, bought extra for Father Day gifts.</li>
    <li> It works great on some blades but on fusion blades it does do much. On Harry&#x27;s blades it works really good.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it makes for a better second and third shave but not convinced it is the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product t was advertised to be in the ads.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He saw this on the &amp;#34;I WANT THAT&amp;#34; TV show.  We didn&#x27;t by any special solutions to use with it.  He uses a gel razor type cream and says it works fine.</li>
    <li> Does the job, every shave is sharp. Saved a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;Yet, product price can be cheaper as it is only a rubber case.</li>
    <li> I was going through a couple blades per week now I have been able to go for about 2 months between changing blade it is not a sharpener as much as it helps to clean and hone the blade kinda like a knife hone does it straightens the blades and cleans them I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product about a year ago.  And since, I have used it on several types of blades from Gillette fusion, to cheaper Gillette blades, Harry&#x27;s baldes, and Bic blades.  I haven&#x27;t found this product to match waht it said it will do let alone re-sharpen the blade.  In my opinion, it simply takes down the knicked bladed edges and allows for the blades to be used maybe 3-5 more times as a sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It by no means re-sharpens the blade (in my experience) and simply repairs a blade for marginal more use.  Instead of buying this I would check out cheaper blade options before buying this product.  I have not found it worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HZ</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the razor pit.  I paid $25 for mine.  I figured I have lost $25 dollars more than once so why not lose it again? For me? This product works. 1.1.2015 to 5.26.2015.  Same razor I have been using is all I can say.  It will not sharpen your razor like when you first cracked open the pack. But it cleans and aligns the razor back  to being able to shave again. I use a Schick Hydro 5. And it&#x27;s been good so far.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will go but I am experimenting. Some razor&#x27;s may not work as well, I do have others I am going to put through the test.  From what I gather through comments I believe it depends on how corse ones hair is, what kind of blade, how many times one shaves etc.  I shave about every other day to two days. You have to play with it. I notice doing it with too much pressure does not work as well.  There is an in between soft and hard that does work.  Almost months. Even if some one gets an extra week out of it. If you do the math it&#x27;s more than before. I will run it 50 time I&#x27;ve even went 200 times. I may not have had too. But it works for me.  if you are impatient this product is not for you. experimenting it&#x27;s the only way to find out how it will work for you. And @ 5 months almost for 1 razor? I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> This will keep you from buying expensive razors. If you are like I am and have to buy razors often, this is for you. We all know how expensive razor can be. Buy this sharpener and save.</li>
    <li> I bought this on all the positive comments. I was hoping this would be the answer to saving from buying expensive razors. I have no idea how people can say that this product works. I found it dulls the blades. It does clean the blades I guess, but sharpen no way.</li>
    <li> i bought this thinking it probably would not really work well.  WRONG.  It does work.  Works very well. SO, to prove it, I set up a semi scientific test.  I use the Gillette Sensor 3 blade razors.  I have been using these since they hit the market.  maybe 15 years or so.  And always about 10-12 day lifespan. I shave almost every day.  Skipping a day here and there on weekends or even a midweek day if I can get away with it.  After that they get a bit dull and start to pull and drag a bit.  So, I made a note of the day I changed blades.  And after every shave, and before every shave, I would give the razor 5-10 strokes on the RazorPit.  I did this religiously.  at 12 days in the shave was really no different from day 1.  Day 16, 18, 20 still very very good shave.  No dragging or pulling noticed. After about 22 or 24 days of use i think i started to notice a bit of dulling.  But still a pretty good shave.  On Day 28 I decided to change blades and compare to the priors days shave.  And the difference was noticeable but not a night and day difference.  So, it was time to change.  But, I had gotten 26 days out of the blade and the shave quality was good throughout.  Since this experiment, I have been less meticulous about using the razorpit before and after every shave.  Nowadays, I will give my razor a few licks every other time.  Or maybe every third shave, and am still getting a great extension in useful razor lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, this is a very useful product.  It does exactly what it say it will do.  So, if you want to stretch your shaving dollar, then an investment in this item will let you do just that!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot! It actually works!</li>
    <li> My guy has always complained about the high cost of razors. I was skeptical, seeing mixed reviews, but I am happy to report that after one month, he gives it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I shave using Gillette Proglide Fusion Power. I am one of those types who only shaves with a blade for 4 uses before I toss it. I like a sharp blade and I feel it helps avoid any razor bumps. I purchased this item not expecting much out of it. I use it as directed after every shave am I am very pleased with the fact I can now get about 8 shaves out of the same blade. For me, this is a win. I can  double the usage of my blade. I can probably shave with the same blade even longer but I can feel the blade getting a little dull during the 8th shave the same way it was feeling before during the 4th shave and I just dont want to risk it. Since my blades cost me $2.50 per blade, I will break even after using just 5 blades. On another note, I dont find rubbing shaving cream on the sharpener to be as effective as just using body wash. I get a much smoother glide and feel like I am doing a better job of &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; the blade of debris and microscopic cells.</li>
    <li> He shaves more than an average guy and goes through razors like crazy.  He found this little sharpener really does work and yes-- he will reorder.</li>
    <li> Works great. I used it on a razor that I was ready to toss and ended up using the same razor for at least 20 or so shaves.</li>
    <li> It works.  I have even hear my husband recommend it to a friend! It really extends the life of your razor.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY WORKS!  I expect to drop my razor costs by at least half, and still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> i use this to (a) protect the razor blade when in my drawer and (b) to sharpen the blade.  the 5-blade gillette blades are expensive, but with the razor pit i can get more than 2 weeks out of each blade.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He says he gets an extra week out of his blades. Hey . . . that is worth it! Those blades are expensive!</li>
    <li> No worky no likey.......didnt work for us.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I was skeptical about the RazorPit when I first saw it.  Based on the many positive reviews and because I got it on sale, I gave it a shot.  The item quickly came and when I unwrapped it, it looked like a razor holder and feels like rubber although it is made of a dense silicone.  The directions are simple enough; after each time you shave you run the blade upward on the RazorPit surface (with some shaving cream to help it slide) several times and you are done.  The process takes about five seconds.  This process apparently cleans the blades and removes any deposits left on the blade head, which actually prolongs the life of the blade and keeps it feeling almost new for quite some time.  To my amazement, my personal results were as follows:&lt;br /&gt;I shave 5-6 days a week and prior to the RazorPit would get about two weeks (10-12 shaves) out of a cartridge.  Now after using the RazorPit I get about 2 months out of a cartridge (40-48 shaves). With the Fusion blades I use costing $4/each, that is a $80 yearly savings!&lt;br /&gt;Even if your mileage varies a bit and you use different cartridges or get a few more/less shaves out of a cartridge, this item will still pay for itself in a few months time.  It is kind of a no brainer; my wife even uses this to extend the life of and increase the comfort of her pink razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: Use this thing from the first time you replace a cartridge; do not wait until your blade is feeling old because this product does not sharpen a dull blade, it will however help maintain a cartridge and keep it from feeling dull.  This is one of the best product purchases I have ever made on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: ...It has been over a year later and I still love this thing. I have been toiling with the idea of chucking my Fusions and going full time snobby, old school single blade but the Razorpit kind of negates the financial benefit of doing that. Plus I figure there has got to be something to the research into creating these multi-blade cartridges because I get a close, nick free shave just about every time...even when I am shaving half asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/2016: This thing keeps impressing me.  Still works as good 2+ years later. Still increasing the lifespan of my cartridges by ~400%.</li>
    <li> This sharpened my razors very well, to the point they almost felt like new. Easy to use and very handy. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job. I haven&#x27;t been using it that long but my razor has definitely given me more uses</li>
    <li> I shave my beard and my head.. Usually the Mach III Superglide will last me three times max.. after which it becomes irritatingly dull. After I started using the RazorPoit Sharpener, I shaved for the 8th time with the same blade today as good as I shaved with it the first time. This tool will save you money on the long run. I pass it on with the shaving lather left over from my shave then rinse and then rub it few times with water only.. It slips much less with no shaving foam but I tell you it makes the blades super sharp. I blow the water off then park the razor vertically. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second RazorPit.  I received my 1st one for Christmas, and I needed a second one.  I change blades about every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save money on buying new blades this is the product that you want</li>
    <li> As someone with a very rough stubble, I can hardly if ever use a blade for more than 6 shaves. Now you can imagine how expensive my shaves are - considering I use Gillette proglide power.&lt;br /&gt;For yonks, I&#x27;ve had to absorb that cost but this nifty little product has changed everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a month now and I have more than recovered my cost already! I had some blades that I was about to throw away and, so far, I have been able to successfully reuse them. I estimate that this improves the shaves by 3 or 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT - NOW!!</li>
    <li> I am giving this three stars because I am assuming the issue is not with the product but with how I use it. For me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharpening my blades at all. In fact, they seem more dull than they usually are over time. But this product has great reviews so I must be using it incorrectly or something. I read the instructions that came with it but I guess I missed a crucial step. That, or it really doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Best product so far this year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan G</li>
    <li> This razor blade restorer really works. It makes the blades last much longer and will pay for itself in just a few weeks .  I have not had to use a new blade for over a month.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my better half.  He has thick beard and was going through a razor each week if not more.  At this point he is still using the same Gillette Fusion razor from Christmas day.  Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I think it actually extends the razor life by another two weeks. Not bad at all</li>
    <li> first time I used it wow what a difference. I am already seeing savings with this product, would recommend it to anyone you have to get used to using it pressure is the key.</li>
    <li> The razor pit has doubled the life of my gillette razors. The $20 spent on this item will save me $80 thru a year easily.</li>
    <li> D/h says really works!</li>
    <li> The RazorPit extends the life of each razor by at least double. I use it before shaving and it shaves as if it is a new razor.  Will pay for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same razor blade for two months now. Everytime I shave I used this product as directed. Works awesome.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical if this device would really work but I&#x27;m now 100% sold. I used to get only 2 weeks out of a blade and now I have been using the same blade for at least 5 weeks and it still works great even after not shaving for 2 days. I have not figured out yet how long a blade will last with regular use of the RazorPit. This is going to save me a lot of money on blades.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it; one of his best close-shave ever! I can&#x27;t believe this product is not advertised everywhere, it really works!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas present to my husband. He has been using it for over a year and it has def. cut down on the need to purchase so many blades. It&#x27;s been a real money saver but it&#x27;s only as good as you using it. You must keep up with cleaning the blade after each shave.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for better, but its adequate, I guess. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to do what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this but honestly I think its a waste of time. I have tried it many times and did not see any difference</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. One start reduction for not bundling with a storage / carrying case. Have been using for 5 weeks - not changed the blade yet. Like it.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times on a Fusion Power razor with limited success. The surface feels like rubber to the touch and behaves like rubber when plied. No idea how the tiny imperfections in the razor blades are smoothed out using a rubber surface.</li>
    <li> It is very satisfying to purchase an item that you knew nothing about and then put it to the test and it does exactly as advertised. This product actually works and is worth every penny of its cost. I love it because it does sharpen a razor blade so that it can be used again instead of throwing it away. Now i have a pack of 16 Fusion Proglide refills that are just sitting. I bought this after the fact. If only i had known.</li>
    <li> This product is made to save you money. There is no fancy gimmick about it. Once you clean your blades, you can use it for a good shave. I try to clean my blades every other day. That way they remain sharp as you shave. I really enjoy using it. One thing I want to mention is that you have to clean your blades often in order for them to remain sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate on this product, I have been using the same blade for the about 45 days without any issues. I do wonder how long will they remain sharp. We will see.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and save a buck.</li>
    <li> Made next to no difference in my blade performance. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am able to get several more weeks out of my razors, but nothing close to 90%. It is probably closer to doubling the life expectancy.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly as it states. I&#x27;ve not had to buy new blades for sometime now. Would reccomend to anyone looking to save money buy extending the time between purchasing new razor blades.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He was sceptical but so far he is very pleased. Just hope it continues to perform as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since September, and it really is a genius product. It literally takes less than 20 seconds to prepare, use, and clean. It will last forever, no doubt. I shave every 2-4 days, and I think I&#x27;m on my 4th blade over the course of 8 months... this really does show that blades essentially only get &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; because of crud that collects at the leading edges. This device wipes the edges clean to a polished like-new surface with just 5 swipes. Now, the reason to switch blades is when the lubricating strip wears away. Forget the &amp;#34;dollar shave club&amp;#34; and electric razors, this is the best solution for sure. Use your favourite razor without overspending on blades. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> Followed directions on how to sharpen razor blades but could not. I even had someone else read the directions and still no positive results.</li>
    <li> I usually change my razor blade after three weeks. I&#x27;m going on my ninth week on this razor blade right now.  Every three days, I run my razor across the razor pit.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for close a year.  I shave eveyday in that time I have only had to change my double edge razor blade twice.  Need to use on your blade just before you shave to maintain a sharp razor.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The RazorPit does give me twice as many shaves on a blade.  They say it will give you 100 shaves, and that is complete nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe you get double the shaves after you use the blade sharpener.  It does save you money and it&#x27;s easy to use. I can get about 20 shaves instead of 10 before I change blades.  It is still worth the money and does pay for itself, but don&#x27;t hope to get the exaggerated shaves the box claims.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband, figuring we would give it a try and he is always complaining about dull razors and his skin breaking out. Well hes been using the same blade for several months and no breakouts! he loves it. such a money saver</li>
    <li> Works exactly like you hope it would.  Simple as that.  This thing is rubber but it&#x27;s not poorly made or sticky or tacky in the wrong ways.  It works perfectly for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  These guys deserve to get rich.</li>
    <li> I have used the same razor blade for 26 days and still going strong. The savings significant because of the high price of razor blades</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Does NOT sharpen blades - if anything makes blade sharpness ( if any) uneven witch makes shaving unpleasant  - wanted it to work, it didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> works as described. WOW!. using mach 3 turbo blade for third week so far. I generally replace a blade at 10 days. i clean  after each use with liquid body wash instead of shaving cream. have suggested product to several people. considering buying gillette fusion pro blades and see if same great results.</li>
    <li> The price of this thing is nothing compared to the cost of those razors, which are the best ones I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Actually chewed my blades up faster than if i didn&#x27;t use it. Disappointed in the product. Save yourself the money</li>
    <li> I was looking for a razor SHARPENER so I bought this despite some of the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really just a big piece of good quality rubber.  You apply some shaving gel or rub soap on the surface of the product until it lathers up, then run the razor back and forth 4-10 times depending on how you feel that day, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that every time you run the razor down it, you have to put some of the shaving gel or soap back on the surface to use the product effectively.  I just put my razor in the used shaving gel and run it again until I feel satisfied my razor is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap:  I really think it is not sharpening your blade per se, but rather cleaning all the gunk off and polishing the blades with every pass on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product once I figured out how it actually worked, but wished the product description was changed to reflect what it actually did.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I shave every morning with a 5 blade Gillette Fusion razor. I used to go through 1 blade every two weeks at best before I started nicking my skin. I now go through 1 blade every two months (one blade lasted one week shy of four months)! Gillette should buy this company and put them out of business ;-)</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when this thing arrived in the mail. For starters, it&#x27;s not really a sharpener at all. It&#x27;s a blade cleaner. So looking at what is essentially a rubber brick, I felt a little bit scammed. But upon using it, all I can say is that I was incredibly wrong. I shave 2-3 times a week on course hair and I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for over 3 months! The amount of money this product will save over the course of a year is amazing. It also works on my wife&#x27;s razor, which is great (she wasn&#x27;t sure it would due to the gel strips that are attached). It&#x27;s crazy to think of all those dull blades I&#x27;ve been throwing away that only needed to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommended. A must have.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, should have realized how stupid I was to buy it before I got it. Threw it out after a few days of attempting to see some kind of improvement in my razor.</li>
    <li> This has got to be a new world record.  I received the Razorpit about 6 month ago and I placed a brand new Gillette Profusion blade in my razor that same day to gauge how much longer this product will extend my razor&#x27;s life.  Now, I don&#x27;t shave every day (every other day) so my razors usually last longer than most guys.  However I still usually find myself replacing them every month or so.  However today is the day I replaced the razor blade I put on my razor six month ago.  Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth the price.  I&#x27;ve already got back my investment as I would have had to purchase a new 5 pack ProFusion just about now which is about the same price as the RazorPit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product.  Looks good, simple, and works flawlessly.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.  Even breathes new life into old blades!</li>
    <li> I READ ABOUT A FEW OF THESE DIFFERENT SHARPENERS AND WAS SKEPTICAL....BUT IT REALLY WORKS AND I AM IMPRESSED. IT IS SIMPLE TO USE AND CLEAN UP; DOESN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT PERFORMS AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but with the soaring cost of razors I made the purchase. It works great.  Blades last for months. Great idea!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months now and am still on the same blade I figure that I have gotten about 25 shaves (lost count at about 18) out of one Gillette Mach III cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I also have changed the way I store the razor between shaves by drying it out and letting it soak in baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby oil will limit corrosion and that might be why I have gotten so many shaves out of one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;If I feel it getting dull I just lap it 5-6 times on the Razor Pit and it works like new.</li>
    <li> I was interested but skeptical so I added this to my wishlist and someone purchased it for me as a present.  This works incredibly well.  At one point I had shaved half my face and had several nicks and cuts.  I used the RazorPit before shaving the other half of my face and had a clean smooth shave with no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I got this razor sharpener delivered over the weekend and just had to try it for my Monday morning shave.  I use the Mach 3 Turbo razor blades which are about $2.50 each.  I normally get maybe 5 shaves from a razor.  To test this sharpener, I found a very old blade that I had not thrown away. This blade was so bad there was no way I could possibly use it.  I followed the simple directions and then tried out the old blade.  It worked great!  It was not as good as a brand new blade, but it was definitely usable.  I&#x27;d estimate it felt the same as a normal blade I had already used twice.  Not brand-new sharp, but definitely still usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the sharpener will work even better on new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!  It will pay for itself in a few months&#x27; time!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it could do anything. Its flimsy and very cheap looking. I gave it a shot and followed the directions. After a few time my razors cut like brand new. I was very impressed. Its an item worth having.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this with new blades yet,  I wanted to see if it actually resurrected blades that I was about to throw out,  and it did,  it didn&#x27;t make them &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34;  but I was able to use them significantly longer.  That alone makes it a worthwhile purchase,  will save my 5 star rating for when I&#x27;ve used on new blades.</li>
    <li> I always wondered if this product worked as advertised because almost all the reviews I have read implied that it does.  I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. It does a great job!  This product is made of rubber, and what it does is clean the blades. It does an excellent job maintaining the blades sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important to note that this item does not \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; the blade.  It is a soft yet rigid rubbery material that aids in cleaning your blade only.  For people that shave and just throw their blade back in the cabinet here are two ways you could make your blade last longer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Buy this product and use as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Wipe your blade off with a rag, quickly blow it dry, and store so water does not leak to the blade during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of the above methods work just as well to extend the life of the blade.  I have been doing the second method for years (and suspect many do similar) and get 1.5 - 2 months out of most blades.  If you would rather wipe on a rubber surface than a rag then this product does the job.  My only beef was in buying this thinking it had some kind of sharpening ability, only to find out it is nothing of the sort.</li>
    <li> 8 weeks with the same Gillette Fusion blade!! Still going strong! There does not appear to be an end in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s 10 weeks with the same Gillette Fusion blade! Still going strong! One thing that I also do is pat dry the blade after shaving. I am amazed!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband on the chance that it actually worked the way it said it would.  IT DOES!!!  My husband has sensitive skin and usually would only get a few shaves out of each $5 Mach 3 Turbo blade before he would have to throw them away.  He would go for a week at a time without shaving to save money and because shaving hurt his skin due to even slightly dull blades.  Now he can shave for a month or more using the same blade!  He now shaves more often and we spend so much less on razor blades!  He says that when he sharpens the blades they are often sharper than they were when they were first purchased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RazorPit looks just like a regular razor stand made out of black rubber - if you didn&#x27;t know it was a sharpener you would just think it was something to rest your blades on.  There is no obvious stone or metal in the pit where you sharpen the blade, it is all just made of a sort of matte looking black rubber.  You operate it by putting a little shaving cream on it, and rubbing your razor blade across the surface a few times.  My husband had no trouble with learning to use it at all, it is pretty straightforward and as far as we can tell, there is no way to screw it up.  We have been using it for about 9 months now (since July 2013) and it has not lost any effectiveness.  At this time, I see no reason to believe it will ever wear out.  It seems very well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got one for my brother for his birthday too and would highly recommend this to anyone who shaves.  It makes shaving so much cheaper and more comfortable.  Admittedly we have ONLY used it on Mach 3 blades (as a woman, I use these too on my legs), so I can&#x27;t vouch for its ability to sharpen other types of razor blades.  Really, we are completely satisfied with it - I still can&#x27;t believe it works!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working pretty good for now, but I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely everything they advertised it to be.  Very satisfied. Purchased it as a gift for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a joke. I used a mach 3 blade for six months! I am not laughing anymore, this thing really works!</li>
    <li> Sometimes the most simple of objects are the most useful. This has been an investment that has paid for itself. I shave my head and face and my razor life has gone well over 100% what it used to without  using this. This is one of the best investments you can make in shaving. I know you look at it and think how can this block of rubber do anything for my razor. Well it works and extends your multi blade razors life. I have and will recommend this item to anyone I know. By the way this would also work for the ladies out in the world and extend the life of woman&#x27;s razors too. So everyone look at this and know even if it looks like a simple concept it works!</li>
    <li> The men in my life didn&#x27;t expect this Christmas gift.  They are using it, but it is still too early to tell if this gadget will increase the life of the blade.  It&#x27;s an experiement in the making!</li>
    <li> We all know how much we despise forking out almost $20 for 4 razor blade refills.  This product allows you to get your moneys worth out of each one.  I was very skeptical that something this simple would actually work, but it does!  When it first arrived, I put a new blade on the razor and used this product after every use as instructed.  That blade lasted over 3 months before I needed to replace it, and I am am an every-other-day shaver.  If you are skeptical, as I was, believe me that this product does work and it pays for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t know whether this product actually works as advertised, but will get to that later. A few days after I received my order the company sent me an automated email (which they seemingly send to everyone who buys this) offering me a free surprise if I leave a good review on Amazon. This makes me suspicious of every positive review on here. I would have returned the product had I only kept the original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post back after I use it for long enough to see if it actually works. It seems like it&#x27;s just a cheap piece of rubber so I&#x27;m skeptical.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this, but I hate paying for razors, so I bought it.  I thought it was just going to be a hone, but it wasn&#x27;t, it is a rubber type product. It is more of a cleaning block than sharpener, which makes sense, because my facial hair shouldn&#x27;t chip or dull a metal blade. When you push it across it dislodged all the hair and shaving cream that gets stuck in between the blades. when I first used this I it was on a blade that I&#x27;d used three or four times, and I ran it across and it was like New again.  The directions say you only have to push it across like three times, but I do it until it looks clean. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I opened the Razor Blade from the packaging. A piece of plastic that I slide my razor on? But it actually works on my Mach 3s. I used to get 3 shaves per blade; now I get over 15. Another thing I do to prolong blade length is dry the blade off with a towel after I do my shower shave and keep the blade dipped in a cup of pure mineral oil (not Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil). This combined with the Razor Blade is giving me 500 percent more blade life, a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My combination of the Razor Blade RazorPit and the mineral oil is working better than I had thought: About 20 shaves between switches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a piece of rubber. I don&#x27;t notice a difference. Its probably wearing away my nice razors that provide me a soothing finish and completely defeating the purpose.</li>
    <li> Before using RazorPit, I was happy if I got 3 shaves from the very expensive Gillette cartridges. And the third shave was always difficult and wound inflicting. I&#x27;ve just finished my fifth shave on one Gillette cartridge while using RazorPit. The fifth shave felt as sharp and close as the first.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get at least 1 more shave from this blade cartridge.  I&#x27;ll probably try to get up to 8 shaves total, from this one.  I completely agree with the other 4 and 5 star reviews of this product.  Buy this and save money on shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this gadget on a whim when it popped up while getting some shaving lotion for my wife.  Since the cost of consumables (yes I understand the business model) has long been a irritant.  I even tried a nice electric shaver, thought it was going to work and save money, then realized you have to replace the head yearly and cancel any money savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having this for a month I have to say it works exactly as advertised.  Cannot quite yet verify their longevity claims.  But in my case, I started with a new blade in my fusion(?) razor and have followed the simple instructions.  I used to get about a week out of a blade, give or take a few days, depending on how often I skipped shaving (usually only the occasional weekend day.)  I am using the same blade that I put in a month ago and it still feels and work fine.  Not exactly \\&quot;like new\\&quot; but perfectly fine.  I even missed about 6 days of use of the pit while on vacation about the second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it would appear that it has increased my typical usage life from one week to at least four (and counting.)  That is pretty good in my opinion.  Even if it varies a little and only averages four weeks, that is very good.  The unit will quickly pay for itself and save me money for years.  I do not see any reason that the pit will not last for a long time.  It is surprisingly simple.  Some sort of hard rubber type material.  I don&#x27;t see ay particular reason it will wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> after using it like discribed, my razor won&#x27;t stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;maybee i&#x27;m using is wrong or it isn&#x27;t designed for Fusion.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to extend the life of expensive razor blades and believe me this is it. First let me say that I have a heavy beard and I was only getting 3 or 4 shaves out of each one. At over $2 per blade, shaving was becoming very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I read about this item on Brookstone but I bought it from Amazon. This item has doubled and tripled the life of my razor blades. It just takes a little cleaning after each shave and it&#x27;s like a new razor blade. I thought enough of it to buy one for my wife and my wife says she may never buy razor blades again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the $20. It will save you a lot more than that.</li>
    <li> It actually works. Razor blades last 2-3 times as long.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent bathroom addition. Gonna solve the Xmas present list for all men in family!</li>
    <li> Very nice! I bought it for my husband and he haven&#x27;t changed the blade for three months since he uses the sharpener.</li>
    <li> Does this really work or is it all in my mind? I use the expensive Gillette razor cartridges, so it&#x27;s important to have them last as long as possible. Since using the RazorPit, I&#x27;ve had many more shaves per cartridge. So I guess it works. My brother bought one per my recommendation, and he&#x27;s had good results as well. Still not sure if it&#x27;s magic, but I&#x27;ll continue to use the RazorPit and keep saving some money.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product, but since razors are so incredibly expensive I decided to give it a try. When examining the product, it appears to be nothing more than an expensive piece of molded rubber (and maybe that&#x27;s exactly what it takes), but somehow it does work! After 4-5 days of using my razor I make it a habit of running it over this thing and am able to prolong the effectiveness of my razor. I wouldn&#x27;t say I get a full 150 shaves out of it, but it definitely lasts me 2-3 months. After that time the blade simply isn&#x27;t sharp enough to get a clean shave (mach-3).&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this would be a winner, but sad to say it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Razor pit meets expectations  it really does keep the blades sharp, the only negative is you lose or better yet it wears the lubrication strip down. Its worth getting this to prolong blades.</li>
    <li> Shave my head and face daily....go through a Mach 3 every 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Tried razor pit and am getting a good week out of one razor..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long pit will last, but at this rate will pay for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> This item is a joke in that I used it as directed for three weeks and it failed to do what the seller alleged, it is exactly what it looks and feels like - a piece of synthetic crap.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product ...  not working</li>
    <li> I think it does help clean the blades, but no more so than other methods.  I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in the amount of shaves I get out of one cartridge.  For the price I definitely can&#x27;t recommend it.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this. It has kept my razors alive much longer than I would&#x27;ve thought. I did think this sharpened the blades when what it does it clean them. Might end up being the same thing. Either way, very good purchase.</li>
    <li> all is good n great.. works awesome so far&lt;br /&gt;will recommend to friends n family&lt;br /&gt;great xmas present it was:</li>
    <li> Item works only for short periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on several razors and the sharpness lasts another 3-4 shaves, then you need to sharpen again.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions don&#x27;t say you need to use it constantly.</li>
    <li> I saw the Razor Pit demonstrated on an episode of &amp;#34;I Want That&amp;#34;. My husband has been a barber for 45 years. I bought the Razor Pit for his birthday two weeks ago. He tried out the Razor Pit on a well worn Bic razor he had thrown into the trash can. He was truly amazed how well it worked. He has now used that same razor multiple times and still is not ready to toss it. He will be purchasing another one for use in the barber shop. We would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Extends the life of ANY razor blade. I have used the same blade for 3 months and it still shaves effortlessly utilizing the razor pit after each shave. An amazing product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, it actually works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really felt a difference.</li>
    <li> Complete and absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have very sensitive skin and used to spend a small fortune on razor blades.  I have only bought new bladed on in the year since I ordered this.  Highly recommend to any any guy.  Especially gay couples!  Two guys, twice the razors.  This will save a lot of money and super easy to use</li>
    <li> Not sure it is helping at all</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he loves it. It works very well just like it says.</li>
    <li> this is a handy little instrument to clean your razor blades so that you can get more use out of the them.  It does not sharpen blades. It just cleans out the hair that gets stuck between the blades and makes it less effective.</li>
    <li> This actually doesn&#x27;t sharpen the blades. Rather it cleans them to a brand new state so that they work well.,</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for to save on buying razors blades always!</li>
    <li> I hate paying for blades and used to shave with crappy old blades to (literally) cut off my nose to spite my face.  Then I discovered this crazy rubber sharpener and now I go through one blade every 3-6 months, if that.  I upgraded to the Gillette ProFusion, bought one pack of replacement blades and I&#x27;m set for something like 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve found that the sharpener works on any blade from singles to my 5-blade beast, from dime store blades to fancy ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just push away with a little shaving cream 3-4 times, wash it off, and you&#x27;ll see that the blade shines a bit more and of course, it&#x27;s sharp again.</li>
    <li> Product works as described, received on time and it great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in September. I thoroughly  read the instructions. It was easy to use.  I probably used it six times.The material started to deteriorate. I contacted the company through e-mail and never received a reply. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Amazing little performer.  It makes already very smooth heads shave even smoother.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to use it until I tried it. I&#x27;m still using the old blade And it is still sharp until today the only thing about my blade is the lubricant strip that it&#x27;s already worn out however the blade still sharp and very satisfied with razor pit I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> This item is excellent so far. I received one for Christmas and it has kept the same blade sharp and smooth since Christmas. I have never had a blade last that long and I have a tough beard. Normally my blades start hurting and chafing after a week or a week and a half. I only changed blades this morning because the old blade fell apart! I sharpen my blade by putting shaving cream on the surface and pushing the blade backwards against the sharpening surface three or four strokes. I don&#x27;t know if it cleans or actually sharpens but I can tell you that my blades stay as sharp as new. This was quick to become one of my favorite gadgets.</li>
    <li> excellent - works just like advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I think this more of a gimick than anything else.</li>
    <li> Mine cost around $30 and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the longevity of my disposable razors.  The blades may have lasted a little longer but I ended up replacing the razors anyway because the lubrication strips wore out.  You may have better results than I did but my sharpener hasn&#x27;t seen the outside of the medicine cabinet in several months.</li>
    <li> I bought this rubber block to use with my Gilette Mach 3.  I was growing weary of constantly replacing expensive blades.  My position today is based solely on my anecdotal experience with the unit but these are my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I get 2-3 times the use out of a blade if I consistently wipe it down after each usage.  The blue line of soothing agent is usually my measure for when it&#x27;s time to replace a blade.  With this rubber block that blue line will be long gone before I decide to replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a shower shaver only.  I keep this block next to my razor&#x27;s base above my shower tile.  When shave I&#x27;ll shoot a little shaving cream on the block, then on my fingers and apply it to my face.  I&#x27;ll heat the razor under the running water and then shave.  Afterwards I rinse it and then run it backwards on the black 4-5 times.  I&#x27;ll rinse it again and blow it dry from the back and then the front side before putting it back on the stand.  I always blow it dry.  My blades never get a chance to rust.  I then rinse the block and put it back up on the tile.  Doing this, my blades tend to last noticeable longer than without the rubber block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, this rubber block isn&#x27;t magic.  It just cleans the crap off the blade that would otherwise be stuck there and cause pitting and corrosion on the blade.  That&#x27;s what makes it feel dull far sooner than it should.  Is it worth $18 (today&#x27;s price?)  Maybe, maybe not.  I paid $25 for it when I bought mine.  I can&#x27;t say that I got my money back on the purchase but I have a sharp blade far more often than a dull one.</li>
    <li> This product does work. Works better if you dry the blade with a hair dryer after you use this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, well packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a rubberized back board to which you add a bit of foam and move your razor in one direction. Tones up the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it extends the life of each blade by just one week. It will have paid for itself in less than a year.</li>
    <li> The blades don&#x27;t really touch the surface at all. I can see that buy the marks left by the shaving cream. The blade retainers on the sides keep the blades off of the surface at least for all the blades I have used. From what I can tell, it&#x27;s just a piece of rubber. I couldn&#x27;t tell any benefit to it.</li>
    <li> That is the best purchase that I have ever made in my entire life. I even got about 50 of my friends to order it. It works to perfection. I have used the same blade since February.</li>
    <li> My husband has very thick, course hair.  He shaves his face and head daily, sometimes twice a day.  He has used only two Mach 4 blades since Christmas and it is the middle of July now.  He used to have to change razors every couple of days.  This is an absolute must for anyone who shaves often.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about ordering this product, but its performance has changed my mind.  I have extended the life of my daily razor and have renewed my travel razor considerably.  How long this will continue, I don&#x27;t know, but I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used it once so far and it sharpened a razor i knew to be too dull for use. Using it didn&#x27;t exactly feel like new but pretty close, With this item you will save at least half annually on blades.</li>
    <li> Works great....razor stayed sharp for almost a month...saves $$ for buying expensive blades !!!  So happy finally purchased.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Keeps your razor super sharm.  Tried it out on a three-week-old razor and noticed s difference immediately.</li>
    <li> bought for a christmas gift. He loved it</li>
    <li> It works so far, came in time. Does not hold women&#x27;s razors very well, which should be expected I suppose.</li>
    <li> I have tried this several times for myself and girlfriend.  Neither of us see any difference whatsoever.  I use a Quattro, maybe it&#x27;s the type of razor used but it&#x27;s a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Now instead of a week on a fusion cartridge I can get a month. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker by any means, after two weeks you can tell it&#x27;s not a fresh razor. but, the blade remains serviceable without nicks or pain.</li>
    <li> Forget Shave club cheap blades, this thing WORKS. Been using the same blade for 2 months, very time I sharpen it, it&#x27;s like new.</li>
    <li> bought them for my two sons Both love it saves them so much money It really works. Saw it on &amp;#34;I want that&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have soft skin but with very thick, very coarse facial hair. I destroy razors and because of hair type have to buy the expensive MACH3&#x27;s. To say those blades are expensive is an understatement and when you&#x27;re faced with tearing through blades or having blades tear through your skin you go with the blades. Still... why spend extra money when you don&#x27;t have to do so?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simple to use... after each time you shave put some shaving cream, soap, etc on the RazorPit, run your blade up (never down as if using it to shave) 3-4 times, rinse both the RazorPit and Blade, dry them both, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would typically not get much more than 1 week use out of a MACH3 blade until getting the RazorPit. While I haven&#x27;t tracked how much longer a blade has lasted I usually get rid of them after the lubricating strip at the top starts to tear off from using the same blade for so long. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Buy RazorPit&lt;br /&gt;2) Use RazorPit&lt;br /&gt;3) Save boatloads of money</li>
    <li> There a less expensive way to keep your razor blades sharper longer. Use mineral oil in a small cup and the number of shaves will&lt;br /&gt;go from 5 to about 15. I been doing this for many years and now only buy razors a lot less frequently.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  work very good</li>
    <li> Seems to help extend the life of blades somwhat</li>
    <li> I have found that if I use the sharpener daily my razor lasts for a minimum of two weeks working like new.  It is so easy to use and hardly takes any time at all after each shave.  Once I adjust to just how long I can now use a particular safety razor I&#x27; m sure I can get more than two weeks use.  Such a simple idea but very cost savings device.</li>
    <li> When I first heard of this item I was rather dubious. I went ahead and purchased it, and have not purchased any blades since. It works totally as advertised.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fact that it&#x27;s a genius idea to try and extend the life of your razors by simply cleaning and drying them after each use.  But this product simply does not work.  I attempted to use it like the instructions read and I tried to use it in different ways.  It just didn&#x27;t really do as advertised.  Not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s bulky and get&#x27;s in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better solution:  Use Q-Tips and clean off the blades of your razors after each use.  Thanks RazorPit for the good idea, but I found a better cheaper way.</li>
    <li> They recommend using shaving cream as a lubricant, but I have found that lotion or soap works better.  Other than that, it does what is says it will and saves you money.  I am getting dramatically better shaves and keeping the cartridges in use a lot longer.  Before I got this, I got an online tip to use my forearm and push the razor the opposite direction (so it won&#x27;t cut hair).  Skin seemed to work almost as well as this product, but it is a little better with this product, or a combination of both.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Couldn&#x27;t believe the rubbery texture does really sharpen the blades.  Used skin lotion instead of shaving foam.  Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This really does work.</li>
    <li> Now I have used a Gillete blade for 11 months...this is a record for me. And I have not finished yet with that blade. Usually, I had to change blades every 3 months.</li>
    <li> pays for itself in no time....I am still learning how to best use it, it is compact in size and truly useful when you run out of sharp blades.....</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t tell if it works or not....i havent noticed it lengthening the life of my blade yet. but i&#x27;ll keep using it cuz it was expensive lol</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this thing!  I usually use a blade for one week and with this thing I have been using the same blade for 3 weeks and counting.  Still feels like a new blade.  I would definitely recommend this item to anyone.  I was a total skeptic but I am now a true believer.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it because of the high cost of Fusion blades. I tried other shaving systems but for me they just didn&#x27;t do the job like Fusion. I particularly like the extra blade to trim close places. I have a pretty heavy beard and shave my head every other day. Historically I would use a Fusion blade for two weeks and relegate it to the shower for my head shaving.  I followed the simple instructions for the RazorPit sharpener and now I am using the same blade for face and head and it will exceed a month&#x27;s use. I am very pleased and this simple gizmo will pay for itself very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I started using this on my original new Fusion blade December 12, 2012. Today is January 29, 2013 and I am still using the same blade. I keep thinking I should go to a new blade...but why? I do shave a little slower because I am skittish. But, no nicks or cuts. And I am shaving my head with it as well. Pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to cartridges, but this didn&#x27;t help at alll with disposables. I&#x27;d give it one star, but I didn&#x27;t think it was fair without trying it with cartridges.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this thing is suppose to work, but it didn&#x27;t work at all, not even a little, the only thing I did was send it back.</li>
    <li> Have been using the same razor for many many shaves. This product is magic and is continuing to keep my razor in great condition. Every man that shaves should own this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the same razor for 5 weeks now and I shave 2-3 times a week. I,m either very lucky with this blade or Da, Pit is the reason why I&#x27;m moving about in smooth school.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;re tired of spending money on expensive blades.  This hard rubberized pad helps to clean your blades just like the author says.  It refreshes your blades to be just like new. This saves your face and money.</li>
    <li> My husband is getting at least an extra month out of his razor blades. It&#x27;s essential to follow the instructions provided.</li>
    <li> works as expected. it helps clean the blade after each shave and that helps maintain the sharpness of the blades - this product does not sharpen the blades !! its just a rubber that cleans the blades (read online that a cloth - jeans - can do the same job)</li>
    <li> This product just doubled in price since the 10 minutes I added it to my cart. Shop around, it&#x27;s available for $20 plenty of other places.</li>
    <li> The RazorPit has literally saved me tons of money in just the short time I have had it.  Normally, I would use a disposable razor twice and then have to throw it away.  The first time I sharpened the disposable razors I was able to get another 2-3 uses before sharpening them again.  That said, it seems that each time I re-sharpen the razors they seem to work better and better.  I will probably only have to throw them away after they finally completely rust out.  I suggest keeping 2 baggies in a bathroom drawer, one labeled &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; and another labeled &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;.. This way you only have to spend about 4 minutes every few weeks sharpening 10-15 of them all at once.  This is super-easy to use and well worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Dad&#x27;s always buying cheap disposable razors, we want to test this out and see how much more efficient we can be with that cost. Just follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> Husband said it works and it does feel like a new blade after using this product. He was please with this product.</li>
    <li> First, I just want to say I&#x27;m a female. I&#x27;ve always preferred mens blades because frankly, who wants to shave anything with a wimpy blade? So that said, keep in mind I shave more surface area than the average man ;) I&#x27;ve had this thing for about a week and used it twice so I can&#x27;t vouch for the long run but I did use it on a month old (give or take) blade. I really don&#x27;t know if this necessarily &amp;#34;sharpens&amp;#34; but it definitely makes for a smoother shave. You know that feeling when your blade starts to catch, or pull, or miss spots or just be generally uncomfortable? Yeah, no problems with that after using this. I gave it 4 stars because again, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s actually sharpening anything but I have gotten (and will continue to get judging by it&#x27;s efficacy) a lot more use out of a blade I would usually have tossed by now.</li>
    <li> YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving, rinse your blade thoroughly under strong-running hot water.  About once or twice a week, wet a ceramic tile on your bathroom wall and pretend to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; the tile with your razor about 7 or 8 downward strokes to sharpen it. I do this and I can keep a Mach 3 blade shaving me close for over 6 months.  I have a pretty thick growth of beard, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There.  I just saved you some money.  Go buy something fun instead.</li>
    <li> I rarely take time to review products but I was compelled to write something about this product. Here is my take:&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1 - Comes in a nice package.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Clear instructions - The make gives you short but clear and concise instructions on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;4 - Very convenient for storing the razor&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1 - Does not remove grime and dirt from the razor blades, you have to clean it first (I use a soft toothbrush - do not use it brush your teeth too, JS)&lt;br /&gt;2 - Does not sharpen the razor blades! I thought this is what it is supposed to do?</li>
    <li> I bought this first as a curiosity, I hate how much razor blades cost. I have been using the same disposable razor for the Past week and a half and I&#x27;m still getting a very good shave. My girlfriend even tried it with her Razor blade And she got similar results. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, Great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> definitely value  for money, it works perfectly! Its very easy to use and adds life to yr blades! Go for it!</li>
    <li> I got this because I was hoping to use my blades for longer. Not so far! My blades dull at exactly the same rate, though I do like that this thing helps to clean the blade after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really recommend it if you want your razors to last longer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this would work so hesitated to write a review until I&#x27;d had it for a few months.  When used correctly (Start dry, apply small amount of shaving cream, push razor away from you and downward approx 25x&#x27;s), this product absolutely increases the life of the razor.  I get an average of 4 times more shaves out of each razor.  Works with multi razors, women&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works, less waste, paid for itself quickly&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Ugly black rubber thing in your shower?</li>
    <li> This claims to be a sharpener, so I bought it for my boyfriend.  Turns out what it really does it remove build up and residue from the blade.  I was expecting something more like a kitchen knife sharpener.  It still increases the effectiveness of the blade, but not like the name and description indicate.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent purchaser on Amazon and I have never written a review before. This product deserves one!&lt;br /&gt;My shaving habits: daily; sometimes skip weekends&lt;br /&gt;Product history: Gillette Mach 3 blades; loved them; hated cost; tried Harry&#x27;s Blades and liked the price but I missed the Mach 3 swivel head design and Harry&#x27;s blades seemed to take a layer off of my face and I cut myself frequently; which I almost never did with the Mach 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Razor Pit: I wet it with warm water and coat it with the left over shaving cream on my hand after finishing with my face, ten strokes of a Mach 3 blade each day before shaving. In the past I changed a blade for noticeable dullness after 5-7 days; now I am still using a blade after ONE MONTH and I still have a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Definitely better shaving performance after use</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;sharpener&amp;#34; because it was in a kit and the only way I could get the Save A Blade Razor Sharpener. From the description and instructions it appears that it will be useless to me.  You live and learn.</li>
    <li> I shave both my head and face. The razor gets a work out...this really seems to make things alot smoother.</li>
    <li> average product, not sure if this is really extending the life of my blades.....</li>
    <li> unit works well,a friend has one -he is getting 6 months on a blade,I&#x27;ve just started, and I see a difference after 6 passes across the sharpener-appears to be a winner</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband last year and he loves it.  He uses it every time he shaves.  He will use it before, during and after he shaves.  He has to have a very clean shave because he is in the military.  My husband has sensitive skin so he needs a very sharp razor.  The razorpit has extended the life of his razors tenfold.  Before the razorpit my husband would get maybe a good 10 shaves out of his razors, now he can go up to two months on one razor.  This is a great product.  I will be buying more as gifts this year.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my partner last year and it really works. So my partner has asked me to purchase two more for him to hand out as presents.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this could possibly work but after reading all the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing, it really does give a much longer life to your razor blade.  I get at least 30 shaves out of a blade I used to get 6 or 7 from.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> I seem to only be able to get a couple additional uses of a blade.</li>
    <li> It works, get better shaves and pays for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> Me and my wife use it!  Recommended by my good friend.  Noticible difference!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a key item for every man&#x27;s household. Does the job, keeps your blade lasting longer.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, as it&#x27;s supposed to be such a great product. However, it is totally useless on Schick Quattro blades (women&#x27;s, at least) due to their wires over the blades. I like those blades as they shave really nicely, and have at least 6 left to use up before I decide if I want to get a new razor handle and cartridge just to use the RazorPit. I wish I had returned it right away. And that i had read a mention of incompatibility in product listing or the other many many reviews I read.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sharpen -- gotta ding them for that. It&#x27;s a misleading product name. But it does help maintain your blade&#x27;s edge by, if nothing else, encouraging good razor maintenance habits</li>
    <li> This is great. I have extended the life of my cartridge from 4 days to over a month! Will pay for itself in a month or two.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He has tried it and says it does work and has improved the life of his razor blades.  Good cost efficient gift.</li>
    <li> This device is amazing! After shaving (I like to use shave oil) I take some shaving cream and glide the razor 4-10 times on the Razorpit and the blade is like new. No nicks, no rash or burn after 4 solid weeks of using a disposable Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to let the blade drip dry with handle up as it says in the instructions.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again absolutely. Best 20$ i have ever spent on my face. I used an 8 month old mach 3 razor and it feels 1 week old</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I found this product, but after Reading reviews I wanted to give it a try. As most of the people the first question is, does it work? Let me tell you they are true and I am not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;After every shave I give it a quick slide as the instructions says and I can notice my blades last a longer time. I have 3-4 times a week. I notice that it last for almost triple the time. I have a sensitive skin and it doesn’t do cuts. Every pass is as the blades are brand new, with still a sharp smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I still change the blades to be hygiene tho this product is worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try, test for yourself and see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to make of this product after a year of use. I still had to replace my hydra shave blades even while using this product. Not sure it saved money in having to re purchase new blades.</li>
    <li> It does&amp;#34;t work at all. Not good product at all. Neverever go for it. It&amp;#34;ll be waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tryed it with my double edge single blade classic safety razor and have not had good results. Yes it may be more effective fo the multi blade people.</li>
    <li> This thing is well worth the money! After using it for 3 weeks, I&#x27;m still using the same blades and they sharpen back up every time. When it&#x27;s nearly $22 for a 6-pack of blades, this RazorPit is a real bargain. I highly suggest purchasing this sharpener/cleaner for anyone who wants to save money on buying blades.</li>
    <li> Been using the same razor often for 3 weeks now. No issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAKE SURE you use as directed. People who complain think either&lt;br /&gt;a) it restores an old rusty blade or&lt;br /&gt;b) it doesn&#x27;t work because they don&#x27;t use it after every shave or they use it improperly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;START WITH A NEW BLADE then USE THE PIT EVERY TIME with a BACKWARD MOTION then STORE BLADE SIDE UP!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quantum physics people! RTFM!</li>
    <li> The RazorPit is amazing.  Over the past year, I have only gone through 2 blades and they&#x27;re sharper than the original.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for those of you who go through blades quickly.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with the same blade for over a month now.  I normally got two weeks from each blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product, but as far as I can tell, it has had no impact on the sharpness of my razors on repeated use.</li>
    <li> I had to look when I got this, but the upshot is I am on my third week on a single blade (Mach 3/Gillette).  I do a quick 4 strokes before I shave and after and never feel the tug that let&#x27;s me know that it&#x27;s time to change.  This is going to be a real money saver and I look forward to the results of that.</li>
    <li> Works great. I shave every other day and sharpen once a week and only use one blade about every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I had seen &amp;#34;sharpeners&amp;#34; for years and never gave them much thought, figured they were just gimmicks. a co-worker had mentioned that he had been using the same blade for about a year and that he sharpened it after each shave by running it backwards on the palm of his hand. I tried it and it worked ok, I figured that it the uneven surface of my hand worked ok, maybe an actual sharpener would live up to the claims. chose this one at random (price and the fact that you can take it in the shower).  I could not be more impressed. I started out with an old blade (gillette fusion) that I had already discarded for being too dull. sharpened it, seemed almost like new. at first I was sharpening it &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; each shave, but I found that doing it before the shave makes a big difference. I leave my blade in the shower, so I am guessing micro particles of rust etc... might be forming between shaves. I lather up, put some cream on the sharpener, give it a few strokes and shave. it actually seems to be getting sharper every time I use it. it seems to be sharper now that a new blade it. I shave my head, so it is important to me to have a nice, sharp blade, otherwise it will look like I have head acne. closest shaves I have ever had, least irritation too. best of all, I am saving about $100 a year on blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! It works really well and absolutely lengthens the number of times you can use one blade. Also I was surprised that I can use it on my razor too!</li>
    <li> Works good on a decent razor. The cheaper multipack razors don&#x27;t allow the junk to wash out and doesn&#x27;t work with razor pit .</li>
    <li> I am completing my third month on the same blade...I like 3rd month!! Unbelievable!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  just got fed up with the cost of replacement blades, which gave only 8 to 10 good shaves. I tried it on a whim and have been blown away. Not only does it seem to go on forever, but the quality of each shave is excellent, excellent.</li>
    <li> I have used it once and sharpens blades precisely. It works as described and is a great product to lengthen the life of your razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> One would not think it, but this item is quite effective in cleaning and sharpening multi-blade razors. I also bought a SAB001 Save A Blade Automatic Razor Sharpener, for it is battery powered. This product is more effective than the battery powered Save - A - Blade. It&#x27;s easy to use, wet the surface, soap and a few swipes to sharpen, and to clean, merely rinse. I&#x27;d recommend this product, as it will save you time and money.</li>
    <li> I CHOSE IT OUT OF CURIOUSITY AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS MADE IN VIETNAM AND SO WAS MY GIRL ANH</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a gimmick but the first razor I used with it was already three weeks old and was ready for the landfill. Started using the razorpit on it and I&#x27;m just getting to where this blade is about to go bad. That was just over four weeks ago. I usually shave everyday with a Gillette fusion 5 blade. My beard is normal to heavy. I think this product does what it says it will and increases the life of a blade by at least 3-4 weeks. Bad news for Gillette.</li>
    <li> This is basically a layer of silicone over hard plastic where you are supposed to rub your razor over it to clean off the soap scum. That is supposed to give you more shaves. I am somewhat convinced that it does give a few more shaves, but certainly not the &amp;#34;Sharpener&amp;#34; that is claims to be.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for over a 6 months now on the same cartridge. Still is sharp as when i first used it. At this rate i wont have to buy another set shaving cartridges for another year and a half. This product pays for itself.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple of months based on my brother&#x27;s recommendation.  Like how it extends the life of my blades.</li>
    <li> This thing works. I have easily gotten 6 months use out of a razor blade. Even at that the blades are still good but the rest of the cartridge falls apart and it needs replaced. I just follow the directions and I use soap instead of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> works better with name brand razors blades</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband.  It&#x27;s good for a place to set his razor, but he says he doesn&#x27;t really notice that it is making his blade last longer.</li>
    <li> Does a good job getting rid of the clogs in the blades, and I&#x27;ve used the same cartridge for a month now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether or not this really works but my husband says it does though he doesn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I&#x27;ve had a RazorPit, for 8-10 months. I haven&#x27;t purchased disposable razors (or any other razors) since then. It works great to keep my triple blade disposables sharp, with no razor burn. I do rinse my razor with hot water, as I shave. The RP doesn&#x27;t really clean the stubble out of the razor, as it states.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this second RP, for my adult Son, for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself one of these. Pays for itself very quickly!</li>
    <li> Razor blades last at least 3 times longer when using this on a regular basis. It is quick and easy to do with every shave.</li>
    <li> Contrary to this product&#x27;s name it cannot and doesn&#x27;t claim (in the instructions) to SHARPEN the blade. The surface is RUBBER. It can&#x27;t sharpen steel. All the instructions claim is that by rubbing the blade on the product it might clean the residue off the blade, something which can be accomplished by thoroughly washing the blade on occasion. I didn&#x27;t compare the longevity of the blades with and without the product since I don&#x27;t think it could work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This will keep your blades sharp! you wont have to replace the blades as often! yes, you could use an old piece of jeans and accomplish the same thing, but this plastic/rubber do-hickey will last my entire lifetime it seems. i rest my razor on it to dry. it is great!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to believe that thisnproduct would work. The truth is that it doesn&#x27;t.....I maybe got an extra shave or 2 at the most. Other than that I see that this as a great idea but poor execution.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Saved me lots of money on razors. Do yourself a favor and buy one.</li>
    <li> I do not notice my blades lasting any longer than before I bought this hunk of useless rubber.  What a joke.</li>
    <li> I saw this item on a TV Show, &amp;#34;I Want That&amp;#34; and it looked intriguing.  So I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order 3 for Christmas gifts for my husband, son and son-in-law.  Of course when they opened up the packages I had to explain what this item was for.  I&#x27;ve used it on my razor and was surprised that it actually works!  My entire family has used these blade sharpeners and have had the same results.  With the cost of razor blades being so over priced this sharpener should save all of us some serious $ on replacement blades. Easy to use and clean up. We are impressed!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Gillette Fusion five-bladed razor since they were introduced to the public. My routine - new blade every Monday. I&#x27;m in week three using the Razorpit and it&#x27;s working. Not sure if I can get 150 shaves (30 weeks based on my routine), but I would be satisfied if this device simply cut my razorblade consumption in half. So far, I&#x27;m impressed and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great at helping to keep blades clean and lasting longer. Use mine everyday. Won&#x27;t sharpen worth a damn but a bathroom essential.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this will yield as many reuses as it claims, but it certainly does work to extend blade life.  I&#x27;m not an everyday shaver, so this works well for me.  It probably means that a razor will last an extra week or so.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Razor pit is nothing but a piece of hard rubber, it doesnt sharpen blades nor does it do a good job of even cleaning them off. Save your money...sounded to good to be true!!! I should have been smarter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called a blade sharpener online. When you get the package it says &amp;#34;Blade Sharpener.&amp;#34; But when you read the directions they do not say it sharpens the blades. Rather. It cleans the blades of skin and hair residue that may reduce the performance of your razor. I&#x27;ve been using it and I do not notice any difference whatsoever. It was a complete waste of money. The fact that it says &amp;#34;Blade Sharpener&amp;#34; makes it a scam. When they freely admit it doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works as advertised.  Product doesnt look like much when you first see it, but it will surprise you how effective it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for well over a year now and have not bought razor blades since I purchased it. I use it to clean and re-true my blade every time I shave.</li>
    <li> It adds a couple of weeks to the razor blades.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. A good investment.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used one of these yet. I got them as Christmas presents for my Father and my brother-in-law. I still haven&#x27;t gotten my brother-in-law&#x27;s to him (it&#x27;s on my to-do list), but both my Father and my Mother (it DOUBLES as an effective gift, because whoever you give it to, the sharer of their bathroom can use it too!) absolutely love it. They say it works just as it was described.</li>
    <li> Very goog product. Worthy of any reccommendation.i have used the same blade now for three months.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;Harry Davis.</li>
    <li> I purchased the RazorPit Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Sharpener and did not expect miracles, just more blade life. When it arrived I took one of the blades I had disposed of and put it in my razor. I sharpened it as directed. I am still getting good clean shaves from that blade eight days later!!  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS ABOUT CHRISTMAS TIME AND STARTED WITH A NEW BLADE TO SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST......I HAVE 1 TIME DAILY AND OCCASIONALLY TWO IF I HAVE NIGHT WORK AND IT LASTED TIL TODAY....4-24 AND THAT&#x27;S GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;JOHN</li>
    <li> Prolong the use of blades. Reduce the cost of adding new blades and keep old blade sharp and lasting for longereriod</li>
    <li> This has doubled the life of my Mach 3 razor cartridges. I use shampoo, conditioner, or the shaving cream that is on the blade for the lubrication of the blades. I dont add shaving cream to the Razor Pit as recommended. It will take some time for the payback/break even point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this to my friends and they like it too.</li>
    <li> Honestly I am at a loss, its just a piece of rubber/plastice/polymer, but I follow the directions and it seems to work. I am on the same razor blade for almost a month now, compared to the normal 2 weeks I use a blade for. While the blade no longer has the moisturizer and stuff on it, the blades still give me a great shave so I think this is working. So in the end was this worth it, I think so, if i can double, or even triple my normal blade use, then I am saving a lot cause the mach 4 blades cost like $3-5 a blade. So this thing will pay itself off in a few months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...not great.does extend a blades life but not to a like new blade. Just OK for the money spent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to get 4-5 months from a single cartridge using this thing and I have a fairly heavy beard and don&#x27;t like pain that much. Also makes a good home for your razor between shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!  It really works to keep the blades sharper longer!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Bought it as gifts for a few of my family members. This is definitely a money saver!</li>
    <li> This works very well.  I would say that a razor straightened with this is at about 85-90%, so basically what it feels like anyway after 2 shaves.</li>
    <li> Followed directions and it didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> But then again nothing works on thick beard.  I tried it as illustrated on the directions and my razor did not feel any better.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell whether I will get as many shaves as they say. However, it has already extended the life of a cheap disposable razor. I believe it works by resetting the angle of the blade(s) bent during shaving. The platform is lubed with shave cream and you &amp;#34;strop&amp;#34; the blade in the opposite shaving direction, thus, in my opinion, resetting the blade. You only need four strops. You can detect a little resistance in the first one or two and none thereafter.</li>
    <li> These made great christmas gifts! Excellent quality at a good price. The texture of the razorpit&#x27;s surface is really nice.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says. i love this item to death it is very neat!</li>
    <li> I used the reviews of others and tried this as blades are ridiculously expensive. I am bald and shave my neck head and face so get through a lot of blades a year. It cleans rather than sharpen but I reckon I get twice the amount of use out of each blade which is for me really good and saved itself in about 5 weeks. If you use a lot of blades this is def worth getting.</li>
    <li> This poduct defintley cleans the blades well. I have yet to see that it makes the razors last longer - im only a week in- recommended so far</li>
    <li> Definitely extends blade life.</li>
    <li> This seems to give you a better shave, but I have found I need to use it a few times during a single shave. But I am not going to lie, it might just be because my razor could be pretty old. So this does as said, it will extend your razor life, but it will not save a dead razor. The price is fair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much when you first get it. Nothing magical. After you follow the steps, the blades become like new! I use a Mach 3 razor and it cleaned the blades awesome! Highly recommend it for people who like that close shave feeling and don&#x27;t want the irritation from dull blades!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27; had to change the blade even after 20 shaves. Great buy, definitely can save you a lot of money on expensive blades</li>
    <li> Great price! Works better than advertised.  I purchased this RazorPit and replacement blades for my razor.  I just had it with paying for razor blade replacements.  I have had this since Christmas 2012 and haven&#x27;t opened the replacement blades yet.  It brought my old dull razor back to life and is providing a closer shave than I can remember (except when the new blade was installed).  It as easy as wiping your razor and rising.  I shave my face 6 out of 7 days and each day is almost like a new blade was put on.  I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or pulling or dulling feeling razor experience since I unpacked the RazorPit. I think this is better than sliced bread and have recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> Sucks sucky sucks sucky sucks sucky sucks sucky sucks. Did I mention it doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really sharpen... it pulls any gunk stuck between the blades to make it last longer.  The gunk just makes the shaving experience rough.</li>
    <li> I have heard of people sharpening their razors before, but was skeptical.  However, I have had this sharpener for over two months and am still onthe same blade.  Simply put....IT WORKS and works well.</li>
    <li> As many reviews have stated, there is no way you are getting 150 shaves out of 1 blade! But it has doubled the life of my fusion blades and wife&#x27;s leg razors, so definitely pays for itself!</li>
    <li> Works.  You may need to do more than 4 swipes to really get the blade clean.  Has saved me a great deal of money.  Probably doubled, at least, the number of shaves I can get per blade.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same blade for months now. It takes some getting used to and you need to work it a few times to work out the &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34;, but over all I am impressed and will be buying these as stocking stuffers this year.</li>
    <li> its okay, but just cleans the open areas between blades, doesn&#x27;t sharpen anything</li>
    <li> I have used it and used it and can&#x27;t tell that it helps at all</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I does work as advertised but I can&#x27;t speak to the claim of 150 shaves before having to sharpen the blade again due to the fact I haven&#x27;t shaved that many times since I&#x27;ve received it.  But overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical if this would work but was shocked at how well it actually worked when I tried it.</li>
    <li> I used to change blades about once per week.  On average I now change blades every three weeks and am trying for longer.  Based on the average cost per blade of ~$2.00 per blade I realize a savings of 66%.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve with this. Seems to work if razor is completely dried after usage and then left on stand.</li>
    <li> It works so good, that now I use the same razor for one month straight! I am so upset with myself, I&#x27;ve been spending thousands of dollars in replacement blades, but NO more! Thank you Jesus!</li>
    <li> I had serious issue with my razor heads becoming dull very quickly and causing a lot of irritation and razor burn on my neck and cheeks.  My wife bought me this for Christmas and I love it.  It saves the razor heads from dulling out so quickly and will save a bunch of money over time because I won&#x27;t have to keep throwing the old heads away.  It dries quickly and cleans very easily.  Very easy to store and pack for a trip.  Great buy.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had read many reviews on this gadget and was doubtful, but decided to go ahead and try it.  Well, I am now a believer.  My 3 blade hydro cuts as well as it did when I bought it several months ago..... and I am still on the same blade!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this like a 3.8/5. This isn&#x27;t really a Sharpener. It&#x27;s basically a rubberized surface that cleans and hones the very edge of the razor cartridge blade, and ONLY the very edge. (You can get one of these surfaces on eBay for like $3). There is often hair that still gets stuck between the blades, but I clean those out with a toothbrush. Regardless, I use a Gillette Fusion Proglide on my head and neck every other day. I use the RazorPit before every shave, and I get about a month or so out of one cartridge now, as opposed to half a month. With that said, I can still feel a difference between a month old RazorPit&#x27;ed cartridge, and a fresh cartridge. Not enough to give up using this though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting about 35 shaves per mach 3 razor blade using the razor pit.  (about 6 weeks of use)  I have a thick beard.  This will pay for itself quickly as I used to use (1) mach 3 razor blade each week.  Make sure you press down hard when sharpening your blade.</li>
    <li> This little jewell worked so well i sent one to my brother &amp; brother in law as gifts. Usually when my wife snags one of my razors, that is the end of it for me but RazorPit even saved that one! Great product.</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this. It looks cool and the thought of spending much less on blades sounded very very good. But I didn&#x27;t see much decrease in the number of blades I had to buy....The comfort strips on the blades would wear out at the normal rate, which left me with potentially sharp blades but an uncomfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This product has saved me hundreds of dollard a year.  I use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razor, but even at Costco, the blades cost a fortune.  I have a fairly heavy beard, so generally speaking, I&#x27;d have to replace the blade once a week or else start getting small cuts from the blade getting roughed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RazorPit sharpener has extended my replacement time from once a week to once a month.  It makes it so that the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razors are cost effective compared to disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sharpen the blades every other day.  It takes about 5 seconds--literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased a razor blade sharpener from DealThrow via LivingSocial for $10. It&#x27;s very similar to this design and may even be the same brand. After one of my Mach3 blades became dull (approximately two weeks of use), I started using this sharpener/cleaner. Immediately the blade regained its cutting edge. I was about to throw the blade in the trash as I generally do at that point after 2-3 weeks of use. Instead, I continue to use the same blade over five months later. Yes, five months later. I shave with and against the grain, sometimes shaving day-after-day and other times waiting five days for a shave, so the blade gets quite the test. My face is also really sensitive and razor burn is frequent, especially on my neck when blades dull, but I rarely get razor burn now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of you, I was skeptical prior to purchasing a product like this, but it really is as amazing as it sounds. I&#x27;ll update this post either when the blade is finally unusable or in a few months, whichever comes first. Currently, I&#x27;ve been using the blade for 23 weeks, which is over seven times longer than any Mach3 blade has ever lasted me, which means the sharpener has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> i bought this based on the reviews of other skeptics, I have no idea how it works, but to test it, I took a razor I leave in my shower to shave some additional body parts. (use your imagination)  Any way, every time I put a new blade in my Fusion, I put the old one in the shower, so its already worn, rusty and gunked up !!  So now I cleaned it with a few swipes of the sharpener and it brought it back to life. I am not sure if it really sharpens or just cleans all the gunk, but it works. There is a good review at &amp;#34;how to shave. com and they also explained how it works. WORTH THE COST OVER AND OVER</li>
    <li> So far I have tried this product with only one razor blade, and number of shaves are no where near what it promises. Not sure if it is due to the brand of blade (not Gillet) I used. I still need to try on a Gillet blade which seems to have gotten more shaves for more people per their reviews.</li>
    <li> Really does make blades last way longer.</li>
    <li> Hubby tried it and said it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I thought I saw some possible results on my razor.  Not sure, but wouldn&#x27;t not worth the money regardless.</li>
    <li> I could live without this.  It&#x27;s not a blade sharpener, as advertised.  All it does is clean out the blade.  It&#x27;s a pain in the butt to use, especially since you have to lather it up, then run the blade over it, then wash out the blade from the shaving cream, then clean the RazorPit...I would much rather just rinse the blade out, and if there&#x27;s any hair trapped, run my finger of it.  If I had the choice, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 7/25/2017: Looks like someone took that denim strap idea and turned it into a product called The Happy Shaver.  Not sure if I can link to other sites so just search on kickstarter.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/12/2016: more than three years later and the Razor Pit still sits on my shower ledge and still gets used daily. It has held up really well and the construction and durability are impressive. I have never improved upon the extra week or so per blade, but I am fine with that and have felt no need/desire to switch to a leather or denim/cotton strop. I have had the best results with the Razor Pit combined with Dorco 6 (my preferred) and Gillette blades. Schick blades have done pretty well also. Harry&#x27;s blades have not done well nor had Dorco 7&#x27;s. Even though I have had the ​great life from this product, I still can&#x27;t see spending $17 on it like I did in 2013. Seeing that the price is now $12.99 or less, I have bumped up my rating to 4 stars. At 12 bucks this is a pretty solid investment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL 4/27/2103: This is a nice take on a traditional strop. I like the concept and it does seem to work fairly well, not amazing, but noticeable. I get about 8 more shaves on average per razor since buying this in February, so about an additional week&#x27;s use per cartridge. I shave against the grain (always have) and have moderately coarse, extremely fast growing facial hair. It is not unheard of for me to shave twice per day if I have an evening event. I also shave my head, so I&#x27;m pretty tough on blades and they get expensive. I have spent many years figuring out what works and what doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely experienced shaver. I&#x27;ve been shaving since 12 years old. Over the year&#x27;s I&#x27;ve become quite the shaving geek. I use all sorts of tricks to get the best shaves, save my skin, and save some $$$. I often shave with baking soda, which has been the best experience (ask me if you have questions about that.) I never use canned shaving cream. I often use my Phytomer Gentle Cleansing Milk to wash and shave. I only shave in the shower with steam and water running. I operate and develop spas, which has given me access to dozens of the highest quality shaving products, implements, and techniques and simplicity always seems to come out on top. A straight razor, boar&#x27;s hair brush, and leather strop is without a doubt the best overall solution, but it is also time-consuming and not very practical if you travel a lot or rush to get ready each morning. In today&#x27;s world, it disposables and expedience that seem to rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing&#x27;s for certain, every guy&#x27;s skin and hair is different, so what works for one doesn&#x27;t always work for another. Razor blades, on the other hand, are all basically the same. Nearly all are made of steel, especially the disposable blades. Steel&#x27;s number one enemy is oxidation, which causes corrosion and uneven surface, which is what we experience as a &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; blade. A steel blade&#x27;s number two enemy is grime. A clean, dry blade is a sharp, efficient blade. If a blade could be used, then cleaned, dried, and kept in a vacuum seal between uses, it could conceivably remain sharp for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;denim strop method&amp;#34; for years and it actually works better than this little unit, but it&#x27;s not nearly as nice looking in the bathroom. I also used to store my blades inside a container of shaving oil, which adds amazing life to them (I&#x27;d get about six months per blade), but that oil gets expensive, is messy, and gets scummy after a bit. Basically too much effort/hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regard to the RazorPit product, I&#x27;d say its biggest benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;1) It looks good and not out of place in your shower, in your medicine cabinet, or on your vanity. Much better than a random piece of denim or old leather.&lt;br /&gt;2) It actually does clean, straighten and give your blades a little extra life&lt;br /&gt;3) MOST IMPORTANTLY, convenience. It is easy to keep on hand. If this productcauses you to develop good maintenance habits, then it is worth the purchase. If you clean, dry and hone your blades, they are going to last longer. It&#x27;s as simple as that. You don&#x27;t need this product to do this, but if this is the product that gets you to do it, then it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $17 including shipping. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 all in and in reality, it&#x27;s probably only worth $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It&#x27;s convenient, well made, good looking, and effective enough to pay for itself. I&#x27;d buy it again for a few buck less than what I paid. I haven&#x27;t had the amazing results/savings indicated or experienced by others, but I am saving enough for it to pay for itself by the end of the year.uses you to develop good maintenance habits, then it is worth the purchase.

    <li> I was a huge skeptic at first, but yes, it really does work! Like others have said, it maybe doesn&#x27;t sharpen the blades, but it cleans them and they feel great. Been using it for about a month now, and haven&#x27;t thrown out a blade yet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get your expectations too high but it does help make your blades last longer so it&#x27;s worth it.  Plus is only takes two seconds to use after shaving.  Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> My husband really uses this thing. He says it does exend the life of his razor blades, so no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Awesome Deal  Bought another one for my son in the Navy..If you are frugal like me this is a no brainer, since it pays for itself in about 5 months</li>
    <li> The product completely justified its marketing hype. I shave everyday and the useful life of my blades are now extended by a month or more. Incredible! I&#x27;ve bought it for all my close friends and they are equally delighted with it.</li>
    <li> Most likely doesn&#x27;t really help but if you imagine it does, then it is worth the little price you pay.</li>
    <li> It works well to clean off your blade prior to shaving.  Do I think it will save me millions in razor blades? Most certainly not! However, it does extend their life to an extent and that was my motivation for purchasing.</li>
    <li> This product will definitely let you get more life out of your razors.  Follow the directions and use it after EVERY shave.  Do not start using it when you think the blade is dull as it doesn&#x27;t work as well if you do that. Use it from the first shave and you will get more longevity out of your blades.  The only thing it can&#x27;t fix is the loss of the smooth aloe strips but if you use decent shaving creme this should not be a problem. I&#x27;d recommend to friends and family.  I bought  my dad and cousin one as a gift.  They are also pleased.  I&#x27;m using my razers for about 6-8 weeks very comfortably.</li>
    <li> This works... but it&#x27;s just barely worth the cost.  It works best with modern catridges with either flexible blades or pivoting heads.  I use Trac II and Atra cartridges.  This product works, but it&#x27;s just barely worth the cost unless you are using something like a Fusion or Mach 3.    It won&#x27;t give you 150 good shaves, it&#x27;s more like it will double the life of your razor.   It requires good lather or a slick lotion to get good glide.  Use only light pressure..  When it works, the blades will look clean and shiny on the edge.  They won&#x27;t be like new but they will feel sharper than otherwise.</li>
    <li> New Review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I have been using this for a while now.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything.  At first I thought it worked a bit, but after further use I have changed my mind.  I have been using the same blade daily for a couple weeks now and it is painful to shave with and keeps getting worse.  That is about how long I use the blades normally with no sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a battery powered sharpener that stopped working.  The battery powered one definitely worked, it was just super cheaply made so I wanted to try a different one after it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for a good blade sharpener.  This one is a little pricy considering its construction and lack of features IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review Below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to work.  I would say it gets worn out blades back to about 50%, so not like new or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; battery powered blade sharpener that was a POS and broke after a few weeks.  It sharpened more than this one does, but it was junk.  This one is still ok, and its pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, its cheap.</li>
    <li> It works,one blade last for twenty shaves... saves lots of bucks on razor blades..&lt;br /&gt;clean up is easy,just rinse with tap water</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works as advertised.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and it does seem to help sharpen the blade but the blade feels unfamiliar and of a different sort.</li>
    <li> My husband was not impressed, but it works great for me!</li>
    <li> This things is kind of amazing.  I was kind of skeptical when I purchased it, but it does seem to keep my razor blade sharper for longer than it normally was.  I would not say that you are going to get like 20 shaves out of one blade but I think I am at like number 7 or 8 on the same blade and it probably has a few more in it.  I would recommend this product to anyone loking to save a few bucks on razor blades.</li>
    <li> Aws ome best online purchase ever</li>
    <li> this works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This really works...absolutely amazing! Extends life of blades for MONTHS!!</li>
    <li> A must buy if you dont want to waste your money buying new blades. Its been months ive been using my first set. Its definitely worth the buck.</li>
    <li> Good for sharpening razors</li>
    <li> First of all, this works great and a big money saver. Almost every shave you feel you are using new a cartridge. The device broke one cartridge as I was sliding my razor to sharpen in the direction of rectangle that hold the cartridge exactly as shown in the picture instead of that make sure you slide your razor in the other direction to avoid breaking of cartridge.</li>
    <li> I stumbled onto RazorPit and read about the product and how it works with MUCH SKEPTICISM!  Decided to try it out. (for around 20 bucks, it&#x27;s not a big risk).  I&#x27;m here to tell you, it works! The cartridge I have used since buying RazorPit three months ago feels sharp and new each time I shave. (it&#x27;s a Gillette Sensor Excel twin blade).  I shave every 3 to 4 days (on average).  Before using RazorPit, I would get three, maybe four shaves out of each cartridge before they lost their effectiveness. I&#x27;m curious to see how many uses I can get out of this first cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool will definitely save me money.</li>
    <li> Definately a 5 star. This is Fantastic. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used it and it does work as it should be (i.e., it keeps your razor blades sharp ).</li>
    <li> i think it KIND of helps, but i can&#x27;t say i had success with using my blades as many times as these guys are claiming. I swear you guys must have baby hair as beards.</li>
    <li> It really does work.  Recommended it to my brothers to buy it. Using same blade for 2 months. Now I can afford fusion blades.</li>
    <li> I bought one and after a few months I was still so impressed that I bought 6 more for family members!</li>
    <li> So far, this product has done a pretty good job of sharpening my razor blades and cleaning out gunk. I can&#x27;t say that, at least in my experience, the blades look *as* good as new, but they come pretty close. Overall, a wise investment.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it based on other reviews.  Didn&#x27;t really do anything to help lengthen life of blades or re-sharpen.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I was already doing a good job cleaning my blades, but I have not noticed any difference using this product (I followed directions exactly).</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but after reading all the reviews I decided to buy this for my husband.  It works just as described.  Sharp blades are a wonderful thing.</li>
    <li> This is the device the big razor manufacturers don&#x27;t want you to know about. Yes, it really works.  Out of the box, I put it to the test using it on a razor that was at least 70% &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; according to normal shave amounts.  Not only did it help but it actually got better over the next several shaves/uses.  I would say I am at least 50% past the normal death of that razor and it is still going strong.  This device will pay for itself quickly...I feel like a fool for not getting one sooner.</li>
    <li> Just as the product description reads: This thing works 90% of the time, 60% of the time. So if 90% of a five star review is 4.5 stars, and this is 60% of the 4.5 stars... I rate this a solid 2.7 stars.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. This product will deliver it&#x27;s break-even point in very short order. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> this is an absolute waste of money! This product actually made my razor worse, I could not return item to the seller, so I am trying to warn others that this piece of rubber is worthless. I too ignored the bad reviews and I thought it may work for me. Buyer beware, if it is to good too be true it usually is!!!</li>
    <li> Complete rip off - nothing but a piece of rubber that does not help to extend your razor- save your money</li>
    <li> I have been using the blade sharpener for approximately 2 months now.  When I recieved the item as a birthday gift I was about to throw away my current Mach 3 blade as it was starting to nic and cut my face.  I have to shave every other day for work and as a police officer I can not have open cuts on my face (blood born pathogens).  I figured I would give the blade sharpener a try before I threw out my old blade and see if it would really work.  Before I used the sharpener I rinsed the blade with water and looked at it really closely.  No wonder I was getting cut, I could visually see dirt, grim and hair on the blades in the razor.  So I tried the sharpener and after using it twice I looked at the razor blade I was going to throw away and it looked brand new!  I&#x27;ve been using the same razor blade for the last 2 months now and the conditioning strip at the top is finally starting to fall apart but the blades still look and cut like new.  Also, after using the sharpener I was no longer cutting or nicking myself while shaving.  Only down side is I think I bought mine for around $15, now that its almost twice as much it seems a little pricy, but it will still save you way more money then it costs!!!!</li>
    <li> It is this simple...Put Shaving cream on Razor Pit..then, your Razor. Slide razor 4 to 5 times forward and you will feel the blades sharpen and get smoother! My friend uses this as well. We are on one blade and have shaven 2 months with one blade. Pro Fusion blades cost 22dollars here and we are now saving money! This product has already paid for its self! Worth It Big Time!</li>
    <li> I read many years ago how to keep a razor sharp was to rub it (the opposite way than you shave) against your arm, that it was like a leather strap used in old time barber shops..... that worked better for me than this, what a waste, save your money.</li>
    <li> Like many I was skeptical but hopeful. I agree that I do not think the RazorPit sharpens the blades as much as it keeps them sharp by getting them clean. I always washed my blades very well before I got this, so I was surprised that I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve been able to use the same Mach3 Turbo cartridge for about 8 weeks (about 3 shaves per week) with no signs of wear and the same close shave without nicks or cuts as the first use. I know 25 uses isn&#x27;t that impressive when compared to the 100 claimed on the box, but even 25 is way better than the 9 to 12 I was getting before. I will try to remember to update the review when I finally switch blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After 7 months, I finally decided to switch blades. The blade lasted around 20x longer with the RazorPit than without.</li>
