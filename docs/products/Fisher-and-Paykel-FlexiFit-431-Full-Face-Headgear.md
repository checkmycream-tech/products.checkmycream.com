    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the standard headgear upgraded to the large headgear and it works perfectly...</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement of the old harness.  It works, what else can I say.</li>
    <li> great products thanks for having this available without having to go through insurance</li>
    <li> These items do not look like the Fisher-Paykel headgear. The material is cheap, the straps have extra velcro connections and they lack the plastic clasp that allows the headgear to attach to the mask.I ordered from two different vendors and got the same defective mask straps. I sent them back.</li>
    <li> This is not the original one!!!</li>
    <li> looks exactly like the headgear that came with mask.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect purchase.  I could not have asked for anything better.  I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was using Apria Health for my CPAT supplies but these are the same thing for half the price.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Just what I needed... Would buy again</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the quickness the straps came in and was delivered by mail.  It was the exact model I needed to fit my existing mask.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Much better than my old one. It works and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is &amp;#34;standard equipment&amp;#34; for my Cpap machine.  It was as ordered, and as expected.  It replaced my old, worn out headgear and worked perfectly.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Worked fine,I almost had to pay for the whole apparatus (mask included) because that was the only way the hospital would cell it to me.  This was was more inexpensive!</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Very happy with the prompt delivery, top quality product.</li>
    <li> This is identical to the one I was issued when I bought the original mask.  Works very well, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered a 432 mask and headset with buckle and proper attachments. When I received the package there was no headset to hold the mask in place: USELESS</li>
    <li> I have tried the FlexFit 431 and being a women with a small head I discovered this one works better for me than the 432, which is larger.  the piece that fits across the top of the head along with the next support at the back of the head are smaller than the 432.  The 432 appears to be the same at the bottom.  The problem I had with the 432 is that the top strap is longer than top strap on the 431 and also the bottom strap on both.  That is where I couldn&#x27;t make it small enough to be comfortable and I had many more large leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I ran into is that my health care provider and an online provider for supplies thought the masks were the same size.  Neither thought I would notice a difference.  But when it comes to how deep the head is at the top of a person&#x27;s head, there is a difference.</li>
    <li> Great purchase fast delivery great product.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement part</li>
