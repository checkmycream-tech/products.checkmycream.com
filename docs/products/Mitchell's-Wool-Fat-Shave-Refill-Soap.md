      <li>Favorite shave soap</li>
      <li>Love the fat.</li>
      <li>In return, it makes the most luxurious lather you&#x27;ll ever experience.</li>
      <li>There are many soaps out there</li>
      <li>I wish it lathered up better</li>
      <li>Since this is a refill, the purchaser would do well to make sure he/</li>
      <li>It will do the job, but you can do better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but MWF is my favorite and a mainstay in my rotation.</li>
      <li>Most luxurious.</li>
      <li>It makes the blade slide easy and leaves the skin nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>rich lather, nice glide and leaves your face feeling smooth and</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great shave and suffer from sensitive skin (or even if you don&#x27;t)</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll enjoy this soap if you can stick with it for a couple weeks to get used to the flowery smell :)</li>
      <li>soap creates a thick/fluffy lather, and the natural lanolin creates a great barier on the skin for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>The scent was kind of off putting at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.  </li>
      <li>One of the best shave soaps, hands down.  </li>
      <li>as it is I can&#x27;t really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>The soap will make your skin feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have a very course beard and sensitive skin but this shaving soap makes my skin feel great during a shave.</li>
      <li>Once you learn to lather it properly it is the greatest shave product alive.</li>
      <li>No over powering smells, just clean.</li>
      <li>Once lathered it provides a nice shave with good glide and the lather doesn&#x27;t dissipate as fast as other soaps.</li>
      <li>Clean smell,great slick lather,and post shave is very good.</li>
      <li>Super.  </li>
      <li>It also has a smell that is very strong and reminds me of old people.  </li>
      <li>Lather is easily worked up and actually helps the blade glide across the skin giving a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and certainly not objectionable, just a kind of clean, soapy fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The lanolin is supposed to be good for your skin, but I really don&#x27;t have enough data to support or refute that claim.&lt;br</li>
      <li>worth the price?</li>
      <li>Worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Works great with sensitive skin and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It is a great soap, and larger than the average shave soap puck, but the price is much higher than even comparable shave soaps.  </li>
      <li>$16 for a puck might seem a bit high but it will last many moons.</li>
      <li>I really like the lather that this shaving soap makes, but the aroma is too perfumey for me.</li>
      <li>It took me a while - almost one whole bar - to figure out how to lather this soap correctly.</li>
      <li>No matter what I try, it lathers really bubbly and not creamy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll skip the straight razor</li>
      <li>After what I had read online about this shave soap, I expected something much better.  </li>
      <li>My grandpa used to use a brush and shave soap with his straight razor.</li>
      <li>However, I find other soaps at lower prices to give better shaves.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have given 5 stars except for the rather high price.</li>
      <li>It is slick, easy to make a great thick lather, but it is no better than many of the cheaper soaps and creams.    </li>
      <li>I have even gone so far as to lather one side of my face with MWF and the other with Razorock or Proraso to make a comparison, and either of those gives me a slicker, thicker cream and a better shave at a considerably lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this soap to new wet-shavers.</li>
      <li>I live in Seattle</li>
      <li>Regain your appreciation for the natural!</li>
      <li>Both perform above average and have scents that are more inline with someone in their 20s or 30s.</li>
      <li>scent is very light and delicate.</li>
      <li>few users will complain about getting a good lather from this soap, but there are a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; lathering videos on YT to help a new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i do have hard water definately a keeper in the rotation and my favorite to date</li>
      <li>I prefer Trumper shaving soap or lately have enjoyed the eshave lime scented cream.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my brother (a gourmet shaving person) and for my adult son who is learning to become a gourmet shaver.</li>
      <li>and I believe water is soft.</li>
      <li>in mind that there is natural lanolin in the soap and if you are allergic to it you should stay away from this soap.</li>
      <li>Its a very thirsty soap so don&#x27;t hesitate to keep adding a few drops, then a few drops more and rub vigorously with preferably a boars hair brush.</li>
      <li>This is somewhat surprising in an animal fat based soap, as they are usually known for their slick nature.  </li>
      <li>The lather is rich and creamy, and extremely slick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It is very highly regarded on all the wet shaving forums.</li>
      <li>Before using this product I constantly suffered from nicks and razor burn after my shaves because of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>the bar is large enough to fit in my mug where some of the other soaps are too small.</li>
      <li>This is a very thirsty soap and demands 3x the amount of water needed compared to other soaps.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very slick and fresh smelling</li>
    <li> Amazing soap; the best one I&#x27;ve used so far. The lather is rich and creamy, and extremely slick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathering this soap has a learning curve. It took me a while - almost one whole bar - to figure out how to lather this soap correctly. This is a very thirsty soap and demands 3x the amount of water needed compared to other soaps. In return, it makes the most luxurious lather you&#x27;ll ever experience. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t even need an after shave with this soap; my face remains moist all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and delicate. You can use this soap every day and not get bored of the scent. MWF has become my almost-every day soap and go-to soap. I don&#x27;t recommend this soap to new wet-shavers. You need to practice lathering soaps like VDH and then come to MWF. Also, lathering this soap needs a lot of patience - you start out dry and add water very very slowly. In the end, your patience will be rewarded.</li>
    <li> I want to respond to another review. This is wool fat soap... wool fat is lanolin, with anything containing \\&quot;wool fat\\&quot;, lurking underneath the sandalwood fragrance there is the odor of lanolin. I use Bay Rhum afterwards which smells great. We have grown so unaccustomed to natural smells these days, that lanolin smell seems \\&quot;slightly off\\&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. The soap will make your skin feel fantastic. I&#x27;d have given 5 stars except for the rather high price. Regain your appreciation for the natural! Also, it&#x27;s a link to our past.</li>
    <li> After what I had read online about this shave soap, I expected something much better.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does a fine job.  It is slick, easy to make a great thick lather, but it is no better than many of the cheaper soaps and creams.    It also has a smell that is very strong and reminds me of old people.  Now there is nothing wrong with elderly individuals and I hope to be one in the future but I do not want to go around smelling like my grandparents.    I prefer Trumper shaving soap or lately have enjoyed the eshave lime scented cream.  Both perform above average and have scents that are more inline with someone in their 20s or 30s.</li>
    <li> The best preforming soap I have used. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great soap nice scent didnt knock my socks off but i do have hard water definately a keeper in the rotation and my favorite to date</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews of MWF soap in the shaving forums, I had to give it a try.  It seems that it has a reputation for being notoriously hard to lather, but I have never had an issue with getting all the lather I need.  However, it is in the quality of the lather that I find this soap lacking.  To me, it just doesn&#x27;t have that slick, creamy lather that gives the cushioning I&#x27;m looking for.  This is somewhat surprising in an animal fat based soap, as they are usually known for their slick nature.  However, it just isn&#x27;t there.  I have even gone so far as to lather one side of my face with MWF and the other with Razorock or Proraso to make a comparison, and either of those gives me a slicker, thicker cream and a better shave at a considerably lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this soap, as it has garnered almost a legendary reputation.  However, I find other soaps at lower prices to give better shaves.  The scent is light and certainly not objectionable, just a kind of clean, soapy fragrance.  The lanolin is supposed to be good for your skin, but I really don&#x27;t have enough data to support or refute that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t find this soap to be as good as many others out there, and it is rather pricey for what it does.  It will do the job, but you can do better.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great shave and suffer from sensitive skin (or even if you don&#x27;t) this product is for you. It is considered one of the best soaps by most wet/traditional shavers and once you use it, you&#x27;ll know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap creates a thick/fluffy lather, and the natural lanolin creates a great barier on the skin for a close, comfortable shave. Before using this product I constantly suffered from nicks and razor burn after my shaves because of my sensitive skin. The first use of this soap gave me the best and closest shave, no knicks or razor burn of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few users will complain about getting a good lather from this soap, but there are a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; lathering videos on YT to help a new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that there is natural lanolin in the soap and if you are allergic to it you should stay away from this soap.</li>
    <li> I have tried to give this a few tries, but I have a hard time with lather with this stuff. No matter what I try, it lathers really bubbly and not creamy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have some other hard to lather soaps that perform better than this with a little less work also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get an itchy dry feeling after using it also. Almost like greasy wool rubbed over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just not overly impressed with the hype on this item. Could be my water or my skin maybe?</li>
    <li> This is great.  The scent was kind of off putting at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.  It&#x27;s kind of flowery but the scent doesnt&#x27; hang on past your shave and the lanolin leaves my face pretty well moisturized.  You&#x27;ll enjoy this soap if you can stick with it for a couple weeks to get used to the flowery smell :)</li>
    <li> lots of good talk about it, got it today, haven&#x27;t shaved yet but the puck looks like it will last for about a year, worth the price? lets see</li>
    <li> My grandpa used to use a brush and shave soap with his straight razor. I&#x27;ll skip the straight razor but I tried several brands and this is the smoothest shave yet. Most luxurious.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes the blade slide easy and leaves the skin nice and smooth. I live in Seattle and I believe water is soft.</li>
    <li> I really like the lather that this shaving soap makes, but the aroma is too perfumey for me. I wish they had a range of scents to choose from. as it is I can&#x27;t really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get everyone&#x27;s problem with lathering. MWF works great every time for me. I have a very course beard and sensitive skin but this shaving soap makes my skin feel great during a shave.</li>
    <li> I heard there was a cult following for this shave soap. I understand why. This leaves my skin feeling great. I haven&#x27;t had problems lathering it. Watch some YouTube videos on how to build a good lather. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, give it a go.</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite shaving soap, he swears its the best</li>
    <li> Once you learn to lather it properly it is the greatest shave product alive. Its a very thirsty soap so don&#x27;t hesitate to keep adding a few drops, then a few drops more and rub vigorously with preferably a boars hair brush. If you use a badger you&#x27;ll be there all day. Worth the effort.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and lasts forever! It&#x27;s already saved me about $10 on shaving cream and I&#x27;ve still got half a cake left.</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to lather, this stuff is GREAT!  I have suggested to others to get this as well</li>
    <li> One of the best shave soaps, hands down.  Great lather, slickness, and cushioning.  Not a very strong smell, but it&#x27;s not about that when it comes to &#x27;the fat&#x27; as it&#x27;s known in some wet shaving circles.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother (a gourmet shaving person) and for my adult son who is learning to become a gourmet shaver. Both rave about this product. The fragrance is very pleasant - not overtly &#x27;lanolin&#x27; or sheepish. Lather is easily worked up and actually helps the blade glide across the skin giving a very smooth shave. Since this is a refill, the purchaser would do well to make sure he/she had a well-draining soap dish; it  is essential for this product.</li>
    <li> this is good, I like the feel of this soap and the bar is large enough to fit in my mug where some of the other soaps are too small.</li>
    <li> Works great with sensitive skin and lasts a long time. Great lather build up. Fits my lather cup firmly. Seems expensive until you consider this will last a whole year or longer.</li>
    <li> This is a really good shaving soap.  Very slick, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling very dried out.  It has a very nice, very mild musky type scent.  Pleasant scent, and so mild that it wont override any aftershave or cologne that you want to use.  Why the missing 5th star? Price.  It is a great soap, and larger than the average shave soap puck, but the price is much higher than even comparable shave soaps.  I guess due to the ride across the pond from England. Great soap if you don&#x27;t mind paying the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of shaving soaps in the last couple of years. Mitchells Wool Fat is by far the best for me. $16 for a puck might seem a bit high but it will last many moons. It boasts excellent glide and cushion with a light aroma. There are many soaps out there but MWF is my favorite and a mainstay in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is one of the best shave soaps available.&lt;br /&gt;Very rich lather, nice glide and leaves your face feeling smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It is very highly regarded on all the wet shaving forums.</li>
    <li> Love the fat.This is imho the best on the market.Clean smell,great slick lather,and post shave is very good. What else can one ask for from a shave soap?</li>
    <li> One of the best soaps I have tried. Lathering does take a little longer but of course the hardness of your water makes all the difference. Once lathered it provides a nice shave with good glide and the lather doesn&#x27;t dissipate as fast as other soaps.The aroma is also nice but not overpowering. If you are having trouble lathering check out some of the videos on YouTube.</li>
    <li> This is the second time buying this product. I wish it lathered up better but, we have heavy water so nothing else I tried lathers well either. No over powering smells, just clean.</li>
    <li> Super.  Favorite shave soap so far-ok just 3 tried but still, the fave.  Great lather, holds up to hot water before working with brush.</li>
    <li> I know alot of people have said this soap is hard to lather. With a Parker synthetic brush this thing lathered beautifully from the get go. I think the water I have is medium hardness, so I don&#x27;t have it really bad on that front. If you can get a good lather with this soap then I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is what you&#x27;d expect a sheep and a fresh load of laundry to smell like, it&#x27;s very refreshing clean and brings up good memories of Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The post-shave feel is ultimate. You won&#x27;t need a balm or moisturizer due to the lanolin content that this has.</li>
