      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>and it came with large velcro strips covering two of the screw holes.</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described, a heavy-duty, black powder coated metal rack for safely holding hot dryers, straighteners, and irons.</li>
      <li>The product makes it seem like it&#x27;s ready for mounting</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I had him put it up higher on the wall next to the sink</li>
      <li>; flat iron barely fits in one.</li>

<ol>
    <li> No instructions on how to install.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well with all my tools. Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition for my cabinet!</li>
    <li> Worked as it should. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Comes with velcro inforcements that I used instead of screwing it into my vanity which I like.  Velcro is very strong in holding my blowdryer, hair straightner and 1 in curing iron. I no longer have to put the hot items on my vanity top and they wont fall off the vanity and hit the ground which helps.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
    <li> No directions on how to install clamp and it came with large velcro strips covering two of the screw holes.</li>
    <li> love the option of wall hanging or on portable trolley edge</li>
    <li> Holds my wand and straightener perfectly. My blow dryer will not fit in the slot with the concentrator attachment on it is the only thing I dislike about it. I attached it on the side of a shelf I have in my bathroom and the clamp holds very well with all slots filled.</li>
    <li> Would be nice if it included a mount but it doesn&#x27;t.  The product makes it seem like it&#x27;s ready for mounting but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Good price quick ship good product</li>
    <li> Other than a minor issue with mounting this on the wall, I love the space this gives for a great hairstyling area!</li>
    <li> It had a lip on the back side that was not shown.  Cannot install flush on side of table</li>
    <li> Better than I expected-it is perfect for containing everything!</li>
    <li> Love this holder!  Exactly what I needed, keeps my appliances off the counter and cords&lt;br /&gt;from a tangled mess.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This did not work out for me because of the size - but it was good quality.</li>
    <li> No instillation instructions</li>
    <li> Thought this would easily mount to the wall or the option of a shelf mount - but hubs had to get creative. He first attached it to a piece of wood like it was on a shelf- and then anchored to wall. I had him put it up higher on the wall next to the sink so the cords are up out of it. It&#x27;s also way out of reach of the little hands. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Solid, safe, inobtrusive, holds hair dryer, and three irons, while attached to the top edge of the dresser, like a desk lamp. One of the best finds at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and how versatile it is. U can clamp it to your counter or attach it to your wall.  I would rate 5 stars if the other 3 round holders were different sizes.  My 1 1/2&amp;#34; flat iron barely fits in one.</li>
    <li> Screw  holes don&#x27;t  match  up. It is unusable.</li>
    <li> No directions on how to mount on wall!!</li>
    <li> Works great! I clamped it on to the side of my cabinet and it&#x27;s super sturdy. I had to peel off the Velcro that it comes with to be able to screw the clamp on.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described, a heavy-duty, black powder coated metal rack for safely holding hot dryers, straighteners, and irons. I mounted it on the inside of a cabinet door in my wife&#x27;s dressing vanity. It is sized perfectly for her appliances. Screw holes are already stamped in the metal strap for easy, secure mounting. We did not need the supplied clamp.</li>
    <li> I Had to make some mods since the vanity had a beveled edge.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for home use in my bathroom. It&#x27;s hard to attach to the wall because of the angle. The slots are too small for curling irons and flat irons...I ended up putting my brushes in it</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep my beauty appliances organized and out of the way!</li>
    <li> Love it! Really easy to set up.</li>
