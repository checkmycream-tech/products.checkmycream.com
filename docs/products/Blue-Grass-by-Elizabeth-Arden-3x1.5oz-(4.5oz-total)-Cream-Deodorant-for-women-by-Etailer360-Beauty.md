    <li> Blue Grass by Elizabeth Arden is a great deodorant!!  It goes on smooth, no clumps, no white residue.  And keeps you fresh all day.</li>
    <li> This product has been used by my family for over 50 years and we wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s the best.    Blue Grass Strong,  Victoria, Texas</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 48 years and recently helped save an actress&#x27; career by recommending it to her.  For years I tried every product on the market with no good results. I was desparate because my problem was causing the arm pits of my clothes to rot out.  Then I happened on this one, which not only solved the problem, it smelled great, did not build up on my clothes, and stopped the odor problem completely.  Since I can&#x27;t buy it in my home state, I now purchase it on line in lots of 6 or 10 at a time to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but when something works this well, you just don&#x27;t try to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 67 years.  Nice to have a product that is a favorite available for so long a time.</li>
    <li> i have allergy problems with most deoderants, i have used blugrass for several years with excellent results . this product is not well distributed  and at times i have had problems finding it in stock</li>
    <li> Using this for about 50 years it has always been 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deodorant on the market.  You stay dry and it has a delicate scent that is not over powering.  You can wear black and it does not leave white marks!!  I believe this product has been around since the 1930&#x27;s and no modern deodorant can beat it.  Believe me, I have tried.  You will not be disappointed with this.  It is difficult to find in the department stores, so I was happy to see it on Amazon for a better price than that found in department stores.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever! Been using this deodorant for decades. It works in every way and makes your armpits smell good all day.</li>

    <li> This my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant. She really likes it and wont use anything else</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for over 10 years and I have found that you can get it for less by ordering online.  I love that you can get shipping included if you buy enough and just stock up.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I&#x27;m allergic to almost every thing I have tried . Blue grass doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of irritation .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best of the best.</li>
    <li> Timeless, I&#x27;ve been using this for years and use nothing else.  Just love the fragrance and it works!</li>

    <li> Great service great price</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! It was delivered quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t count the years&amp;#34; it&#x27;s been so many.  I purchased it when I was having those fun &amp;#34;Hot Flashes&amp;#34; &amp; needed something to help because I was working in an office at the time.  It is a roll-on not a spray &amp; kept me dry &amp; didn&#x27;t soil my cloths.  I used to purchase it at a department store but found Amazon is more affordable.  It seems to have a long shelf life so three tubes is a perfect amt.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass Cream Deodorant or other fragrances by Elizabeth Arden for more than 40 years.  I began using them as a teenager to prevent the bumps that I sometimes had after shaving under my arms and have never stopped.  I have recommended it&#x27;s use to my children, grandchildren, family and friends.  So far everyone had experienced the same result and I highly recommend its use.  Over the 40+ years and despite any changes in the company, this product has remained the same product I used as a teenager!!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  My mother always used this while I was growing up.  I now use it and love the light fragrance and how well the deodorant works!</li>
    <li> The best deodorant ever!</li>
    <li> Product and delivery were as expected.</li>
    <li> delivery and product as expected, excellent.</li>
    <li> Great buyer! Will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift. It is fine.</li>
    <li> What a deal!! love this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase again.  When I received these all 3 deodorants did not work. The cream is suppose to come out at the top and I tried for awhile and nothing happened.  Can&#x27;t use them and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
