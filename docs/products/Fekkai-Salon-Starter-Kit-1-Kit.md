      <li>trying!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>these are worth</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair which is also colored,  I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is an economical way to try the other two products which are good as well</li>
      <li>The conditioner works as well as any other good quality brand.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of the Fekkai Color Care and had to try it right away.  </li>
      <li>This product works beautiful on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the high price.</li>
      <li>can feel it with first wash- highly recommend</li>
      <li>It looks brighter, and much fuller.  </li>
      <li>well so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>

      <li>well worth the money makes your hair shiney and soft, just try it</li>
      <li>Love the Fekkai line of products and this little starter kit (which I bought for my travel bag) included a $10 coupon off the purchase of two Fekkai items.  </li>
      <li>Not really a complaint as it makes no claims at detangling.</li>
      <li>I knew that I loved the mask but was anxious to try the regular conditioner and this sampler gave me that opportunity.</li>

      <li>It left my hair easy to comb through (even while wet!)</li>
      <li>It leaves my rather coarse curly hair very silky.  </li>
      <li>Completely feel scammed.</li>
      <li>It leaves her hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I only had to straighten the ends of my normally frizzy wavy hair.</li>
      <li>and even the next day, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smelled just as nice as the shampoo, but I found it a bit difficult to rinse out.</li>
      <li>For the price, I would have expected a LOT more &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34;, but there are less expensive products out there that do a better job....</li>

    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample packet of the shampoo and conditioner and full tub of the mask. The shampoo is lovely! It smells like grapefruit (in a good way!) and is easy to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner I was less impressed with. It smelled just as nice as the shampoo, but I found it a bit difficult to rinse out. It also left my hair a little tough to comb through. Not really a complaint as it makes no claims at detangling. Just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is AMAZING! It had a lighter scent, and was very easy to rinse. It left my hair easy to comb through (even while wet!) and even the next day, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend the shampoo and mask. The conditioner was so-so for me.</li>
    <li> these are the best shampoo and conditioners on the market- leaves hair amazingly soft and silky- can feel it with first wash- highly recommend</li>
    <li> My hair was relaxed and was not frizzy after it air dried. I only had to straighten the ends of my normally frizzy wavy hair.</li>

    <li> I have been receiving this for a while and love the shampoo and this time it came and was a fraction of the size it had been!  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!!!!!!  I have tried many very expensive salon shampoos.  This is the one I like the best.  It leaves my rather coarse curly hair very silky.  My color-treated, dry hair also has more body and natural wave than I have seen in a long time. Love both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shampoo/conditioner combos to keep my hair color from fading and the shine leaving all together. Your product is the only one that I have used where I do not see any fading shampoo to shampoo. I know it has to be leaving but the amount is so tiny, you don&#x27;t notice it and you almost feel like the last application you put on will be the last time you have to endure any coloring sessions. A big bonus is the shine. My husband noticed that my hair has a sheen that was never there months after coloring, usually its getting dull and dry. I will use this product from now on and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> The shampoo really cleanses your hair (I like that), so use sparingly. The conditioner works great, the masque works well too.</li>
    <li> Without notification that the subscribe and save product has changed Amazon sent it anyway! Completely feel scammed. I have been ordering this on subscribe and save for over a year and all of a sudden each bottle is 2oz instead of 4oz.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like a haystack.</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai products.  They last forever and they work.  These starter kits are perfect for travel as well as a perfect little surprise gift for the girl who loves to try different products.  And, the conditioner makes a great substitute for shaving cream.  No, I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
    <li> All you receive here is the travel size. I ordered this by subscription to get monthly  full size.  I thought that was a very good deal, but that deal was cancelled before it started!  So I cancelled paying $15.00 for one travel size set. I thought I would get the full size!  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the high price.</li>
    <li> This product works beautiful on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. It leaves her hair soft and shiny. I buy the starter kits to use for travel but these are a great way to try out the products and find what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Suds well so you don&#x27;t have to use as much. This is an economical way to try the other two products which are good as well</li>
    <li> Great kit, quick shipping, the box was a bit destroyed but it did not affect the quality of the products inside.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which is also colored,  I love this product.  My hair has never looked or felt better.  the color stays so much longer, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great travel kit....I took these items on a trip to Euope this summer and the size was perfect!  Love all 3 products!</li>
    <li> Love the Fekkai line of products and this little starter kit (which I bought for my travel bag) included a $10 coupon off the purchase of two Fekkai items.  Sweet!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Fekkai Color Care and had to try it right away.  My hair has been so lifeless lately, and the color seemed so dull.  I tried it last night, and was very happy when I brushed it out this morning.  It looks brighter, and much fuller.  Today is damp and humid, and no frizzies either.  Will definitely continue using Fekkai products!  I received the sample for review purposes through Influenster.</li>
    <li> For the price, I would have expected a LOT more &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34;, but there are less expensive products out there that do a better job....this one isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but it isn&#x27;t stupendous either.</li>
    <li> They were a pretty good size, and after washing my hair it smelt really good and made my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for colored hair, especially blonde or highlighted and also great for travel.  It&#x27;s not always the easiest to find anymore.  I love that I can get anything in this line from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried the Fekkai Tech. Color Care products this weeks. It included a sample of the shampoo and conditioner and the hair mask. I like that they all included grape seed oil. The mask had a wonderful scent and it was by far my favorite product. If your looking for products that help with your color treated hair  these are worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
