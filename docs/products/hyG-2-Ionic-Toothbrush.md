<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My family has used nothing but these for a very long time. My sister went to the dentist for a chipped tooth. It had been 5 years since she had been in.  He fixed it and told her there was no need for a cleaning since there was nothing to clean.  That&#x27;s how well this ionic toothbrush works for us!&lt;br /&gt;  It only works if you hold it correctly, which is not difficult.  The base works well for a couple years, easily.  A lot cheaper than dental bills!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the HyG Ionic toothbrushes since I saw the infomercial on TV way back in the early 90&#x27;s. I would never use anything else. My teeth are smooth as glass. When I go to the dentist they never have much calculus to scrape off. It works better than any brush with a motor. People are skeptical because it doesn&#x27;t have one but if you try it you&#x27;ll never go back to the motorized brushes. They&#x27;re a complete waste of money. The batteries in the last at 2 years and you only have to replace the heads once in a while. Do your teeth and pocketbook a favor and switch to HyG Ionic!</li>
    <li> I too bought the original 3 piece tooth brush when it first came out. Came with a VCR tape about the science of how it works. Before I bought this toothbrush, when I would get my teeth cleaned every six months, it took two full sessions to get all the plaque off. Immediately after starting to use the tooth brush, it went to one session. The battery lasts forever. I think I&#x27;ve only had two handles w/battery in more than 15 years, and that is only because the first handle broke after many years. The bristle end last longer than most tooth brushes. I now use the Hydro Floss brand (a water jet) machine to strengthen/clean my gums and \\&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; Brushpicks to clean up stubborn plaque in conjunction with the hy-G toothbrush and I&#x27;m in and out of the dentist&#x27;s office in a hurry. Deep pockets have filled back in and Cleanings are a breeze. Use this brush correctly and it will make a big difference to your teeth and wallet.</li>
    <li> This product does work! I wanted to buy it when it first came out on the market years ago but I was dissuaded by a well meaning person -- I&#x27;ve wished I wouldn&#x27;t had listen. My teeth have deteriorated since and I&#x27;ve tried everything -- ultrasonic toothbrushes, dental picks, baking soda, etc. So years later I decided to give this product a try. It works -- it leaves my teeth feeling very smooth and clean and it&#x27;s very gentle. I don&#x27;t quite understand the science behind it all, I know it&#x27;s that it works. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s the best thing I have bought so far.</li>
    <li> I use this toothbrush and a certain brand of toothpaste daily and have found both items to be quite useful in cleaning my mouth and the bones within it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a while but not long enough to decide if it really helps with tartar control.  i need to use it for a longer period of time before i can really rate it.</li>
    <li> Wow! I knew about these toothbrushes because my dad did the clinical trials with them! My friends love to get these as gifts from me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for many years. It works as it is supposed to. That&#x27;s why i keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  Teeth feel clean.  Easy to use.  My wife likes it too. Just have to keep finger on the metal.</li>
    <li> Used this toothbrush system for years and works great.  The unit I received didn&#x27;t look like the picture shown.  I was hoping to get the newer version and instead received the old version.  The system is still great, but the picture is misleading.</li>
    <li> The normal sonic toothbrushes are around $100. Same technology here only MUCH cheaper and it works! Serioulsy at least the last four years there is nothing to clean from my teeth at the dentist.  I love it. My teeth are white and healthy. I get complements on how well I take care of my teeth..it is THIS toothbrush! You can replace the heads on this toothbrush. I do about every six months. If you brush like a banshee then maybe you need to replace them more but they hold up well. The brush itself has a button you can push to make sure its still working like it should and it likes a little light up. I have replace my brush after about three years.  All and all not a bad investment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is by touching the metal part on the toothbrush with a wet finger (falls right where you would hold on it anyway) it somehow reverses the polarity and blasts the plaque from your teeth. They aren&#x27;t kidding.  So if you are the banshee/ or gorilla kind of brusher  you can lighten up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two super toothpastes:  [[ASIN:B000OV5QWM Thieves Dentarome Ultra Toothpaste With Xylitol by Young Living - 4.1oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Gives you super white teeth but not fake, really clean.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0080L9FUM Earthpaste Amazingly Natural Toothpaste-Cinnamon 4 Ounces]]  There are two other kinds of wintergreen and peppermint but I am totally addicted to cinnamon. Careful though is is slick coming out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I bought another hyG toothbrush because I couldn&#x27;t find my battery checker from my last hyG toothbrush from a decade ago. I have just been replacing the heads and continuing to brush. Murphy&#x27;s Law occurred and I found the checker the day my new brush came. After 10 years, this thing is still good! Now I have a backup. These things are amazing! I have had other electric toothbrushes, but my teeth feel cleaner with Listerine and the hyG toothbrush. My dentist agrees! Do not hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> I do not recall Dr name on product.  I am not home to look.  With first use some receding gums bled.  Mouth feels clean after use.  Need to use it longer to see effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Only toothbrush I use. Finally I&#x27;m getting results and there is minimal tartar at check ups. . Go online and read about how it works</li>
    <li> the bristles are way too soft and I have yet to find the time to figure out if its on or not.</li>
    <li> Way overpriced, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I had read an article on line about the merits of ionized tooth brushes and decided to give it a try. I was very pleased with the results because my teeth are squeaky clean at the end of using this brush. They do feel as if I&#x27;ve just been to a good dental hygienist. Sorry Europe, but you don&#x27;t know that art too well. I&#x27;m an American living abroad and have no luck even finding an efficient hygienist for my teeth and gums. This ionizing brush and some good dental floss is my substitute and, I must say, I&#x27;m thrilled with the result. Given that it has now been proven that plaque and sores on the gums cause cancer as well as heart disease, it&#x27;s something we should all be taking very seriously.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does exactly what it says it will do. After about 5 days of twice a day tooth brushing with this brush, my teeth and gums were so clean that my teeth feel like porcelain. I won&#x27;t be without this brush again - plus it&#x27;s a very soft bristle brush, which my dentist likes. There were several replacement heads sent with the toothbrush, so hopefully by the time the battery (non-replaceable) in this brush runs out, I will be ready for not only a new brush but more refills. Very nicely done. Wish I had known about this product many years ago.</li>
    <li> Since I started using the brush a month ago, some dark stains on my bottom front teeth have gone away. I like the narrow head for reaching back teeth, and I have high hopes for a better checkup in a few months. If some pockets along my gum line have decreased in depth, I&#x27;ll be singing the praises of this toothbrush for evermore.</li>
    <li> Had one of these years ago and loved it.  I had no idea they still made them until I saw it on AMAZON.  They are as good now as always.  They work great and if you DO have sensitivity with your teeth, just don&#x27;t use it everyday.  I take about 2 days off a week and have had no problems.  I simply brush my teeth with my electric.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
    <li> as mentioned - love Dr Tung products - been using for years - best I have found so far!</li>
