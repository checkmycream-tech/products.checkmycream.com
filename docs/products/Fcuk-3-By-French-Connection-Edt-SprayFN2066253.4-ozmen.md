      <li>A good every day cologne, you will enjoy it, not to strong.  </li>
      <li>Smells awesome, I always get complements, my girlfriend loves it, it lasts about 8 hours and its only $20</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me of that smell you get hit with when walking into a Hippie/Bohemian type store, but it has a cleanliness about it that you don&#x27;t sense in most of those stores.</li>
      <li>absolutely LOVE this cologne.</li>

      <li>sadly it only lasts a hour at the most and that is with 5 &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY unless u r interested in using 25% of bottle..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely weaker than Armani, and not as spicy, more</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a really pleasant fragance, it is not over powering, does not smell like soap or anything cheap, this smells like the really expensive stuff, it reminds me a little of some of the Hugo Boss or Paco Rabane fragances.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this and a really discounted Christian Audigier for men EDT</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t last as long or project as much as Armani either.</li>

    <li> This was a gift for my dad since he accidentally broke the one he was using previously (a really expensive one) and was not able to replace it yet.  So I tried to help and Amazon to the rescue suggested this based on my search history, and nailed it!!  I was a little worried because of the low price but figured I would give this a try.  I am really happy I did.  I purchased this and a really discounted Christian Audigier for men EDT (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002XITZDA/ref&#x3D;wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;colid&#x3D;285M48UAI8HXD&amp;coliid&#x3D;I6FDW3ASOBHM0&amp;psc&#x3D;1) with both purchases I spent less than a third of what the one my dad was using before and they smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really pleasant fragance, it is not over powering, does not smell like soap or anything cheap, this smells like the really expensive stuff, it reminds me a little of some of the Hugo Boss or Paco Rabane fragances.  As I said it was a gift for my dad, he is a doctor so he needs a long wear fragance that is pleasant throughout the day and this one makes the cut, don&#x27;t hessitate to purchase it, you will be pleased or you will have a great gift for someone special :)</li>
    <li> Not a smell I like, too sweet but not horrible</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, in protected wrapping, and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Great scent. I love it however......sadly it only lasts a hour at the most and that is with 5 &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34;. Nonetheless great cologne, just wished it had a longer duration so to speak</li>

    <li> Scent is wonderful received complements from all who got close, many inquired where can I get that for my husband and boyfriend!</li>
    <li> Different smell. A cheaper version of Armani I thought. Kind of had that Armani smell and it lasted all day and well into the evening.</li>
    <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice scent 3 smells lite and sensual  and lasts 3 hours .. great price anthing south of twenty bucks</li>
    <li> Really good smell. For casual use</li>
    <li> A great gift!!! Smells absolutely great!!!!</li>
    <li> A good every day cologne, you will enjoy it, not to strong.  Very inexpensive.  Get a bottle today.  Have a good day.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, I always get complements, my girlfriend loves it, it lasts about 8 hours and its only $20</li>
    <li> Update: 4-17-2013: a replacement was sent, spry pomp works perfectly. thanks!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived today.. Spry pomp won&#x27;t work and I&#x27;m trying to return this defective product and find it Extremely cumbersome to impossible . I&#x27;M NOT HAPPY. BUYERS!! BEWEAR!!!!</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE this cologne. It smells so good!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Bottle design sucks.. It was very hard to use it from the day 1 but after I used 1/4th of bottle, the spray just stopped working.. I have 3/4th perfume left but unfortunately can&#x27;t use it.. DO NOT BUY unless u r interested in using 25% of bottle..</li>
    <li> Reminds me of Armani however not exactly the same. It&#x27;s definitely weaker than Armani, and not as spicy, more sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last as long or project as much as Armani either. Very Good sent though, making it my daily. Great value.</li>
    <li> I like this scent, It has hints of sandalwood and lavender, and maybe a pinch of a patchouli type smell. Kinda musky too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of that smell you get hit with when walking into a Hippie/Bohemian type store, but it has a cleanliness about it that you don&#x27;t sense in most of those stores.</li>
