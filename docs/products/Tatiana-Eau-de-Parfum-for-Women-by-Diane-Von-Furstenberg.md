      <li>I was thrilled to locate it here.</li>

      <li>Best price, fast service, and this has been me for many years.</li>
      <li>Bought it as a Christmas gift for my mother, she loves it and she´s super happy with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong and it just...stinks.  </li>
      <li>Keep the dazzling original in your memory and avoid this.</li>
      <li>The original Tatiana was one of the great perfumes:  heady, exotic, sensual, the essence of womanity.  </li>
      <li>She loved it, just what she wanted,  will buy this item again and highly recommend this great item for any lady.</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful light (yet noticeable) floral fragrance (primarily jasmine)</li>
      <li>Really happy to have found it, and if I remember right, the price is about what I used to pay for it.</li>
      <li>I just love the fragrance, and have never found another that I like as well.  </li>
      <li>one of the most feminine perfumes ever love it.  </li>
      <li>The Easter Bunny left this in the basket of someone very wonderful....</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>But I fell in love with it at 21, and it&#x27;s always been my favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>My all time favorite frangrance.</li>
      <li>So glad it is still around.</li>
      <li>I have used this for many years and love it.</li>
      <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used many more costly scents.  </li>
      <li>I bought my 1st bottle of Tatiana more years ago than I care to admit to.  </li>
      <li>Men love it.</li>
      <li>This perfume was my go to perfume for many years and then it vanished.</li>
      <li>As a kid this was my favorite  </li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>but I do love it.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it again at such a great price and shared it with my daughter.  </li>
      <li>Diane Von Furstenberg has proven that lovely, fine colognes ARE affordable.</li>
      <li>The scent is a light floral but to my nose it has more alcohol scent than fragrance.</li>
      <li>found coco mademoiselle fit me better.</li>
      <li>I have used Tatiana for 30 years, and am so pleased to still be able to order it, especially at such a great price</li>
      <li>It is strong and made me want to gag.</li>
      <li>I wore Tatiana for the entire 80&#x27;s decade and it was light, airy and absolutely beautiful.  </li>
      <li>She said it&#x60;s fine, but probably she didn&#x60;t want to disappoint me.</li>
      <li>Like I said though the item arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older but my olfactory senses still recognize unique, pleasant, and familiar smells.  </li>
      <li>It may sound like something your grandma would wear, and she might.  </li>
      <li>I liked the scent so much that I asked her what it was.</li>
      <li>I prefer light fragrances, but this one becomes almost nonexistent, almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>I ended up bringing into work and set it on a table for someone to take for free.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume and you really cannot find it retail, so being able to buy it through Amazon has been so convenient.</li>
      <li>This is an older perfume, but the aroma brings back wonderful memories with my wife.  </li>
      <li>The light clean fragrance was there.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and smells just as I remember :)</li>
      <li>If you have never used the original, you may like it.</li>
      <li>A rare find!  </li>
      <li>Unlike the original.</li>
      <li>I love that it smells like a perfume made directly from flowers, rather than an abstract fragrance like most perfumes.</li>
      <li>A light fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I was waiting for the floral, sweet scent, that never happened.</li>
      <li>It had a great fragrance, and I always got asked (by other women)</li>
      <li>I was hoping that maybe one of her older ones would be just as good and would hold me until I get my boyfriend to buy me the new one for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>I tried Diane VonFurstenburg&#x27;s new one and fell in love but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $95 for it.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the fragrance as much now as I did when I was rocking out in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I was really amazed that this perfume is available now.  </li>
      <li>Just as I had expected, I had been looking around for this item for quite some time, now I have it and at a GOOD price.</li>
      <li>It is still a nice fragrance but not quite the same.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s intensely floral, but clean, not heady.  </li>
      <li>absolutely i could not find any identity in this scent, reminded me what my grandmother would wear on a special occasions, as she never wore any perfumes.</li>
      <li>I used this perfume in the mid-80s when it first came out.</li>
      <li>and it did not look pretty.</li>
      <li>This was my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance for MANY years - till it suddenly vanished from the market.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>It is the perfume that she wore when we first dated and got married over 26 years ago.  </li>
      <li>my mother found me a bottle at a discount store once and said she used to wear it in the 70s before she married my dad.</li>
      <li>I was so glad that I found it after the last bottle was gone.  </li>
      <li>This is not the original Tatiana that you may remember from the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Once again I got sucked in by positive reviews of a product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time lovely perfume</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great. Love it.</li>
    <li> I wore this 30+ years ago in high school.  It was my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent, and I still love it for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> The initial spray, each time, is a fragrant walk down memory lane.  I used this scent for years and then it became difficult and then impossible to find.  I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon.  The price is right and the fragrance is as I remembered, or at least the first spray, but the scent is very fleeting. I prefer light fragrances, but this one becomes almost nonexistent, almost immediately.  NonnieB</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! Tatiana is hard to find and in the past, I had bought some that didn&#x27;t smell right. This was perfect!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this again.  I&#x27;ve worn it forever, and was really upset when it was discontinued.  I just love the fragrance, and have never found another that I like as well.  Really happy to have found it, and if I remember right, the price is about what I used to pay for it.</li>
    <li> A rare find!  This was my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance for MANY years - till it suddenly vanished from the market.  I was thrilled to locate it here.</li>
    <li> It smells great! Just as I remembered!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite frangrance.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed that this perfume is available now.  There has not been any other perfume I have smelled or used that has the smell of this one.  Every one around me asks me what perfume i am wearing. I like fragances that do not overwhelm, but that can turn heads.  This one, definetely is the one.</li>
    <li> I wore this as my spring fragrance in high school.  It was pricey at the time.  I was thrilled to find it again at such a great price and shared it with my daughter.  She said \\&quot;mom, that smells delicious; it smells like spring\\&quot;.  Light, not too sweet floral, just smells great!</li>
    <li> I thought since the perfume was from Diane Von Furstenbergy it would be very nice but I was wrong.  I read other reviews and thought I would enjoy it.  I would have returned it but I apparently you aren&#x27;t permitted to return perfume because it is flamable.  The perfume was too strong and not appealing at all.  I ended up bringing into work and set it on a table for someone to take for free.  It smelled too bad to give away as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this fragrance again, and for a great price! I&#x27;ve never been much for perfume, but this is one of a handful of exceptions. my mother found me a bottle at a discount store once and said she used to wear it in the 70s before she married my dad. i gave it a try and i loved it! I adore jasmine, and this fragrance smells like spring and life. I love that it smells like a perfume made directly from flowers, rather than an abstract fragrance like most perfumes. smells like a beautiful spring day!</li>
    <li> Love this.  It was as scent my mom used to wear and I am pleased to say it is still a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift for my mother, she loves it and she´s super happy with it.  It smells great.</li>
    <li> I have loved Tatiana since the &#x27;70s! A light fresh scent. It always reminds me of summer.</li>
    <li> One of my old time favs</li>
    <li> my daughter was very happy that I was able to find this for her</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and smells just as I remember :)</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this particular perfume for over 10 years!  I was so glad that I found it after the last bottle was gone.  I always get compliments when I wear this, so I have never bought anything other than Tatiana and I never will as long as this brand continues.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the product itself because I bought it for a gift. It was very poorly packaged; the actual perfume box was damaged. Very disappointing because like I said before I bought it for a gift and it did not look pretty.</li>
    <li> Once again I got sucked in by positive reviews of a product.  I tried Diane VonFurstenburg&#x27;s new one and fell in love but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $95 for it.  I was hoping that maybe one of her older ones would be just as good and would hold me until I get my boyfriend to buy me the new one for Christmas.  So this one was inexpensive and had good reviews so I bought it.  BIG MISTAKE.  It&#x27;s very strong and it just...stinks.  I didn&#x27;t even try to give it away. In the trash it went...</li>
    <li> As a kid this was my favorite  B-)&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised to find it here.</li>
    <li> I used to love this fragrance, but in the late 80&#x27;s it seemed to change and I did not like it anymore.  Has anyone else noticed this?    I wish the original fragrance would come back, I wore it when it first came out in 1975 until about 1987 when it changed.</li>
    <li> This perfume was my go to perfume for many years and then it vanished. I saw it here at Amazon and couldn&#x27;t resist. It arrived well packaged and I ripped it open to get a smell. It&#x27;s just like I remember it. The light clean fragrance was there. I can&#x27;t wait to go somewhere to wear it out. Hope I never loose it again.</li>
    <li> I have worn no other perfume but Tatiana since 1980! It has a beautiful light (yet noticeable) floral fragrance (primarily jasmine) that is not overbearing or annoying to those around you. I have tested other perfumes out of curiosity and will purchase nothing else but Tatiana.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume and you really cannot find it retail, so being able to buy it through Amazon has been so convenient. The price is reasonable for this perfume as well.  I have seen this sold at flea markets, but I am always skeptical of whether it is the real thing or a knock off.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought my 1st bottle of Tatiana more years ago than I care to admit to.  It served me well in the 70&#x27;s.  I ran out of my last bottle several years ago and actually forgot about it.  I intended to order a bottle of Diane for a relative and mistakenly bought Tatiana instead.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and immediately began using Tatiana again.  I enjoy the fragrance as much now as I did when I was rocking out in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m older but my olfactory senses still recognize unique, pleasant, and familiar smells.  I won&#x27;t forget to reorder Tatiana when my \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; supply gets low.  Over the years I&#x27;ve used many more costly scents.  Diane Von Furstenberg has proven that lovely, fine colognes ARE affordable.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mom who&#x60;s name is Tatiana. It was a surprise for her. I&#x60;ve read a reviews and took a risk to buy it. Be honest I don&#x60;t like it at all and I have a difficulties with a UPS to return it. So, I gave it to my mom. She said it&#x60;s fine, but probably she didn&#x60;t want to disappoint me. But we are all different and you will like this scent. Who knows?</li>
    <li> She loved it, just what she wanted,  will buy this item again and highly recommend this great item for any lady.</li>
    <li> I received this perfume very quickly and in great condition. But it smelled old, not a pretty fragrance. My friend wears this and I alway ask her what is it you wear, because I want to get it. Well, you can&#x27;t return cologne because of it&#x27;s flammability, or I would trust me.Like I said though the item arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> In the late 70&#x27;s on a flight to St. Maarten I met a model who was wearing Tatiana. I liked the scent so much that I asked her what it was. For years after that I always wore Tatiana...until I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in the stores. I thought maybe it was discontinued. I was so happy to find it at Amazon, and at a good price as well. I definitely will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My first fave perfume, and have been without it too long! What a treat to find it here, and for 15 dollars ! The smell is exactly as I remember, soft and feminine. I will use this seller and product again and again!</li>
    <li> My friend really loves this fragrance and could not find it any longer in the department stores.  She does not have a coimputer and could not access the internet to look for this.  I found it for her and gave her 4 bottles as a gift.  She loveds it</li>
    <li> this was too old fashioned per my taste.  very chap smelling fragrance. very flowery and absolutely i could not find any identity in this scent, reminded me what my grandmother would wear on a special occasions, as she never wore any perfumes. bought this fragrance based on the reviews i read and unfortunately ended up using it as a bathroom freshener. my mother didn&#x27;t like it also.</li>
    <li> Definately not  the scent that it use to be.  It really stinks on me.  Sorry for the review.  Nothing personal.</li>
    <li> This is an older perfume, but the aroma brings back wonderful memories with my wife.  It is the perfume that she wore when we first dated and got married over 26 years ago.  We cannot find it at places where they sell perfume, so I was ecstatic to be able to find it online and order it for her (for me) for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and have not heard how she liked it. I tested it and it was a medium-light scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume inspite of the negative reviews it recieved. We, I should have gone along with the negative reviews. It is AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the same aroma as the old perfume. I sprayed it on and was not impressed. I was waiting for the floral, sweet scent, that never happened. No, I would not give this a go.</li>
    <li> one of the most feminine perfumes ever love it.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This perfume is deliciously fragrant with flowers.  Men love it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a christmas gift and the bottle was poorly packaged and it arrived broken on my footsteps. I don&#x27;t see any options listed to return it for a refund or at least exchange it like the some of the other products has listed. Disappointed in the results and only about 3/4 is left and the top is broken, there is absolutely no way I can give this a gift.</li>
    <li> Diane Von Furstenberg wrecked her name here by brandishing it all over this fragrance. It is not worth the amount of money I paid.</li>
    <li> The original Tatiana was one of the great perfumes:  heady, exotic, sensual, the essence of womanity.  As often happens in the perfume world, a perfume house can&#x27;t leave well enough alone and &amp;#34;improves&amp;#34; the scent by reformulating it.  Reformulations are rarely improvements(or even necessary).  The original little beauty is now just a witch&#x27;s caldron of cheap, stinky chemicals.  Keep the dazzling original in your memory and avoid this.</li>
    <li> Just as I had expected, I had been looking around for this item for quite some time, now I have it and at a GOOD price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the same scent that I used to buy in the 80&#x27;s, but still delivers a nice, just-showered fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this she has been looking all over for it. I looked on Amazon and Tada there it was. I surprised her with it and she received it delivered at the door, she couldn&#x27;t believe it , the excitement on her face was wonderful.</li>
    <li> My fave from way back, still has the old fashion smell.  Of coarse I won&#x27;t be wearing it every day but I do love it.</li>
    <li> a special spray.not like the common ones I used.It really suits women in love.&lt;br /&gt;I found coco mademoiselle fit me better.Spray means one&#x27;s scent or charactor from other aspect,I think.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and love it. So glad it is still around. Will keep on buying as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> Best price, fast service, and this has been me for many years. People always ask me who I am wearing, so others like it as well.</li>
    <li> The back of the box says \\&quot;jasmine, gardenia and honeysuckle,\\&quot; and that is what it smells like to me.  It may sound like something your grandma would wear, and she might.  But I fell in love with it at 21, and it&#x27;s always been my favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s intensely floral, but clean, not heady.  Very feminine, and yes, men like it.</li>
    <li> I have used Tatiana for 30 years, and am so pleased to still be able to order it, especially at such a great price</li>
    <li> This is not the original Tatiana that you may remember from the early 80&#x27;s. Not even close to what it use to be.</li>
    <li> My mother passed away recently and a small bottle of this was in her belongings. I liked the smell and used it all. I thought since I liked the one my mom had so well that I would look for it and purchase a new one. This is definitely NOT the same one that I used!  Although this has the same name, it is not the same scent. It is strong and made me want to gag. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off. The other one had a fresh light floral scent. This one seems heavy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: When I tried to send it back Amazon I found out that they will not take it back. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I gave a rating of 5 stars because this IS a great perfume.  I wore it a long time ago, but its been rather hard to find lately.  I was so happy to find it offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this perfume in the mid-80s when it first came out. It had a great fragrance, and I always got asked (by other women) what do you wear? What is that? I used to say, hey get your own scent! Then it vanished. Years later re-surfaced. But something has changed. It is still a nice fragrance but not quite the same. I read reviews by other women who also think the formula was changed. Sad. I don&#x27;t use this, and still have more than half left. If you have never used the original, you may like it. The scent is a light floral but to my nose it has more alcohol scent than fragrance. Unlike the original.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I have found that I can wear without smelling yucky after I have had it on for awhile...And it is my grand-daughters name too!!</li>
    <li> The fragrance does not last.</li>
    <li> I wore Tatiana for the entire 80&#x27;s decade and it was light, airy and absolutely beautiful.  I ordered this bottle for nostalgia&#x27;s sake and can only say &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;!  I did a little research and found out that they changed the formula a few years back and completely destroyed my precious little gem.  Caustic, harsh and thankfully short lasting, this bottle will be thrown into my yard sale bin.</li>
    <li> Great to be able to buy it I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time lovely perfume</li>
    <li> I bought this parfum for my sons girlfriend for Christmas.  I love the scent and thought it would be perfect for her.</li>
    <li> She loves it and had lost where to find it at retailers.</li>
    <li> Lifelong favorite. Very hard to find now</li>
    <li> My sister had used this perfume for years and was unable to find it any longer.  So when I found it on Amazon, I rushed and bought her 3 bottles.  She still likes it, but she says that it does not smell as strong as the one she had used in the past.  I only have her experience to go on.</li>
    <li> Great buy - smells great too!</li>
    <li> The Easter Bunny left this in the basket of someone very wonderful....she loves it.  Still smells the way I remember.....</li>
