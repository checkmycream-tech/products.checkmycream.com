      <li>I love amazon.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a spa ...and what a refreshing way to smell.</li>
      <li>Then someone recommended this to me, and within a week I was significantly better.</li>

      <li>I do have friends that used this during their pregnancy and liked it, but they were also using the basq butter, so I can&#x27;t really comment as to how effective this may be.</li>
      <li>Excellent, used it during my pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.</li>
      <li>Very good,it&#x27;s good for myself</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin very nicely, leaving you feeling soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild pleasing smell to it too &amp; is not greasy.</li>
      <li>But that smell is sooooo strong of eucalyptus</li>
      <li>Although it is my favorite body oil, I can&#x27;t really comment as to how effective this product is for tightening the skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is absolutely horrid, I love the idea of this product I love that its oil and it rubs in super nice.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get huge until month 8</li>
      <li>My belly was huge and I did not get one stretch mark.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
      <li>Great product overall!</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic</li>
      <li>I am happily purchasing my second bottle and plan to continue to use it throughout the rest of my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Was not too excited about the oil when I started using it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>This body oil smells fabulous, made my skin feels soft and smooth and absorbs very quickly!  </li>
      <li>I was super happy that I had not seen a single stretch mark for months.</li>
      <li>so I was very worried about getting more stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this oil.</li>
      <li>When I was pregnant, the itch was killing me.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using this oil since I was 12 weeks pregnant.</li>
      <li>it wont leave a residue on the skin and absorbs quickly..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still pregnant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m six months pregnant.  </li>
      <li>The oil itself has a dense texture but absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue.</li>
      <li>I am 34 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>Amazing natural ingredients, smells like a spa, soaks right into skin without being greasy.</li>
      <li>The first I tried made my skin break out; the second did not have a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any permanent stains on any of my pajamas though so it might be okay.</li>
      <li>Such a nice treat</li>
      <li>It sinks in and feels really good.  </li>
      <li>but it is not greasy at all and soaks right into your skin.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this brand works really well for Pregnant women，I bought a set of body oil，all</li>
      <li>In any case, I used this regularly during my pregnancy, and it definitely feels luxurious and smells great and helps relieve itchiness on your expanding belly, but it didn&#x27;t prevent the marks.</li>
      <li>I put this on first (as recommended by the women that first sold this stuff to me) and then applied this stretch mark butter.</li>
      <li>I know it works because I didn&#x27;t start until my 5th month with my first pregnancy</li>
      <li>would definitely repurchase this :)</li>
      <li>I used during our first pregnancy,no stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I do know, however, that its scent is wonderful and unique, exotic without being heavy, and that a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I do love this product just as a regular body oil, but I will probably not purchase it again because of the high price tag.</li>
      <li>Been using it since the beggining but won&#x27;t know if it really works until the end of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on very well.</li>
      <li>not sticky but gentle moisturize my skin around belly.</li>
      <li>I never got any stretch marks throughout my whole pregnancy.</li>
      <li>And it really seems to be keeping the stretch marks at bay.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works of you are prego and trying to prevent stretch marks and keep your belly moisturized.</li>
      <li>I had my daughter 3 months ago and faithfully used this oil twice a day during my whole pregnancy.</li>
      <li>the bottle is easier to control how much you want with pressing than just pour</li>
      <li>Very mositurized not at all oily.  </li>
      <li>After using this product daily for about the last 12 weeks now my skin is already feeling very healthy and soft all the time.</li>
      <li>It sinks in very quickly and never got on my clothes or felt oily.  </li>
      <li>if I&#x27;d used more, or less, of this product.</li>
      <li>When I found out that I was pregnant with my second child, I started using the oil from the day I found out.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t completely relieve the itch, but it worked sooooo much better than any other product.</li>
      <li>Really it is just a mix of oils you can buy at a natural food market or a vitamin store.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good,it&#x27;s good for myself</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works yet.  It smells really good, but I guess because I don&#x27;t feel the tingle, I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s only been a little over a week.  No difference yet,  and I do know everything takes time.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have fairly oily skin and was concerned about an \\&quot;oil\\&quot; but it is not greasy at all and soaks right into your skin.  And it really seems to be keeping the stretch marks at bay.  Plus it smells great.  Great product overall!</li>
    <li> Excellent, used it during my pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Been using it from the end of the 1st trimester; till the 8th month as yet no stretch marks. I recommend this product . It has a very mild pleasing smell to it too &amp; is not greasy.</li>
    <li> The best! I used during our first pregnancy,no stretch marks. Hoping for the same results with the second. And, it smells great!!</li>
    <li> love the combo with the polish and cream. Such a nice treat</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using two different grocery-store bought brand oils. The first I tried made my skin break out; the second did not have a pleasant smell. This product felt great on my skin and had a very light and pleasant smell. Compared to a typical lotion, this oil does stay slicker on the skin, and I do have to wait about 10 minutes or so before I feel comfortable putting my clothes back on depending on how thickly I apply the oil. However, I&#x27;ve noticed that compared to lotions and other oils I&#x27;ve tried, this leaves my skin feeling so soft. I&#x27;m only 22 weeks in my pregnancy, so I can&#x27;t speak for any stretch marks. However, I can say that before I started using this product my skin felt incredibly itchy due to the stretching (even with my usual daily body moisturizing lotion). After using this product daily for about the last 12 weeks now my skin is already feeling very healthy and soft all the time. I usually apply this oil in the morning after the shower and at the end of the day my skin is still feeling incredibly soft and moisturized. Living in the desert climate of Phoenix, AZ, I think this says a lot! I am happily purchasing my second bottle and plan to continue to use it throughout the rest of my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this oil. I have begun giving it away as gifts. It is the only oil that I have tried that does not leave your skin the least bit greasy. It soaks in immediately and smells like you are leaving a spa. A little goes a long way. I am half way through my pregnancy, use it twice daily and am not even half way through the bottle. It is a great buy!</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely horrid, I love the idea of this product I love that its oil and it rubs in super nice. But that smell is sooooo strong of eucalyptus it&#x27;s nauseating.  I thought if I put gloves on and it&#x27;s on my belly I won&#x27;t smell it. WRONG it gets all over your clothes, you must like the smell to be able to use this. My husband was like &amp;#34;why do you smell like that&amp;#34; LOL!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month.  I do not see a difference at all.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am writing this from my husband&#x27;s account -   I am 34 weeks pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using this oil since I was 12 weeks pregnant. I applied the oil daily morning and evening and vitamin E in the middle of the day. I was super happy that I had not seen a single stretch mark for months. But then, about a week ago I noticed something in my lower belly and to my huge disappointment they were stretch marks. I am so devastated. I don&#x27;t know if I missed that area (since as the belly gets bigger it is hard to see)when applying the oil or what. Bottom line is that I still have a couple of weeks to go before I give birth and I have stretch marks. Perhaps this oil was just not right for my skin type (I am Mexican). I am now in quest to find something that will help eliminate the stretch marks I now have. Thankfully, they are only a few and are just in the lower belly but still, I wish I didn&#x27;t have any. So to all those women who are still in the early stages of their pregnancy, don&#x27;t forget to apply oil/cream, whatever to the lower belly!</li>
    <li> I used this oil and I loved it.  It smells amazing.  I recognize the name of every ingredient on the bottle.  It sinks in very quickly and never got on my clothes or felt oily.  I am not a person who would normally use an oil, but once I tried this after my OBGYN told me to go get an oil and I was hooked.  I know it works because I didn&#x27;t start until my 5th month with my first pregnancy and I got stretch marks.  When I found out that I was pregnant with my second child, I started using the oil from the day I found out.  I carried that baby differently and I did not get any new stretch marks.    I buy this oil for my sisters and best friends when they find out they are expecting and they all love it!</li>
    <li> When I was pregnant, the itch was killing me. I tried the stretch mark creams, colloidal oatmeal, rumored witch hazel, and anything I could get my hands on. Then someone recommended this to me, and within a week I was significantly better. It didn&#x27;t completely relieve the itch, but it worked sooooo much better than any other product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This oil smells nice and feels great.  However, no product will prevent stretch marks.  I had hoped this would and used it faithfully.  I didn&#x27;t get huge until month 8 and I had no stretch marks until then.  This did keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every oil and this is by far the best. Amazing natural ingredients, smells like a spa, soaks right into skin without being greasy. Layer under the body butter.</li>
    <li> I only use this under pajamas; I think it would be too oily for regular clothes. I don&#x27;t mind some oily stains on my pajamas, but not on my regular clothes. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any permanent stains on any of my pajamas though so it might be okay.</li>
    <li> I recommend this brand works really well for Pregnant women，I bought a set of body oil，all works well.</li>
    <li> Was not too excited about the oil when I started using it. Really it is just a mix of oils you can buy at a natural food market or a vitamin store.</li>
    <li> The oil itself has a dense texture but absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue. It also smells great. I had very dry skin at the end of my pregnancy and this was the only thing that stopped the crazy itching. It did not seem to do anything to prevent or repair stretch marks though. I still have zebra thighs, so I am giving 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this oil. I had my daughter 3 months ago and faithfully used this oil twice a day during my whole pregnancy. My belly was huge and I did not get one stretch mark. And it is not genes because my mother and both sisters got terrible stretchmarks with their pregnancies so I thought for sure I would get them. I used it in conjunction with the basq body scrub as well as Mama mio stretch mark cream. The oil smells amazing, like a product you would get in a spa and it absorbs very quickly, leaving a beautiful scent on your skin. I am not pregnant anymore but I am ordering another bottle because it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> not sticky but gentle moisturize my skin around belly. I stick to use it for 6months and even after giving birth to my baby.</li>
    <li> OMG,!! This stuff is fantastic it works well my stretch marks are getting lighter I been using few months now I run out almost my third bottle ,definitely recommend this oil</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use it. My young sister like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m six months pregnant.  Been using it since the beggining but won&#x27;t know if it really works until the end of pregnancy. So far I like the way it feels. I also use the Advance butter.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this stuff. He said, that stuff you put on is actually working! I never got any stretch marks throughout my whole pregnancy. The lady that sold it to me said it would get rid of pre-existing stretch marks too, but that is not true. I&#x27;m still a fan because I didn&#x27;t get any new ones. I put this on first (as recommended by the women that first sold this stuff to me) and then applied this stretch mark butter.</li>
    <li> I ordered Basq a few months into my pregnancy to avoid stretch marks. I&#x27;ve gone through 4-5 bottles using it 2-3 times a day religiously. It has helped some I believe...but in the 9th month of my pregnancy I&#x27;ve still managed to get stretch marks on my belly. It seems like basq helps to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; them some after applying it. I&#x27;m still pregnant and I&#x27;m curious to see how the marks look after baby. Basq helps but can&#x27;t guarantee zero stretch marks for sure.</li>
    <li> This oil was recommended to me to prevent stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not sure if anything could have prevented them for me.  I gained quite a bit of weight during pregnancy, and I&#x27;m naturally a petite person, so there was probably no way my skin could have stretched that much in a short time without leaving marks. In any case, I used this regularly during my pregnancy, and it definitely feels luxurious and smells great and helps relieve itchiness on your expanding belly, but it didn&#x27;t prevent the marks. I do love this product just as a regular body oil, but I will probably not purchase it again because of the high price tag.</li>
    <li> oily，good smell，effect last whole night</li>
    <li> The oil feels great and is an excellent moisturizer.  That said, it also gets into your clothes, and the smell permeates, and is impossible to get out (doesn&#x27;t stain, just has a lingering smell).  I happened to be sensitive to it and went through 2 bathrobes. If you&#x27;re suffering from morning sickness, you may want to stick to just the body butter.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I have used it since i received the product as a sample during my pregnancy. My son is now 11 months and the oil has not only helped return the elasticity in my stomach and thighs but it has also help diminish the appearance of my older stretch marks from a previous pregnancy.  I even started using it on scars from an unfortunate breast surgery and it has helped smooth those scars out as well. Its not a miracle oil and won&#x27;t make you perfect but it with everyday use you do see a whole lot of improvement in your skin.</li>
    <li> Worth the money! Smells like spa, penetrates in skin leaving it hydrated but not greasy. Ive used during my pregnancy along with the cream and did not get one strech mark!:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I would like using an oil because I thought it would get on my clothes and leave me feeling oily.  This oil is not like that.  It sinks in and feels really good.  My skin feels great.  Very mositurized not at all oily.  So far, I haven&#x27;t seen a single stretch mark!  Plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> This body oil smells fabulous, made my skin feels soft and smooth and absorbs very quickly!  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy feeling like some body oils do.</li>
    <li> love this body oil!! it wont leave a residue on the skin and absorbs quickly.. would definitely repurchase this :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this helps minimize stretch marks; I don&#x27;t know what my skin would have looked like if I&#x27;d used more, or less, of this product. I do know, however, that its scent is wonderful and unique, exotic without being heavy, and that a little goes a long way. This is not a heavy, goopy oil. I have dry skin and curly hair and found that this oil helps tame both.    I&#x27;d initially seen this reviewed in an article in W magazine 2-3 years ago. At the time, it was not yet being marketed--it had just been created (according to the article). So I hunted down a bottle, and then another bottle, at Neiman Marcus (which is not carrying it currently).    The only way to know if it&#x27;s for you is to buy a bottle!</li>
    <li> the bottle is easier to control how much you want with pressing than just pour out.&lt;br /&gt;comparing the small bottle 15ml I bought before, this price is much better and love the smell</li>
    <li> I got this to be pro-active against stretch marks during my pregnancy. Hopefully the stretch marks stay away but I am LOVING the smell. It reminds me of a spa ...and what a refreshing way to smell. YUM!</li>
    <li> This product help deeply moisturize my skin. It dried fast with no oily residue and I felt like it prevented stretch marks. It is expensive, but I had also purchased other oils including palmers and bio oil and felt like they didn&#x27;t even come close to this product.</li>
    <li> Delivery speed is too slow.I love amazon.I love the freedom and democracy of the United States, I hate dictatorship of the Communist Party.</li>
    <li> This is the best body oil ever.  First of all, it smells like a dream and second of all it works like a charm.  My sister used it when she was pregnant to prevent stretch marks and both of us have not stopped using it since!!!  The baby will be a year next week!</li>
    <li> I had twins and I am a small lady and I got stretch marks when I went through puberty so I was very worried about getting more stretch marks.  I used this oil once a day along with the cream that goes with it once a day and I am happy to say I got NO stretch marks and my stomach was very large with twins!!</li>
    <li> I love it, smells really good and is not greasy. This is the second bottle that I get and I&#x27;m planning buying more it works great during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this my entire pregnancy (month 7 now) and it&#x27;s fabulous. It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on very well. So far no stretch marks but I&#x27;ve also been very active as well. You won&#x27;t regret it - worth the $ although at first seems a tad expensive. It lasts a long time too - I started using it at week 14ish and one bottle will last me the entire pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works of you are prego and trying to prevent stretch marks and keep your belly moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oils, but this one is my favorite. It isn&#x27;t as greasy or oily feeling as other oils. It absorbs into the skin very nicely, leaving you feeling soft and silky. It&#x27;s great to use when you just get out of the shower or bath. Apply before drying off, and massage into skin. Using it on a wet body makes a little bit of oil go a long way. Although it is my favorite body oil, I can&#x27;t really comment as to how effective this product is for tightening the skin. I don&#x27;t use this product everyday as a beauty regimen. I use this more as a luxury product. I do have friends that used this during their pregnancy and liked it, but they were also using the basq butter, so I can&#x27;t really comment as to how effective this may be. Nonetheless, it is a great body oil, very moisturizing, with a pleasant scent, so I do highly recommend every lady get a bottle.</li>
