    <li> As a 52 yr old I&#x27;m always looking for something that makes my skin look better, and this definitely helps my Glo Pressed Powder Foundation go on smoother and stay that way longer.  There is less creeping into pores and lines with this product.  The tube is small, I&#x27;ve been using less than a pea size drop on my problem areas, so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  I will be buying this product again though,I know that!</li>
    <li> I use a mineral powder foundation and had never tried a primer before. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it makes your face feel so smooth and silky.  It does improve the appearance of the powder foundation and seems to keep it looking fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Love this primer more than any other!  Have tried so many but GloMinerals primer goes on light and smooth. Makes my pores appear smaller, makeup stays on longer!</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it would make my foundation last longer... totally works! I am a primer girl from now on thanks to this stuff!</li>
