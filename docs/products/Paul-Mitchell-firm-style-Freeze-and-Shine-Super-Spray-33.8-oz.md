<li> how long I couldn&#x27;t say.</li>
<li> The cap was loose</li>
<li> I hate hair products whose fragrances are so strong that they are all you can smell all day long and totally interfere with any other fragrance you wear.  </li>
<li> However, still does the job and much lass expensive.</li>
<li> My standby hairspray (and I have thick, coarse hair).</li>
<li> Keeps my hair in place without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
<li> Product took a lot longer to deliver than promised but the worst part was that about 1/3 of the product had leaked out of the top cap and saturated the cardboard box.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but find it hard to get around here for some reason so that is why I got it online.  </li>
<li> Others or generics are not the sane at least for me.</li>

    <li> So few places carry this refill size, so was glad to find it on Amazon. Great product - used it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and will continue to do so.  Pricing here is the best and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I really like Paul Mitchell and have for years I really appreciated the serve and product you provided for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the only hair care product the hubby cannot do without. It is a better deal to buy and refill than what he was paying for the single bottles at the salon. Lasts quite a while, though exactly how long I couldn&#x27;t say. Almost a year, since he has a short doo.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair care products I have used.  Always does what is advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for more years than I care to remember.  It just works, period.  It&#x27;s not overly sticky, you can layer it and still brush it out, and, last but for me certainly not least, it doesn&#x27;t SMELL.  I hate hair products whose fragrances are so strong that they are all you can smell all day long and totally interfere with any other fragrance you wear.  This one never has.  I highly recommend this - and I&#x27;m someone who loves doing my hair in every imaginable hairstyle. It works for everything.</li>
    <li> Very subjective but this refill didn&#x27;t seem quite as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the smaller off-the-shelf variety sold at most stores like Target, Walmart, etc.  However, still does the job and much lass expensive.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love it.  Good to find it a little cheaper than what the beauty and retail shops sale for.  Even better to be able to use cash back rewards to pay for!!</li>
    <li> Would not use anything but Paul Mitchell spray on my hair!  Cheaper to buy by this size and refill the smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> Product took a lot longer to deliver than promised but the worst part was that about 1/3 of the product had leaked out of the top cap and saturated the cardboard box.  The cap was loose so I guess that&#x27;s what happened.  Better packaging is needed by this vendor.  I thought about sending it back but didn&#x27;t want to hastle with getting it repackaged and I needed (wanted) what was left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this non-aerosol finishing spray.  Just a couple of sprays &amp; it holds without stiffness.  Use this to refill the pump sprayer for excellent savings.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place without being stiff or sticky.  Washes out easily leaving no residue.  This is for a pump spray, not an aerosol, so no harm to the ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this large bottle and refill a pump spray bottle for best value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but find it hard to get around here for some reason so that is why I got it online.  It is just perfect for my thinning hair because it keeps it in place for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I always use Paul Mitchell products and especially the freeze and shine.  Tried to get it cheaper on amazon but this product is not like the others I have used the scent is even different.</li>
    <li> Great product and pleasant scent.  For someone with fine and completely unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s the ONLY product that holds my hair in place without looking like I use a ton of product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray - especially for fine hair - holds well but isn&#x27;t &#x27;hard&#x27; or sticky.

    <li> My favorite hairspray of all time!!!</li>
