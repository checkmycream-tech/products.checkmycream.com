      <li>My hair is soft and shines a lot more since I started using this product.</li>
      <li>I had naturally curly hair and could use mostly any over the counter product to keep my curls in order.</li>
      <li>My curls look nice but are not soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to see that I could purchase it through my Amazon Prime account and it cost less.</li>
      <li>I have very soft thick curly hair carols daughter milk moisturizer defines my curls perfectly :) I finally found a winner :)</li>
      <li>This product is great and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I mean you were the FIRST product that actually made my hair look awesome.  </li>
      <li>same as original, smell less intense, overall a good product to purchase, makes curls more defined and shiny  </li>
      <li>at first, my hair was very shiny and my curls&lt;</li>
      <li>soft fresh hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>tho I.Love the smell) is very watery</li>
      <li>It would take out sooo much of my hair because of how mated it made it.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t worry that much...</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels great blow dried or natural with no greasy feeling and all natural products.  </li>
      <li>and I too remember the days when this product was $12 and worked a whole lot</li>
      <li>This really works and never leaves a greasy or smelly feel with my hair.</li>
      <li>i have tried different carols daughter products and honestly the only decent one is the hair milk style pudding.</li>
      <li>It does an ok job, but I will be trying other products.</li>
      <li>Works ok- not worth the expense</li>
      <li>The moisture does not last a full day.  </li>
      <li>This is My first time using this product and I have natural hair which dries out alot.</li>
      <li>Tames frizzies,and leaves hair shiny, silky and easy to manage wih absolutely no sticky residue.</li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking it would be really great for my new kinky straight wig, boy was I wrong.</li>
      <li>I used two to three times my normal amount</li>
      <li>The Milk line shampoo &amp; leave conditioner and spray to refresh my hair is owesome can live without.</li>
      <li>BEWARE 3c NATURAL GIRLS!</li>
      <li>i have type 3c natural hair.</li>
      <li>One big difference I notice is, the one from target is much &#x27;thicker&#x27;, and seems like this one from amazon seller --- diluted with water to fill the bottle...?</li>
      <li>I have used Carol&#x27;s daughter products  now for 2 years since going natural.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t provided the soft conditioning</li>
      <li>I am an old school CD fan...</li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair moisturized and soft, it smells</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a must for the natural hair person.  </li>
      <li>&gt; no heavy build up  while using it.</li>
      <li>I also saved money by buying it on Amazon than directly retail.  </li>
      <li>Its good on my own hair but is absolutely horrible for my wig</li>
      <li>… I&#x27;m returning my products for a full refund and still seeking answers on how to strip this heavy conditioner from my hair</li>
      <li>hair definitely feels more moisturized than it usually does!</li>
      <li>All other products that claimed to leave your hair feeling soft and frizz free after bllowing, still left my hair looking like a dry tumble weed blowing down one of those Western Streets you see in a cowboy movie right before they count to three.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to give such high ratings on products unless I&#x27;m actually &amp;#34;Blown</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not for my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>so... bought this hair milk while back through this seller... then not too long ago, I bought same exact hair milk from target.</li>
      <li>Use a little Vaseline along with product on 1 year old&#x27;s hair and her hair is growing fast.</li>
      <li>It was recommended by an African American friend who it works wonders for w her natural curl.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve really changed -- your ingredient list is vastly different from your previous formula.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell is very strong and terrible</li>
    <li> My hair still is dry by midday.  The moisture does not last a full day.  Also, the sheen is not as shiny as I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be really great for my new kinky straight wig, boy was I wrong. This product RUINED my wig. making it frizzy, dry and mated. Every time I combed through it. It would take out sooo much of my hair because of how mated it made it. Its good on my own hair but is absolutely horrible for my wig</li>
    <li> BEWARE 3c NATURAL GIRLS! i have type 3c natural hair. i used this for a wash n go. at first, my hair was very shiny and my curls&lt;br /&gt;were defined than after a few hours it felt dry. My curls look nice but are not soft to the touch. i have tried different carols daughter products and honestly the only decent one is the hair milk style pudding. these products are beyond overrated. it might work for thinner hair but definitely did not do well at keeping the moisture in. i will stick to my mixed chicks leave in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve curly dry hair and I&#x27;ve been using Carol&#x27;s Daughters products for years and it&#x27;s the only product I use on my hair. I order 3-6 bottles at a time. The Milk line shampoo &amp; leave conditioner and spray to refresh my hair is owesome can live without.</li>
    <li> Not the product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Not terribly pleased with it. I don&#x27;t like the texture honestly.  But I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> Like the way product softens hair, but dissatisfied with dryness. Use a little Vaseline along with product on 1 year old&#x27;s hair and her hair is growing fast.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my hair. I am an African american</li>
    <li> Works ok- not worth the expense</li>
    <li> The milk is good for a leave in or to detangle. But once again the smell is nothing to love.</li>
    <li> Would I buy this again yes, it is a great product. My hair is soft and shines a lot more since I started using this product. I&#x27;m free from chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and still like it, but it appears that the formula has changed a bit.  Therefore I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is My first time using this product and I have natural hair which dries out alot. I use about a nickle to a quarter size daily to help me style my hair. It makes it more manageable. I&#x27;m in love with it!!</li>
    <li> Smell bad and doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I have to put my hair in a ponytail after using this product, because it doesn&#x27;t curl the hair well.  My hair is thinning, so that might be one of the problems.  I love Carol&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner but this product was disappointing to me.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product it has a very strong smell like amonia and it burns my eyes when I&lt;br /&gt;put it in my hair, or the children,s hair, it was a waiste of my money and I will throw it away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, I was buying at the department store and they stopped carrying it.  I was delighted to see that I could purchase it through my Amazon Prime account and it cost less.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as fantastic as people make it sound. Have used better products.</li>
    <li> so... bought this hair milk while back through this seller... then not too long ago, I bought same exact hair milk from target. One big difference I notice is, the one from target is much &#x27;thicker&#x27;, and seems like this one from amazon seller --- diluted with water to fill the bottle...? not sure, but definitely very watery.</li>
    <li> I loved this product before the formula changed. I&#x27;m so disappointed in the change.</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk Original Leave-In Moisturizer for Unisex, 8... having mixed hair can be hard to find products that dont wiegh the hair down</li>
    <li> As I battle the allergic reaction to the product line, my hair is suffering too!  I had naturally curly hair and could use mostly any over the counter product to keep my curls in order. So I thought I would try the Carol&#x27;s Product Line… now I have this &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my hair that will not go away - even after 6 washes using various brands of shampoo!  Ugh.. the milk products weighed my hair down… I&#x27;m returning my products for a full refund and still seeking answers on how to strip this heavy conditioner from my hair… Sigh.</li>
    <li> Dear Hair Milk,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this letter because, in all honesty, it&#x27;s over between us.  I&#x27;ve actually been seeing someone else for several months.  I know we&#x27;ve been together for years and that you&#x27;ve always been there for my hair, but look... you changed.  I know you went through changes before (remember when you tried to dress up like an actual milk bottle?  That was so cute!), but this is different.  You&#x27;ve really changed -- your ingredient list is vastly different from your previous formula.  I know you say you&#x27;re the &#x27;original formula,&#x27; but you&#x27;re not and my hair knows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the day everything changed...  I opened up my Carol&#x27;s Daughter package to find a different bottle inside.  \\&quot;Uh oh,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;This is never a good sign...\\&quot;  But I didn&#x27;t worry that much... I mean, you&#x27;ve changed tons in the last few years...  several bottle redesigns, introductions of shampoo and conditioner (that I loved, by the way) and dismissals of the same shampoos and conditioners, introductions of a pathetic shampoo/conditioner combo (??)... I wasn&#x27;t worried.  Until I actually used you.  You came out of the bottle lacking your signature sweet scent.  You were nothing like your old self -- watery and weak (and yes, I compared you to the last bottle I was just finishing up... and yeah, you are nowhere near as thick as you used to be).  I put it in my hair, no difference.  It was like I put nothing in at all.  I put more in my hair, again no difference.  I used two to three times my normal amount and I still had poorly defined curls and tons of frizz.  I wish I could blame something else, but the truth of the matter is that you are the only thing that changed that day.  I went through the whole bottle hoping that I was wrong, that it would change... I mean you were the FIRST product that actually made my hair look awesome.  I talked to everyone about you, about how much I loved you.  I even dealt with your incessant price increases and product size decreases (I remember paying $12 for a 10 oz bottle... now you&#x27;re, what?  $20 for an 8 oz bottle?) because I could never put a price on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I doubt I&#x27;m ever coming back to you.  Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;ve found something that works almost as well (Curls) and is half your price.  It&#x27;s not as great as you originally were, but it&#x27;s far better than you are now.  You&#x27;re watery and weak with no curl-defining, or frizz-fighting, properties.  For some odd reason, you changed your *almost universally adored* formula and now you&#x27;re a shadow of your former hair milk self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave you that second star simply because I couldn&#x27;t one star you...  not for all the times we had together.  Anyway, I&#x27;m breaking up with you, Hair Milk... and it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s you.ases (I remember paying $12 for a 10 oz bottle... now you&#x27;re, what?  $20 for an 8 oz bottle?) because I could never put a price on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I doubt I&#x27;m ever coming back to you.

    <li> This really works and never leaves a greasy or smelly feel with my hair. I&#x27;m really happy with this product !</li>
    <li> Its true...As one customer put it, the formula had changed a great deal. The hair milk (tho I.Love the smell) is very watery and you have to put on more than you should to try to get some definition to.your curls. I am an old school CD fan... and I too remember the days when this product was $12 and worked a whole lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this bottle, I will probably end my relationship with CD for good. :-(</li>
    <li> Like others have said, the oil used to be thick but now it&#x27;s very thin. It does an ok job, but I will be trying other products. My hair needs a heavier moisturizer (AA, with 4A curls)</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with lots of different curl enhancing products for a few years now. I am very disappointed with Carol Daughters Hair Milk Leave in because it leaves a shine on my hair that makes it look greasy.  It also doesn&#x27;t provided the soft conditioning feel that I&#x27;m used to from other products.  Remember the shine from the 80s jerry curl? That&#x27;s what this reminds me of. The Milk Co-Wash is even worse which I will rate with a 1 star because it makes my hair feel stiff and it doesn&#x27;t detangle. I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair these products would be ideal for but it&#x27;s definitely not for my natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only leave in that works for my texture</li>
    <li> he loves it. good deal for the price. I don&#x27;t know what else to write about this.  It&#x27;s okay is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this product. Makes her hair healthy looking and smoother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products. I find Hair Milk to be top of my list.  I use product for curl definition and light hold. Hair Milk does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy or oily. I also like Aveda Be Curly and Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curl (but it leaves my hair a little crunchy). For stronger hold or styling I use Proclaim Curl Gel.</li>
    <li> Most amazing product line that we have used on our little ones hair. He is bi-racial and we had tried product after product to keep his hair looking great!!! He gets so many compliments on how well it looks and smells!!! It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Tames frizzies,and leaves hair shiny, silky and easy to manage wih absolutely no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Gives hair shine and lustre. Makes hair feel and smell good</li>
    <li> It softens and curls my daughter&#x27;s hair to perfection, and makes it easy to comb through.  And hair milk smells amazing!  She gets compliments all the time about her hair, including how yummy it smells.</li>
    <li> same as original, smell less intense, overall a good product to purchase, makes curls more defined and shiny  last all day</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything spectacular to my hair.  Will not purchase again. I dont understand what ingredients makes product so expensive?? I have a better hair day using coconut oil and ECO styler gel on my 4a hair texture.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something I could use every day, not just when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Expensive but seems worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Really makes her hair nice and easy to comb.  We combine it with a little water and then spray it in.  Works well that way!</li>
    <li> Love the product, however it&#x27;s soo expensive. Maybe prices will come down in the future. All her products are great though.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product was expensive, but since I knew it would last a long time I sprung for the $20. I did not like the smell. Some reviews said that it smelled citrusy, but it smelled like chemicals to me. As soon as we started using it, very sparingly mind you, my daughters scalp was itching terribly. I thought that maybe it was a coincidence and tried the product again the next week, but had the same results. It did hold the curls, but no better than any other products that I have tried. I will stick with my inexpensive and more gentle products from now on. Exposed Organics makes great hair products for curls and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I like it! It felt like putting water in my hair--which is exactly what my low porosity, thick and medium-coarse hair needs.  I&#x27;m 3b/c &amp; 4a. It definitely has a scent to it; I&#x27;d say like limes and grass. The scent is noticeable but not overpowering &amp; it fades. It&#x27;s a thin consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair definitely feels more moisturized than it usually does! Glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased from Target not Amazon...hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after her hair started to grown back due to chemo and radiation treatment.  One of the best products around for women with curly hair.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial w loose curls. I was looking for something that wld tame the frizzies she gets later in the day but not weigh her hair down. The product works fairly well for her. It was recommended by an African American friend who it works wonders for w her natural curl. I wldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed w the product but I think if she had kinkier hair it wld work a little btr. My friends hair is absolutely gorgeous w the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I have very soft thick curly hair carols daughter milk moisturizer defines my curls perfectly :) I finally found a winner :)</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s a must for the natural hair person.  This product is great and last a long time.  I recommend this and all Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I have used Carol&#x27;s daughter products  now for 2 years since going natural. This product leaves my hair moisturized and soft, it smells good.&lt;br /&gt; no heavy build up  while using it. soft fresh hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> After trying lots of products for my curly hair, this is the best, if you want to use it as curly.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for use with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I also saved money by buying it on Amazon than directly retail.  I will definitely be making this purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to give such high ratings on products unless I&#x27;m actually &amp;#34;Blown Away&amp;#34; by the results, and with me, results are everything.  I&#x27;ve used this product when it was introduced on one of those TV Shopping shows and going on 5+ years now nothing I had been using previously seemed to keep moisture in my hard to tame curly, wavy, color treated hair. All other products that claimed to leave your hair feeling soft and frizz free after bllowing, still left my hair looking like a dry tumble weed blowing down one of those Western Streets you see in a cowboy movie right before they count to three.  My bathroom was starting to look like the Hair Care Isle at the drug store. Once this product arrived on the scene, and it did what it promised to do, Out went everything except this.  Finding it being sold on on Amazon at a competitive price made it a no brainer.  My hair looks and feels great blow dried or natural with no greasy feeling and all natural products.  Tried other products in this line that are also pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> Great for kids, and ponytails.</li>
