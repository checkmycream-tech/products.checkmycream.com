    <li> I still have the bottle of Pure DKNY eau de parfum my husband got me for Christmas ... and this doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same. But it&#x27;s close enough and the price is right, especially considering that this perfume is apparently off the market.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with what I received, smells just like I expected it to. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, Many of them give me headaches but never this one.</li>
    <li> lovely smell. light, not overwhelming</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift, so I cannot comment on the shipment or seller, but I love this scent. For years I have looked for something as light and delicate as this. I&#x27;ve been smelling my wrists all day and am so happy to finally have it.</li>
    <li> VERY, VERY pleased w/ this product &amp; the seller!! I was kind of worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; scent...after I had read some of the previous comments. I&#x27;m glad that I went ahead &amp; ordered!  When it arrived, I was so relieved to discover that it was TRULY &amp;#34;DKNY Pure&amp;#34;. It came in the original packaging &amp; box!! So happy to know that I can continue to buy this scent!! I would Definitely buy it from this seller as well!!! NO question! True products!! EXTREMELY satisfied!</li>
    <li> Seems to be the real deal</li>
    <li> Awesome gift for one of my BFF&#x27;S, she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in product, not the real thing!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described at a great price.  The scent is the same with original packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragance thinking it will smell good but it didn&#x27;t go with my chemistry.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume, and so do I</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna be honest. I don&#x27;t even remember purchasing this. Especially since I&#x27;m a 26 year old male. I think maybe my g/f at the time hacked me .__. Ah well. Probably smells wonderful. She always did smell nice.. I think I&#x27;ll call her&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No but seriously, my mother loved this for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. Very pretty light and nice for everyday</li>
    <li> I ord&#x27;d this because to me it just has a  light scent.  I use it for everyday use and haven&#x27;t heard any negative comments just yet from my peers!!! lol....Would buy again from this seller and this scent. :)</li>
    <li> Came quickly and still in original packaging. This is a favorite scent of mine and i was sad to see it discontinued. Im glad amazon had it ready for purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a great price</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Been a long time user of this perfume and I can assert that this is the original</li>
    <li> DONT DO IT - THIS IS A KNOCK OFF - EVEN A DIFFERENT COLOR  lol  I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WITH THE PRICE THAT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,  threw it away --- smells terrible - WARNING -- avoid this it is NOT Donna Karan Pure ( how we know it)</li>
    <li> The product must have been expired. The fragrance did not last 5 minutes after being applied. Had my daughter try it to make sure it wasnt reacting to my body chemistry. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m Josh B.&#x27;s wife. I saw this Pure DKNY for sale for only $13 and thought, &amp;#34;what a great buy on a perfume I know I already like!&amp;#34; The perfume arrived, and unfortunately it smelled like straight rubbing alcohol. Pure DKNY is a favorite fragrance of mine, so I definitely know how it should smell. The product I received smelled disgusting. On top of that, I just learned that it&#x27;s not eligible for return! Maybe losing $13 isn&#x27;t that big a deal, but if I wanted to smell like rubbing alcohol, I could have bought a 12oz bottle for $1 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance. You don&#x27;t need a lot. About 2 or 3 pumps sets you for the entire day, truly. Not too light, definitely not heavy. I love it for summer time dressy. :)</li>
    <li> Received brand new and within 2 days.</li>
    <li> Scent is much stronger than I expect of this perfume. Looks exactly the same but scent is much  stronger..am disappointed</li>
    <li> Great day fragrance but as long lasting as I hoped</li>
    <li> Perfect condition, arrived quickly. Very happy! And it smells absolutely amazing. I love dkny fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s so delicate and soft of a fragrance that I can wear it anywhere without risk of offending anyone!!</li>
