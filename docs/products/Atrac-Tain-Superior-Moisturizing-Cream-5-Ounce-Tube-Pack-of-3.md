    <li> Just so you know what your getting, this is the lotion you get in the hospital or doctors office for extremely dry skin. Yes it&#x27;s expensive (at least to me) but without it my hands truly do suffer. Apply twice a day and it&#x27;ll get rid of exema  in a week. As for my background, im a mechanic so needless to say i work with my hands and they can get pretty bad. Goes on smooth, dries in minutes, won&#x27;t wash off, and leaves absolutely no greasy feeling whatsoever.  My life would be over without this stuff!</li>
