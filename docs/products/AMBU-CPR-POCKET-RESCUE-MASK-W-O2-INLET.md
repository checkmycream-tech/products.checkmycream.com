      <li>I feel better knowing that I have this in my glovebox</li>
      <li>The mask, for the price paid, more then met my expectations.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re very straightforward to use.</li>
      <li>You better have taken the course if you want to use this mask and have strong hands.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers this for a great price.  </li>
      <li>When practicing, it is much easier to achieve a good seal.  </li>
      <li>Compact and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The elastic band can get in the way at times but is easily removed.  </li>
      <li>This is a good high quality pocket CPR mask.  </li>
      <li>and it would do fine as a mask.</li>
      <li>The case is huge though.</li>
      <li>so I can fit it in my bag.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice, sturdy case and hope I get to use it for real some day.</li>
      <li>Product was great except the glooves were too big.</li>
      <li>More importantly is that the quality of the mask itself is much higher than the one used in class.  </li>
      <li>But overall it looks like good quality material</li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the fact that these seem cheaply made.</li>
      <li>A true must when mingling with minions.</li>
      <li>Step two is insure adequate breathing.</li>
      <li>Received this product quickly.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in a car if the weather is very hot.</li>
      <li>This mask was very inexpensive, and shipped and arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought the Ambu res-cue mask more to get to the $25 minimum for free shipping but was pretty surprised at the quality feel of this thing.  </li>
      <li>CPR is a simple, effective way to save lives, and these are pocket sized for convenience.</li>
      <li>I have not had the occasion to use this product (thankfully) but it seems to be a decent product, and definitely comes at a good price.</li>
      <li>it came right on time.</li>
      <li>This was the right price</li>
      <li>They were size x-large and it did not have a choice to pick the right size for the glooves.</li>
      <li>The case and mask are a little big, but in the event I needed to use it I would be very happy using this product.</li>
      <li>It was 4x&#x27;s as much at school than on here!</li>
      <li>It is made pretty well</li>
      <li>i have used this device before so when i needed to equip our company&#x27;s first responders with first aid supplies</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed for my CPR class and it arrived as pictured in a sealed bag.</li>
      <li>She keeps it in her first aid kit in her car.  </li>
      <li>This was exactly what we needed for our first aid kit.</li>
      <li>this was my first choice.</li>
      <li>bought for a work first aid kit.</li>
      <li>Anyone who takes a CPR class or First Aid class needs to order this mask.</li>
      <li>Also, it comes with a set of gloves and cleaning swipe which is all you need for the first time you use it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so much cheaper and nicer than what I would have gotten in a store!</li>
      <li>I had used a rescue mask in CPR training on a few occasions and felt like it would be a good idea to keep one in the car.  </li>
      <li>I have played with it enough that I am kind of surprised it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sturdy construction of the equipment itself, the case is nothing special but it stays closed and doesn&#x27;t crush easily.</li>
      <li>These are the exact same devices I was trained on in advanced Fist Aid and CPR class</li>
      <li>This certainly isnt something you can just carry around with you, without a backpack to put it in.</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s a nice touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it to keep a tight seal on a patient&#x27;s face without hand pressure.</li>
      <li>It comes all flattened out and in a nice little case with some gloves and an alcohol prep pad.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone in their car and in their home first aid kit.</li>
      <li>It is very inexpensive but a very high quality product.</li>
      <li>This came in a very sturdy case which is important when stuffed in my emergency back pack.  </li>
      <li>Thank God I haven&#x27;t had to use this device, but it appears to be built well and was ready to go when I opened for test.  </li>
      <li>These masks are much easier for beginners to use than faceshields and the disposable plastic liner types.</li>
      <li>but it sits in my IFAK pack ready for that emergency that I hope never happens.</li>
      <li>4 stars only because I (fortunately) have not had the opportunity/need to use it in an emergency, so my evaluation is all theoretical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems like it would work really well</li>
      <li>Also has VERY pungent chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>As described and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It was relatively inexpensive, cheap insurance.</li>
      <li>This mask worked very well in Professional Rescuer CPR and DOT First Responder training.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good product. just a little bigger would be good if you could get the air.</li>
    <li> A great addition to a home/travel/work/picnic/practice health kit. Comes in a sturdy container and they&#x27;re very straightforward to use. A bit bulky for casual carrying, but if you have a car or a bag, you have space for this life saver.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my CPR class and it arrived as pictured in a sealed bag. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and does it well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Get yourself enrolled in a course, and then get one of these. This protects you from the person while allowing you to save his or her life.  CPR is a simple, effective way to save lives, and these are pocket sized for convenience.</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about the fact that these seem cheaply made. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these for my staff again.</li>
    <li> Just get a version that includes both masks in a soft case. This version is more difficult to use with infants</li>
    <li> This mask gets a good seal and has an excellent one-way air valve.  The elastic band can get in the way at times but is easily removed.  Perfect for CPR,BLS,etc. courses and hopefully perfect for real-life situations should you ever encounter one.</li>
    <li> AMBU CPR has a great product here. This mask is one of the cheapest on the market, has a replacable valve with filter, and is made from quality materials! It is a complete saftey kit, gloves and wipes included in a bright red, hard, crush resistant case. I have recommended this to the American Heart Association CPR instructers in my area. These masks are much easier for beginners to use than faceshields and the disposable plastic liner types. I noticed many people struggling to get a good mouth seal with other cpr shields, they tend to move around while doing compressions, dont get me wrong all cpr devices are a good thing, but this one is at the top of the line with the laderal units! Thanks AMBU, keep up the good work!!</li>
    <li> Thank God I haven&#x27;t had to use this device, but it appears to be built well and was ready to go when I opened for test.  Delivered a day earlier than quoted.</li>
    <li> Amazon offers this for a great price.  For the price it is a very nice mask.  It is made pretty well and it would do fine as a mask. I got these to put them in the car, etc.  They are great for that use at a price that is about right.</li>
    <li> I was trying to save some money on my response kit and tried Ambu.  Not a horrible product, but not as durable as more expensive models (especially around border/seal).  Also has VERY pungent chemical smell.  Made in China (if it matters).</li>
    <li> 4 stars only because I (fortunately) have not had the opportunity/need to use it in an emergency, so my evaluation is all theoretical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy construction of the equipment itself, the case is nothing special but it stays closed and doesn&#x27;t crush easily. I tried the mask on, and it fit well even over a fairly long beard.</li>
    <li> This mask worked very well in Professional Rescuer CPR and DOT First Responder training. It&#x27;s easy to get a very good seal on a patient&#x27;s face, and it&#x27;s compatible with most bag-valve mask and O2 systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck strap tends to get in the way. I suppose it&#x27;s a nice touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it to keep a tight seal on a patient&#x27;s face without hand pressure.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I needed one for my Rescue Diver certification training, so I bought this one.  It had the oxygen tube (not all pocket masks do) and a case.  No brainer.</li>
    <li> I bought the Ambu res-cue mask more to get to the $25 minimum for free shipping but was pretty surprised at the quality feel of this thing.  I have played with it enough that I am kind of surprised it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet.  It comes in a nice, sturdy case and hope I get to use it for real some day.</li>
    <li> The service was great it came right on time. The product was just as described in the ad. I would use this service again.</li>
    <li> Great price, well made, and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> This is a good high quality pocket CPR mask.  I hope I never have to use it, but we have one in both of our cars just in case.</li>
    <li> I need this item for school. It was 4x&#x27;s as much at school than on here! I would get at least 3, one for my purse, one for the car and one for office</li>
    <li> I like this mask because its just like the one I used during my CPR training.  A lot of the other masks have funky attachments or O2 inlets sometimes, and this was just what I was looking for.  I keep it in my backpack or my bag sometimes when I go out (just in case!) &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After having been trained as an Emergency Medical Technician in 1984 I have had numerous occasions to provide medical assistance to injured persons. Step one is check for a response. Step two is insure adequate breathing. In most cases step two requires contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood and/or vomitous. Since the discovery of AIDS you would have to be a fool to provide mouth to mouth resuscitation without the protection provided by a &#x27;mask&#x27;. If you know CPR, and you should, you need a mask. It is of no use unless it is with you. This seems to be a good one at a good price. Don&#x27;t be without one!</li>
    <li> Good Product. Everyone should have one with them.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. i have used this device before so when i needed to equip our company&#x27;s first responders with first aid supplies this was my first choice.</li>
    <li> bought for a work first aid kit. not used but everything looked great!!</li>
    <li> I feel better knowing that I have this in my glovebox so if ever I am put in the awkward position of putting my mouth on som eone elses to save their life I will be protected. It is a little bigger than I thought it would be (the case) but is still worth buying</li>
    <li> This product is for my survilal kit and it meets expectations for that&lt;br /&gt;AMBU CPR POCKET RESCUE MASK W/ O2 INLET</li>
    <li> For health professionals who carry an emergency bag, this is a must have.  Fits onto an ambu bad, very helpful</li>
    <li> perfect exactly what i was looking for. not much more to say here but they have a minimum numbers of words required for review. dumb.</li>
    <li> I have not had the occasion to use this product (thankfully) but it seems to be a decent product, and definitely comes at a good price.</li>
    <li> This item was excellent! It is very inexpensive but a very high quality product. I would recommend this product to my colleagues.</li>
    <li> Product was great except the glooves were too big. They were size x-large and it did not have a choice to pick the right size for the glooves.</li>
    <li> Just what is needed to ensure rescuer and victim maintain proper boundaries.  Discourages sharing of oral secretions.  A true must when mingling with minions.</li>
    <li> I have not used this in an emergency setting. I bought this because I was taking a CPR class. So far I haven&#x27;t washed the thing, (since I&#x27;ve been using it on the same mannequin), but I don&#x27;t think it would be that hard to clean whenever I do get around to washing it. Seems like a good enough size, although obviously it&#x27;s probably too big to use on a baby&#x27;s face. But overall it looks like good quality material and I&#x27;m glad it came with a case, including instructions on how to use it and a pair of gloves.</li>
    <li> Compact and easy to use. I highly recommend this to anyone in their car and in their home first aid kit. Great value and good quality. This is a well made product</li>
    <li> Never can tell when you have to do mouth-to-mouth of these things are great people to most people have to touch them we use them every day just in case something We love them and I want them to you work only</li>
    <li> If you want to save a life and do it without the discomfort of exchanging bodily fluids, you need this.  I carry one of these in each of my cars (in the glove box) and you never know  someday I may use them.  These are the exact same devices I was trained on in advanced Fist Aid and CPR class so I am confident and happy to have them on hand for any emergency.  And they will keep me safe while letting me help someone in need.  Great case to carry it in too.</li>
    <li> Perfect pocket mask for the price.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll never need it but it will be where I need it if I do.</li>
    <li> I buy these to distribute during my CPR classes.  Includes a pair of gloves and a personal protective barrier for the user. A must have item for CPR class grads.</li>
    <li> Great product I bought this for my daughters CPR class she loved it she said it did everything it was supposed to do with no problems.</li>
    <li> My wife took a CPR class and this is one of the things they recommended they get.  She keeps it in her first aid kit in her car.  It was relatively inexpensive, cheap insurance.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed for my class and great for the price! so much cheaper and nicer than what I would have gotten in a store!</li>
    <li> very light and compact.  works well for a somewhat basic first aid kid.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in a car if the weather is very hot.</li>
    <li> I think this is a pretty cool little kit. It comes all flattened out and in a nice little case with some gloves and an alcohol prep pad. you just pop the mask up if you need to use it.</li>
    <li> Needed a mask for my new certification.  This was the right price and it&#x27;s a great size so I can fit it in my bag.</li>
    <li> Received this product quickly. While I hope to never have to use it, I feel that this is a good piece of equipment to have on hand just in case. One way valve and filter seem adequate for (of course) single use. AMBU is a good name in the industry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Firefighter for 10 years</li>
    <li> Good quality. As described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Perfect! This was exactly what we needed for our first aid kit. Great item!!</li>
    <li> It is packaged attractively and has a sturdy cover which was very important to me to protect the mask from contamination</li>
    <li> The mask, for the price paid, more then met my expectations. Hardcase, gloves, alcohol prep and mask. Teaching courses on m own and for Red Cross, I have seen some bad CPR pocket masks. This one was perfect-</li>
    <li> This mask was very inexpensive, and shipped and arrived very quickly. Anyone who takes a CPR class or First Aid class needs to order this mask.</li>
    <li> This mask is as advertised!  It seems like it would work really well and I have no problem carrying it around with me.  It isn&#x27;t heavy.  The case and mask are a little big, but in the event I needed to use it I would be very happy using this product.</li>
    <li> I had used a rescue mask in CPR training on a few occasions and felt like it would be a good idea to keep one in the car.  This came in a very sturdy case which is important when stuffed in my emergency back pack.  More importantly is that the quality of the mask itself is much higher than the one used in class.  When practicing, it is much easier to achieve a good seal.  Also, it comes with a set of gloves and cleaning swipe which is all you need for the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Came as advertized. The case is huge though. This certainly isnt something you can just carry around with you, without a backpack to put it in.</li>
    <li> My wife and I just took a CPR/AED recertification. I thought it would be good to have a rescue mask in the car. The case is hard to open and instructions are vague. You better have taken the course if you want to use this mask and have strong hands.</li>
    <li> Have not tried it yet but it sits in my IFAK pack ready for that emergency that I hope never happens. Good reviews on this item.</li>
