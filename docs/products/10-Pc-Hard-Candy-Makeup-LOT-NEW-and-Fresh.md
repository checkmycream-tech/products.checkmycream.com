      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Thank you for my order it came at a reasonable time.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this a higher rating, but the package condition of some of the items I received weren&#x27;t great and 2 out of the 10 items are questionable and will have to be discarded.</li>
      <li>I had gotten a little bit of everything, a good majority was eye related stuff</li>
      <li>The packaging on these, particularly the boxes, were quite beat up, which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for me, but the items themselves look used.</li>

    <li> Loved it all! Got a lot of bronzes and some cute colors. I had gotten a little bit of everything, a good majority was eye related stuff but I got some nice colors and got a very nice lip gloss. Everything was fresh and nothing was damaged. I think this was a great deal and totally would buy again!</li>
    <li> Two items arrived broken but are still usable.  There were also a couple of things that I didn&#x27;t like (glitter stuff) but I can easily give that to a friend or family member who does.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and plan to reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with what I got! Something for everybody. Everything was new and sealed properly. Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Everything I received was sealed and new. I received 5 eyeshadows one sparkly eyeliner one liquid (navy) two different concealers ombre lipstick and one lip gloss. I am very satisfied with the products &amp; wasted no time trying them out. Definitely some fun new looks in my future, thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered twice and the first time I got a pretty teal liner but was sad it was dried out and i couldnt use it. The second time I got everything in perfect condition But not much variety would have loved to get some of those loose pigments</li>
    <li> Great selection. Fast delivery. I plan to order more to keep on hand for my teen daughter to give to friend for last minute birthday gifts.</li>
    <li> Great colors. Addicted to hard candy!!</li>
    <li> The makeup I got was use and the eye makes up was broke I will love my money back</li>
    <li> The packaging on these, particularly the boxes, were quite beat up, which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for me, but the items themselves look used. The &amp;#34;Hide And Glow Cheek&amp;#34; tint stick had a fingerprint on the actual makeup itself, even though the tube had plastic sealing it, which was bizarre. Also, the lip balm I got was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how much money I spent on this though, I&#x27;m not too disappointed because I really am looking forward to using the rest of the stuff I have gotten. I wish I could give this a higher rating, but the package condition of some of the items I received weren&#x27;t great and 2 out of the 10 items are questionable and will have to be discarded.</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this!</li>
    <li> It was OK. The order came quickly. I realize now I paid way too much for two day shipping. I only really like 4 if the items and no concealer or foundation for me. I got mostly eye shadows and nail polish.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with Hard Candy! I am very pleased with my concealer!</li>
    <li> I was highly satisfied with my purchase! I received a good variety of products and even got a cc crème stick in my shade! The only downside is not being able to customize your skin color because I have light skin and I received a concealer in medium shade but I found someone that could use it so its not that big of deal! I actually just placed my second order with this seller today! It is well worth the $11</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for anyone in the market for great Hard Candy products. All of the products I received from the lot were amazing! Everything was packaged properly, sealed and/or boxed. My only reason for giving it 4/5 stars is because I wish there was more of a variety. I received mostly lip products, but all of the products were great nonetheless. I also received a nail polish, an eye shadow stick, and a highlighting quad. It shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> Love the products! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Very good products!! Abselutely loved it and will be buying from again when I get paid!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for my order it came at a reasonable time. The only thing i would say that was misleading was in your description you list face, eye, lip, nail, and mascara. I thought i would of had some sort of foundation or cover up. But other than that very contient with items. Would look forward to do more business with you</li>
