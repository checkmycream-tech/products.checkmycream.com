      <li>Very sensual scent.</li>
      <li>this product is original BUT not the actual J&#x27;Adore by Dior scent..</li>
      <li>Very nice, can hardly tell that it is not the parfume (toilette).&lt;br /&gt;It is far more subtle, but it lasts just as long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t heavy or overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>musky but a small squirt would be fine for the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, because a little goes a long way.</li>

    <li> This fragrance is a beautiful floral that radiates good taste.  It is very feminine yet sexy.  It has notes of white flowers, rose, lily of the valley, jasmine all combined in a very sophisticated way.  It is a traditional floral but it isn&#x27;t heavy or overwhelming.  It is very different from Miss Dior or Miss Dior Cherie.  The house of Dior has been producing perfume for a very long time and it&#x27;s obvious they have an excellent perfumier.  The floral notes in Jadore are very subtle yet it isn&#x27;t a fragrance for those who are dubious about florals.  It&#x27;s definitely for those women who gravitate toward them and embrace them wholeheartedly.  I personally love florals and have a large collection of them.  And yet, this one is different from anything else I have.  This fragrance would make a beautiful gift and it is assuredly worth every penny.  Amazon, btw, has a great price for this.  I paid much more in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;Got it before expected</li>
    <li> Very nice, can hardly tell that it is not the parfume (toilette).&lt;br /&gt;It is far more subtle, but it lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;If I could, I would invest the extra $10 on the parfume, though. All in all, very much worth the money. Now I smell like YUM.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I loved</li>
    <li> Amazing! My favorite perfume!!</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear Jadore. It smells really clean and is not too overpowering. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Expensive but definitely worth it.  By far the best smelling perfume that my wife wears.  She loves it so I guess thats all that really matters.</li>
    <li> I buy my wife a bottle of Chanel No. 19 every year. I bought this for her too this year just to give her a little variety. It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance and you have to love the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it beautiful scent!</li>
    <li> She loves this scent.  The price for the bottle size was great.  She should wear this for quite a bit of time.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the seller..this product is original BUT not the actual J&#x27;Adore by Dior scent..This one is a new scent called J&#x27;Adore Voile an interpretation of the original. It has a similar smell but no, no no no nothing like the original..very sad to expect something amazing and get an ok thing</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like j&#x27;adore which I have been using for almost 10 years. Even my boyfriend confirmed it smells different. I&#x27;m skeptical that this is the correct perfume.</li>
    <li> This was the REAL thing!! I love the deep, layered sensual aroma that Dior came out with when they made this one. It is more of a night scent since it is a tad heavier, and musky but a small squirt would be fine for the day. i get many compliments on it when i wear it. I would say though it is not something I would by for a teenage. Very sensual scent.</li>

    <li> Nope. I got the pink one???? Totally NOT the same scent. I wanted the one in the picture but instead a pink surprise was delivered - I do not like surprises. Price was too good to be true. Funny how true that expression is.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and the delivery time was perfect!  Judy</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my girlfriend and she loves it, as well as me too ;-)</li>
    <li> yes!!!!  good purchase!!!!  ;)</li>
