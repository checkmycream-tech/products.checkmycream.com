      <li>We put it to use today at the beach and it was able to keep my family and I from getting sunburned.</li>

      <li>Probably better than the one with chemicals.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such wonderful sunscreen!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Worked well after sitting at the soccer field all day :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident Sunology is protective - but for the cost and the ease of use, I will go to Plan B.</li>
      <li>I was sure we would be roasted by the end of the day but</li>

      <li>This sunscreen is great if you want a natural sunscreen without chemicals that has no fragrance.</li>

      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Sunology Natural Sunscreen  is wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Otherwise,  a smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>I know that this is great coverage and rated well on EWG, but it goes on with a white film and leaves you looking like a ghost.</li>
      <li>Non-sticky, and light.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic body sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I am very fair and this worked extremely well.</li>
      <li>When applying!&lt;br /&gt;1.  Smooth on a light weight moisture lotion first so your sunscreen will spread more easily!&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dense, goes on clean and penetrates the skin so it disappears.</li>
      <li>I spent hours trying to decide on the perfect sunblock, and in theory this is the one!, but I used it once on my face and the next day got a huge whitehead on my cheek!</li>
      <li>Decided to test out this sunscreen before my Florida vacation on a trip to Six Flags, where my boyfriend and I were in FULL sun for about 7-8 hours.</li>
      <li>I would rate it better because it really does work</li>
      <li>: Love the new packaging!</li>
      <li>At first glance, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
      <li>I recently found out how many harmful ingredients that many companies are putting into&lt;br /&gt;their sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I love these products and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>and I think this sunscreen is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>Just received this sunscreen and it is our new favorite.</li>
      <li>I use this everyday and it works great as an undercoat to makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love that it is natural</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural ingredients is great for the entire family.</li>
      <li>Works great if used correctly, leaves a little bit of a white sheen at first but soaks in nicely after working it in the skin and drying.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb the way that traditional sunscreen does, but with a little extra effort, and checking yourself in the mirror to make sure you don&#x27;t have a pasty face, it absorbs wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It was so hot under the sun</li>
      <li>It is important that the products I use are natural, free of chemicals, and work for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Reapplied as directed, and it worked very well!</li>
      <li>It is pretty safe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It kept me protected in the hot Texas Sun.</li>
      <li>4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be repurchasing this product - thanks!</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s expensive, and you don&#x27;t get much product, but it is totally worth it to have safe, effective sunscreen without harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>Ok but never seems quite dry.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I got this specifically for a trip to tropical area close to the equator where the sun is much stronger than my home.</li>
      <li>I have highly recommended this sunblock to everyone I know!</li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on looking light blue.  </li>
      <li>They really work for my whole family.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell goes on clear and is safe enough to use on my baby in this blazing heat!</li>
      <li>You may find that it&#x27;s not easily scrubbed off (the white film), but that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s hard to remove; rather, you just need a good wash cloth or loofa to scrub it better, which is probably not a bad idea to do now and then anyway!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is light and alot goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>All natural, no chemicals, AND THEY WORK!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying Sunology&#x27;s sunscreens for a few years after receiving a sample in a goody bag for a running event.  </li>
      <li>The sunscreen is somewhat thick and glides on pretty easily, but I suggest really rubbing it into your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Water resistant! It works! Loved this! It worked great. I tested it out with just my hands and I really liked it. Didn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky or anything like that. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This sunblock worked better than any I have used. It does not require a lot and does not show white. I did my research and feel this is safe for use on the face as well as small children.I got this specifically for a trip to tropical area close to the equator where the sun is much stronger than my home. I am very fair and this worked extremely well. I have highly recommended this sunblock to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Too sticky &amp; chalky. Too pricey for the amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying Sunology&#x27;s sunscreens for a few years after receiving a sample in a goody bag for a running event.  I like how it feels and feel good knowing I am not applying more harmful chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people may not be accustomed to the faint, white coating on the skin when applying, but that&#x27;s due to the minerals being used to protect the skin (zinc) as opposed to the chemical barriers in other, traditional sunscreens. It&#x27;s not as stark white/opaque as regular zinc oxide sunscreens and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was ghostly from head to toe.  You may find that it&#x27;s not easily scrubbed off (the white film), but that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s hard to remove; rather, you just need a good wash cloth or loofa to scrub it better, which is probably not a bad idea to do now and then anyway! ;-)</li>
    <li> Sunology Natural Sunscreen  is wonderful for sensitive skin. I am glad to find it at Amazon.. Hard to find it at all times.</li>
    <li> I got this free in return for an honest review and all I an say is that I am impressed with the quality. We put it to use today at the beach and it was able to keep my family and I from getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. Does feel sticky at times, but what sunscreen doesn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I can only give 3 stars, due to the added vitamin A.</li>
    <li> Love it! Wish it came in a bigger tube. It kept me protected in the hot Texas Sun. Now I am almost out.</li>
    <li> Not too effective for my toddlers. They both had turned red within an hour of being under the sun. That had never happened with any other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past. 3 stars for its creaminess, no strong smell and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like the stuff.  My only complaint is it takes a good washing to get the stuff off.  That&#x27;s not going to keep me from using it.  I&#x27;d rather use sunology than some crap loaded with chemicals any day.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick but you know you are getting protection from sun.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t smell goes on clear and is safe enough to use on my baby in this blazing heat! Thank you for allowing me to try this product.</li>
    <li> Just received this sunscreen and it is our new favorite. It&#x27;s all natural ingredients is great for the entire family. I have really sensitive skin and this sunscreen was awesome! Worked well after sitting at the soccer field all day :)</li>
    <li> Pricey for a little 2oz tube but it protects well. Doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as well as I&#x27;d like, leaving a visible white film - which is not uncommon for many of these natural sunscreens. However, the difference with this one is that it also feels a bit greasy. Our family has been testing out a bunch of these natural sunscreens this summer, and unfortunately I can&#x27;t say that this is one of our favorites.</li>
    <li> Ok but never seems quite dry.</li>
    <li> I recently found out how many harmful ingredients that many companies are putting into&lt;br /&gt;their sunscreens. I ordered Sunology because of the safe ingredients it contains.&lt;br /&gt;I am a recent cancer survivor and must be very careful to use a product that is gentle&lt;br /&gt;and filters out the harmful UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;I find that putting Sunology in the palm of one hand and rubbing my hands together helps this&lt;br /&gt;product to be easier to apply. I notice that it is thick and goes on in a bit of a white covering, but&lt;br /&gt;with rubbing, disperses into the skin nicely.I was out in the sun all afternoon the other day and did not burn.&lt;br /&gt; I am very happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> FINALLY! My 13 yr old cannot use aerosol sunscreen or any brand that you can buy over the counter at a drugstore, including Neutrogena sensitive. This has been the only product in which she does not break out in a rash. It goes on thick but easily absorbs so the white is not obvious.</li>
    <li> Decided to test out this sunscreen before my Florida vacation on a trip to Six Flags, where my boyfriend and I were in FULL sun for about 7-8 hours. Reapplied as directed, and it worked very well! It rubbed in nicely (not a lot of residue) and didn&#x27;t leave me looking ghostly, which I was afraid of. It was a bit runny once it was heated by the sun but that probably helped with application. It was so hot under the sun I was sure we would be roasted by the end of the day but neither of us were sunburned. He wasn&#x27;t pink at all, while I was just a little pink on my shoulders where my backpack rubbed of the sunscreen. I&#x27;m buying another tube for our vacation (the tube is pretty small). (Side note: used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t break me out or leave me feeling greasy. I have sensitive, greasy skin on my face naturally so if it didn&#x27;t bother me at all it&#x27;s definitely a winner!)</li>
    <li> Greasy, doesn&#x27;t soak into skin</li>
    <li> I received this product free in return for an honest review, all opinions are honest and not influenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen works great for my face, i have really sensitive skin and my face always burns.. This protected my skin great, and my skin felt soft and healthier wearing it.It is not oily and smelly like other brands of sunscreen which is awesome. i definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really small tube and really sticky when applied to the skin. Gives you a feeling like your pores can&#x27;t breathe. .....just a weird,  freaky feeling! The shipping was fast but the sticky feeling drives me to shower it off or thin it out with lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this product free in return for an honest review, all opinions are honest and not influenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light and alot goes a long way. It&#x27;s not oily and smelly like other products, which i love.&lt;br /&gt;It works for great protection on your skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on looking light blue.  After trying to rub it in, gave up and washed off.  Just awful.  Go with Sun Bum which is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily skin and I can&#x27;t stand anything that feels sticky or greasy.  In the past, I&#x27;ve ended up not using other sunscreens that I had purchased because they were so uncomfortable, I wouldn&#x27;t wear them.  And what good is sunscreen if it isn&#x27;t being used?  I use this everyday and it works great as an undercoat to makeup.  ADDENDUM:   I&#x27;m updating this review by giving 4 stars instead of 5.  This is because I&#x27;ve noticed that the ink from the tube is rubbing off, and I can&#x27;t help but think that some of this is being rubbed into my face.  And that can&#x27;t be good.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! The only issue I have is that the box was way too big and wasteful. Otherwise,  a smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy this mineral sunblock. Out of the many I have tried it goes on the smoothest and rubs in the best. It does rub on car seats, etc. as I haven&#x27;t found a mineral sunblock that doesn&#x27;t... but it&#x27;s worth that one annoyance to know I&#x27;m not putting horrible chemicals into my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. I have very fair skin and this product protects my skin very well.  It does leave a white residue but continue to rub until the residue disappears.</li>
    <li> very nice works great will buy again</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m a melanoma survivor and wanted a natural sunscreen. This works great! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Sunology products. All natural, no chemicals, AND THEY WORK!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, non greasy. Did not clog pored. Easy to apply &amp; remove. Highly effective. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be repurchasing this product - thanks!</li>
    <li> This was excellent! Non-sticky, and light.</li>
    <li> The tube itself is far too small.  Since it is difficult to spread and rub in, this one tube would probably only last two applications for your body.  The face product is probably fine as you have less area to cover.  I purchased, trying out various products, trying to find a quality sunscreen our entire family can use. I&#x27;m confident Sunology is protective - but for the cost and the ease of use, I will go to Plan B.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this irritated/stung.</li>
    <li> My application process had 2 segments.  Initial application rub for a minute or two, then wait about 5 minutes and rub the remainder in.  It took me a couple of applications to figure it out.  I have a dark complexion because you know I&#x27;m black so I don&#x27;t know if this is an issue for other complexions.  But I did not notice any change in my complexion after being under the Caribbean sun for a week so it worked.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this sunscreen just because it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients. There is no smell and I think this sunscreen is my new favorite. The sunscreen is somewhat thick and glides on pretty easily, but I suggest really rubbing it into your skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends! Thank you for making such wonderful sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of hiking and am exposed to the elements daily. Sunology is a great alternative to using the OTC products with their harmful ingredients. It contains zinc oxide which is the ultimate sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Pros: all natural, EWG score &#x3D; 1, SPF 50, works well -- no burning, no scent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: VERY whitening (like ghost white), VERY greasy, VERY hard to wash off, EXPENSIVE!</li>
    <li> I spent hours trying to decide on the perfect sunblock, and in theory this is the one!, but I used it once on my face and the next day got a huge whitehead on my cheek! I&#x27;ve decided to use it only on the back of hands, neck, and chest, but never on my face :/. The search continues.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great if you want a natural sunscreen without chemicals that has no fragrance. I have fair skin and it&#x27;s not white on me, but I use it mainly on my arms/hands and use a different tinted sunscreen on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative on this is the packaging. At first glance, it&#x27;s just fine. But when I put the sunscreen on, I&#x27;m putting it on both arms and therefore switching which hand I hold the sunscreen tube in. And obviously my hands are a bit greasy. Almost immediately, the paint/words on the tube starts to peel and flake off. It was so bad that I had to put the tube in a plastic baggy and when I use it, I just put the end of it out of the baggy and squeeze the tube with it still inside the baggy. But flakes still fall out of the baggy a little bit. It&#x27;s like the design is disintegrating. So yeah, the packaging is a mess, and for that reason, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to buy it again when I&#x27;m through with it. Which is too bad because I like the sunscreen a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and won&#x27;t use anything else, there is no better sunscreen on the market. It is important that the products I use are natural, free of chemicals, and work for my sensitive skin.  Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.  Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> EWG gave it a pretty good rating. It is pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is too greasy, too white.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. A little pricy. When you apply it is leaves white residue on your skin. I think bugs might like it too, not sure. Probably better than the one with chemicals. Honestly, what works for me and is a lot cheaper is coconut oil with a few drops of carrot seed oil or rasberry oil, works like a charm, and bugs hate it.  It is also easier to apply and good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Works well...a little bit expensive for the teeny tiny bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is SO thick and very difficult to apply. It leaves a white color coating skin. I put this on my bf who is a tan/light brown color, and he looked like a man who was trying to look like a ghost of christmas past for a play, or something.</li>
    <li> This actually works very well as a sunscreen...however, and this is a BIG however, it doesn&#x27;t rub in well at all and literally looks like you have white powder stuck on you. If your a guy with hair on your body I can tell you its NOT a good look. Its also very hard to wash off, which is good and bad. I had trouble getting it off in the shower. I would rate it better because it really does work but until they retool the formula I would try to find something that doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;ve powdered yourself down.</li>
    <li> Been using Sunology&#x27;s natural sunscreens for years for me and my children. They are chemical-free which is very important to me and my children. They moisturize my skin while providing the all day protection that I need. I love these products and highly recommend them. PS: Love the new packaging!</li>
    <li> it leaves a very white cast. I looked like a ghost but I will say it does work well.</li>
    <li> All thick zinc oxide barrier sun creams leave some white pasty look and are slightly time consuming to apply. However the health benefits far out weigh these small issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Great Tips When applying!&lt;br /&gt;1.  Smooth on a light weight moisture lotion first so your sunscreen will spread more easily!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sprinkle unsweetened cocoa powder on your skin and blend to make the white zinc turn a pretty tan color. You smell great and cocoa takes you a shade darker! It&#x27;s a win-win!&lt;br /&gt;  Skin Cancer and brown age spots are no joke! EWG -Environmental Working Group has list of least harmful sunscreens. Their app is called Skin Deep</li>
    <li> leaves a white film and it is not as natural as it seems.</li>
    <li> felt a stinging sensation on my skin</li>
    <li> It works for natural....does have a white color at first....have to rub in really good.</li>
    <li> Product worked well, thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great if used correctly, leaves a little bit of a white sheen at first but soaks in nicely after working it in the skin and drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sunology sunscreens for the past couple of years.  They really work for my whole family.  I love that it is natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals on me or my kids.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I  like that its natural but it goes on tacky so I mixed it with another one- Once it dries on the body it still looks greasy- Wanted to like it thanks</li>
    <li> I know that this is great coverage and rated well on EWG, but it goes on with a white film and leaves you looking like a ghost. My husband used it at a baseball game and all the other dads just kept laughing at how white he was, he couldn&#x27;t get it to rub in! NOT good when you are trying to encourage sunscreen use!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic body sunscreen.  It&#x27;s dense, goes on clean and penetrates the skin so it disappears. You can feel the good minerals in it like a friend to the skin.  A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;m using it every day. No mess on your clothes, just deep protection of your skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very effective and rubs into the skin very well. It doesn&#x27;t absorb the way that traditional sunscreen does, but with a little extra effort, and checking yourself in the mirror to make sure you don&#x27;t have a pasty face, it absorbs wonderfully. I also have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my face the way traditional sunscreen always does. I would definitely recommend this stuff. I know it&#x27;s expensive, and you don&#x27;t get much product, but it is totally worth it to have safe, effective sunscreen without harmful ingredients.</li>
