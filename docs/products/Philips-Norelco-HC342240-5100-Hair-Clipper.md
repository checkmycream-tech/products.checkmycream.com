      <li>/&gt;This is a great clipper for the price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used clippers by Panasonic and Conair, and while they were all good clippers (with a ton of attachments to keep track of), I&#x27;ve never been truly impressed by any until I used the Philips Norelco HC3422/40 5100 Rechargeable Cordless Hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Norelco is a great brand</li>
      <li>The wireless aspect of this unit is great.</li>
      <li>hair clipper is great for the home barber.</li>

      <li>I do hope it holds up well, because it works great.</li>
      <li>Great for the price.</li>
      <li>All in all, a great product.</li>
      <li>In all honesty, this is great but get the 7100.</li>
      <li>I like this product, it very handy.</li>
      <li>Very nice,</li>
      <li>Very handy machine from the house of Philips Norelco.</li>
      <li>(But nice to have the option of plugging it in, too!)</li>
      <li>cuts hair really good</li>
      <li>Battery life is good</li>
      <li>It looked good to me out of the carrying case, but what do I know about clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are budget clippers that can do just as good of a job as these can</li>
      <li>Having said that, it does a good job</li>
      <li>fairly easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes switching lengths on the fly very easy.</li>
      <li>He said it was incredibly easy to use and is very good quality.</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The carrying/storage case that&#x27;s included is a nice perk, too.</li>
      <li>I decided I liked the look</li>
      <li>Its nice not to tied to a cord.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t been able to use any clipper on my beard, so I use scissors to keep from sporting the Duck Dynasty look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great, but I think it feels and looks kind of cheap.</li>
      <li>Ever since I started being my own barber, I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, I cut my own hair.</li>
      <li>Best hair clipper I have owned... thus far.</li>
      <li>have yet to see how the 5100 stands up to the test of time, but so far I am very happy with them.</li>
      <li>, while this is great for a straight crew cut, there aren&#x27;t the angled combs that most of these units have for giving that nice slant around the ears.</li>
      <li>For a battery operated hair clipper the Norelco is pretty darn good, it may not have an adjustable blade set which would have been nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;Light weight, and able to operate cordlessly (also works plugged in), makes it handy and easy to use.</li>
      <li>, I might have been able to use mirrors but...</li>
      <li>This one looked great in theory, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
      <li>It requires many passes to do the job.</li>
      <li>and it does have the concenience of being able to be thrown in a bag when your traveling.  </li>
      <li>but I have gotten more than 8</li>
      <li>I love not having to fumble with attachments or losing misplacing them.</li>
      <li>I was pleased all the way around.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful basic clippers and it does the job</li>
      <li>It seems okay if you want to cut hair all the way off, but if you want to leave some using the adjustable attachment, it doesn&#x27;t work for s--t.  </li>
      <li>But it gives a real quick cut if you are in hurry.</li>
      <li>but after that I was able to start thinking in millimeters.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve served me well, but this Philips Norelco unit is better.</li>
      <li>Norelco 5100 is lightweight and is mostly plastic.</li>
      <li>this set does have makes this just an all around better deal.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and rechargeable.</li>
      <li>This is a quality unit and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it for some time.</li>
      <li>More like an electric razor.  </li>
      <li>The guides incredibly easy to attach and best of all, don&#x27;t come off mid haircut!</li>
      <li>The cheap American-made clippers I had from the 60s was much better.</li>
      <li>Working great so far.</li>
      <li>It performs well, is easy to clean, and you don&#x27;t have to oil the blades!</li>
      <li>Budget cordless clippers with more than adequate results that should work for most clipping needs.</li>
      <li>The feature I love most about this Norelco Hair Clipper is the quick adjustments.</li>
      <li>It is so nice to find a clipper that has adjustable length right on the clipper itself.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to hold and use</li>
      <li>/&gt;This seems like a all-in-one solution clipper for us with adjustable length, lightweight and easy to wash blades i.e. just pop out the blades for washing off any hair stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The curved shape also helps me to hold it in my hand easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The comb on this allows for a lot of settings, 23 stops easily adjusted by the thumb, but not so easily it will slip on accident.  </li>
      <li>The blade guard adjusts in well-marked increments and the power button is easy to operate but doesn’t get switched accidentally.</li>
      <li>This one has one guard that extends and is easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the trade off against having the easily adjustable, built-in comb.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too tall, and it is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>adjustable comb works well to control the height of the cut, but it clogs too easily and requires continuous attention.</li>
      <li>At first, the Remington worked quite nicely.</li>
      <li>It is light and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to handle since it is cordless.  </li>
      <li>Clippers work fine but battery died within 6 months.  </li>
      <li>Philips customer service was exceptional though, they sent out a new pair.</li>
      <li>experience with Philips/Norelco personal grooming / hygiene has been polarized: the Philips Sonicare stuff has been great but the co-branded Norelco battery powered items never lasted that</li>
      <li>cordless isn&#x27;t that important a feature on clippers UNLESS they have the power to keep up with corded items.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>reason I am comparing the 2 is that A: the cheap Wahls have served me for over 2 years now and  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the fact that you can use it cordless or with the cord if you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge it beforehand.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a very nice addition to the total package.</li>
      <li>This one has been the most consistent and easy to clean one</li>
      <li>but the battery life was good and the amount of noise it made was not nearly as loud as most of the plug in type.  </li>
      <li>The Amazon description page does a nice job listing the main differences between the two.</li>
      <li>design is straightforward, but it feels somewhat clunky in the hand</li>
      <li>This is the first wireless hair clipper I&#x27;ve owned, and I must say I love it.</li>
      <li>Cut clean, no tugs or catches.  </li>
      <li>These clippers feel super cheap.</li>
      <li>It provides a clean, even, haircut.</li>
      <li>A guard attaches easily, and the case it comes in, while large, does the job just fine.</li>
      <li>The Norelco 5100 is a bargain and seems good enough for home use.</li>
      <li>If only it cut well, this would be a good product.</li>
      <li>It lacks power which you can feel when trimming, compared to a true electric clipper.</li>
      <li>It does have a good battery that is supposed to last 8 hours</li>
      <li>If you are a short haircut sort of person, then this is a good option for you.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does the job, has to be cleaned constantly throughout the cutting process</li>
    <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t use the comb. Light weight, battery lasted almost 4 weeks on a charge using it daily. The comb made a mess of my hair using it set for 5 mm (a bit annoying that it has only metric settings). I tried it both doing it myself and having wife do it. I then did it again using it on 1mm but it was still very uneven. I then just clipped it all off without the comb. I decided I liked the look so I&#x27;ve kept it. I redo&lt;br /&gt;it every day so there&#x27;s no mess of clippings.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to but it makes cutting your hair easier as there is no cord in the way.  It bogs down on my hair and I have to frequently brush out the clippers out as I cut but other than that they have been great!</li>
    <li> I like it! I was replacing an old Norelco that the guard broke and ended up getting this one (the old guard wasn&#x27;t available for separate purchase). It comes with a decent plastic case which includes the unit and manual, charger and some cleaning attachments. This one has one guard that extends and is easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting, it does a good job. Battery life is good and I haven&#x27;t had any major complaints. This unit is WIDER than my other one, which is a good and a bad thing. It cuts much faster but is a tad more tedious for around the ears etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars. Thank you for reading!</li>
    <li> The adjustable comb has to be removed and brushed out every few seconds or it quits cutting. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with other clippers. Very annoying. I won &#x27;t buy this sort of thing again. Battery seems to hold a charge better than my last clippers.</li>
    <li> I think some of these reviews are trying to compare Apples to Oranges.  You cant compare a battery operated trimmer with a plug in unit.  If you open up both of them you will see exactly why.  For a battery operated hair clipper the Norelco is pretty darn good, it may not have an adjustable blade set which would have been nice but it does operate pretty well for taking a standard hair cut and it does have the concenience of being able to be thrown in a bag when your traveling.  Overall I found the plastic to be a little on the cheap side but the battery life was good and the amount of noise it made was not nearly as loud as most of the plug in type.  So overall I think it&#x27;s a good clipper and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of hair clippers on my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. This has got to be the worst. I had to stop a minute or two into the haircut and switch to our Remington. This pair of clippers did not cut the hair evenly--the entire clippers are made of plastic, not metal, and feel too light in the hands. One needs a heftier instrument against the contours of the head to cut closely and evenly. These clippers feel super cheap. It comes with one attachment and the length of the cut is adjusted by a button on the clippers--nice idea but the button feels cheap and is hard to push. These clippers simply did not do the job.</li>
    <li> I used it to clip the fur of a stray cat outside (yes he actually let me do it) because he was getting some serious knots. It took a couple of sessions to get them all ,but now he is a very happy cat! I would highly recommend them for this purpose.</li>
    <li> The feature I love most about this Norelco Hair Clipper is the quick adjustments. I love not having to fumble with attachments or losing misplacing them. I&#x27;ve recently started cutting my own hair because of the diminishing quantity of hair there is left to cut. Spending $30 for a 3 minute haircut seems steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is funny on my beard. To be fair, I haven&#x27;t been able to use any clipper on my beard, so I use scissors to keep from sporting the Duck Dynasty look. This is a quality unit and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it for some time.</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy to handle since it is cordless.  Just what I need for a buzz cut.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KX68ADVLU1Y6]]Background you can skip&lt;br /&gt;I opted for a video review to make you hear the \\&quot;power\\&quot; difference with like-kind corded clippers that I normally use compared to the Norelco ones.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Philips/Norelco personal grooming / hygiene has been polarized: the Philips Sonicare stuff has been great but the co-branded Norelco battery powered items never lasted that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular item is just OK compared to the much cheaper Wahl:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79300-400-Color-Complete-Haircutting/dp/B000JNQSIQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395347844&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;wahl+clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am comparing the 2 is that A: the cheap Wahls have served me for over 2 years now and  B: cordless isn&#x27;t that important a feature on clippers UNLESS they have the power to keep up with corded items.&lt;br /&gt;You do not necessarily trim your hair every day , frankly I don&#x27;t even trim weekly (incl. my beard) and batteries like this tend to lose their charge over time. So when you are ready to use them I found myself plugging in the item into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About this item&lt;br /&gt;My main gripes that are keeping it from my LOVE IT 5 starts:&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are not adjustable, only the plastic head is: for short beard trimming this is useless&lt;br /&gt;- When I did force it through a beard trim: the blades snagged my hair a few times. Painful and my adjustable Wahl (see video) has none of that&lt;br /&gt;- the clippers work somewhat OK with the trim head on, but for precision trims (around the ears) the naked blades pouch away my thin hair and it really doesn&#x27;t work well. Its almost as if the blade distance is too narrow or so. Others have said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;- It lacks power which you can feel when trimming, compared to a true electric clipper. No comparison, even when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s too expensive for the plastic you get. It&#x27;s not even thicker plastic.&lt;br /&gt;- If your hands are wet, or the bathroom is misty then the buttons are slippery. Its hard to switch on. Maybe my item is just defective but the button requires some force as does the trim head dial.&lt;br /&gt;- The trim head is too big and bulky. Makes it harder to precision trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- It is lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re into cordless: it is but remember, it doesn&#x27;t hold charge that well over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: sorry for the accent in my video. I try!ns are slippery. Its hard to switch on. Maybe my item is just defective but the button requires some force as does the trim head dial.&lt;br /&gt;- The trim head is too big and bulky. Makes it harder to precision trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- It is lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re into cordless: it is but remember, it doesn&#x27;t hold charge that well over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: sorry for the accent in my video. I try!</li>
    <li> To make a short story long, I basically cut my own hair. I used to go to the barber, but for the kind of haircuts I get when I do have it cut (short), it just didn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense. After all, the barbers I&#x27;ve been to basically did the same thing...they just clipped it all off and then edged it to make the sideburns and neckline even. I&#x27;ve used clippers by Panasonic and Conair, and while they were all good clippers (with a ton of attachments to keep track of), I&#x27;ve never been truly impressed by any until I used the Philips Norelco HC3422/40 5100 Rechargeable Cordless Hair Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first use, it feels a bit light, especially for a unit that has to house a rechargeable battery. Fortunately, that didn&#x27;t translate to any lack of quality, as it quite simply cuts through hair smoothly, with very few catches in the blades (and mine is still very thick in places, though these days, not as thick on the top as I&#x27;d like). The adjustable guard/comb has 12 length settings and is a great alternative to having to change out the multiple combs that most other clippers come with. Not only do you not have to worry about losing them, but the way it just locks in place and is instantly adjustable to whatever length you want, it just makes for an easier, quicker haircut, all the way around. Battery time shouldn&#x27;t be an issue (advertised at 75 minutes a charge, I was pretty much done using it, cutting my own hair, in 20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews that this seems to be a chintzy, cheap-feeling, poorly-made product, despite the fact that it seems to cut hair pretty well. While it is lightweight, especially in comparison to some of the more &amp;#34;heavy-duty&amp;#34; units I&#x27;ve used from Conair in the past, I don&#x27;t consider it to feel cheap. It does a great job cutting hair, is easy to clean (fully washable and hair just doesn&#x27;t get stuck inside of the unit like some others) and really seems to be a good product, despite its light weight. If you want something that feels like an industrial-grade tool to shear off your locks, then steer clear of this. If you&#x27;re just looking for something that&#x27;s going to do a good job cutting hair, then the HC3422/40 might be worth a second look.ike an industrial-grade tool to shear off your locks, then steer clear of this.

    <li> Worked on Husband&#x27;s haircut today. My comparison is to a Wahl hair cutting clipper and kit. The Phillips Norelco performed very favorably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, having gotten brave or foolish in recent years, now wants me to cut his hair. Having no particular skill in this, I rely on the clipper and its guides to do most of the work to make the haircut come out even and more or less the same each time. The Wahl clipper system had a dozen or more guides of different heights which had to be changed out for each area and hair cutting portion. The Phillips Norelco has a single guide, but it adjusts to all the different heights! Very nice, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, and able to operate cordlessly (also works plugged in), makes it handy and easy to use. I was pleased all the way around. The only slight quibble is a lack of accessories - like a comb and hair clips.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 5100 Hair Clipper is efficient and simple to use. The blade guard adjusts in well-marked increments and the power button is easy to operate but doesn’t get switched accidentally. The blades do a good job cutting hair without pulling or snagging. A charging adapter is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is straightforward, but it feels somewhat clunky in the hand Although the wide head is efficient, it can be awkward to maneuver on curves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for a few years now, and in that time I&#x27;ve tried different types of hair clippers. This one has been the most consistent and easy to clean one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the dial aspect as opposed to having different clips. Makes switching lengths on the fly very easy. I also like that this is a self oiling clipper do I don&#x27;t have to mess with the mess (ha, see what I did there?!). And, like Philips Norelco&#x27;s beard trimmer, the battery life on this thing is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are budget clippers that can do just as good of a job as these can but the few features this set does have makes this just an all around better deal. Also, it comes with a nifty case. Recommended.</li>
    <li> For over five years I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair with the Oster Classic 76 Professional Clippers. I am comparing the 5100 Norelco to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the low price of the Norelco 5100. For this price you receive the clipper unit which has adjustments to cut the hair 12 different lengths. These are adjustments on the unit itself, there are not separate blades that you have to purchase separately (like the Oster 76) and put on. So there is a cost savings to buying a clipper that has so many different lengths built-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an 8 hour charge this can be used cordless for 75 minutes per the manufacturer. If you want you can use it with the cord plugged in also. The Oster only can be used with the cord which can be annoying if the outlet is in front of the person or to the side, the cord hits them in the face while clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 5100 is lightweight and is mostly plastic. The Oster 76 is heavy and is less comfortable to handle for a non-professional who does not have built up hand, wrist and forearm strength from cutting hair all day for their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that Norelco also makes a 7100 model which has more features and is a higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the price difference for the layperson, this Norelco is a huge savings on the unit and does not require buying each blade size separately if you want more than one cutting length. The Norelco 5100 is a bargain and seems good enough for home use. (I am unable to quote prices in this review per Amazon policy, just click to look at the Norelco 7100 and the Oster 76 Professional for an idea of the cost savings for the Norelco 5100.) If you want the Cadillac of hair clippers buy the Oster 76 Professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 5 stars for ease of use and low cost, more options and its cordless option.</li>
    <li> My father has a terrible time finding clippers he likes. They either don&#x27;t have the right attachments, need a lot of extra maintenance or just don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this in Vine, I decided to grab it and see how it would work for him. It looked good to me out of the carrying case, but what do I know about clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict: He loves it! the blade is self-sharpening, you don&#x27;t need oil to maintain it. It&#x27;s a very basic clipper with just the right attachments. He said it was incredibly easy to use and is very good quality. It trimmed his beard and hair beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is a great brand and I would highly recommend this product. Keep it in mind for a Father&#x27;s Day gift or Christmas stocking stuffer, or for a replacement clipper.</li>
    <li> I own several Philips Norelco clippers, and I imagined this would be a cheaper - yet still useful - addition to my collection. I found myself quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting up the clipper was simple. A guard attaches easily, and the case it comes in, while large, does the job just fine. Personally, with the limited room in my bathroom I&#x27;d have preferred a much smaller case, but maybe that&#x27;s just me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a 6mm shave of my head (thinning hair, *cry...*), and unfortunately the clipper doesn&#x27;t have a setting for 6mm, opting instead for 1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm etc.. My wife set the clipper to 7mm and began to clip my hair. We figured we&#x27;d see how 7mm went..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it went disappointingly: The wife found it very hard to be consistent with the clipper, and it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all of removing hair evenly. After roughly 10 minutes she gave up, and went back to our other Philips Norelco that we both really like for my head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00ARF429S Philips Norelco QG3380/42 Multigroom Pro]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While more expensive, it easily does a far better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for this Philips, it&#x27;s only worth 2.5 stars with my hair. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super-disappointed in it.  It seems okay if you want to cut hair all the way off, but if you want to leave some using the adjustable attachment, it doesn&#x27;t work for s--t.  It would not cut my beard down from 1inch long to a half inch long. It apparently isn&#x27;t sharp or powerful enough. It would only cut my head hair down to 1/2 inch after about a billion passes.  It&#x27;s just a toy--a big waste of time, a rip-off. The cheap American-made clippers I had from the 60s was much better. I will never buy anything from this company again and hope I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> Working great so far. Only need very occasional trips to the barber to clean up areas I can&#x27;t reach myself. I use the lowest setting for the shortest cut so no need to have any styling skills. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and use it once every two weeks. So far the first charge has lasted me 4 cuts and counting. It cost me a little more than what I would pay for one haircut so I&#x27;ve already recovered the cost.</li>
    <li> Paid for itself in one weekend.</li>
    <li> This trimmer and hair cut device works well.  It is quiet and low vibration compared to the heavy duty units.  More like an electric razor.  The adjustable guide does work.  If you are a short haircut sort of person, then this is a good option for you.  You cannot get longer guides for one full inch or longer, so your options are a bit limited.  Neither can you get angled guides for sides above the ears.  Still, this unit works great for simple straight cut haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I used this for the first time I have had compliments on my haircut.</li>
    <li> We have been cutting my husbands hair at home for probably about ten years now. We have gone through countless hair clippers. We usually buy a Wahl brand clipper, but they only last a few months before the quality of the haircut seems to decline. I don&#x27;t think we will be replacing this one soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips Norelco Hair Clipper does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It provides a clean, even, haircut. There are no weird patches of longer hair or (gasp) bald patches. It charges quickly. The guides incredibly easy to attach and best of all, don&#x27;t come off mid haircut! I enjoy the fact that you can use it cordless or with the cord if you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge it beforehand. The charge lasts a long time, however. It is lightweight, no more wrist cramping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great clipper for the price! Salon quality haircutting at home!</li>
    <li> It is so nice to find a clipper that has adjustable length right on the clipper itself.  No more fumbling around to find the right numbered comb to clip on the head.  This was a pain to do while cutting my hair.  But with this clipper I now can just adjust the length while the clipper is right in my hand.  This clipper also has 13 different lengths and.is cordless but has enough power to the do the job.  Its nice not to tied to a cord.  The comb and cutting head are easily detachable and cleaned under running water. The only problem I have is that the cutting lengths are in millimeters instead of inches.  So my first haircut (I cut my own Hair) was a bit short but after that I was able to start thinking in millimeters. The curved shape also helps me to hold it in my hand easily. It does have a good battery that is supposed to last 8 hours but I have gotten more than 8 and it only takes about 75 minutes to charge.  I would recommend this clipper to anyone.</li>
    <li> Clippers work fine but battery died within 6 months.  I suspect leaving the charger plugged into the clippers but unplugged from the wall did it in.  Philips customer service was exceptional though, they sent out a new pair.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does not cut hair that well. It leaves hair uncut in places and have to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; the next day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since high school. The style of hair I have makes it easy, and there&#x27;s really no reason to pay a barber. But I absolutely hate having to mess around with a cord. So I gave the wireless Remington HC5950 a try. At first, the Remington worked quite nicely. I liked how it only needed one comb, which was adjustable with the press of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after several months, the digital adjustment went haywire. Not only did it show the length number incorrectly/inconsistently, but it would intermittently move up and down when I turned the unit on. It would work after some tweaking, but got to be a bit frustrating. The digital adjusting of the Remington seemed cool at first, but it in the end, it just added more room for error. So that&#x27;s why I gave the Philips Norelco 5100 a chance; I wanted something that worked manually without all the fancy bells and whistles. Something that just . . . well . . . worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s exactly what I got. Not only does the Norelco 5100 cost less, but it is lighter in my hand, which makes it easier to use. And the manual comb length adjustment works like a charm. You set it and it stays in place. No monkeying around. No need for extra comb sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5100 doesn&#x27;t have the turbo boost that its higher-end 7100 counterpart contains, but I found I didn&#x27;t need it. Likewise, I found I didn&#x27;t need the Titanium Blades. The Stainless Steel blades cut through my thick, dense hair without flaw. And they are self-sharpening as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can remove the comb while the clippers is running to shake out built-up hair (like all clippers, it cuts better when unclogged), and snap it back into place fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see how the 5100 stands up to the test of time, but so far I am very happy with them. They gave me a much better haircut than the Remington HC5950 and with less hassle.</li>
    <li> Best hair clipper I have owned... thus far.</li>
    <li> Very handy machine from the house of Philips Norelco. This hair clipper is one of my current purchases which I used to personify my haircut with satisfactory compliments from my friends. The use is very simple. Only I am facing an issue in cleaning the product after use. The cut hairs went inside everywhere of the machine which is uncontrollable. But it gives a real quick cut if you are in hurry. Perfect packaging from amazon.com but the delivery date exceeded the promised delivery time.</li>
    <li> Clips closer than any other clipper.  Battery lasts a lot and can be used wet.  Great for the price.</li>
    <li> For years I have paid $30-$45 for a simple haircut and wash and frequently regretted it. As a guy, my hair is pretty simple, I keep it short and basically out of my way. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works! Follow the directions and take your time. Go slow.. and always make sure the flat of the plastic guard is flat on your scalp. Don&#x27;t try to use this like a beard trimmer. I suggest using it at the highest level and slowly incrementing it down a step at a time until you find your comfort level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast, seems to hold a charge a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Long power cord if you need to use it and it&#x27;s not charged.&lt;br /&gt;Seems well made and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None really, it does what it says. Only prob I ran into of course was that I had to have my wife do the back of my head as I couldn&#x27;t see around the back, I might have been able to use mirrors but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I end up with the same quality cut as $40 gives me? No of course not but it&#x27;s close (for me) and frankly I plan to use it for emergencies and touch ups between cuts.</li>
    <li> Does not cut well at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clipper for just a month now. Overall, nothing about it really impressed me but it is a solid hair clipper. I also have the 7100 which is the more expensive version. The Amazon description page does a nice job listing the main differences between the two. In terms of performance though i found that they are pretty much identical.&lt;br /&gt;Functionally they are the same as well. The clipper has just one attachment which you can adjust the length from a slider on the clipper. The 7100 does it smoother and on the 5100 its something rougher. The attachment itself is the same cheap plastic for both though so i dont know if it can take a fall or such. Since there&#x27;s only one of it you&#x27;d be out of luck if it broke until you got a replacement. Its easy to hold and use i had no problems in that regard. Its quiet for a hair clipper, but also in this regard not very powerful; even more so for the 5100 because it doesnt have a turbo option like the 7100.</li>
    <li> More tools than you can shake a stick at, a ton of settings, strong cutting power and long battery life. In all honesty, this is great but get the 7100. It&#x27;s quite a bit better and for not much more money. High quality clippers.</li>
    <li> Both my boyfriend and son use hair clippers, so we’ve used a variety of brands over the years, including beard trimmers and other similar devices. One of the annoying aspects of these is often the cord. No matter which way you’re turning or twisting, it seems the cord can get in the way. The wireless aspect of this unit is great. It means you can twist, angle, follow the contour of the head, turn to catch hairs, and so on. I definitely think all units like this should be cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trade-off is usually that it has a low charge, which can also be annoying. You won’t want to go around with a half-cut head! Luckily, this unit has plenty of life to get through a haircut and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable comb works well to control the height of the cut, but it clogs too easily and requires continuous attention. If it clogs, then the hair you&#x27;re trying to cut never makes it to the blades. You might not realize this until later in your hair-cutting process, at least the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while this is great for a straight crew cut, there aren&#x27;t the angled combs that most of these units have for giving that nice slant around the ears. That&#x27;s the trade off against having the easily adjustable, built-in comb. Maybe they&#x27;ll come out with an interchangeable piece that has the angle for a future or higher-end model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll give it 4 out of 5 stars for great general utility with a few issues that could be improved.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I cut my own hair. I have for over 20 years and I probably will for another 20. (Full disclosure: I cut my hair, but my wife uses a trimmer to do the back of my neck.) Ever since I started being my own barber, I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers. They&#x27;ve served me well, but this Philips Norelco unit is better. I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and rechargeable. No more having to worry about where to plug in the clipper when I want to trim my hair! (But nice to have the option of plugging it in, too!) The Philips Norelco clipper has a single adjustable comb, which I like. But I am a bit worried about durability. (I have no idea how much a replacement comb would cost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clipper is great for the home barber. It performs well, is easy to clean, and you don&#x27;t have to oil the blades! (That was always a pain with my old clippers.) The carrying/storage case that&#x27;s included is a nice perk, too. I never got one of those with my Wahl clippers. A little thing, yes, but it&#x27;s a very nice addition to the total package. I highly recommend this Philips Norelco hair clipper.</li>
    <li> This Norelco clipper is very lightweight and easy to use. I have used it on a few members of my family and we&#x27;re all happy with the results. It does a beautiful job cutting hair and it isn&#x27;t too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, but I think it feels and looks kind of cheap. I was surprised to see the Norelco brand on this product. It&#x27;s been many, many years since I have bought a Norelco product, but I remember them being very solid and well made. This clipper just doesn&#x27;t have that feeling to it and it looks like they cut a lot of corners in the quality of the plastic housing and slider control. If I had picked this up in a retail store, I probably would have put it back on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite how I feel about the appearance of the clipper, it still does a wonderful job and we&#x27;re getting plenty of use out of it. The blade and comb are excellent. I do hope it holds up well, because it works great.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a top of the line clipper, but it does the basic job very well.  The cordless feature makes it simple to use and it charges quickly and lasts long enough for a few touch up cuts.  It is light and easy to handle.  The adjustable cutting blade provides some diversity in the amount of hair you cut but it doesn&#x27;t have as many options as the more expensive clippers with multiple heads.  It isn&#x27;t precise enough to closely trim side burns.  For the price, this is an excellent option.  Perfect for travel as well given the weight and size.</li>
    <li> Like this convenient to use hair clipper because of its built-in different hair length trims. This hair clipper allows you to choose from 12 hair length setting i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 mm etc till 23 mm. I absolutely love this feature as I can adjust it to the length that I require without having to re-trim my hair when I use the current one that does not have the length fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves this clipper as she can easily and confidently clip my hair to the length projected without fear of clipping them unevenly. She loves that this is slightly lighter than the current one that we are using too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a all-in-one solution clipper for us with adjustable length, lightweight and easy to wash blades i.e. just pop out the blades for washing off any hair stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product from Philips!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since college, about 15 years ago.  I&#x27;ve never invested in expensive clippers and I&#x27;ve never taken good care of them, so I&#x27;ve gone through probably about 7 clippers over the years. Some lasting me a while, some not so long, and one pair getting tossed out after a half use. It just didn&#x27;t cut my hair. Those last were in the same price range as these, and were also cordless, so I honestly was suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut my hair this past week, was pleasantly surprised.  Cut clean, no tugs or catches.  And it cut on the first pass. Cheaper models often don&#x27;t cut well, requiring several passes making it hard to get a precise haircut.  If they don&#x27;t cut where you want, it&#x27;s very frustrating. These cut quite well. About 10 minutes in or so, I noticed a drop in power. Not so much it stopped, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as strong as before, though not so weak to cause problems. Just something I noticed, plug it in and it revved up. Again, only a slight drop but it does make me a bit concerned about battery life for longer haircuts or multiples if that&#x27;s your concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb on this allows for a lot of settings, 23 stops easily adjusted by the thumb, but not so easily it will slip on accident.  Of course, I have no idea the equivalent length, just numbers 1-23, but it&#x27;s not that hard to guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t as precise or as consistent with cutting as higher cost, plug in models, but for the cost this is a very good set. Budget cordless clippers with more than adequate results that should work for most clipping needs.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful basic clippers and it does the job well.  I was a little nervous because it didn&#x27;t have the regular plastic guards of all sizes that I&#x27;m used to. You control the length by means up a push-up dial on the back of the device. I kept thinking it was going to slip down and end up bald!  But nothing like that ever happened.  The only thing it&#x27;s missing though is an angle guard, which really could be useful.  If you want to have a fade effect from a 3-2-1, you really have to have the dexterity (or experience) to do it yourself with the different numbers.  Other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this little hair clipper is how light it feels.  Generally, clippers are heavier, but this model, although plastic is light to hold.  It isn&#x27;t too tall, and it is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice adjustment knob on the front, and this enables you to cut at different lengths, and there are 12 changes.  You will get only one trimming head with this.  But, you will adjust lengths right from the clipper.  So, that makes it easier, rather than changing clipper combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, this is plastic, not as durable as perhaps your old clipper set.  Therefore, be careful attaching that comb, which seems fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice cut for now, will update if changes occur....Rizzo</li>
    <li> I used to &amp;#34;go shaggy&amp;#34; in between haircuts with my sideburns growing too long and bushy and with stray hairs at the hairline around my neck. The Philips Norelco hair clipper, however, allows me to quickly and neatly groom myself without a visit to Supercuts. The clipper gives a close trim while still maintaining comfort. Especially when I trimmed my sideburns, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get the razor burn that often happened in the past -- even with professional grade clippers. All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> I use hair clippers for crew cuts. As I get older and my hairline higher, there&#x27;s not much point to going to a barber shop and spending $20 on a haircut. Every 4 or 5 months, it all goes. I had been using a wired Wahl clipper for years. This is the first wireless hair clipper I&#x27;ve owned, and I must say I love it. I always hated the bother of the wire interfering with movement and having to worry about snagging shampoos and other toiletries in my small bathroom. It also means I have to stand a reasonable distance from a power source. With this Norelco, I have complete freedom to move around and look at myself in the mirror without the cord getting in my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in adjustable length limiter is a great idea! I hated messing with the separate attachments and length lever on my Wahl because it often slips during use as the cutting edge comes into friction with my scalp, requiring me to pull back the lever in the middle of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is outstanding for the features, and about the same price as my non-cordless Wahl.</li>
    <li> I thought this was something I could use as a trimmer but as it turns out, this is really a barbers kit. Not saying it&#x27;s bad but the description is misleading. Having said that, it does a good job but it has a bit of a learning curve and may take some time getting used to.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair with hair clippers for years, so I have a fair amount of experience with different models. This one looked great in theory, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well. It requires many passes to do the job. This is particularly problematic for the back of my head, where I can&#x27;t see if I&#x27;m done. As a result, I need someone else to cut my hair for me, it takes a long time, and it&#x27;s frustrating. It&#x27;s not the worst hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I particularly like that the length is adjustable without having to change combs and without having a lever off to the side that is easy to move inadvertedly. If only it cut well, this would be a good product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it very handy.</li>
    <li> cuts hair really good</li>
    <li> Works really well for trimming my beard.</li>
    <li> This is a great little razor. The battery last a long time after charging and the trimmer adjusts to many different lengths. My only complaint is that the LCD screen/computer doesn&#x27;t seem to adjust or show the proper length of he trim after only a few shaves, I knwo how many clicks up or down on the setting i want it but the screen won&#x27;t show that length.</li>
