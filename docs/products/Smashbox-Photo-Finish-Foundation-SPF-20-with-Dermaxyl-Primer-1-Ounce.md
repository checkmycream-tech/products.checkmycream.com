    <li> I have really sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all. After putting it on, it makes my skin feel super soft. I love it for that reason alone. Works really well with liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread!</li>
    <li> Makes makeup last all day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes my foundation last all day, and it has sunscreen. It is also very long lasting, one tube lasts about 6 months.</li>
    <li> This make-up base goes on so smoothly and then my make-up smooths on right over it!  Makes the make-up go further, too!  Smooths out wrinkles - makes my skin look younger!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE...... SO TIRED of finding enough words to say I love it! Five more required! How many more!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works as a sunscreen and primer. I makes my skin look dewy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get this in the subscribe and save program. I am a vain woman, of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;and this has become a staple for me.I remove it with makeup remover wipes and have no problems.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation primer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great primer for a smooth look that lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This product makes putting on makeup a breeze. Makeup goes on smooth and looks good all day.</li>
    <li> Always liked this product, glad I found it here since this particular one is hard to find.  Wish they didn&#x27;t always come out with new ideas &amp; forget the old customers.</li>
    <li> I bought this one over the classic white Smashbox Primer, which I love.  I was attracted to the Spf for summer.  It works as a primer but not as well as the other. Plus, the product seems to separate in the tube if it isn&#x27;t used daily.  You can shake it vigorously and it mixes okay but if you forget you get a watery, greasy blob before the now-thickened product comes out. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I have deep acne scars. This product didn&#x27;t do anything. Save your money. Its pretty worthless</li>
    <li> I loved this primer. It made my skin look bright and smooth. I recommended it to my friends too.</li>
    <li> Best Foundation Primer in the universe!!! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, it glides on like silk, minimizes my pores, and makes the application of my foundation and blush easier to apply evenly. An all around must-have for your make-up bag!!</li>
    <li> Love it, been using it for quite some time (several years now) and still think it&#x27;s the best around.  Tried others, nothing works as well.  Sometimes, on weekends, it&#x27;s all I put on.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Smashbox primer from the department stores that comes in the square, pump bottle and the thickness is better than what is in the tube.  I&#x27;m not sure why this tube of primer seems watery</li>
    <li> I  love this product..not to heavy and allows powder to be applied smoothly. I would recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love this primer!  I call it my face spackle!</li>
    <li> This is the first time trying a primer. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
