<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I previously had Wen Fig and loved it. The Lavender is awful and leaves your hair dry and frizzy! Would love to return it for a refund as it was quite expensive....$58.00</li>
    <li> have used wen since 2009... would not use anything else on my hair. i love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it makes my hair manageable!</li>
    <li> Not sellers fault. Product leaves me too oily or too dry. I can&#x27;t find the balance that works for me.</li>
    <li> Reallly does a good job.  Hairr is much better looking,</li>
    <li> I really love WEN lavender. I&#x27;ve been using it a while. I ordered this product and it seems like it is the authentic product but I&#x27;m not entirely sure. Next time I will just purchase it from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Wen lavender and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least two years.  I love how it makes my hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Only use WEN product on my hair for the last eight years.  Amazing feel on your hair</li>
    <li> Love the 32 ounce bottle because this product goes quickly. I started using when and my husband tried it and like it too. Less hair loss than with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love Wen shampoo and especially the lavender scent of this one. it is invigorating and refreshing. I have found with Wen that I must use a different shampoo about every 2 weeks to keep my hair from getting flat.</li>
    <li> I have grey thinning hair that gets frizzy easily. It is brittle and hard to manage. Your cleansing conditioner was the perfect solution.  am going to take it to my beautician. If beauty salons would use Wen, they would get better results with customers.</li>
    <li> We have been using Wen for over a year now and love it. We have fine straight hair and so we do rinse very well. My color stays much better with Wen.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Perfect for my thick wavy hair and my preference for an all-in-one product.</li>
    <li> I am a new curly convert and this is what I chose to set foot in the door. I have lots of fine, very dry and frizzy, type 3b hair and have been using this every 3-5 days for the last month. I am 3/4 through the liter bottle and NEVER gotten 5* worthy hair. Some days worse than others but consistently frizzy and generally stringy, though yielded better results when used as advised on [...] and paired with a cone-free gel.    Makes a decent leave-in but not the best. Has great slip for detangling once you&#x27;ve used enough but note that will probably be A LOT less than stated by Dean. For my hair type and length he recommends 32-40 pumps but I&#x27;ve gotten best resuslts when using 20 pumps as advised on the [...] product page. I find the product TOO expensive for the results obtained but if it works for you, you&#x27;ll probably want to slowly reduce the pumps to see how much is enough for you. You can start with Dean&#x27;s minimum and reduce two pumps per section until you&#x27;ve reached the perfect combo.    I&#x27;ve used several of Dean&#x27;s techniques but this is DEFINATELY NOT the Holy Grail he advises it to be that \\&quot;does all\\&quot;. MIGHT give it another chance paired with other tested/true styling products in distant future but not convinced.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sweet Almond Mint and the Aloe of the Wen conditioning cleanser as well.  I love them all, but I feel the Lavender works the best for me.  I have fine hair and relatively thin hair, the Aloe works well too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for 6 months now, first time I tried it I was very impressed, since than, I read an article that we should not use shampoos to wash hair, and use only conditioners, I tried wahsing my hair with a conditioner only and I had exactly the same result washing my hair with the Wen shampoo. I think that Wen is just a conditioner, a good one, however, a very overpriced one. Right now, I switch between the Wen and the conditioner (one that is very inexpensive), I have to think if I realy want to pay so much money for Wen when a conditioner ($4 conditioner from WalMart) has the same effect. I have thin hair, I have been using the most expensive products on my hair for my whole life, so it is not that much about the price as it is about the effectiveness of Wen in doing anything different for my hair than a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I like the Wen products. I have thick wiry hair and this product leaves my hair soft and mangable. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell too much that is why I gave it 4stars.</li>
    <li> This product has been very good for my fine, thin hair.  It also has helped regulate my oily scalp problem.  I like it a lot.  I tried to go back to cheaper, phosphate-containing shampoos, but can&#x27;t after using this product - I&#x27;m thoroughly spoiled!</li>
    <li> I noticed that my second 16 oz bottle of WEN is getting low. So I came to Amazon to order more. I do not usually reveiw things. But I have to say that I think WEN is the greatest product ever created. I have naturally curly hair, and I am a redhead. I wear my hair in a short curly bob. Since using WEN not a day goes by that someone does not comment on my hair, the shine, the brightness, the softness. I will never go back to regular hair care products. When I started using WEN I literally threw every thing else in the house away regarding hair care and I have not looked back in regret. You will not believe until you try it for yourself. When my daughter was visiting she tried it and was amazed. My hair is healthier that it has been since I was born because of WEN. Everything the product claims is true and that is a rare find!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, do a test of this cleanser first. I have sensitive skin and using as instructed made my skin burn where the conditioner made contact as if I&#x27;d rubbed menthol on my skin. My scalp also feels dry, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel totally clean.</li>
    <li> Wen is the perfect balance for my fine hair and sensitive scalp. Since using it, my hair seems thicker and even seems to be growing faster now that my scalp condition is improving. I doubt I will ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Lavender!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never relied on sample packs to try out a Chaz Dean product since I knew about them.  I knew there was a money back guarantee.  For a long time I used Fig and Tee Tree (scalp issues which it helped), but sometimes the Fig was a little too heavy for my hair.  I read the manual from an order and tried Lavendar and ordered a 32 oz. bottle and never looked back.  (I have highlighted hair.)  It cleans without stripping.  Lately I&#x27;ve been sick to the point that I can&#x27;t wash my hair that often.  So I simply wash 2 or 3 times lightly with the heaviest wash last.  I also use his Re-Moist Moisturizing Mask and use it a little as a leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;m happy.  My hair is happy too.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but I just don&#x27;t really see the difference in my hair than when I use salon brand shampoo and conditioner.  I have colored hair and think it might help keep the color better than a standard shampoo.  You need to really rinse as they instruct.  The one thing I notice is that my hair seems to get dirty faster.  I don&#x27;t like to shampoo my hair daily and with Wen, the second day of my hair is much more blah.  I still use a styling product as my hair was kind of fly away when I didn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t think it is bad, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth $50.  I will use until the end of the bottle and will probably go back to a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I got the WEN sample pack, and found the Lavender was by far the best match for my fine, oily hair. I was really hoping that at some point in my life I&#x27;d be able to go a day between shampoos. There was not enough in the small sample bottle to really give this product a chance to work, so I got this jumbo size.    I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now, and I still have to wash my hair at least once every 24 hours or look like an oil slick. That is a big disappointment. Also, I began to have fairly substantial problems with dermatitis on my fingers after two weeks. I now wear plastic gloves to wash my hair, and the problem is nearly gone.    HOWEVER... I&#x27;ve had a problem with ear canal eczema for years that even prescription creams wouldn&#x27;t touch, and it cleared up within days of starting to use this product. Days! Also, this stuff actually seems to heal split ends - I have hair down to my waist, and haven&#x27;t had to trim the splits (can&#x27;t even find them!) since using the Wen Lavender.    So good points: cleared up eczema, split ends gone.  Not-so-good points: have to wear gloves in the shower, still a greaseball, and it&#x27;s really, really expensive.</li>
    <li> WEN is a really rich conditioner, not a wonder product. It smells like a spa (more rosemary than lavender)...the smell is surprisingly mild, and goes away instantly. The pump was broken, but I replaced it. The required number of pumps is ridiculous. You might as well plan to use an entire bottle each time you wash your hair. I tried using less, and then more, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.     I had no issues washing my hair without suds. My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, but it didn&#x27;t feel clean, either. It felt like when you wet your hair when it&#x27;s really dirty, but don&#x27;t wash it. Stiff and icky. Rinsing was a bit odd, because my hair never felt clean. When dry, I had zero shine. A bit less frizz, but seemed identical to washing my dirty hair with my standard creme conditioner rather than shampoo. Felt filmy, even though I rinsed properly. My hair had no smell, no bounce, nothing. I tried it a few more times and by the end of the week, my scalp felt dirty and oily, and my hair looked pretty awful. I then washed again with regular shampoo and conditioner and my hair is back to normal. All I can say is my hair actually feels better with regular shampoo, sulfates and all. An expensive lesson. It&#x27;s a good thing I tried the smaller (cheaper) size first. I think this is one of those products that works for some people but not others. Perhaps it has to do with hard vs. soft water or different types of hair. Oh, and the name is really stupid.     For reference, my hair is medium length, medium texture. More thick than thin, slightly wavy, and tends to frizz on the top layer due to repeated hair coloring. It&#x27;s exceedingly average, so I feel I&#x27;m a good test for most hair products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Lavender for over 6 months and really love the product. My hair is never dry or oily at the scalp, and it shines beautifully.  I am older with fine, lifeless hair. Wen gives my hair life and bounce especially if I use it with a dab of styling gel. The \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to using Wen, for me at least, is to use a couple of pumps first, work in and rinse off right away, then start again with the usual amount and leave it in as recommended before thoroughly rinsing. The first rinse ensures all the hairspray and gel is gone, the second finishes cleansing and conditioning while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the way Wen makes my hair feel. My hair was hard to control and never soft before Wen. I have tried several of the different Wen types, and this one is my second favorite. The sweet almond mint is the only thing better. My hair is silky, soft, and manageable. Wen is expensive but so worth it. I know longer have to use any other products to manage my hair so that is a factor in the cost. Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. First time user and I absolutely love this product. It works great on my fine, curly hair. The lavender product gets my hair squeaky clean (was suprised), and it has never looked healthier. I will be ordering more in the future (say goodbye to regular shampoos), and will order ahead of time so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I heard about WEN through infomercials. However I really did not want the commitment of the auto shipment that is required to go through the WEN site prior to even trying out the product. I am not a fan of almond, so I purchased the WEN Lavendar Cleansing Conditioner. First, I have straight Asian hair past my shoulder blades and it&#x27;s medium fine/coarse texture so I do need conditioner to de-tangle my hair. I wanted a one step system that does not \\&quot;strip\\&quot; my hair and leave it easy to manage. After receiving the large cleansing conditioner, I went through the video tutorial online and read through several online suggestions. In other words, I followed instructions to the tee by wetting my hair thoroughly, separating each section to \\&quot;lather it\\&quot; , comb through it, let it sit while I shower, and rinse. The first time, it took almost 15 minutes. Let&#x27;s just say that it took a lot more commitment than I usually take. The WEN Lavender smell is more herbal than floral, so I am assuming it&#x27;s an American Lavender varietal. I am mentioning this because other reviews have stated that this cleansing conditioner smells. I think it&#x27;s just indicative of the type of lavender that WEN decided to use. You will notice as you let the cleansing conditioner sit, it tingles. It feels like the tea tree shampoo that I have used from Trader Joe&#x27;s at $5.95. I believe the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; is meant to be connote \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to the user. Personally, I like it, but it&#x27;s definitely a preference.    As you rinse out the conditioner, you will definitely notice that your hair does easily brush out even when it&#x27;s wet. They recommend you put in a dime size conditioner into the hair after you rinse out. Let me skip to after blow drying my hair. I use an Italian high powered hand dryer with a large rounded boar&#x27;s hair coarse brush. This creates volume and texture, however I noticed that the WEN cleansing conditioner does tend to drag down the hair and make it go flat. The reason I say this is thatI have used Pureology Conditioner Hydracure Intense Moisture Masque for the last few years and it not only leaves my hair silky smooth, but after blow drying it gives it great volume. Please note, besides shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t put any chemicals in my hair, in other words: no color, no gel, no hairspray, no perm chemicals.     In conclusion, as I purchased the 32 oz, I still have half a bottle left and I alternate it between my regular shampooing and conditioning. As I am already using products that work really well on my hair, I don&#x27;t believe WEN has changed the condition of my hair for the better. I have to say that given the price, I was hoping for a more dramatic healthiness to my hair, but that did not happen. This may not be due to the product, but due to the current health of my hair. In the future, I might purchase this sporadically to switch out what I am currently using, but I don&#x27;t think this will be a stable given the price to effectiveness ratio.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. At 53 I still love my long hair. I color treat and wear it at mid back level. My hair is soft shines and a comb goes thru after a wash like a warm knife thru butter. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for almost 2 years. I use the cleansing conditioners and occasionally the hair mask and styling creme. I LOVE what they do to my hair! It is soft, shiny and never tangles. I ran out for a couple of weeks and went back to the salon products I was using before discovering Wen and immediately noticed a difference. The shampoo and conditioner I used are quite expensive, $35.00 a bottle each and I went through them in about 6 weeks; I have hair to the middle of my back and though it is fine, it is very thick. I had to use a boatload of conditioner just to get the tangles out. I don&#x27;t have to use as much Wen and my hair is so much nicer with it that my old products. I am completely hooked on this stuff and have found that contrary to what I read here, I have spent less on this than I would have on the Nioxin I used to use. I just wet my hair and follow the directions, put it up on top of my head while I finish my shower and by the time I am through a few minutes later, I am able to comb it out with no problem, no tangling. My hairdresser noticed the difference the first time she trimmed  my hair and she&#x27;s started using it too...we just don&#x27;t tell her boss! The only one I&#x27;m not wild about is the fig; the scent is too cloying for me, but the other 4 are great. None of them, including the fig, leave much scent after it dries.  I really can&#x27;t see any cons to this at all...it costs me less, works better for me and actually takes me less time simply because it&#x27;s only 1 step and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the tangles I used to get.</li>
    <li> My hair is in its best shape ever since using this Cleansing Conditioner.  Can&#x27;t go back to suds.  My hair is thick, coarse, and frizzy.  I don&#x27;t spend too much time styling it with the blow dryer because I have to use a straightening iron.  Sine using this product, my hair no longer feels fried.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair looks like it did when I was a teenager again.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Wen cleansing conditioner keeps long hair healthy all the way to the ends, reduces breakage, allows hair to grow longer and to look healthy doing it.  Doesn&#x27;t overdry the scalp, which in the past lead to excess oiliness for me.  A great innovation.  I do not expect to ever use traditional shampoo again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve seen the infomercial, believe every word of it.  WEN has completely changed my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 18 months, twice a week, and my hair is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am an African American women with course resistant hair and this product seems to work for me, it makes my hair soft and more manageable.  I read other reviews before purchasing and they were mostly good so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have no regrets, it does exactly what they say it does and I am happy to be in on the secret. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Worked better with my fine  and color treated hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite WEN product</li>
    <li> So maybe I am infomercial stalker, or maybe I am 1 who like to be completely informed b4 I purchase a product, BUT either way I finally purchased Wen Cleansing Conditioner and WOW!!!! Can you say \\&quot;Wen In LOVE!\\&quot; I am an African American woman with Natural (Shall we say \\&quot;Misunderstood\\&quot;) hair and I have been chemical free for over 12 years now.  This is where the problem USED to be.  I would wash my hair and attempt to condition it, then comb it out with the conditioner in it (MANDATORY), then rinse it and attempt to comb it out AGAIN!  Then fight it to blow dry it, and not cry in the process from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I finally ordered Wen after 6-7 months of watching the infomercial everyday and taking my own market research.  All I can say is HOW STUPID I FELT FOR WAITING SOOOOOO LONG!! I use the Wen Cleansing Conditioning Cream and NOTHING MORE!  I have the easiest time now washing and combing out my hair.  This may seem like nothing but for me it was a 45 min. to and hour and a half process that has been shortened to maybe 20-30 mins. TOPS!  Not only does it work, I found out that my GRANDMOTHER uses Wen and it was even more confirmation since she DOESN&#x27;T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING SHE SEES ON TV! I thank you and my hair thanks you!  \\&quot;Wen in love\\&quot; you tell someone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;TDT, Houston, TX</li>
    <li> I am able to use a little everyday to keep my fine hair from being greasy looking and also keeps the tangles away.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for years. I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 10 years....sounds gross but WEN really works and my hair is in the best shape since. All 3 of my kiddos use WEN even my sons. I would give it 5 stars but the price is steep and the shipping cost sucks. I typically order lavender or almond mint. The fig is a little heavier but its good too.</li>
    <li> I read reviews from probably 10 different websites before I bought this product. Other reviews were very helpful (they warned me to not order via the website) as those who have suffered from billing errors and issues with customer service. As usual, the ordering process via Amazon was amazing.    Now onto the product - I have fine hair and the past couple of years it has changed a lot. By the end of the day I am just a grease ball! It&#x27;s really gross. I talked to my family practitioner, my gyno and a dermatologist. The first two docs said it was hormonal changes since I&#x27;m in my mid-20s now. The dermatologist had me trying all sorts of fancy shampoos for dandruff and problem scalps and nothing has worked...so I gave in and purchased Wen.    I always take my time when using it and literally follow the instructions down to the finest detail but am disappointed in the results. Ads claim that it makes hair fuller, have more bounce and body, and is great for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; hair. It probably is great for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; hair but not all issues like they claim. I can see it being great for women or men who have thick, unruly hair with flyaways...but this stuff is awful on fine hair (despite the commercials and ads that say it&#x27;s great for all types). I will admit that it did make my hair very soft and I had fewer tangles during the day...but it made my hair even greasier...even with following all instructions.     It wasn&#x27;t the worst experience in the world - I am only giving it a 2 mainly because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for not working as well as promised. I won&#x27;t buy this again.    On a sidenote - for those of you going through what I am...I got shampoo from Kiehl&#x27;s a week ago and LOVE it! :)</li>
    <li> My hair was a ,edd before I started using WEN.</li>
    <li> Glad to be done with shampoo then condition.  Do follow directions</li>
    <li> I have tried the original formula and the cucumber formula.  This is by far my favorite!  I have thin hair, this formula definitely adds more volume than the others.  It also works equally well for the split ends.  For the first time in my life my hair is getting longer and fuller at a reasonable speed and I don&#x27;t have to constantly trim off the dead ends.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair and it works great for it. The only thing about this bottle is that they didn&#x27;t send the pump that&#x27;s suppose to go with it, so i&#x27;m now trying to squeeze my conditioner out of this huge bottle, which is a pain, and it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like the lavender conditioner I&#x27;ve used before from a different company. Soooo.......I think I&#x27;ll go back to buying directly from the WEN website.</li>
    <li> I now love this product. My hair feels softer and smells better than ever before. It is like satin. It didn&#x27;t tame my frizz as much as I would have liked. I love after I use it my hair smells amazing and my hair feel invigorating. I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> i already wrote a review and amazon fixed the problem I had with the order</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair! It is the only shampoo that I can find that calms down to craziness of my hair. It is WORTH THE MONEY! I promise you! The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that the scent is VERY strong. But I would recommend this shampoo for people with big, frizzy hair or even fine, frizzy hair. You should try it out, it does amazing on my hair and I think that you should give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen cleansing Conditioner for about a year now. I find that it really does give me more manageable hair.  Since my hair is short I do not have to use as much product as they recommend.  I also use it as a leavve in hair conditioner as well.  Bravo.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> I got the 6oz bottle to test it out. The lavender smells lovely and it does make my hair softer but nothing that is drastically different than Dove shampoo/conditioner.  You have to use a huge amount each time.  I have hair past my shoulders and the 6 ounce bottle lasts about 3 washings even when I use the minum amount recommended.  There&#x27;s NO way I would recommend anyone pay for at least two big bottles of this stuff per month.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive, but it&#x27;s great. I gave it as a gift to the girlfriend of my son. She has wunderfull long red hair and she was lucky to get this product. I&#x27;m from Germany and I use also this WEN for my hair. My husband is able to see, weather I have used WEN or another schampoo. It looks better with WEN. I would like to order this product for myself - its too bad, that you don&#x27;t send it to Germany.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s why....it didn&#x27;t do everything it promised.  Yes, my hair feels great.  Yes, it looks healthier. Not much different in volume though.  I have thin hair and need product to give it some oopmh.  Some people say it&#x27;s easier for them to skip a day in between washes.  For some reason I can&#x27;t.  I have noticably unwashed hair if I do.    So while I&#x27;m not in love with it, I can&#x27;t bring myself to use regular shampoo now.  In the shower, your hair feels amazing.  You will notice an immediate difference from that standpoint.  I tried the multi pack to see which cleanser worked best for me. Fig was the worst.  The almond was really good, but the lavender seemed to work best for me.    I didn&#x27;t have bad hair to begin with, just thin and I wanted it to look thicker.  There is definitely improvement.   Definitely worth a try.  Use more product than less if you&#x27;re unsure of how to use it. And leave it on the entire time you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write a review for any product but felt this was necessary. I first tried the 16 Oz Sweet Almond Mint and loved it! I have longer medium thickness hair that is curly when air dried. I noticed a dramatic reduction in hair loss (hair in shower, on my brush, etc). Also, my hair was really soft and shiny. If I were to rate the Sweet Almond Mint it would be 5-stars, hands down.     I went to order the 32 Oz and at the time Amazon didn&#x27;t have Sweet Almond Mint in that size in stock, so I ended up ordering the Lavender. You would think that the scent shouldn&#x27;t make much a difference in the actual results of the product but it does in this case. I have noticed my hair is more brittle, dry, and I lose more hair on this compared to the Sweet Almond Mint. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will now just stick to Sweet Almond Mint. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up that the different scents do have different effects.</li>
    <li> Have used WEN products for a while now.  Hair is beautiful.  Lavender is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Good and thick. Sometimes, from otherr sellers it comes a little thin. This one is always thick and works great.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been a WEN fan for about a year now.  I absolutly love the product and will buy again. But the lavender smell is way too over powering.  At times it felt as though my scalp was burning but overall I love the WEN line. :-)</li>
    <li> I started using Wen shampoo/conditioner about a year ago and I will never stop...Amazon had the best price and the largest size available...Thank You Amazon...!!!...</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Greasy for super straight hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but for this product, I had to. I am an \\&quot;older boomer\\&quot; and, over the years, have spent thousands of dollars trying to find the right shampoo/conditioner. The search is over. My hair is thin, fine, wavey, &amp; foiled. I&#x27;ve been using the Lavender products for several months. Up until I began using the Cleaning Conditioner, Styling, &amp; Volume, no one would say to me that my hair was silky, shiney, healthy, beautiful, and full of bounce. Now they do!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Great product for great value!  Fast shipping too!  I love this stuff! It smells and works great for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  Save your hair and money with WEN. Been using for 5-6 years and would never again wash hair with any other product.. Daughter also uses this product. Also love all the flavors from Fall, Winter that Chaz makes the smells are luxurious.</li>
    <li> Two years into using Wen, and I still love it.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever stuck to one shampoo line this long.  Can ABSOLUTELY tell a difference if I am traveling and forget the wen and have to use something else.  Do I wish it was cheaper?  yeah.  But worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have found that I can make it last a bit longer if I add some water, and I think it cleans a bit better.  I know you are not supposed to use the word &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; with wen, but watered down just a bit it does seem to clean better.</li>
    <li> just as on the infomercial - love it and how it benefits my hair which had been ruined by long hospital stays and much anitbiotics and ther meds; cut my hair down to a shortie and now use only WEN!</li>
    <li> This is the third Wen cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve tried (first was Sweet Almond Mint a few years ago, second was Cucumber Aloe).  I liked them both, but didn&#x27;t quite get the exact results I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily scalp and fine hair.  Recently my hair has been dry from the middle to the ends, so I thought Cucumber Aloe would be The One to save it.  I got about 3/4 of the way through the bottle in a few weeks when I realized, though my hair was clean and tangles have lessened, that my hair was still a bit puffy and wasn&#x27;t getting the moisture I was looking for.  I then purchased the Lavender and it was exactly what my hair needed!  My hair is slowly becoming more hydrated. Plus, I love the scent:  it reminds me of the cool lavender cloths the yoga teachers give us at the end of class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the pump is a bit faulty (it pumps slowly and doesn&#x27;t recover quickly for another pump; I have to wait a minute for it to fill.  If I force it/pull it up, it just sucks in a bunch of air).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the Lavender will continue to be good at my scalp end (it seems the Cucumber Aloe was better to get rid of oil), but it&#x27;s definitely better for moisture!  I guess the rule of thumb with Wen is to investigate what formula is best for your hair.  (The difference is NOT just \\&quot;scents.\\&quot;)  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be sticking with Wen this time.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it relaxes me  The sent last all day. Plus yu can use it every day without over drying yur hair. My hair has never felt or looked so beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love the minty feeling on my scalp when using it and how my hair smells after using this product. My hair looks great too!</li>
    <li> I have multi-textured hair (who doesn&#x27;t!) and this helps it not frizz nearly as much. The only problem is that it&#x27;s so much I have to hide it to keep the rest of the family out of it.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have not been loyal to one brand or another.  That all changed when I purchased WEN conditioning cleanser for the first time about 4 months ago.  Who would believe you could have shiny, clean, easy to manage hair without using shampoo?  I never knew how harmful conventional shampoos are till I saw the WEN infomercial and ordered from the TV.  Yes, it is a bit more expensive.  But not if you consider that you eliminate the need to purchase shampoo AND conditioner AND leave-in conditioner and so on.  The directions say to use a lot of pumps, but my experience (and my daughter&#x27;s experience) have shown that you actually need less than HALF the recommended amount of pumps for absolutely beautiful, healthy hair.  There are several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; available for different hair types.  I have only used the lavender, but my daughter uses the cucumber aloe and is very happy with it.  I could go on and on, but just watch the infomercial sometime and believe what Chaz Dean tells you.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen Cleansing Conditioner, even before the infomercial blasts, as my \\&quot;product\\&quot; of choice - the best ever shampoo, conditioner and styling creme all in one natural product.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I like Wen conditioning shampoo but it is just too expensive</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff....i have very thin/fine hair that is very very frizzy and curly. and this takes the frizz out.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was -- softer than it has ever been. I like the idea of doing a healthier cleasing of my hair. Don&#x27;t be surprised when you don&#x27;t get all those suds like regular shampoos -- this product doesn&#x27;t have all those chemical things in it that make suds, but it still will clean your hair. It&#x27;s true that it is kind of on the pricey side, but if you figure the additional cost of a conditioner on top of buying shampoo, perhaps it isn&#x27;t so bad when this product does both jobs. I don&#x27;t use as many pumps of the product as Wen suggests; I just put a few on the sides, top, and back and then really work it in. I let it stay on my hair until I&#x27;m done with my shower and then I rinse it out well. My hair comes out soft, shiny, and managable. I like ordering it through Amazon because then Wen doesn&#x27;t set you up for those automatic shipments.</li>
    <li> I purchased the WEN Lavender shampoo with high hopes that it would help me with my dry ends....OMG was I in for a surprise!  After about two weeks of use I noticed I was loosing all sorts of hair when I rinsed, more noticeable by my forehead area.  I made a doctors appointment thinking that something was wrong with me.  My doctor asked me if I had changed shampoos recently....\\&quot;I DID\\&quot; I told her.  She asked me to stop using it and see if my hair loss discontinued......I quit using it and my hair loss has stopped.</li>
    <li> I am a Wen girl/woman now.  Have used for a few years, since his cleansing conditioner came out.  I am extremely sensitive to any soap products/sulfates, so this is perfect.  As a mature woman who covers up her little sparkly hairs, this makes my hair color last a lot longer, as the product claims to do.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day anymore, like I did when using soapy shampoos.  I love Wen.  It is different than the shampoos we have been using since our childhood, so you have to get used to the difference.  Give the difference a chance, and you will love it.  So will you hair.  I get compliments on my hair all the time.  I have recommended it to many women.  I have very fine hair.  Wen makes it feel full, soft and luxurious.  I will never go back to shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo very much. It&#x27;s very different from regular shampoos in that it doesn&#x27;t suds up but that&#x27;s ok. My hair feels washed and conditioned when I rinse it out.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s an expensive product.</li>
    <li> I like the Wen products. I have thick wiry hair and this product leaves my hair soft and mangable. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell too much that is why I gave it 4stars.</li>
    <li> I recently started using the Lavender Wen after using the Sweet Almond Mint.  I will start by saying I am a fan of the Wen Sweet Almond Mint.  I don&#x27;t love the scent, so I thought I&#x27;d try a different one.  I have medium length, fine hair, with a tendency towards an oily scalp.  Not a great combination to have!  I typically need to wash daily to keep my roots from looking greasy and my hair going flat.  With Wen, I can wash every other day, with much better results. Both the Sweet Almond Mint AND the Lavender (volumizing for fine hair) have the same great results.  You do need to use the recommended amount (at least ten pumps), and rinse it very well so you don&#x27;t leave any residual product in your hair.  Also, there is no longer a \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; shower, as it takes time to apply it thoroughly, massage it in, let it sit, and rinse it completely out. That said, I love the results, my hair is fuller, with more bounce and shine, and somehow my scalp never looks greasy for two days.  However, the Lavender has a much stronger menthol scent that the original Sweet Almond Mint, it will actually clear your sinuses!  It has little to no noticable floral or lavender scent.  I am going to try the Cucumber Aloe next, but the Sweet Almond Mint is a sure bet!</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so good before Wen! Really try it - you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to love this stuff and my hairdresser says my hair feels really healthy since using it.  I received it before the due date as well.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> As with a lot of thing you see being sold on the tv I was somewhat skeptical. As I have extremely dry hair and now live in the high desert the problem is even worse. I bought this thinking it can&#x27;t do any worse than all the other stuff I have tried. As well as my hair being dry it is also very curly, as a matter of fact, if I do nothing with it I end up with a &amp;#34;Fro&amp;#34;. This product has help more than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> As proud member of the curly hair club, I know that using standard shampoo leaves my hair a frizzy dry mess. Wen makes sure that may hair is clean, soft, and really helps cut down the frizz. This with a weekly deep conditioning treatment (twice a week in the winter) keeps my hair soft with actual curls as opposed to a Brillo pad esque rats nest</li>
    <li> great product works on my thick tinted curly hair to soften it and makes in vwery managable tames frizzies in the damp weather and is great for dry hair</li>
    <li> I have been ysing Wen for 2 years and i love it. My hair has never been healthier softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I happened to buy this for my girlfriend who was insisting that it really made her hair look amazing. I really don&#x27;t know much of all this, but i just went on and bought it. All i would have to say is that it really does work wonders, her hair looks amazing from when the second she tried it. I have never seen a difference like that, and well this was for sure a perfect gift that she enjoyed so much. Plus I got her a large bottle which made her have a bigger smile. Overall this product is perfect, and really brings out the best in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love WEN....my hair has never been this healthy feeling. The product is pricey but I believe it is worth it. Just be careful when purchasing the product as you may end up in a &#x27;recurring shipment contract&#x27; that you never intended to enter.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother and she loves it. Hair feels thicker and stays cleaner longer.</li>
    <li> Love Wen - saved my hair!</li>
    <li> Product worked well cost was ok</li>
    <li> I felt like my hair was still dirty the two times I used it.  RETURNING</li>
    <li> I use it as a conditioner after shampooing with Aveeno. Alone it is too heavy for my fine and thin hair.  But as conditioner it is great. My hair shines and has volume</li>
    <li> it is the best shampoo since my hair started turning gray.  It makes my hair nice and smooth not wirey like the new gray coming in.</li>
    <li> Love it, everybody must try this product, don&#x27;t need anything else. I have been use it for over 5 years</li>
    <li> Been using Wen on my hair for over two years,  gives the hair body and shine, will definitely recommend it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> After some experimenting I found this product to be a wonderful substitute to shampoo 1-3 times a week. I also discovered continuing to use conditioner after rinsing wen enhances the product. I still use regular shampoo 1-2 a week.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair that I straighten each day with an iron.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveda and Bumble &amp; Bumble products until now. The Wen cleansing condition is so much better than those!  My hair no longer has the frizzie look.  And, it feels so clean - even if I skip a day.  With other shampoo/cond, my hair always felt really heavy &amp; dirty on the 2nd day -- not at all true w/Wen.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and the Lavender Cleansing is perfect for my locks! It gets 4 out of 5 stars because WEN products are so expensive!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this at all. Caused severe scalp irritation and really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair. Sorry that I spent so much on a non shampoo. Would not purchase again, and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wen cleansing-conditioners for over a year now. I have fine wavy hair that is color-treated. I find that this product is all that it is advertised to be. It is gentle, keeps my hair hydrated and I only now need to wash my hair twice a week. You do need to rinse throughly to avoid residual product left in your hair, but my hair has never been in such good shape. I also appreciate not having to do a two-step process every time I shampoo (shampoo and condition). The product is relatively expensive, and you do need to use quite a bit to get the desired results, but I feel that it is worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> It smells great...i love the way your hair feels and looks after using this product...the bottle is so big it last a long time</li>
    <li> First, the fragrance is like a lavender field in Provence. The product doesn&#x27;t lather like conventional shampoos but when used as instructed, the sensation is tingly and unmistakably clean. My usually fine and limp hair was noticeably glossier, softer and more manageable with no flyaway friz. My scalp which can feel tight and dry especially in the winter felt simply refreshed. I was skeptical about the hype, but Wen delivers on its promise.</li>
    <li> I love my lavender cleansing conditioner so very much! i condition every day now. Before I couldn&#x27;t shampoo that often, my hair just wasn&#x27;t happy that way. Now it always looks great!</li>
    <li> I really do love this product. I have used the Almond Mint and really like that one too. I used the Fig and HATED it!  I have caucasian hair, that is really curly. I do dye my hair. This keeps my hair soft and smooth. I do still need mouse or gel to tame the flyways. My hair always feels and smells clean.</li>
    <li> the spout did not work- have to squeeze out shampoo- so you end up using more than you need</li>
    <li> I got one as a present and liked it so much that I bought one to keep using. No longer am I greeting tangles and am not losing hair</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for a few years. I love, love, love, but I wish you were able to get Lilac ... That is my favorite ... Simply beautiful...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who loves the gentleness of this brand for her stressed-out hair. She claims to now have more hair on her head, less in the drain! PS - I use it and so does my other daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend cause she&#x27;s always wanted this product so I got it and she was really happy for it and worked great on her hair. And it was shipped super fast to my front door</li>
    <li> great product for all types of hair!</li>
    <li> I like the almond much better</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair feels shiny and healthy even after years of dyeing, bleaching, blow drying, and flat ironing. I prefer this product over my stylists shampoo. I only use a dimw size of serum when styling, and my hair looks and feels great! Thank you wen!!</li>
    <li> Washing with this shampoo is like washing with conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t get the hair CLEAN. If you have fine straight hair like I do, you won&#x27;t like the results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleansing conditioner.  You have to follow the directions exactly to get best results.  My hair is normal in thickness but vety dry and wavy.  I will never use shampoo again.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and love it.  I don&#x27;t think my hair looks any better but it feels amazing.  I didn&#x27;t give Wen 5 stars because I can&#x27;t believe how fast I go through it and I have chin length hair.</li>
    <li> I love my WEN.  It is all I use.  My hair can be a fried mess, but WEN is a lifesaver.  My hair is always moisturized and in great condition.  Yeah, it is tricky to use because it does not create a lather, but it is the kindest and gentlest product to use on your hair.  My hair is very fine and it really transforms it to a shiny, thick and sleek.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about this product for several years. My mother-in-law recently gave me several samples in all different scents. I tried them all, I looked up directions online, and I followed the directions to a T. I have thick, long, wavy hair. When I fixed it before Wen, I would either blow dry it and then use a straighter and a curling iron, or use a lot of mousse to wear curly. Either way I wore it, it would always be frizzy by the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 days of trying Wen, my hair was finally manageable. I can now wear it straight and it lasts for days before needing to be washed again. I usually wash it every other day, but sometimes I will go for 3 days. My hair is now shiny, not frizzy, and it looks healthy. My husband even noticed the difference and gives me compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I have read the reviews about hair loss with this product, and that has not been my experience. I loose hair, but only a normal amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the different scents, my favorite is the P... Read more</li>
    <li> Heard such pros and cons on this so figured I would try myself.  Personally my hair couldn&#x27;t feel better and heck it is easier to use one product then two. At first I left unfilled do to no lathering happening that passed when hair became softer. You do have to follow the direction to get the results not a mircle peeps.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It does exactly what it is advertised to do. Always delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Makes my fine thin hair look and feel great. I have actually received a couple comments! yea</li>
    <li> Love the product&lt;br /&gt;Best my hair have ever been!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells although, on me, it isn&#x27;t like shampoos that you can smell in your hair all day.  It has a nice little tingle and that makes me think it&#x27;s doing a good job of cleaning my scalp.  I didn&#x27;t experience the dirty hair feeling a lot of people seemed to mention.  I am a little confused though.  The bottle says 16-24 pumps for medium hair.  My hair is actually pretty long and I only use about 7.  I don&#x27;t even think I could fit 16 pumps of the cleansing conditioner in my hand.  Maybe it&#x27;s because the bottle is big (32 oz) and the amount dispensed per pump is bigger.  It does make my hair soft and shiny, but I guess my hair already is.  ASIAN HAIR FTW!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Great product</li>
    <li> WEN products are great product for maintaining healthy hair!</li>
    <li> I am a curly girl, thick hair and shoulder length.  Wen helped me manage summer humidity.  My hair is not so dry or frizzy.  This is my second purchase.  First was 16 oz Spring Gardenia and loved that.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is everything it was said to be. Definitely made my hair feel healthier. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> must alternate with regular shampoo</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair but smell good. My hair was dull. I have thick and typically very shiney hair, but Wen changed that for the worse. My husband has short Curley hair and he felt like it didn&#x27;t work for him either.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s why.it didn&#x27;t do everything it promised. Yes, my hair feels great. Yes, it looks healthier. Not much different in volume though. I have thin hair and need product to give it some oopmh. Some people say it&#x27;s easier for them to skip a day in between washes. For some reason I can&#x27;t. I have noticably unwashed hair if I do.&lt;br /&gt;So while I&#x27;m not in love with it, I can&#x27;t bring myself to use regular shampoo now. In the shower, your hair feels amazing. You will notice an immediate difference from that standpoint. I tried the multi pack to see which cleanser worked best for me. Fig was the worst. The almond was really good, but the lavender seemed to work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have bad hair to begin with, just thin and I wanted it to look thicker. There is definitely improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try. Use more product than less if you&#x27;re unsure of how to use it. And leave it on the entire time you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioners, especially the Fig, Pomegranate and Lavender.  The product protects my overpriced hair color, feels good in and on my hair, and rinses out easily.  There are many knock-offs available, but Wen was first and remains the best.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item after seeing all the hype about it.  I have used it for weeks and love the product.  However, I have found other products that are less expensive and I get the same great results.</li>
    <li> Would not use anything else on my hair.  Great price.  It breaks down to $29 per 32 oz.  If one were to purchase a 32 oz separate you easily would pay over $32 dollars.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong. Absolutely worth the price. I like the relaxing lavender scent and it&#x27;s one of the few that has the alcohol listed in the ingredients, way down the list, very important!!! I have been out mowing the lawn for hours with my garden hat on, taken it off, wow my hair, smells great!!! Even if it&#x27;s been a few days since i&#x27;ve used wen, awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products and this is perfect! My hair is shiny and healthy; I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this will never use shampoo  again 😊</li>
    <li> I love the Wen product and have used it for quite some time.  I have long hair and it is thick.  I comb the Wen through in the shower and it is super smooth and well conditioned.  I use quite a bit since my hair is very long but generally speaking, I think the bottle would last the average person about 2 months.  This particular delivery, my pump was broken so I have to pour it out of the container.  A little inconvenient but doesn&#x27;t change the product itself as being a good quality.</li>
    <li> Ii don&#x27;t have a big prefrence about the different scents, but have&lt;br /&gt;not returned to regular shampoo since trying wen.</li>
    <li> Best one in the line for fine hair I have found</li>
    <li> I have used Wen products in the past.  I got this one to try it and like Sweet Almond, this one is just as good.</li>
    <li> Iuse it as conditioner . I do use mild shampoo to wash my hair before using Wen . It is perfect match for my very dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product. Had a bad experience dealing with Chaz Dean directly, thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing an infomercial.  I have found that while I like the results, I cannot just use this without shampooing normally once or twice a week, because my head starts to itch.</li>
    <li> All commercials sounded too good to be true but after trying it  - IT WAS WONDERFUL. Even after 1st time, hair was soft but seems thick enough to hold style with only comb/brush.  Used the Styling Cream with 3rd shampoo-left next day for 2.5 weeks-washed with rain water-no chance to &amp;#34;set/pamper&amp;#34; but hair stayed very manageable, clean and no smell!!  A little pricey,but this product makes my hair look,feel and SO easy to just let it style itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now then, if only you&#x27;d come up with some kinda product that would change our looks into the lovely faces that go with the commercials ------)</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t bring myself to purchase until a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;m a clean freak, and the idea of not using shampoo just grossed me out because I was sure my scalp/hair would feel dirty.  I finally broke down, figuring I could always return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  And yes, I bought the 32 oz. vs. 16 oz. because the price was a better bargain, so a real gamble!  From the first time I used Wen I *loved* it!!  My hair and scalp feel perfectly fine.  No more itchy spots.  And the scent is AMAZING!!  I have very fine, silky hair which has always looked great the same day it&#x27;s washed.  But completely flat and limp the next day.  Been this way my entire life, and I&#x27;ve shampooed every single day because of it.  Well, with Wen my hair is just as fluffy/full the next day!!  It looks *exactly* the same on Day 2 as it did on Day 1.  Completely amazing!  Am I still shampooing every day?  Well, no.  I&#x27;m cleansing with Wen every day.  But I really don&#x27;t need to.  So, the bottom line is that I didn&#x27;t expect to be impressed with or particularly like this product.  But I am...it is awesome and wonderful.  Oh...I don&#x27;t use anywhere near the amount suggested.  I have very, very short hair and use a single pump.  But I do put it on first thing when I get in the shower and leave it on until just before I get out.  I also only &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; once and don&#x27;t use any as a leave-in either.  Based on my usage, this bottle will last me for a very long time, making it one of the less expensive hair cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about this product for several years. My mother-in-law recently gave me several samples in all different scents. I tried them all, I looked up directions online, and I followed the directions to a T. I have thick, long, wavy hair.

I loose hair, but only a normal amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the different scents, my favorite is the Pomegranate, second is the Fig, followed by Cucumber Aloe. My 2 least favorite were Sweet Almond Mint, and Tea Tree Oil, respectively. I think the different scents are for different hair types, so someone else may have a different experience with those. I have already suggested this product to my friends and family. I would suggest following directions. I watched a video online about how to do it and that really helped. Make sure you rinse it thoroughly, and adjust the usage based on how much hair you have. I use around 9 pumps, and my hair is very thick and long, about to my bra strap.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for last two months and I&#x27;m pleased with results. My hair is full of body and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must for color treated hair and I no longer use a hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Lavender for 7 months and I will never use shampoo again. I have thick wavy hair. Many products were good but most tended to dry out my hair.  Wen gave me soft but manageable shiny curls and no more frizz or dry ends.  Color stays longer and I am not loosing as much hair in the shower or when drying my hair.  The infomercial is true.  This stuff is great and worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love Wen products, but we all know how pricey they are.  This is a giant bottle, for a pretty good price for this line of goods.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong, which I like.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen hair conditioner. It&#x27;s my favorite hair product. It smells fantastic too! It doesn&#x27;t lather up so if you like a good lather to feel clean you won&#x27;t get that here. My daughter and I both agree that our hair has never looked better. I&#x27;ve tried several varieties and they are all good.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to all expectations, and is especially appropriate for damaged or colored hair.  There is no product build up after use, and you can shampoo less with the same daily confidence that your hair will meet your expectations.</li>
    <li> this product takes a little getting used to ... we are so accustomed to that sudsy squeaky clean feeling ... this product is non sudsy ... so... i believe the secret to the desired end result is ... use as much or as little as you are comfortable with, for me it&#x27;s 4 pumps, massaging the Wen WELL into your scalp. i find that when i take a couple minutes to do this, i have a better hair day .... try to leave it on the hair as long as possible while you shower...i have found my hair to become luxuriously thick and my long hair seems to last longer and look better between shampoo&#x27;s ...every other day or every three days and it still looks great! ... if. at first you feel your hair is a greasy mess, as some have described...stay with it, try to refrain from using everyday and i believe in about a week you will be feeling great about how you look in your hair!</li>
    <li> After seeing the infomercial several times and reading lots of positive reviews about Wen I decided to purchase the lavender formula and try it out for myself.  I thought it felt terrible in my hair the first time I used it. It seemed very heavy and was difficult to rinse out. The worse part, my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better. I wanted it to make my hair shinier and to control the frizz and it didn&#x27;t do either of these things to my hair. I decided to keep using the product because I read that it could take a number of washings before you can see a noticeable difference. I washed my hair with Wen on average three times per week for four weeks. I never did get the results I wanted and, in fact, my hair was feeling worse and worse to the touch. It was flat and dull and the frizz never did improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old daughter was also anxious to try out Wen. She wanted silkier and fuller hair. She used it twice and hated the way it made her hair feel so much that she refused to ever use it again.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect and the price for this was very good...  I love Wen and buying it from Amazon was the best decision I made</li>
    <li> I love all &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; products on my&lt;br /&gt;Hair. It&#x27;s not harsh on ones hair.&lt;br /&gt;No more Shampoo for me. It&#x27;s a buy</li>
    <li> I had written a review before, but a few months later I have to say that Wen is working out very well for me. It is still the only product I use on my hair. After a while my hair has become more healthy-looking and it feels like the hair I had in my 20&#x27;s. This product is so easy to use, and for some, it might take a little while to get used to just using one product, but it is so worth it. I also figured that it costs me about 17 - 20 dollars to use Wen each month, but I am sure that everybody can agree that it is easy to spend that much on all the products you use on your hair a month. Wen is the only one for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. The minute I started using it, I noticed the different in my hair. Smell good, leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Worked well the first month but then I started to get build up. It also is super expensive so I went with some natural shampoo/conditioners from whole foods that were much better overall.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is amazing. My whole life I&#x27;ve had straight, no body hair. After using Wen, I actually have curls! I think it&#x27;s because there is nothing weighing my hair down. I am totally hooked on Wen.</li>
    <li> I tried wen (pomegranate) from a friend of mine and decided to order my own it&#x27;s truly wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t care for this scent and the way it left my hair feeling. I have tried other Wen scents and so far I like the original Sweet Almond Mint and I recently purchased the Tea Tree and I like it better than the Lavender. I thought the Lavender didn&#x27;t smell like I imagined it would plus it seemed to make my hair hard to get a comb through. The Tea Tree seemed to give my hair more volume and I think it made my hair feel softer. I have very fine thin hair and I feel that the Tea Tree has been the best so far for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Wen products and this was no different.  The product arrived quickly and the results from the conditioning conditioner were excellent.  Will keep returning to Wen products, time and again!</li>
    <li> Personally, I wasn&#x27;t a fan but I don&#x27;t use shampoo either.  I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, Lavender.  I am also male so I am not looking for bounce or flow but it was just the price.  It did make my hair seem smoother when I still dyed it.</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype and tried Wen products. My recommendation is this is probably great if you have normal to dry hair, but if you have oily hair it is not a good product. I am not impressed! If you have oily hair, steer clear of Wen.</li>
    <li> The WEN left my fine hair limp and greasy</li>
    <li> Wife absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> 5 stars, love the product.</li>
    <li> love hat this product does for my hair</li>
    <li> My hair is shinier and easier to style.  Plus, it seems to bring out my natural highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I take cancer medication which is causing me to lose my hair.  Every time I washed it I would find strands of it&lt;br /&gt;in the bath tub.  It has been several weeks of using when and the fallout of hair has subsided considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you WEN.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I like Bed Head better. It doesn&#x27;t even smell good. Can&#x27;t believe this product is so expensive. It&#x27;s just average &amp; nothing special about it at all.</li>
    <li> Long time user of this product. I use it daily and love the way my hair feels. I will say that the the manufacturer suggests I use 4 or 5 times the amount that I actually use on my hair so experiment with it to see what works for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 1 year.  I&#x27;m a black female.  I&#x27;d been relaxing my hair for almost 20 years and that resulted in very dry, brittle, very damaged hair.  Then menopause crashed into my life and caused further damage.  Two years ago I had all of the the relaxer cut off and started all over. Thereafter, I had tried various shampoos and conditioners...even those that supossedly are formulated for \\&quot;black women\\&quot;......to try to restore softness and moisture back into my hair.  Ha!  they all failed miserably! Then I happend to see QVC and Wen was a featured product. I never watch QVC but I&#x27;m glad there was nothig else on that day worth watching.  I orderd the cleansing conditioner and the oil and the results have been very favorable.  I don&#x27;t use anything else now.  I use the lavender and have used the fig.  They smell wonderful and they don&#x27;t have the harsh detergents in it that other commercial shampoos have.  I sometimes wear wigs for versatility and I even use Wen when I wash them.  Wen is a keeper for me.  Thanks Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> My sister bought me a bottle of this for my birthday.  I was quite skeptical, but I was running low on shampoo anyway so I decided to give it a shot.  It turned out to be one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve received.    It has the creamy consistency of conditioner, so at first you may be thinking that this stuff will leave your hair limp and greasy, but somehow it leaves your hair light and clean and super soft.  The biggest difference I noticed was the added shine.  My boyfriend even noticed that my hair was much softer and shinier.    The instructions recommend about 10-12 pumps a day, but I only use 5-6.  My hair is really fine and also not very thick, so how much you use will depend on your hair.  A 16oz bottle lasted me about 2 months.    I recommend trying it out.  The results are pretty instantaneous, so you&#x27;ll know after a few washes if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen shampoo-conditioner and my hair is so soft. I was told by my stylist that it used to be course feeling. Now it is soft, bouncy and has shine.</li>
    <li> Love it so much gave this as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Although silky feel in shower when rinsing,  lots of tangles and when I use more product then too heavy. I used the almond which I liked until I highlighted my hair,  which needs more conditioner which is why I tried the lavender.</li>
    <li> I have middle of my back blonde, fine, thick hair.  I love this stuff, just wish it wasn&#x27;t priced so high.  But, well, I am hooked so....</li>
    <li> There is no better shampoo.  It is well worth the money and will last you for months if you have shoulder length hair...  It was a life saver for me!!  Thank you WEN!!</li>
    <li> I have used WEN Lavender for at least 3 years and love it. Yes, you have to use a lot, yes, it&#x27;s pretty spendy, and yes, your hair will be in great shape. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. I color my hair blonde and I never have to worry about brassiness or color change. Love, love.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have long fine hair and it gives great body and volume and keeps my color looking fresh!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have a lot of very course, curly hair and Lavender Wen is the key to making it look amazing.  On the expensive side but I think it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I would use nothing else!!</li>
    <li> This product works very good. I have dry damaged hair &amp; I see a difference in the ends of my hair. However, I feel I have to use it almost everyday because after one day my scalp feels dirty. Also the lavender smell is a little too strong. I will try the almond next.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. Once I started using it nothing else compares.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair turns out after using this shampoo. Wish it was not so expensive as I would love to use it all the time. I have long hair and it takes quite a few pumps to completely coat my hair. I use it when I want to look especially good for an event!</li>
    <li> Love Wen. Saves me time and my hair has bounce and shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen after started getting Brazilian Blowouts a year ago. It is awesome. I love lavender. You don&#x27;t have to use as much product as recommended but follow the wash and condition instructions. I don&#x27;t get the split ends like before (I&#x27;m a heavy user of the blow dryer and flat iron when my BB starts to grow out). I must also say that moving to Chicago, I never used to get dry flaky scalp, but with the extreme cold winters, this product has nourished my scalp to where the matter was resolved within a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  Never had compliments on my hair before WEN.  It does everything it says it does.</li>
    <li> I live this cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only one I use.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using Wen for several years and have seen a great improvement in the texture and fullness of my baby-fine hair. This 32 oz. size is a good bargain when compaired to the 16 oz. size, and with Prime there is free shipping. Would highly recommend the lavender for all the baby-fine haired out there.</li>
    <li> this product takes some getting used to when you are accustomed to regular shampoo but is wonderful for your scalp and hair.  It is such a nice product.  follow the instructions.  you&#x27;ll be amazed how nice your hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I love WEN (well, that is when I can afford it!). I&#x27;m not a big beauty product person but my hair is the one place I pay attention. I love to dye my hair and condition it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I workout a lot and swim often enough that I worry about damaging my hair. I have long, dark, oily (dry/damaged ends due to processing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love using this product. I usually use Lavendar but haven&#x27;t had any complaints with others I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing I will say is- at first, I thought it made my hair too oily, still, but after other reviewers suggesting a double cleanse: I tried it and my hair is the best it&#x27;s ever been considering the damage it&#x27;s been under this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price- even though the product is amazing and has quality ingredients, I still find it hard to afford on a regular basis (as have others I know who have tried it have said).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this product at fisrt. How can a conditioner leave my hair feeling cleansed and clean? After a little bit of nagging from my mother (THANKS MOM!!!) I broke down and bought the product. I AM HOOKED! After the first use, my hair felt silky and was so shiny. Before I had used this product, I was ready to cut off an inch or more of hair that had been damaged by a hair dresser who bleached my hair. The ends were completely fried. After one use of WEN, you couldn&#x27;t see any damage whatsoever! I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to regular shampoo again. There was no breaking of my hair and no color fading either. My color has lasted so much longer than it would have with regular shampoo, and that&#x27;s because red faids fast. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a way to increase the health of their hair. I also want to note that I have very curly hair and I live in a high humidity area of the US, and it did wonders for the frizz!</li>
    <li> I purchased a 15 oz. bottle of the lavender cleansing conditioner just to try it. I have used it twice, and I&#x27;m sort of undecided about it. I have thick long hair that gets dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s healthier for your hair than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, and my hair even looks good when I wake up the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really gross. It smells like... wood, mint, and cat pee. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so expensive, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that great.&lt;br /&gt;It does a horrible job at getting rid of tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might use this product every once in a while between using my normal shampoo/conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think I can justify spending this much money every month for a sub-par product.</li>
    <li> So was all excited about this product, my friend has been using it for a month.  I on the other hand have only used this twice, and once when I used her product.  Then the Intensive treatment once.  Yesterday was my second time.  I swear to you, one would think I was on chemo, so much hair fell out.  So  I went online, sure enough it was right there for me to see, multiple complaints about hair falling out.  The ball of hair that came out yesterday, would have overflowed a shot glass.  I have thick hair, will I did have thick hair.  The first time the same thing happened.  Needless to say::::: WARNING WARNING WARNING.</li>
    <li> Wen is by far the best hair cleansing product I have ever used. My hair is shiny, healthy and the curl is much more prominent without the frizz!</li>
    <li> I remembered loving this product when I used it 4 years ago. My hair has been really dry and brittle so I ordered a bottle from amazon. I have mixed feeling about it:  Likes:  When I blow dry my hair, it sets instantly in place   I don&#x27;t need to use any other smoothing product  Dislikes:  There is a lot of wax in here, I feel like I need to wash my hands after I touch my hair  I need at least 20 pumps to wash my hair, if I don&#x27;t want it to look greasy  My hair seems to be thinning. I may be imagining this, but my hair feels thinner and I feel like there is more hair in the drain than normal  I need to wash my hair more often than before.   I am going back to Kerestas, which I&#x27;ve always loved, but I will finish off this bottle first.  I think a cheaper and smarter solution to my hair problems would be a Brazilian Blow Out and regular hair trimmings.</li>
    <li> Huge fan I wrote the review for this on a different purchase</li>
    <li> This Lavender cleanser feels nice and tingly on my scalp and has a delicious scent.  I absolutely love it!  Leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this from the Wen web site but will not do that again.  I had canceled my order but they continued to send me unwanted products and charge my credit card.  I had to cancel that card.  After that , I found it on Amazon.  I have fine hair and this product is perfect for my hair.  I use Aveda hair products on the weekends just to switch things up but love going back to Wen on Monday.</li>
    <li> I like I mix half wen half folicure seems to work for me</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I love the tingle on my scalp,the smell of lavender and the way my hair feels so clean!</li>
    <li> I love wen! This is worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to use for your hair. I take a lot of medications and it really effects my fine thin hair. Since i started using Wen, my hair has become soft, shiny, and fuller looking. It&#x27;s a great product for anybody&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s also economical, as it only take a small amount as it&#x27;s cleanser and conditioner in one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, works well, smells great!</li>
    <li> Wife and kids love this stuff. Great bday and mothers day gift for guys wondering.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner in one of its kind.  The direction in pumps depends the thickness of your hair.  I pump twice and spread it through the scalp. Let it settle for two minutes, then swipe Wen through to the end of the hair. Let it settle for a minute. The rinsing takes half the amount of time.  My  hair is fine with medium amount of hair and middle of the back length.  The outcome is cleaner, bouncy, and shinier.  I shampoo less than prior usages with other shampoo.  Shampoo three times and the result is the same.  This product does not lie.  I will purchase other scented Wen.  Worth the money and save spacer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My hair loves this!</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product.  I love the scent, the creamy texture, the way it makes my hair feel soft.  It&#x27;s a product that makes sense to a lot of us.  A conditioner that cleans rather than strips the hair.  That&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using this for over a year so much that I got this big bottle since I was tired of running out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s this.  I started noticing I was having an itching burning scalp and drier hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then the hair started falling out.  I was in a panic.  I switched to other shampoos in desperation.  Suddenly, no more hair falling, no more itching scalp.  I was thinking what the heck, it had to have been the Wen that was the problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s simply that I developed an allergic reaction to this or not.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it is.  I have developed an allergy to Brazil nuts and Hazelnuts as an adult.&lt;br /&gt;So I suspect that some of the botanical ingredients in this might have begun to cause an&lt;br /&gt;allergic reaction in my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I blame the Wen for this? Probably not.  But I&#x27;m sure there must be others out there who have had something similar happen.  If essential oils are in this, they most definitely can cause inflamation if they contact the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I like the product? I love it.  I love the scent of lavander, the thick creaminess of the product and they soft smooth way it leaves my hair.  But I&#x27;m scared to use it again due to the problems I encountered in my scalp. I&#x27;ve tried two of the other scents in this but the lavander seems to be the most moisturizing, which is what my dry hair needs.  The other scents didn&#x27;t make my hair as nice as the lavander did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend that you try this but be aware, especially if you have allergies, that you may notice some reactions from it in your scalp.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I am 60 yrs old and my hair looks like it did when I was 30. Have used this exclusively for 3 yrs.  even travel with it. Best thing about it is that I does NOT strip out color. I only get a brightener put on my grating blonde hair and this product doesn&#x27;t take out even that mild product. My hair is soft and healthy looking. I&#x27;d never go back to shampoo</li>
    <li> I love the oversized bottle and the fact that the Lavender is for fine hair.  Wen Clensing Conditioner has been great for my hair.  It is in better condition than ever since I stopped using shampoo with &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;.  This cream is wonderful.</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR CARE PRO DUCT EVER! I have sensitive skin and suffer from dermatitis, and it cleared up after using this shampoo. My hair is so soft and I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it anymore :-)</li>
    <li> I love Wen!!! I have noticed a huge improvement in my hair after using this product. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to regular shampoo!</li>
    <li> Wife has been using Wen Almond Cleansing Conditioner for a while.  She thought she&#x27;d like to try the Lavender one.  Found it is actually better for her hair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the wen cleansing conditioner. It makes my hair shiny and smooth and very hydrated! I love this product!</li>
    <li> not impressed ,,, probably just not use to no suds .. does not seem clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only cleaned my hair with WEN once so far, but it came out really clean, no residue, and not dry like it usually is. But we will see, the jury is still out after using it several times how my hair responds to this new way of cleaning my hair.</li>
    <li> this is fantistic  have tried other shampoos since starting wen  always go back to wen  highly reccomend  its the best  hard to pay the cost but well worth it</li>
    <li> Wen is the only thing that works on my fine hair. No tangles without being weighed down! I have never been able to get out of the shower and run my fingers through my hair without tangles until now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen over a month now and I must say that going back to traditional shampoos and conditioners doesn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. Wen works great without all of the harsh chemicals and lather and suds you find in normal shampoos and conditioners. It&#x27;s great stuff. The scent is amazing and the product cleans your hair without harsh detergents-plus you only need the one bottle, you don&#x27;t need shampoo and conditioner. This is all in one. You can put it on in the shower and put a few squirts all over your hair and let it set and rinse and repeat. Sometimes I only do it once and it&#x27;s fine that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your hair healthy, shiny and manageable. My hair just feels thicker and fuller. The best thing that I like about Wen is that I don&#x27;t shed. Often times when I took a shower and washed my hair, my hair would shed during and after when I combed it. I haven&#x27;t noticed the shedding since I began using Wen. This product was recommended to me by a long time Wen user who swears by it. I agree completely that this is a wonderful hair product and I highly recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> Used for years now and love the body, color protection and conditioning. Turned many others on to it. Be sure and use as much as it recommends.</li>
    <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t use too much...don&#x27;t need as much as suggested. I sometimes use regular shampoo and then finish with the wen shampoo as I have an oily scalp. My hair was damaged and this changed my hair to healthy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I had seen the commercials and thought about ordering Wen before.  I was afraid it would leave my hair flat.  My hairdresser recommended that I try it because my hair was dry and frizzy.  Now my hair is shiny and full and the softest it has ever been.  This is a great product!  The major dislike is the high price.</li>
    <li> I have very long, slightly wavy, fine, blonde highlighted hair. My son has biracial, semi course, curly, dark hair. I no longer have to buy separate shampoo AND conditioner for both of us. One bottle of Wen is all we need! Saves me $$ but more importantly, my hair is shiny, voluminous and bouncy with crazy hold. My son&#x27;s hair is soft and shiny with defined, controlled, no frizz, springy curls. Now that we we use Wen. Seriously. We should be on the infomercial. Love this product. Never going back.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, however it looks thin because it&#x27;s so fine.  Since I have been using WEN, my hair is in awesome shape, not even needing much of a haircut and I do have highlights and lowlights.  That in itself is hard on the hair.  The last time I went to the hairdresser, she was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t take the product out of my hair so she used her shampoo and then used the WEN once, next day I had to wash it out and condition it with the WEN conditioner that came in my first kit.  It worked it out and the next day it was beautiful again.  I won&#x27;t use anything but WEN now.</li>
    <li> Not as conditioning as I remember. May be that my hair has a tolerance to the stuff. I have fine hair that is pretty unmanageable without Wen so I do recommend this to anyone with long fine hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted - works for me</li>
    <li> Love it ! Makes my hair so soft and light. I won&#x27;t go back to using regular shampoo. So happy</li>
    <li> It Smells good and is a Good price. Would get it again. I like the Lavender. It does Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I like the lavender Wen which I ordered almost a month ago. The wrong product was shipped to me and I am still waiting for the lavender to arrive. Not happy that I am still waiting for the item I ordered.</li>
    <li> It is so wonderful my hair is soft and silky I just love it. I have used this product for a long time. Delivery was quick and product was very well packed awesome service.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and Wen is best for hair.  No longer is my fine hair limp and oily looking.  Love the fluff and flow.  No need to use extra products on hair.  Just a small dollop of wen as a leave in conditioner and hair can air dry or blow dry without the frizz.  Thanks seller..I do recommend you highly..A+ to you.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEN! I started using it about three years ago. It&#x27;s now the only hair product I use. Lavender is a universal cleanser formulated for all hair types, particularly dry, dehydrated, or color-treated hair. It&#x27;s promoted as being great for creating volume without weighing hair down (I can&#x27;t really speak as to that particular claim as my hair is naturally very thick.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using WEN, I noticed an immediate difference. My hair was softer, and less dry. As I continued to use it, I noticed that my hair got softer and felt more moisturized. Now, after three years of use, my curls are springy, non-frizzy, and soft. I am bi-racial, although I have what you would probably call \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair. Typically, daily washing makes my hair feel dry and course. With WEN I can wash my hair as often as I like--as a matter of fact, the more I wash it the better it feels. My routine is to wash my hair every two or three days (I wear my hair natural; it&#x27;s soft, but has really tight \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; curls, and is very thick.) On the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just wet it and apply a little WEN as a leave in conditioner before combing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! It&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;ve saved so much money on other hair products--conditioners, leave in conditioners, moisturizers, etc.--that from a financial perspective it&#x27;s pretty much worked out to be even. Furthermore, it makes my hair feel so fantastic! I used to hate my hair, and have done all manner of things to it in the past; relaxing, curling, braiding, you name it. Now I just wash and go! There&#x27;s nothing like WEN! I love it and would highly recommend it! FYI WEN is appropriate for children too; although the recommended formula for that purpose is Sweet Almond Mint, as it is the mildest. Furthermore, WEN now also has a children&#x27;s line...WEN Kids, which includes three different scents; Strawberry Banana, Watermelon, and Apple.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hair and I am happy with this product, works great, great quality and competitive price</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  It does so good on mine and my daughters hair.  Makes combing a whole lot easier!!</li>
    <li> Love WEN - have been using or about a year and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as prior to WEN. I think my hair is twice as think since using WEN.</li>
    <li> Wen works so well. No need for additional hair products or lots of bottles in the shower. Just follow the directions, use Wen @the beginning of your shower, rinse out @the end - great clean, shiny hair! It&#x27;s so nice when a product actually does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my daughter as a last minute gift for Christmas and do I mean last minute. I got it before Christmas and was VERY pleased! She LOVES IT! I got her the biggest bottle I could find! I am impressed with the entire transaction of this buy. Would do business again with this seller.</li>
    <li> For most of us, life feels like a movie we&#x27;ve arrived at forty-five minutes late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!&lt;br /&gt;You happen to it!&lt;br /&gt;We r not victims !&lt;br /&gt;For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.&lt;br /&gt;;~PB</li>
    <li> I have had thin, straggly hair for my whole life.  Eventually I made it a habit to have a few extensions placed every few months, just to improve my hair a little.  A friend of mine asked me if I had seen the Wen infomercial, and we both laughed.  I decided to try it and I have to say it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I always get great compliments, and never have a bad hair day.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best product to use on my curly hair.  This and some gel is all I use</li>
    <li> Love it my hair feels and looks more healthier  and my  color last a lot longer than it did before</li>
    <li> I like WEN a lot. When I first used WEN I could see the difference compared to other products. Although the lavender burned my eyes a bit in the shower, and wouldn&#x27;t hold my curls as long as the other products did. I would next time start with the simpler products of WEN before I tried this again. All in all not terrible.</li>
    <li> Been using this Wen product for 10 years, love it, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. My hair is wispy and likes to fly away with WEN Lavender Cleansing Conditioner it is manageable again.</li>
    <li> the difference I feel in my hair is amazing!  I let some friends use it and they went and brought it also!</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for 3 years now.  My daughter is a stylist and I can get salon products at cost but I keep going back to WEN.  I have thick, coarse hair.  WEN keeps it soft and frizz free.  I love the shininess of my hair.  I can&#x27;t use regular products because my hair ends up dry and frizzy.  I can imagine if you have limp, fine hair- this may not be for you.  But if you have thick ethnic dry frizzy hair- this is perfect! I can&#x27;t give it up- ever!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair.  I have tried what feels like tons of products, its nice to find one that works.</li>
    <li> My favorite Wen scent for very thin straight hair. This product reduced my hair loss and texture significantly. Will never use regular shampoo again.</li>
    <li> got this for grand daughter who has thick curly hair,  after using it was fun and easy for her to brush her own hair.</li>
    <li> love to have my hair back! this is a great shampoo/conditioner. my hair has got the volume and thickness as it did before i got sick. i ran out of it and had to use regular shampoo; the feel of chemicals on my hair and my body was disgusting! i couldnt wait for Wen to come in the mail. if for whatever reason you think Wen Lavender is not helping you, try a different &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; as every hair is different and you just may need a slightly different approach. Wen works! i&#x27;ve been doing it for over a year, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The product works great for me hair.  It works on all types of hair, even permed hair.  It really helps me lock in my curls while still making my hair easy to comb.  The smell is good too.  The larger 32oz helps me not have to worry about running out of stock compared to the normal 12oz.  I recommend this product to all who are looking to bring their hair to life.  WEN is a great product!</li>
    <li> Well this product lived up to the hype for me. If you want to spend the money it is worth the results. I have short thick hair so I don&#x27;t have to use the ridiculous 16 pumps recommended. But my hair has never looked and felt better. People should decide for themselves however if it is worth the money. You can get travel size at Sephora but you need a week to really see results.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the pump does not work. I like the hair product itself, it leaves my hair in great condition. But the packaging could improve. The pump doesn&#x27;t work and makes it hard to get the Wen out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has a great fragrance.  You really need to work the product down to you skull to get a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product it is great and smells wonderful.  I would recommend Wen to anyone who has hair loss due to chemo.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to stop hair loss by stimulating the scalp with the comb provided.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed in improvement in my hair and I really like this product.  I don&#x27;t know if other people notice any difference in my hair but I&#x27;m happy with it and that&#x27;s what counts.  I have recommended this product (and shared it) with friends.</li>
    <li> I have premature gray and have been coloring my hair for years.  This shampoo keeps my color true, my hair super soft and silky, and I am now able to have long hair since using Wen.  It wasn&#x27;t healthy enough before then.  I love all the Wen cleansers and don&#x27;t use any other conditioners or styling products.</li>
    <li> another GREAT choice from WEN. This one smells great and leaves your hair soft and shiney. Will buy this one again</li>
    <li> love this in between shampoo for color treated hair.  Use also as a conditioner and detangler.</li>
    <li> Dried out my scalp.  I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Wen! I have long, thick, curly/fuzzy hair and this has been the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond and two other seasonal scents and the Lavender by far has been the best one. I even started buying my daughter the apple kids Wen, her hair is also curly and fuzzy and not only does it smell great but is tames the frizz and leaves big beautiful curls. I will never waste my time on other shampoos or conditioners again.</li>
    <li> Just love this product</li>
    <li> Excellent, arrived in an expeditious manner</li>
    <li> I have had an on going battle with my hair but now that I started using wen I swear nothing else will ever touch my head!</li>
    <li> My hair has stayed in great condition despite use of dryers and straighteners.  I also have a two-process color treatment every 5 weeks and my hair is still healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> makes my fine hair limp and oily. Ok as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed by how well WEN works. My waist length hair is fine, wavy, and easily frizzes. I have an oily scalp and dry ends. It takes a lot to make it look good. My hair usually looks limp and greasy just a day after washing it. WEN has changed all that. I&#x27;ve washed my hair about 4 times with WEN and i have a completely different head of hair. It is so full of volume now. It even feels thicker. It is very smooth, no more frizz, and the shine is unreal. My scalp is not oily anymore. All this in just 2 weeks of use. I&#x27;m so happy I finally decided to try WEN out.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the cucumber aloe and the lavender. I do one wash with the cucumber 1st, then rinse and do a 2nd wash with the lavender and let that sit for about 5 minutes before rinsing out. I split the recommended amount between these 2 washes. You do really have to work this product into your hair to get it clean and make sure to rinse it thoroughly. If your hair feels greasy or dirty, you should use more pumps of the product when washing. I know it sounds wasteful but, believe me, it works.</li>
    <li> I work out daily and am having to wash my hair often.  Wen helps to keep some moisture in&lt;br /&gt;my hair and not dry it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for over three years now. I&#x27;ve always used the Sweet Almond but had heard that the Lavender was best for color treated hair. I really love the smell and how it leaves my hair feeling healthy, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my hair color quite a bit. Gone from dark brown to blonde to brown, and all within the space of weeks sometimes. My stylist confided in me that, even though they don&#x27;t sell Wen, she is going to recommend it to her other clients. Why? Because my hair was able to withstand the constant change with chemical damage. And still be healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one request for anyone is this: FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! If you do not read and follow the directions you are going to be unhappy with this product. Read them, give it one week, and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you chemical treat your hair and/or use heat and styling tools everyday, I highly recommend you try Wen.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, feels great on your hair and smells incredible. I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now and have much fewer split ends and my hair holds curl better now.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> love how soft my hair feel. great product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat WEN hair products !</li>
    <li> WORKS NICELY AND LEAVES HAIR SOFT.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and arrived safely</li>
    <li> Liked the conditioning part. However, the cleaning part unsatisfactory.  I suggested clean with other shampoo and use this as rinse.  I, personally will not purchase again, most likely.</li>
    <li> I love Wen. This is the third time i&#x27;ve purchased it and I can not imagine not having Wen!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now. My hair is very fine so I was hoping it would make me love my hair for the first time ever. I will admit, the first week, I was not happy. My hair felt so oily by the end of the day, but as I have continued to use it, I don&#x27;t have to wash it as much and it is a lot less frizzy, looks healthier and is easier to manage. I am not completely sold of the super powers that it claims to have, but I am willing to give it a try and see if my results keep getting better!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I LOVE the lavender smell. It is so nice and makes my showers so enjoyable. It also isn&#x27;t too strong that I can smell it all day so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. I have an oily scalp and shampoo every day. This is a great conditioning product and helps with my dry ends.  Due to the price, I alternate with another conditioning shampoo. Be warned, this has a strong lavendar scent which I happen to like but not everyone will.</li>
    <li> Wen is the first hair cleaning product I am not allergic to.  My hair stays clean longer and has more body.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wen cleansing-conditioners for over a year now. I have fine wavy hair that is color-treated.  I find that this product is all that it is advertised to be.  It is gentle, keeps my hair hydrated and I only now need to wash my hair twice a week. You do need to rinse throughly to avoid residual product left in your hair, but my hair has never been in such good shape. I also appreciate not having to do a two-step process every time I shampoo (shampoo and condition).  The product is relatively expensive, and you do need to use quite a bit to get the desired results, but I feel that it is worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> Wen is truly a non-drying hair cleanser.  I have tried other sulfate free shampoos but they still lather up and dry out my, already dry, hair.  Wen isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s very much worth your money.  Lavender is my favorite scent.  It smells like lavender, not fake perfume lavender!</li>
    <li> I ordered the lavender, and the first few days I was very pleased, my hair&lt;br /&gt;was so much softer....by the end of the week, it is weighing my hair down,&lt;br /&gt;the hair won&#x27;t hold a curl, after I hot roll my bangs to get them bouncy, they go flat right away, like a min. later. I can&#x27;t have hair like this, and go to work.&lt;br /&gt;it takes a long time to rinse this stuff out, and I rinse it out!&lt;br /&gt;gonna have to return it, no point in keeping it.</li>
    <li> Wen is great ,once you use it a few times you will never go back to traditional shampoos again ,Hair is full of body ,no static, and feels so soft .</li>
    <li> I have used the product for four years now.  Love it. Love it. Love it!!!  What more can I say.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is no longer dry, fly away, Volume like advertised..  shine too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen products per instructions for 5 months. Lavender, Almond Mint, Six-thirteen, Anti-frizz cream, Replenishing mist... I looked great for 3-4 months, just awesome, then suddenly everything was brittle with frizzy breakage. My hair is over-conditioned. Subsequently appears damaged. I have to smack it down now with a waxy or oil product like never before, or go get a Brazilian Blowout so I can put a wide toothed comb through it. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Tried it and my hair looks dull and feel funny. Won&#x27;t buy again.  I have fine but thick hair and it does not like this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. especially for chemically treated hair. I use all the time. I would definitely recommend to a friend at anytime.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works beautifully!  Follow the instructions for the best result.  Some people try to skimp on product but you do need to cleanse and rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Every single time I use this conditioner, I feel like I&#x27;m in a spa.&lt;br /&gt;The lavender aroma sends me to a state of tranquility.  But onto the product itself..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is good stuff.  It detangles hair easily, is great for promoting scalp health (you get the nice tingles when you use it!), comes in a gigantic bottle.. I end up using quite a bit each time as I have long hair, but I still love it.  Just make sure to rinse the conditioner off thoroughly - it takes a little bit more time to rinse it all out as it&#x27;s quite slippery.  My husband uses it, and I notice he gets noticeably less scalp itch when he uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is great for any hair. Leaves my hair very soft and clean. Takes a bit of getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t lather, but well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> If ur hair is fine, this is awesome. Love love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It makes my hair feel soft every time I use it. However I don&#x27;t really care for the lavender product. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It says it is supposed to help you relax, but I need more than a hair care product to relax:) This is good if you don&#x27;t want to go through the manufacturer and pay a monthly or every 3 months price or just to try it, which is what I did. If I want more, however I will probably go through the manufacturer because it would be less expensive.</li>
    <li> I am on my second 32oz bottle of Wen Lavender conditioning shampoo.  It&#x27;s a great product.  They are correct in advertising that it doesn&#x27;t take the color out of your hair.  The reason and only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that if you don&#x27;t rinse, rinse and rinse some more, your hair can feel very heavy.</li>
    <li> This really cleans. My scalp felt cool and tingly. Good size bottle. definite re-buy.</li>
    <li> I have just used this product now for the third time and just love it!  From the very first washing, I could feel that my hair felt more hydrated and smooth.  I live in humid Florida and normally have a bad case of the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; after blowdrying my hair.  Not with this Wen product.  I selected the Lavender and it smells great and has a wonderful tingling feeling.  I especially love that I can order this from Amazon and am not stuck in the automatic shipping scam!!!</li>
    <li> This is a product that does not live up to its price tag.  Beware as well to never contact WEN directly, they will continue to charge you even after to called to cancel.  I had to eventually cancel a credit card to get out.  Whether you like the Amazon process or the product actually &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for you, the WEN company strongly exhibits scam artist principles.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair soft but not dull. Smells fabulous. Only negative feedback I have is the cost of this product. It is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> This made a great gift for my friend who turned me on to Wen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only 2 months and love it.  My hair is more manageable to the point, I can even go a day without shampooing.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing conditioner.  I prefer to buy it like this as opposed to subscription service.  I have dry, colored treated hair, and this is wonderful.  I have been using it for 18 months, and has turned around my hair issues!</li>
    <li> Has same fragrance as original Wen. I love Wen, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance. Should work on more distinct fragrance</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lavender Cleansing Conditioner for about a year and it is the best. I am of mixed race and it really tames my very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love when I use it on my two year old granddaughter. now I&#x27;ve got my 80 year old mom hooked on it as well as my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;we are definatly wen girls</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I use.  I don&#x27;t need to buy cream rinse anymore.  Last longer that what you would think.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I have been using it since 2008.  I recently decided to start ordering it through Amazon instead of getting it sent to me automatically from the company every three months because I feel this arrangement will suit me better.  I have thick, wavy and extremely tangle-prone hair and since discovering this product I simply cannot bear to use anything else on my hair.  Before using Wen I would dread washing my hair because I would spend at least an hour detangling the matted mess after stepping out of the shower.  I tried ALL the detangling products out there and none of them worked even remotely as well as Wen Cleansing Conditioner.  After washing my hair with Wen, I simply run a wide-toothed comb through my hair and my hair is completely tangle-free within seconds.  I participate in a lot of outdoor activities (mountain biking, hiking, horseback riding) in the hot, humid Deep South and this product has no problem cleaning my hair and keeping my scalp healthy. Yes, this product is a little pricey, but well worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner is a wonderful product, the outcome of my hair is perfect each time . My old shampoo is retired for good.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very satisfied customer !!! The price is a bit high but it is worth every Penny !</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with wen! Love this product</li>
    <li> Not totally sold after 1 week but will give it 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this product makes my hair feel fabulous, super clean, and shinny!!!! Didn&#x27;t take to long to receive.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year.  Compared to other products my hair looks and feels like it has moisture.  Styles easier</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It made my hair very fizzy! I would not purchase this product! I was very disappointed in the outcome of the products ability to make my hair look like they promised.</li>
    <li> I had been meaning to try this shampoo for a while after seeing the infomercials on television. As a conditioner, it&#x27;s not too bad. It leaves my hair soft and reduces static. As a shampoo, not liking it so much. It cleans the hair shaft adequately, but it leaves my scalp feeling oily and dirty in less than 24 hours. I&#x27;ll finish using the remainder of the bottle, but I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gives hair life and shine. no soap to dry your hair out . Been using it for more then 5 yrs now. For some it might take a bit to get used to the fact that it does not suds.Yes it does cost more then regular Shampoo but worth it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Wen after watching the infomercial and reading several positive reviews.  I have naturally curly hair that comes down to my mid back.  99% of the time I blow it out straight and then use a straightening iron...I live in the south, so I am always fighting frizz with our humidity levels.  I used Wen religiously for 6 months and followed the directions exactly.  I was always very particular to rinse my hair thoroughly, and when I put a small amount back on after I towel dried, I never went near my roots.  It made my hair oily and heavy, and ultimately had to use it like a regular conditioner after a shampoo to make my hair manageable again.  This product is way too expensive to be used as just a regular conditioner.  Normally my hair is pretty dry, I can go 3-4 days without a wash in the winter and do fine.  With Wen, I was lucky to make it to the next day without having to use a dry shampoo to soak up oil.  While it did make my hair soft, it did nothing for the frizz or to make it more manageable.  I think on TV everyone&#x27;s hair looks great because they have a professional blowing it out for them...wouldn&#x27;t all our hair look better if we had that option, regardless of the products used? I am switching to the macadamia nut products, as the conditioner leaves my hair just as soft and costs half as much.  If you want to give this product a try, I would definitely start out with a single bottle from amazon and avoid the recurring shipments they try to rope you in on the TV infomercials..</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean using this way over priced product. After one month&#x27;s use, I had my hair styled, and my stylist even agreed with me! I have friends who love it, but it&#x27;s not worth it for me. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anybody!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but it is way to expensive.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been better and I only need one product, not shampoo and conditioner. Really fabulous and worth the price</li>
    <li> Been using WEN for 4 years.  I LOVE it!  I will never use anything else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Wen cleansing conditioner and love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  been using this for 3 months and have noticed a difference especially not seeing so much hair in the comb/brush or shower floor!  Will be buying more product.</li>
    <li> it is so expensive, but worth it. My hair feels great</li>
    <li> Great item and timely arrival****</li>
    <li> Let me just preface this post by saying that I have constantly been rotating between many different brands for the past few years in search of the perfect hair shampoo/condition combo.  I have used, Pureology (Nanoworks), Moroccan Oil, Nioxin, Schwarzkopf and MANY other high-end name brand products.  I kept using different products because I wanted a conditioner that left my hair soft, smooth and tangle free yet not weighed down.  I have color treated hair and each product did nothing for my dry ends.  After I would blow-dry, I would still have to straighten and finish with an oil or finishing spray to tame the frizz.  The FIRST time I used WEN, it was like my ah-ha moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a week but have no doubt that my search ends here.  You can just FEEL the hydration even with the first time you use it.  I noticed a huge difference in my hair and my normally dry and brittle ends are much more moisturized and manageable.  As I am writing this, I feel like I am sounding like an infomercial but this feedback is 100% true from a normal consumer.  I love this stuff.  Looking forward to seeing more improvement as I keep using WEN because after the few times I have used it, I am confident that my hair will see it&#x27;s best days from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the technique in which I use half the recommended amount, rinse and then lather and rinse again.  Just before I get out of the shower, I add one more pump and barely rinse it out so it acts as a leave-in-conditioner.  This has worked for me so far.</li>
    <li> Wen is especially great for very dry hair. My hair was fried due to me attempting to color at home. I LOVE this product and feel its worth the price. I think I&#x27;m going to get my mom some for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My mixed race children both LOVE this product. One has very thick wavy hair the other has thin curly hair. The 9 year old with the thick hair tried it at a cousins and kept talking about how soft her hair felt and how tangle free it was at the end of the day. A month later she saw the commercial and begged for it for two straight weeks. Now, being a Black woman, I have spent a lot of time trying to find just the right products for my girls. Search is over. This is it. I recommend this HIGHLY</li>
    <li> I love my wen, it works great on your hair and makes you wonder why you ever used shampoo in the 1st place</li>
    <li> I received 2 samples from a friend in Lavender and Pomegranate and I tried the Lavender this morning and I really like it a lot!  It made my hair feel so soft, full and manageable.  The only thing was my hair was a bit frizzy.  I want to try the Styling Creme as it says it helps that.  I want to switch to WEN and not go back to shampoo.  What a difference!  I also want to add that I looked at the 32 ounce price on here for the Lavender and it is $67.50!, and on QVC ( where Chaz Dean sells it) it is $49.50. Why does this site sell it for more?  That is terribly more then I am willing to pay. If I find a 32 ounce that sells for about $39 to no more then 49, I will consider buying it.  I have more pro&#x27;s about it and this is the only con I have. It does work very well.  I have friends who use it and will never go back to shampoo!  After using it myself for the first time several weeks ago, I loved it and would like to continue using it at a good price.</li>
    <li> Wen does make your hair feel softer and gives it renewed body and shine. Smells great too. Users may find that it doesn&#x27;t lather like a typical shampoo or 2 in 1 product. My hair is very fine and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; conditioners.</li>
    <li> was very skeptical about buying wen. its pretty pricy but i did end up loving it and i love the smell my hair is so much softer and it grows ridiculously fast i dont need my hair straightener and all the other name brand products ive spend hundreds of dollars on to keep it tamed wen actually does exactly what it says its going to do!</li>
    <li> Tried the knock offs and they don&#x27;t come close. This smells great, leaves my hair super soft and clean, no tangles and super shiny. Only con is the price. Love how Amazon lets me use my cashback from Discover at check-out to ease the pain. This 32oz bottle lasts a long time as I only need to use it a few times a week to maintain. Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for years. I tried to save money by switching back to shampoo and conditioner and hated it so I went back to Wen. It is worth it. Smells great and truly a one-step shampoo/conditioner/detangler unlike other products that advertise to do the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over middle age and often &amp;#34;wash away&amp;#34; the grey so I had frizzy old lady hair. Now that I use Wen, I really can&#x27;t believe the difference this product has done for my hair. I often received complements for my long hair when I was young but that stopped 10 years ago when the frizzy old lady fly away hair started but when I started using Wen within a week friends and strangers started complementing my hair.</li>
    <li> It took some months of being consistent to see Wen change my hair. It became more manageable and softer. You really do have to go some months to see results, but its worth it and is now all I use on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of the Wen ads on TV and finally checked out the reviews, which seemed good.  I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve only used the Wen now for about a month.  I like it a lot.  I don&#x27;t shampoo, just use the Wen about every other day.  My hair seems to have a nicer feel now.  I&#x27;m 57 so my hair is not oily like when I was younger.  I&#x27;m not sure if Wen alone would have worked for me 40 years ago.  However,  now it seems take the hair spray out of my hair and leaves it feeling natural and clean.  In summary - so far, so good.  I like the product and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it instead of my usual shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years and love the product, just wish it was more affordable for all the products.Some is very reasonable and i don&#x27;t mind the cost, however some seem a little high for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> So rich and creamy.  You can&#x27;t get a better product for your hair.  Smells heavenly and I love this product!!  $ well spent.</li>
    <li> Love the product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I think this is actually better for my hair than normal (even high-end) shampoo and conditioner. However, there are a few things I don&#x27;t like about it: 1. I&#x27;ve ordered two large bottles, and both times the pump stopped working with several inches of product left in the bottle. Still usable, you just have to screw off the top, and estimate how much product to use. It&#x27;s annoying. 2. It does take longer than normal to shampoo/condition your hair, because it takes a long time to completely rinse the product out. 3. You&#x27;re supposed to leave the product in your hair for the duration of your shower, which means you&#x27;re rinsing it down your head and body after you&#x27;ve washed yourself. I always feel like I want to at least rewash my face after rinsing my hair because of this. It&#x27;s pretty heavy-duty creamy stuff.</li>
    <li> I love using the Wen products on my hair.  I wish this product was around 50 years ago when my hair felt so brittle.  Today my hair is shiny, soft, and manageable, thanks to Wen.</li>
    <li> love the WEN products!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have long, fine hair, therefore have tried lots of natural products to avoid formulas w alcohol, lots of chemistry, etc... Was skeptical about a salon product, but it&#x27;s the best! Usually need decent shampoo/conditioner combo, but unbelievably, this really IS a 2-in-1.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, despite how silky smooth, yummy smelling, and shiny my hair gets with this product.  I lost gobs and gobs of hair, so I looked it up and did some research, only to find that this is a problem and there was acutally a law suit because of it! Good luck to those who want to try it though, as this isnt always the case.  Once I stopped, my hair stopped falling out, so I started again, and same story, gobs of hair fell out.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a sisters recommendation! Her hair is OUTSTANDING, but it didn&#x27;t do much for mine. I guess you&#x27;ll have to try it to see for yourself. I gave mine to her.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe i waited this long to try this. I have fine hair and this makes my hair look shinny and healthy. My color no longer fades. I love it</li>
    <li> If you want perfect hair...if you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s falling out...if you have thin hair, this is the product for you.  I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s great! It keeps the color safe  and keeps the  hair nicely conditioned. I would highly recommend this  great product.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wanted to LOVE this shampoo...the ratings seemed to be too good to be true so I had to try it. The claims just aren&#x27;t true. My hair has the same texture, feel, look, etc. And my color lasts not one day longer than it did using regular shampoo and conditioner. The one step process is nice, but for the price and with all its claims, this product is just way overpriced and somewhat disappointing.</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR PRODUCT ON THE MARKET</li>
    <li> Love my wen. This is best for cleaning. Little build up. My other products are gone. Shiny healthy hair. Yes, wen products...rinse....rinse.....rinse ......but experience natural shine, and silky feel. This is my favorite for average but thick hair. I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEN IT IS AWESOME FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine hair. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Use as deep cleanser, didn&#x27;t like for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Smells like Vicks vapor rub</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen products for years &amp; the lavender scent is one of my all-time favorites. The 32 oz size is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> love Wen - it lasts forever and I dont need conditioner when I use</li>
    <li> I love wen lavender cleansing conditioner leave my hair very soft and shine, I highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love the cranberry mint  , so I bought a 32oz. Bottle of this lavender being that I also like lavender and boy did I make a mistake :( Not all wen products are created equal.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to thick hair that is wavy and this lavender wash makes my hair look fine :(&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m loosing hair in the shower and that&#x27;s not normal for me.</li>
    <li> Loves the way it makes my hair look and feel.  But it takes some getting use to because it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoos, but it gives your hair nice body and shine.  And very soft to the touch,.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen conditioner.  It has made a big difference in how my hair looks and feels.  I color, blow dry and curl my hair.  After using Wen, my hair is stronger and healther.  I have been able to wear my hair in longer styles than in the past.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen cleansing conditioner about a year and a half ago. I have been coloring my hair myself for 30+ years and get a perm about every 3 months. My hair is almost collar-length and I use 6-8 pumps about every other day. Prior to using Wen, my hair was falling out and I was getting dry scaly patches on my scalp that just would not go away. After less than one month using the product my scalp was healed and I only see small amounts of hair coming out. I am 63 so a little hair loss can be expected :) I used the Sweet Almond Mint at first and loved it. Ordered the Fig once which happened to be a little cheaper and did not like the smell at all. I&#x27;m on my first bottle of the Lavender and I LOVE IT. The scent is beautiful and there has been no change in the texture of my hair as some reviewers have mentioned. I will use either the Lavender or the Sweet Almond Mint forever. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Works so well on my long, thick, wavy hair! The fig is supposed to be best for that and it does work well, but this one has proven better in my case. Makes my hair so shiny and I can run my fingers right through it. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t put two and two together until I saw the lawsuit for hair loss. My hair is falling out in clumps, I thought it was stress but it seems women using this product are having similar issues. I&#x27;m no longer eligible for a return but I will gladly throw it in the trash.</li>
