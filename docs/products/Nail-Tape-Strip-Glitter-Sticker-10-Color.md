      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Very nice product,low cost</li>
      <li>Very happy with the tapes themselves, not 100% pleased with the color selection.</li>
      <li>You get a lot more than you&#x27;d expect and these are perfect for taping to create boundaries and paint designs or can be used as decorative tape once sealed in with top coat.</li>
      <li>None of them were damaged and the colors are amazing.</li>
      <li>The tape is very functional and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>but when i do the design comes out nice.</li>
      <li>Great for anyone who wants to start playing with nail tape, fun with a great price!</li>
      <li>I wish they were just a bit thicker, but I love to use them on my nails</li>
      <li>Within an hour it was coming off even with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I did receive two purple tapes in the pack but that is ok.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Definitely glad that I bought them.</li>
      <li>Very good for the price, they came in full sized rolls and they stick decently.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item not to long ago and was happy to find that they arrived on time in a nice package.</li>
      <li>This are cheap and nothing like how the look they are to this and rip easily after they rip it take like 15 minutes trying to find the tip of the tape</li>
      <li>But nevertheless, I enjoy using them.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap this was when I saw it; I figured it was a sampler.</li>
      <li>They do tend to peel quickly, but for a night out, I think they are fine...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, full size tape spools!</li>
      <li>Other than that, its a great product</li>
      <li>Fun colors.</li>
      <li>or else they&#x27;ll peel right off your nail.</li>
      <li>The white tape breaks very easy, must be the way it&#x27;s made.</li>
      <li>arrived quicker than expected &amp; i love them!</li>
      <li>I just love all of the different colors that came in the pack.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use them, so I have more than enough tape to practice.</li>
      <li>the colors are pretty</li>
      <li>Is ok but doesn&#x27;t stay sticky for long</li>
      <li>Just have to make sure polish is all the way dry before applying to avoid messing up the design!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really use them much</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and lasts a long time before peeling off.  </li>
      <li>This not only shipped super fast</li>
      <li>Other than that I was very pleased with the overall product.</li>
      <li>I bought these a few weeks ago and they arrived earlier than expected which is great!</li>
      <li>Had to be careful when putting the clear polish on top of tape the color would dissolve.</li>
      <li>and I would definitely buy them again as long as I would get as many as I was told I would get</li>
      <li>I figured that would be pretty basic.</li>
      <li>The tape isn&#x27;t as sticky as I thought it would be but would probably stick if you put a clear coat on top, also you have to cut it with scissors, which is very hard to cut it in the exact length of my nail.</li>
      <li>Came a day early.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice to have a comparison picture to show how thin the tape actually is.</li>
      <li>and I have used the white and blue so far.</li>
      <li>The colors were good and were all in separate packages, the only complaint I have is that the tape sometimes falls off the wheel, and it can be hard to find the end of the tape.</li>
      <li>Not a long lasting strip</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest cutting the strips before putting them on your nails and using a clear top coat after it is on.</li>

<li> There was plenty of colors and it actually came before the expected date.</li>
<li> The green was a frayed somehow and when I tried to take some off from the tabbed area entire chunks of it came off , in addition the red one was dented in spots and falling off the roll.</li>
<li> I got the following colors: silver, green, white, pink, black, red, dark blue, purplish pink, platinum, and gold.</li>

<li> Just have to be very careful to seal the ends</li>
<li> Took forever to get here, sometimes they don&#x27;t stick, and they didn&#x27;t even send me a roll of black tape...</li>
<li> Allows polish to slide in underneath it creating a look that is not clean or neat.</li>
<li> (I expected at least a month shipping going from China to US), but it was not a sampler.</li>
<li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t anticipate was how thin the tape is.</li>
<li> recommend sealing them to make them past longer.</li>
<li> Not a very good product.</li>
<li> the strips are really hard to get off of the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Thin tape....</li>
<li> too thin</li>
<li> False advertisement .</li>
<li> I thought the strips would be wider but they turned out to be very thin and hard to work with.</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
