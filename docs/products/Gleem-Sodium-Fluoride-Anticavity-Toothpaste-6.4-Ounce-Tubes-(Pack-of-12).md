      <li>It is sometimes hard to find in the stores, so I am delighted to have found it on Amazon!    </li>
      <li>A little too minty for me had kind of Certs or Strong Altoid flavor to it.</li>
      <li>When I discovered Amazon was carrying it, I was delighted and have resumed using the toothpaste that gives you a \\&quot;gleeming\\&quot; natural white smile.</li>
      <li>Great to finally find the product but buyer beware the expiration dates for the 12 boxes is way too short to order in this quanity.</li>
      <li>I received my Gleem quickly and at a reasonable price.  </li>

      <li>I ordered a dozen, and that should last me better than a year.</li>
      <li>The product arrived as promised and was exactly as desired.  </li>
      <li>Should be good now for a few years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultra Brite (always my favorite for the price; cleans teeth, freshens breath for many hours)&lt;br /&gt;Pepsodent (easy on the gum and gives you a fresh breath for few hours)&lt;br /&gt;Close Up (strong minty/cinnamon flavor afterwards but at least it cleans well)&lt;br</li>
      <li>My smile was so bright that people I passed on the sidewalk were forced to look away.</li>
      <li>You can really see a difference with just the first brushing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Gleem Toothpaste for 50+ years.  When I was a kid, Crest had just been introduced on the market.  My Mom bought it, of course, to try it out.  Went back to Gleem after a short time.  I have tried many others over my lifetime and none of them clean my teeth and make my mouth feel as fresh as Gleem.  It is getting harder to find, and I am hoping the company may pay attention to some of these written reviews.  What&#x27;s the old saying?  If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it?  Never mind all the newer fancy products that are way overpriced as well.  I love this product and will continue to use it as long as it is available!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It is the best tooth paste I have used my whole life. Can not find it in the stores anymore. Glad I could get it here and elsewhere on the internet.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Gleem. my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I have brused them with Gleem. It is the Best tooth paste in the world ... I can only find it on Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Please Always sell it !!!</li>
    <li> Great paste as usual!!!  Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gleem nearly all my life.  It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty feeling in your mouth, or have too much \\&quot;fresh flavor.\\&quot;      I was disappointed when Procter &amp; Gamble took this product out of general distribution in favor of its other brand of toothpaste.  I called once or twice to learn what product they suggested as an alternative.  Once I found Gleem on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t care what to alternative was, I could get the original!!    My mouth feels fresh, clean and neutral (i.e. no minty freshness).  Add to these superlatives a smile that Gleems.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I love the product but can&#x27;t find it on your site anymore</li>
    <li> Gleen toothpaste is very hard to find until I found amazon. Now I have no problem.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves Gleem and even though we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, I am able to find it on Amazon. Thank you Amazon and Gleem!</li>
    <li> I have used Gleem tothpaste for 30 years.  I have NEVER had a cavity.  I can no longer find Gleem in my local stores, but I am thrilled to find it at Amazon.  In the past I had to try other kinds of toothpaste when I coulnd&#x27;t find Gleem.  There IS NOT another toothpaste on the market that cleans, whitens and freshens your breath like Gleem.  I saw on MSN news that P&amp;G is thinking of discontinuing Gleem.......I don&#x27;t know what I will do.....</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old and have used Gleem toothpaste since High School.  I have yet to get a filling or cavity in my teeth.  My wife used another top brand (Crest) and regularly had cavities.  When she switched to Gleem, her dental visits stopped except for routine cleaning. I truely hope they continue manufacturing Gleem Toothpaste forever and not change anything about it.</li>
    <li> Gleem, How is it that I never tried this product. Its clean tasting and its easy to rinse out of your mouth. It works better and is less expensive than the other brands. To bad its so hard to find. Proctor and Gamble in all there wisdom says they dont know who sells it try the dollar store. Its not in an of our local dollar stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product with a long history. My mother has been using it for 40 plus years. I wish it were sold in stores. Glad it&#x27;s available still, even on the internet. Keep it reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> wife could not find this product anymore locally (Houston tx)  seems the walmarts and others only carry other brands or the scrubb a dub version.. This version does not scratch things like teeth lol</li>
    <li> The item was hard to find but the service was great and the product was as advertised, will do business again in the future.</li>
    <li> My sister loves Gleem toothpaste and has not been able to find it for months.  She contacted the manufacturer and they have discontinued making it.  I will probably purchase another 12 pack for her very soon in the future.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste--fair price---what else can I say</li>
    <li> The taste is great, and my girlfriend loves it too.</li>
    <li> Product was fine but the package had been damaged and more tape applied and it was 2 tubes short</li>
    <li> Have used this product for at least 45 years. When I could no longer buy it in my state was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste around. Like many others I too have used Gleem all my life. It is near impossible to find it anymore. Gleem has such a fresh taste like no other brand. I can&#x27;t stand the strong mint flavors of most toothpastes today. This my 2nd order of the 12 pack and I will continue to order from Amazon as long as they carry Gleem.</li>
    <li> I should have known GLEEM would be my undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I only brushed once a day, but pretty soon I was hooked. I felt like it made my smile brighter and whiter. People responded to me. Ladies smiled back. Pretty soon I was up to 5x a day. After every meal and before and after sleeping. My smile got whiter and whiter and whiter. My smile was so bright that people I passed on the sidewalk were forced to look away. It was like a lighthouse beam firing out of my mouth. After a few weeks the wheels came off at work. As an assassin, I was praised for my stealth. It became impossible to sneak up on a head of state as they slept without emitting a dazzling beam of light, which would betray my position. But I kept using. Eventually my savings dried up and my wife left. I was reduced to living in an alley and cleaning myself in public bathrooms. When my GLEEM runs out I usually have to do some things I&#x27;m not proud of to get more. Just spending everyday afraid the GLEEM will run out and scheming to get more. You wouldn&#x27;t really call this living.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the news from Procter and Gamble.  Gleem was discontinued in 2014.  But the good news is that the Gleem formulation will be rebranded as Crest Fresh and White starting in March, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gleem toothpaste several times each day for the past 50 years.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> I was so upset when Gleem Toothpaste seemed to disappear overnight from department stores and then I couldn&#x27;t even find it at Dollar Stores. Well, here&#x27;s comes Amazon.com to the rescue. When I discovered Amazon was carrying it, I was delighted and have resumed using the toothpaste that gives you a \\&quot;gleeming\\&quot; natural white smile.</li>
    <li> Been using Gleem Tooth Paste for 55 yrs...I&#x27;m always getting Compliments on my smile and Teeth...Gleem is getting very difficult to find and I&#x27;ve tried all the others, but NONE makes my teeth and mouth feel as fresh as Gleem... By far the best product on the market...By the way, Im 61 yrs. old with All My Teeth, which I contribute to Gleem !!!  ~NO OTHER TOOTHPASTE WILL DO~Thank You Amazon for attending to my needs... I will be a Repeat Happy Customer...Much Thanks, Pat Newman...Amazon is the PLACE !!!</li>
    <li> Great to finally find the product but buyer beware the expiration dates for the 12 boxes is way too short to order in this quanity.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be writing a review about toothpaste. I have used Gleem Toothpaste since I was very young and about 4-5 years ago the Grocery Store and Drug Stores around quit selling it..so I took a chance and found I was able to order it by the case...enough to share with my grown kids as well! If Gleem reads this, please bring the product back to Champaign, Illinois!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for some years now.  I love buying a case at the time.  Don&#x27;t even have to think when at the store \\&quot;do I need toothpaste.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It is the only toothpaste I can put in my mouth without it tasting bad. Personal choice I guess.It is the only one I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> My husband and children teased me when the large package of a dozen tubes arrived, but soon changed their tune.  The kids are actually happier to brush with Gleem than with the cartoon character pastes.  Sounds strange, but we really like this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> after hearing about this toothpaste i decided to get a tube to try it out, since i wasn&#x27;t sure if i would love or hate it i didn&#x27;t get the 24 pack from amazon, and found out from Wikipedia that dollar tree carries them, I am switching from Toms to Gleem now</li>
    <li> This is byfar the worst toothpaste I have ever used. It used to be Equate from WalMart but now it&#x27;s Gleem 1) It doesn&#x27;t freshens my breath like other toothpaste. Yes, I have brushed my tongue and all parts of the teeth/gum. The problem with this toothpaste is that after a couple hours, my breath still stinks (no joke). For under $1.50 retail, this is my current ranking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra Brite (always my favorite for the price; cleans teeth, freshens breath for many hours)&lt;br /&gt;Pepsodent (easy on the gum and gives you a fresh breath for few hours)&lt;br /&gt;Close Up (strong minty/cinnamon flavor afterwards but at least it cleans well)&lt;br /&gt;Aim (Slightly better than Gleem. I would still avoid it and pay 20 cents more for the above brands)&lt;br /&gt;Gleem (no positive comments here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also true that it&#x27;s not ADA certified. (no logo) I&#x27;m very skeptical that it even contains real fluoride. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s made Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect purchase of wonderful Gleem Toothpaste which is not readily available a at local pharmacies.  The product arrived as promised and was exactly as desired.  Out smiles are whiter and brighter now.</li>
    <li> We have always used Gleem and love it and are thrilled we can order it from Amazon - cannot find in the drugstores.</li>
    <li> Got quickly very good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A long time favorite that is difficult to find any place else.</li>
    <li> Order came as expected</li>
    <li> This was my favorite brand toothpaste when I came to this country in 1981. It used to have small bluish particles in it. I don&#x27;t know why was it changed to a plain white paste. Regardless, I still like the taste! And surprisingly it isn&#x27;t available at markets like before, I can only find it online. I&#x27;ve bought a whole bunch to last me for long.</li>
    <li> Great price on a good sized tube of this hard-to-find old favorite.</li>
    <li> A little too minty for me had kind of Certs or Strong Altoid flavor to it. I didn&#x27;t like the weird aftertaste this product had and my breath started smelling kind of funky after about a hour. I used this for about 3 days and did not like the results I quickly went back to my old toothpaste and everything seemed fine again.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find in the stores any longer so was pleased to find it online so I don&#x27;t have to search for this older product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS TOOTHPASTE EVERY SINCE I WAS A KID, 60 YEARS AGO. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND IN STORES.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried that leaves my mouth feeling clean. For me, the others are too sweet tasting.</li>
    <li> Never use anything but Gleem since I was a small child and I have never had a cavity.</li>
    <li> I buy a case of this for my husband about every 3-4 years.  It&#x27;s the only toothpaste he will ever use.  And he has NEVER had a cavity.  (and he is 52 years old)</li>
    <li> THIS BRAND IS DONE IN AMERICA</li>
    <li> Always liked the flavor of Gleem better than any other brand.  Never understood why it was not marketed any more. And I don&#x27;t understand how Amazon gets it.  But I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the hitch in the deliver was fixed quickly and professionally.Don&#x27;t know why P&amp;G quit making it. Great taste.</li>
    <li> used this brand for years. don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when it&#x27;s used up</li>
    <li> I have used Gleem for decades. I&#x27;ve tried various other toothpastes for different reasons, but always come back to Gleem.  It is sometimes hard to find in the stores, so I am delighted to have found it on Amazon!    Gleem does not irritate my tongue or gums like some other toothpastes do.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite toothpaste and unfortunately is now not sold in any of the stores here.  I was grateful to find it on the internet but had to get a dozen which was way more than I needed but gave some to friends to try.  They all love the GLEEM and I can highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to have received this product. I am also saddened that this same product has been discontinued. Thank you for having it available. I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste since the 70&amp;#34;s. My life/teeth won&#x27;t be the same without it. I hope you&#x27;ll be able to find more just so I can order more. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> excellent product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised to be reviewing a toothpaste. However, this stuff is great. It leaves a wonderful clean feeling and your teeth feel like when you come from the dentist. It has a great mint taste and helps to whiten. You can really see a difference with just the first brushing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Thanks.  We love Gleem and can&#x27;t find it anywhere local.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like using Gleem toothpaste, but it&#x27;s hard to find in store in my area.  I&#x27;m glad that there are on-line sellers who carry it.  Everything was fine with this order -- the toothpaste was shipped promptly and arrived well-packed.  No problems.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste out there and provides whitening.  Other whitening brands make my teeth sensitive but not this one!  Funny to buy such a large quantity but it got too hard to find locally.  I just tucked it away and know that it will be here without having to have to try to hunt some down in town.</li>
    <li> I used this when I was a kid. I was glad to see it was still available to purchase.</li>
    <li> Unable to purchase at local stores.  Had this toothpaste when I was a Child 72 years ago. Was able to give to my younger brother.</li>
    <li> Great product. All family loves the taste.Good price. On time shipment.</li>
    <li> When I switch to so called whitening toothpastes, my teeth get yellow.  This is the best toothpaste out there and the only one I want to use.  I hate that you can&#x27;t get it in stores any more.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> If you really like this toothpaste, this is one of the only ways to get it nowadays.  I ordered a dozen, and that should last me better than a year.</li>
    <li> GLEEM has always been a favorite but recently hard to find in a retail setting. I was pleased to find it here and now have enough on hand for awhile.</li>
    <li> Great product.Been using it for many years. To bad they decided to not produce this anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a hard item to find, but it is one of the few toothpastes I can use.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found a source.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of tooth paste in my time ( 59yrs ) and I buy this stuff by the case because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores. My mouth feels fresh and clean when I am done brushing. Most others leave my mouth feeling like it has been swabbed out with cotton and I am spitless. I hope that is not TMI.</li>
    <li> I received my Gleem quickly and at a reasonable price.  Gleem is no longer available at any stores near me.  At 66 years of age, I have never had a cavity, and this is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever!  It&#x27;s a shame more people are not familiar with it!  I have used it since I was a teenager and have had only one new cavity in 40 years.  I like the hint of clove, so to me it also tastes the best of any toothpaste I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Stores don;t carry it anymore so I&#x27;m glad it is available in bulk. Should be good now for a few years.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Been using it for years!  No cavities!  Now they have discontinued it, so found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for a really long time. I am 67 years old and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
