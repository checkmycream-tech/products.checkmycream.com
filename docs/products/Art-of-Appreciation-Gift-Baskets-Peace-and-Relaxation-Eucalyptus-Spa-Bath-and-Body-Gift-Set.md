### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.  </li>
      <li>Perfect gift for someone to relax with.</li>
      <li>my wife has been very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent gift basket for my wifes birthday</li>
      <li>She was very happy when she received it and loved the slippers!  </li>
      <li>Packaged and shipped great</li>
      <li>Great gift for a mother to be; she was thrilled!</li>
      <li>this was a birthday gift for my guy and he loved it and has been using it till it was all gone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so-so but the bathing soaps, slippers, and scrubbers are good quality.</li>
      <li>Maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to buy a gift set online.</li>
      <li>The mother loved it</li>
      <li>Girlfriend loved this ...</li>
      <li>She loved it, the scent was really nice and the basket comes stuffed with items.  </li>
      <li>However, the item I received is not as nice as what I thought I ordered.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it was filled with wonderful goodies for all to enjoy.</li>
      <li>It is wrapped with bows, nice presentation.  </li>
      <li>Nice variety of products and packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s a real eucalyptus fan and was happy not to get &amp;#34;lavender!&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I will not be able to use it for my event.  </li>
      <li>and they enjoyed it all.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to let everyone know that this basket was really cute.</li>
      <li>Great assortment of treats and the basket is very festive and adorable.</li>
      <li>item was shipped with many others in a card board box.</li>
      <li>But that wasn&#x27;t as important to me as the contents.</li>
      <li>Nice gift for a person needing some relaxing help when a professional is not there in person for someone special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t send it directly to someone as a gift</li>
      <li>It came right on time with the delevery date</li>
      <li>I really liked the combination of items in the basket,  but when it arrived, I was embarrassed to give this as a gift,  To begin, the quality of the products was watered down cheap stuff.  </li>
      <li>Arrived earlier than expected and was lovely, my MIL was very pleased with the contents.  </li>
      <li>When I saw the gift basket it looked very cheap and the products were not up to my standard of quality.</li>
      <li>love shopping on Amazon; however, I will not purchase items from Art of Appreciation in the future.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and product was exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>when really you are getting maybe four of those items.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is, in the written description on Amazon, it clearly says these are delivered in a tin - one is in a basket and neither of the spa gifts are worth $50.00.</li>
      <li>Neither of the items are presented as nicely as the picture on Amazon and both look like they are missing an item.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money thinking you are getting a nice spa bath set....</li>
      <li>Parents really liked it and loved the different items they&#x27;ve never tried before, but it wasn&#x27;t too weird</li>
      <li>A little small but nice!!</li>
      <li>Very cheap and small for what you pay for.</li>
      <li>One could go to the dollar store, get the same items yourself and built the exact basket for under $10.  </li>
      <li>Her basket was complete as listed.</li>
      <li>Legal disclaimer&#x3D;might be different from what you see.  </li>
      <li>but i found it small and cheap for the price.</li>
      <li>The lotions were very watered down.</li>
      <li>not a very adult or classy present.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The gift set looks bigger in the picture than it actually is. But that wasn&#x27;t as important to me as the contents. When I received the set, the entire set was wrapped in plastic as it should have been but in my case the plastic had been torn and some items were missing. I don&#x27;t know if it was accidentally or intentionally torn during packaging but it was torn and some items that were listed in the description were missing. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to buy a gift set online. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t send it directly to someone as a gift, I would&#x27;ve been more disappointed.</li>
    <li> Slippers were lime green. not a very adult or classy present. the picture shows white slippers.</li>
    <li> A little small but nice!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these. One came in the tin as I expected, the other came in a basket. If I wanted a gift in a basket, I would have ordered something else. Neither of the items are presented as nicely as the picture on Amazon and both look like they are missing an item. There are 3 bottles in the picture, only 2 bottles are in the basket / tin  I received. Neither have pumps on the lotion and shower gel, like the picture. There is no combined brush/pumase in the tin. Bottom line is, in the written description on Amazon, it clearly says these are delivered in a tin - one is in a basket and neither of the spa gifts are worth $50.00.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift basket for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. However, the item I received is not as nice as what I thought I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price vs. the quality is lacking - It is much smaller than made to appear in the picture. The quality and size/proportion of the items received does not meet what is shown (to be of quality). Also it came with blue slippers and didn&#x27;t include two of the other items shown. I took a picture to compare and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased something from Art of Appreciation on Amazon and it was not the same quality that I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love shopping on Amazon; however, I will not purchase items from Art of Appreciation in the future.</li>
    <li> The mother loved it but i found it small and cheap for the price. (Mothers day gift).</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved this ... she&#x27;s a real eucalyptus fan and was happy not to get &amp;#34;lavender!&amp;#34;  heehee  Nice variety of products and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fast shipping and product was exactly as shown.</li>
    <li> This was not worth $50.  I sent this as a gift and it barely had half of the stuff in the picture shown below.  Don&#x27;t waste your money thinking you are getting a nice spa bath set....when really you are getting maybe four of those items.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift sent out of town. It is well wrapped in plastic.  The slippers in the back look comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This item was shipped with many others in a card board box. Packaged and shipped great</li>
    <li> She was very happy when she received it and loved the slippers!  The only issue is that my name was not present on the package.</li>
    <li> I really liked the combination of items in the basket,  but when it arrived, I was embarrassed to give this as a gift,  To begin, the quality of the products was watered down cheap stuff.  One could go to the dollar store, get the same items yourself and built the exact basket for under $10.  I paid $50.  Even the \\&quot;large\\&quot; chocolate cookies package had only 2 cookies in it.  I feel like I was ripped off and felt foolish giving such a poor quality gift.  I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hear anything bad with this gift. Parents really liked it and loved the different items they&#x27;ve never tried before, but it wasn&#x27;t too weird and they enjoyed it all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She loved it, the scent was really nice and the basket comes stuffed with items.  Perfect gift for someone to relax with.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift basket for my mothers birthday and was not happy with this purchase. When I saw the gift basket it looked very cheap and the products were not up to my standard of quality. The lotions were very watered down.</li>
    <li> Not only were the items in the picture NOT what I receieved but there were things missing from it. Not happy for $50 purchase.</li>
    <li> this was a birthday gift for my guy and he loved it and has been using it till it was all gone.&lt;br /&gt;the candy and tea are so-so but the bathing soaps, slippers, and scrubbers are good quality.</li>
    <li> Nice gift for a person needing some relaxing help when a professional is not there in person for someone special.</li>
    <li> Excellent gift basket for my wifes birthday</li>
    <li> Great gift for a mother to be; she was thrilled!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let everyone know that this basket was really cute. It came right on time with the delevery date and it was filled with wonderful goodies for all to enjoy. Great assortment of treats and the basket is very festive and adorable.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see how my wife likes the items, which appear all there.  It is wrapped with bows, nice presentation.  But base is a white wicker basket, not the metal bin.  Legal disclaimer&#x3D;might be different from what you see.  This is the case for me. May not make a difference for you.</li>
    <li> product received on time and as shown in picture.  my wife has been very happy with it.  lots of stuff in one bucket!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was lovely, my MIL was very pleased with the contents.  Her basket was complete as listed.</li>
    <li> This item was extremely disappointing.  I will not be able to use it for my event.  The slippers and brush were a baby blue and not white as shown in the picture.  The item was much smaller and  items were missing from the basket.  I have wasted my money. This gift is totally misrepresented online.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this product. What you get is not what the picture represents. Very cheap and small for what you pay for.</li>
