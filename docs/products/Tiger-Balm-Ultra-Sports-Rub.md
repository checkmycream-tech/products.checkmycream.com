<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I myself personally have tried other products that cost more money and claim they have more ingredients in them but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. STRONG SMELL, but awesome results.</li>
    <li> Gives relief for shoulder and knee pain.  Have had intense shoulder pain and this seems to do the trick for some quick relief.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without this stuff. However, I don&#x27;t recommend starting out with the ultra strength unless you have a high threshold for the freezing hot burning sensation it provides.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a sore Neck/shoulers for several days. Best I can figure, I strained a muscle at work and it just keeps getting worse because I can&#x27;t properly rest it. Icyhot and Tylenol did absolutely nothing for the pain, so a friend of mine recommended Tigerbalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING!! Barely 5 minutes after rubbing this into my sholders/neck, all the pain faded and I regained full motion of my head and neck. The burn from the menthol is definitely stronger than Icyhot, but it&#x27;s worth it considering the overall results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for aches and pains in my muscles.</li>
    <li> Incredibly strong and incredibly potent. As a powerlifter, I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> Your photo shows the &amp;#34;non-staining&amp;#34; tiger balm, but I received regular.  I ordered this one because the pic specifically showed it was &amp;#34;non-staining.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This has a very strong smell that some may not like or some will like me,. its menthol thats for sure. Regardless of smell it works really great on stiff joints or neck and only a very small amount is required and once applied it works for a couple hours. Perfect for before going to bed not so much for putting on and going out with.</li>
    <li> What most of the 5 Star reviews say is true. I am soldier in the and injured my back exercising. When my medic first gave this to me I was very very skeptical, because of the fact that 1. I am against the idea of using pills of any kind and like to look for natural remedies and 2. It&#x27;s a cream. How is this &amp;#34;Stuff&amp;#34; supposed to fix my back injury? Well I applied the balm not knowing what I was getting myself into. Let me tell everyone that reads this review. IT IS AN INTENESE EXPIERENCE!!! Also on that note I applied considerable amount thinking that it was not going to be that potent. The burning and cooling sensation last for a couple hours as most people say people say. I applied the balm around 8 and wore off around 1030. It&#x27;s so potent that personally it made my stomach hurt. Like a throw up sick hurt, but don&#x27;t let my personal experience scare you. This stuff is killer. The way you could utilize this balm for so many of your sports related injuries is so beneficial. It&#x27;s like the PA&#x27;s say &amp;#34;Soldiers are like underpaid professional athletes.&amp;#34; Most of the injuries we suffer from are sport related. So I hope everyone can understand why I am emphasizing the awesomeness of this product.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis throughout my body.  I have been using different rubs for years.  I would much rather do this than wallow in pain which will always be there.  For me this is better than popping a pill.</li>
    <li> My husband first started using tiger balm as he plays disc golf. Used it for his muscle pains. Then he had me try it. I have arthritus everywhere. I was amazed how it works. My Mom hurt her baby toe and it has been hurting for some time and when she visited us we told her about tiger balm and she decided to try it on her toe. I really didn&#x27;t think it would help with that but she no longer has pain in her baby toe. This is a great product. i would swear by. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I order the Tiger Balm and it was shipped either the same day or the next day and arrived very quickly. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> I find this even more effective than the Icy Hot that I have used for years. Would highly recommend. I like the way it smells although others might feel differently. It was a reassurance that no tiger parts were used to make the product.....</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I&#x27;ve used it for various sore muscles or pinched nerves,etc. really does a great job for pain management.  I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s actually rather pleasant, almost &amp;#34;clove-like&amp;#34;, but the smell gets all over your clothes, so I have to take off one star.</li>
    <li> I had already used this product before but could not find it in a large container. This is an awesome product. I recommend it to anyone needing some pain relief.</li>
    <li> cant live without im addicted lol, feels great on lower back</li>
    <li> Its amazing the best I&#x27;ve tried everything it works and I have serious back and knee problems....</li>
    <li> This smells so bad that I threw it in the trash. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Has done more for my sore knees than pills.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I thought that it would not help my sore back, but it completely took the pain away. I love this stuff and highly recommend it. At first it was freezing on my skin but then it felt great and my back stopped hurting. I was amazed.</li>
    <li> My grand father passed away last year.He used to use it on his shoulder.I miss him so much...... Now I am getting old and I need this tiger balm for myself.This works wonderfully.......makes me feel good thinking about him and makes my shoulder feel good.Thank you tiger balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think it is just me thinking about someone from some smell.People pass away and so many things has changed around me....makes me sad.But I believe there are some ways to remember missing person.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Although the scent is a bit strong, the relief to my sore leg muscles and shoulder tendinitis is amazing.</li>
    <li> I started using Tiger Balm about 3 years ago. It works! I have given it to people who suffer from arthritis. They all love it too! Some were sceptical at first! However, they are just like me using it to help get rid of pain so you can sleep. I take it with me wherever I go.  I buy the 4 pack it&#x27;s a better deal, and it is good to give as a gift. If your not sure just buy a small amount. My guess.....You&#x27;ll be ordering more. Wishing you good health.  My arthritis dr told me to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> A-MAZING! This s*** is awesome. Seriously though, I have always been a fan of Icy Hot and when I couldn&#x27;t afford a new bottle my roommate let me use her Tiger Balm. I fell in love because it works so much faster and deeper. I decided to look on Amazon for a tube of my own because I had a gift certificate and found this. It&#x27;s a great size. My roommates was about an inch in diameter and is hard to use once you get down into it a little bit. This one is about 2 1/2\\&quot; wide and a little shallower so very easy to retrieve. Also - this is the version that is even more intense than the typical Tiger Balm. When I threw my back out this was my only solace. Again, AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I got this for a family member that was doing a lot of strenuous activity shoveling snow. His body was achy and nothing was really helping, but he said that this balm helped more than other things that he tried.</li>
    <li> I used to use the TB Ultra all the time and thought it worked well, until I found the TB available from Taiwan! It is about double the strength AND adds clove oil which is wonderful. So, all in all, this stuff is great, but the stuff from Taiwan is amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product......</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! Use it for everything from headaches and back aches, to sore feet after a long day. Arrrived in a timely manner and prices great! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love tiger balm and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> Have bought this several times. Beats out BenGay and all of its competitors. I would recommend it to anyone who needs this for their muscle issues.</li>
    <li> I prefer the red Tiger Balm better, it seems to be a little stronger.</li>
    <li> My wife has severe problem with rheumatism. gets up all hours of the night. She puts this on and in a few minutes she is back asleep, instead of being up for hours. The price might seem high, but you use only a little and it REALLY WORKS. I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is a great product which produces heat when placed on the skin.  This product does nothing.  Buy from a health food store not from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best stuff.  Short period of time, puts me to relaxation every time.  I get a migraine, massage into my neck, and I&#x27;m asleep!  I wake up feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I will buy this as long as I run. I don&#x27;t plan on stopping- the running. This is a MUST for runner&#x27;s, no matter this distance.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on amazon but now that i found it on here i will certainly buy it from here.  I was introduced to this miracle worker 3 years ago because i suffer from chronic migraines since i was a child.  I have always had to use prescription pain killers and even had shots because sometimes pills won&#x27;t do the job.  I can honestly say that I NEVER leave the house without this in my purse, it has helped me time and time again to alleviate the pain of migraines.  I am not saying that it has worked on its own but it has made it easier for me to get through the pain of migraines and has made it possible for me to be able to take Advil instead of prescription drugs.  I put it on my temples, behind my ears, in the back of my neck and on my forehead as soon as i start getting the migraine and depending on how i feel i apply it every hour until the pain disappears.  I strongly recommend it for anyone who gets migraines and I am sure it works great for other pains as well.</li>
    <li> Christmas gifts for older family members. We use this every day for various aches &amp; pains. No regrets! Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Excellent pain reliever</li>
    <li> I use Tiger Balm in my massage practice.  I tried other things but this is the best.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell but it works great&amp;#62; Wear gloves when applying.</li>
    <li> Use this for headaches because I&#x27;m not allowed to take any kind of medications for headaches/pain.  It works a lot of the time...depends on what the headache is from.  Just need to get used to the smell first!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> There is another beside Tiger balm called Clinacanthus nutans balm. it is very traditional and effective no less than tiger balm come with unique super nice smell. you can check my website.[...]</li>
    <li> Its a great pain relieving balm and use it all the time for my back and head.</li>
    <li> Love Tiger Balm! Works great, I use all the time for my arthritis.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It has a good smell and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, you can stop reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, do not, I repeat DO NOT put this on your bewbs. Don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t. TMI, but I put tiger balm on my PMS-sore bewbs thinking hey, they&#x27;re sore. This works on sore things. It&#x27;ll be great! Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just trust me. It was awful. I immediately questioned every decision I have made in my life up until that moment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my hands/wrists/arms for tendonitis/carpal tunnel syndrome, and back pain, and it has helped relieve some of the pain.  Hubby can&#x27;t stand the medicinal smell, but I&#x27;m pretty used to it, having grown up using Chinese healing oils all my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed in this product; doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything but smell.  My hip doesn&#x27;t feel any better so feel like I wasted my money</li>
    <li> I won some Tiger Balm on a blog giveaway. I just tried this for the first time yesterday because my back was hurting. Right away I felt a cooling sensation. It really helped with the pain. I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I think this works OK compared to other similar products.  I do not like the smell of it though---it is very sting.  be sure to wash your hands after application.  not sure i would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best pain relief ointment I have found.</li>
    <li> Great for sore, achy muscles.  Nice smell, not like medicine as many of them do.</li>
    <li> Used as soon as product arrived and it worked well. This product has been around for years so it must be great.</li>
    <li> Mmm, tiger balm. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! It is strong and gives good fresh feeling on the skin. Not so expensive, it is a big deal if you want to try Tiger Balm.</li>
    <li> Have  used this product with satisfaction</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. It is great for muscle aches, but I use it mostly for my migraine headaches. Just a little dab on the temples seems to help. I think it may be the smell of the product more than else, but whatever works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, until yesterday, I&#x27;d never read the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; TIGER BALM For fast and effective relief of headaches, stuffy nose, insect bites, itchiness, muscular aches and pains, sprains, and FLATULENCE. Apply gently on affected area.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users have noted, it burns a bit like Bengay. I do NOT recommend applying gently to the affected flatulent area! Hahahahaha! That cracked me up!! I&#x27;m not sure how this would help with flatulence, but the other listed uses make sense and the product is great. The white formula is less intense than the red, which is strong enough to feel like it&#x27;s going to blister my skin. It&#x27;s effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell pretty strongly, but then, if you&#x27;re using it for flatulence, maybe you don&#x27;t mind so much!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and find it helps sore muscles as good or better than some expensive prescriptions.</li>
    <li> I have muscle aches and pains, and there were times when none of my pain medication would help. This definitely warms my back enough to help it release the tension. It is strong, so after applying I recommend waiting 30 minutes to an hour before applying more. The smell is strong, as one would expect, but I like the spicy aroma. I learned the hard way - do NOT apply in a car or closed space... it made the driver&#x27;s eyes burn... :( Otherwise, effective for my uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong. I am new to the Tiger Balm remedy, I get a lot of aches and pains and I hate taking a lot of Advil or other pills to relieve pains.  Tiger Balm is an awesome alternative to pills and It&#x27;s all natural.  Since I am very active, and injure myself often, I got the ultra, I think it&#x27;s going to last me a while.</li>
    <li> not liking the formula change :(</li>
    <li> Good value. It works well for my sore muscle from running.</li>
    <li> It´s a very good product, I bought 3 units and shared the other 2 with my Taekwondo Grand Master and a colleague, we all agree it works very well. Received the product 2 weeks before deadline!</li>
    <li> May have been transported in the heat for too long. Mine arrived and more than half had leaked into the bshipping box. Awesome product though. Guess I should look for it in a local store.  My Bad.</li>
    <li> This relieves pain of the back and the joints fairly well</li>
    <li> Do you use Tiger Balm?  If you are human, have muscles and tendons and the commensurate occasional aches and pains then you need Tiger Balm!  Legend has it that a Chinese emperor back around 600 AD had a rather large concubine and while that worked for him...his back was often not up for the challenge.  Time to call in the Chinese medicine men and order up a balm for his back to \\&quot;keep him in the game\\&quot; so to speak!  Failure was not an option as the consequences for the medicine men would be ugly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, they got it right and \\&quot;voila\\&quot; Tiger Balm was born.  True story? I dunno but it adds a bit of mystery and intrigue to the balm, wouldn&#x27;t you agree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, this stuff comes in a reddish formula and a white formula, I have never used the red version...but I am told it will stain your clothing...if staining is not something you are desiring then be sure you order the white, non-staining formula!  I only, exclusively use the white non-staining balm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have used a lot of stuff with names like Icy Hot, Ben Gay, Fire and Ice...you name it and they all do what they purport to do...burn you!  God forbid you rub your eyes or elsewhere....enter the \\&quot;fire dragon\\&quot;, if ya know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid tennis player, addict is probably a more appropriate term.  I play everyday for at least 2 to 3 hours, weather and other things considered and I have all the aches and pains to prove it!&lt;br /&gt;But....I also have Tiger Balm everyday!  After a hot shower to open up the pores, I apply just a little buttering of this stuff to my lower back, both knees, a bad ankle and my right shoulder.  There is an immediate warming action though no burn and this stuff must contain an analgesic because it takes the edge off of any minor aches and pains immediately and keeps on working through my daily tennis regimine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trully love this stuff, have used it for years and years now and wouldn&#x27;t even think of heading to the courts before applying it to my known weak areas as well as to any new areas that may have shown up as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a nice fragrance to it....not as overwhelming as some of the other muscle balms I have used in the past and even that slight \\&quot;rub\\&quot; fragrance seems to dissipate before I get out of the house to play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 87 year old neighbor, in great shape for his years but he has some knee issues and once I gave him a dab of mine in an older empty tin....he now uses it faithfully and says it really helps him to get around better then without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 50 gram tin is good for at least 6 months of applying everyday.  It has the consistency of waxy shoe polish and you just need to glide your fingers across the top and then apply to the area you want to treat!  There are knock offs out there with \\&quot;tiger\\&quot; in the name but I have tried them and they are useless.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get the real deal....\\&quot;Tiger Balm\\&quot;, despite the knock off name and packaging and cheaper price they are pretenders to be sure and you will have wasted your money on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccommend this stuff to all my friends, tennis playing or not and I have yet to get any negative feedback!&lt;br /&gt;Yep....the Chinese Emperor got himself back into the game and me and hopefully you as well!plying it to my known weak areas as well as to any new areas that may have shown up as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a nice fragrance to it....not as overwhelming as some of the other muscle balms I have used in the past and even that slight \\&quot;rub\\&quot; fragrance seems to dissipate before I get out of the house to play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 87 year old neighbor, in great shape for his years but he has some knee issues and once I gave him a dab of mine in an older empty tin....he now uses it faithfully and says it really helps him to get around better then without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 50 gram tin is good for at least 6 months of applying everyday.

    <li> Good product, good price!</li>
    <li> really warm and feels great and does not smell as much.  leaves and greasy residue and takes a lot of work to clean the covered area off.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this product for muscle aches due to athletics and arthritis.  Only small size jar found in stores.  Relieves pain and stiffness.  Used banalag for years and tiger balm eases pain better.</li>
    <li> The odor is interesting but the heat to sore or pulled muscles is good.  This is a good product and does work. Know of a couple massage therapist that use this stuff to play sports.  Agree that it is a good item.  Will buy this item again for my softball playing.</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> I got the big tin so I wouldn&#x27;t have to hold back. Oooh, glide it over the neck and shoulders before bed and, yea baby, re-LAXing those tense muscles so instead of rocks and pain we got some minty-fresh E-Zzzzz happy go-sleepy time. Okay, maybe a little on the fiery side if you slather it on, but the stuff does work, waaaaay better than any of that Ben Gay (what?) or waaaay WAAAAY better than ANY of the cheap imitation crud.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY worth it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000N5WT2O Tiger Balm Sport Rub Ultra Pain Relieving Ointment 1.7oz]] - I&#x27;ve been using Tiger Balm since the 1980s. Couldn&#x27;t be without it in my medicine cabinet. Changes in weather bring on a bit of pain along my trapezius muscles, all along the length between my neck and shoulder. Tiger Balm soothes the pain remarkably. Recommended the product to a friend who suffers frequent back pain and she too found it very effective. So much so that on her recent trip to Paris, she was elated to find Tiger Balm in a drugstore there, so she could alleviate the aches and pains of strenuous walking and baggage wrangling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> Since when did tiger balm do away with the capzacin? This new stuff is just menthol which doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything whatsoever. If you are expecting the soothing heat that used to be tiger balm you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I grew up putting this on every kind of wound imaginable.  My mother uses it constantly and it still works for me today.</li>
    <li> Works great for stiff / sore muscles - put it on at night and wake up feeling better. It has a strong smell which some people may not like. Wash your hands thoroughly after applying - there&#x27;s places you don&#x27;t want to get this stuff.</li>
    <li> I first experienced Tiger Balm after an acupuncture treatment many years ago.  I love the smell which seems healing in itself.  I had the tiny jar of Tiger Balm Ultra which is awkward to use because it is only 1.5\\&quot; wide and you have to dig your finger into it to get the ointment out.  This metal container is about 3\\&quot; wide so you can just slide your finger across the contents to apply it. This is the traditional formula of Tiger Balm Ultra ointment--like petroleum jelly only it absorbs well.  I mention this because I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get when I bought it.</li>
    <li> I broke my collar bone and the pain was really bad,I needed to take some strong pain pills.After 5 weeks I tried to get off them and succeeded with this tiger balm.this product took the ache right ou of my shoulder and helped my wife&#x27;s arthiritis .</li>
    <li> I am a runner and I apply tiger balm to my feet before I run.  My husband uses it on his knees due to arthritis.</li>
    <li> It makes you smell like an old person but hey it works.  Soothes your muscle aches only treats the symptoms not the problem.  I had back pain and come the next day same problem so it works in a pinch doesn&#x27;t alleviate anything it just comes back.</li>
    <li> HEATS UP TO HELP SUBSIDE THE PAIN.</li>
    <li> I have been using tiger balm for years to calm sore muscles..... does the job and smells great at least I like it.</li>
    <li> The stronger stuff out there</li>
    <li> Never live without it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Tiger Balm for years and told me the Ultra will not work as well for my pain as the Red Extra Strength.  She was correct.  The Ultra works fine for general muscle pain and it does come in a larger 1.7 oz. size.  For deeper pain (I need replacement shoulder surgery and am pushing it off until next fall), I found that the Red Extra Strength is much more effective on my shoulder.  Extra Strength only comes in a very small jar - only 0.63 oz., but worth every penny to pain sufferers.  Tiger Balm also makes patches and a stress rub.  The stress rub doesn&#x27;t smell so it may be an alternative to the strong-smelling Extra Strength.  Also, some with sensitive skin may find it (Extra) too strong for them so test it on the top of your hand.  Use a very small amount and rub it in well to get deep relief.</li>
    <li> Loved it, good quality fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tiger Balm for a long time, and find it very helpful in easing the pain of arthritis and keeping me more comfortable.</li>
    <li> i was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t enter my stomach and cause problems  I already have those  and did not want to damage liver with strong pain meds. i knew of tiger balm i hadn&#x27;t used in years . this stuff kills the pain in my ankle that was broken yrs ago. pain level 5 after work 10.  this stuff smells better than icyhot .  this is great and i would tell people with addiction problems  no pills nothing to get addicted to  .</li>
    <li> Love this balm--have used this stuff for stiff neck/back for decades.  It works wonders, and buying via Amazon simply reduces the inconvenience and pain in the neck for which I am procuring it in the first place.</li>
    <li> This is a great price on Tiger Balm and a much bigger container compared to the versions I see in brick and mortar stores.  I find it easier to get the product out of this.</li>
    <li> I first learned about Tiger Balm from my massage therapist. She uses it when I come to her with specific injuries, such as a pulled muscle in my neck and shoulder region or plantar fasciitis (left foot). I&#x27;ve been buying it through Amazon.com ever since because it works so well when heat and cold packs aren&#x27;t available or convenient. I use it everyday for neck and should relief because I have fibromyalgia. I also have TMD and I have used it underneath my jaw near my ears to provide fast relief. I recommend it to people who deal with chronic daily pain.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better then the old tiger balm for muscle pain, Why destroy your kidneys and liver with painkillers when you can just use this.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Fast delivery.  The best for my aches and pains.  Mouse elbow, wrists, neck and back.  Do not try other tiger balms.  This works the best.  I tried the shoulder and neck cream while it helped it cannot compare to this.</li>
    <li> I have only used a couple times on my shins. Smells nice and has a pleasant sensation when applied. Smells like Vicks Vapor rub.</li>
    <li> Maybe you would be fine to order in the winter. I ordered in the summer though and it leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great product, seller</li>
    <li> Besides being an all-around excellent muscle pain reliever, Tiger Balm is a quilter&#x27;s best friend. Sometimes we spend too long bent over our work, whether cutting, sewing, or quilting. Or that slow walk through a quilt show has us looking for a chair to sit on. You know what I mean! Tiger Balm&#x27;s soothing ointment feels really good on those sore back muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been lifting loads heavier than you should -- and straining arm and back muscles? Leg cramps? Shoulder muscles tensed up too long? Tiger Balm to the rescue. Have been using this product myself for years, from the little jars to the larger cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ancient formulation with a distinct but mild fragrance. When it comes to pain relievers, you can smell like menthol or you can smell like Tiger Balm. I and my quilting friends prefer Tiger Balm. Husbands use it, too. I don&#x27;t leave home on any trip without it.</li>
    <li> I have used this pretty consistantly for the past 10 years and it as always worked well for me.  Being petroleum based makes it stick to my skin better, but also makes it harder to get off my skin it I happen to get it somewhere I do not want.  It stays active for many hours, it is good for general pain related to spinal, joint and muscles and it helpful for sprains.</li>
    <li> we love it!!! It works better than any other such products, for pain.&lt;br /&gt;we recommend it to all our family!</li>
    <li> When I had a nasty bruise on my leg I wondered to myself: &amp;#34;if you put Neosporin on cuts, what do you put on bruises?&amp;#34;  The answer: this stuff!  But, more importantly, it&#x27;s great for sore muscles.  I tend to get a lot of tension in the muscles that connect my neck and shoulders.  Sometimes it gets quite painful, and before I discovered this stuff the only remedy was to go get a massage.  This balm does not work as well as a good massage, but it is the next best thing I have found.  You have to warm it by swirling your fingers around in it, but you don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot.  It also helps if you massage it into the sore muscles.  Give it about 10 minutes and you&#x27;ll start to feel the tingle.  That tingly sensation lasts for about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, it does have a strong smell to it that sticks to you for a while.  It&#x27;s a very herbal smell which isn&#x27;t necessarily unpleasant (it has a bit of a spicy smell too).  If you don&#x27;t want to smell like this stuff all day, then I recommend applying it at night and showering afterward.</li>
    <li> Product is great, but not a fan of the packaging. Could have been something I missed when ordering, but it&#x27;s in a tin, not a jar like you also may have expected. Kind of hard to open, and if you&#x27;re traveling and it gets smashed, good luck opening again. Gets hot and does probably what you need, just know its jelly like Vaseline and after rubbing it will leave a residue on your fingers so wash you&#x27;ll need to wipe if off afterwards. Smells like Christmas.</li>
    <li> GREAT RELIEF FOR MY GUY&#x27;S BACK ISSUES  fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using Tiger Balm for many years and will continue to do so. The pain relieving ointment has proven to be better then any heat penetrating product on the market today. The effects of the Tiger Balm relieves my pain for most of the day without having to continuously apply more every hour or so.</li>
    <li> works great - love it for pain in back and sciatica</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I could buy this balm from Amazon.com for a reasonable price with speedy shipping.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years.  This Ultra Strength Balm is just right for me to apply for minor irritation of joints or muscle.  Sometimes for bugs&#x27; bites.  Great products.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely the best for muscle soreness.  It does have a scent but is not offensive.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is very weak, I have been using tiger balm for years and this is the shabbiest that Ive ever purchased. I suspect it may be fake. It works as if its 1 Part Tiger Balm and 2 Parts Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years for sore muscles. In the last 4 years, I have been suffering from severe Fibromyalgia and Cervical Stenosis, which causes constant, nauseating upper back pain. This product is the only product that can help my pain go away. Even prescription medication is not as effective as this rub. I love it and I have recommended this product time and time again for people with muscle issues. I tell them to use this product before they try muscle relaxers or pain pills as it&#x27;s far more effective and has a quicker response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, don&#x27;t put this on after a shower or bath as they open up the pores of the skin causing Tiger Balm to sting and be much hotter than normal.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and this is my number one go to product for clients when they have chronic issues, It is the perfect consistency to use while doing the massage strokes and yet gentle enough to just rub on when the client is at home.</li>
    <li> I received the product with broken lid always worried I will cut my fingers when dipping into Tb</li>
    <li> When I was in the military someone recommended this &#x27;if I can find it&#x27; I was told. They let me use theirs... I can&#x27;t remember where I found it in 91, but I have been using it ever since. Thank god for amazon! I tried other topical pain relievers off and on, flexall, beengay, pentrex, aspercream, etc... And I just felt it was a waste of money and always came back to tiger balm! This not only cools but it feels like it relieves swelling, maybe it&#x27;s mental but it really gives me relief. So in military it was for over exertion, and now it&#x27;s for arthritis, pulled muscles and joint pains.(shoulder atm). It seems more chilling to me rather than warning... Maybe everyone feels it diff? But still it&#x27;s nice relief.</li>
    <li> I use this balm on my very arthritic knees, and usually, it works great.  When I get it from other places, that is. This particular balm does nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t think it is authentic becAuse it does nothing.  Doesn&#x27;t get warm doesn&#x27;t tingle, does not take the pain away.  Tiger balm always does these things for me.  So, I think this is not the real deal.  Too late to send back.  Darn. And such a big can, too.</li>
    <li> When you first rub this stuff on it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  After a few minutes it really kicks into high gear.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using tiger balm and when i put it on my skin it started burning! The next day my skin was blistered and i had a skin rash that lasted 2 months. I think i had an bad reaction to some of the oils in the product.</li>
    <li> What a great product this is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mother-In-Law purchased some of this at a local grocery store.  I thought I&#x27;d try it on my arthritic knees.  Within a minute I felt some relief concerning my knees.  I checked to see if they carried it on Amazon and they did!  (The amount is larger and it costs a little more, overall; however, ounce for ounce, it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.).  It does have a &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; smell so be prepared for that.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but it is present.  I know this because I would put some on my knees during my planning period and my students would come back from their special(s) and ask, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;  It would often be followed by, &amp;#34;That smells good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it hasn&#x27;t stained any of my clothing and it lasts a good while to help diminish the pain.  I&#x27;ve found another product that also helps my knees:  White Flower Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is amazing and works on all of my sore muscles. Came quickly!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would alleviate arthritis pain and was glad it did not contain tons of unnecessary ingredients like China Gel, Icy Hot and others. Unfortunately, it did almost nothing to alleviate my arthritis pain and it seemed to take much longer to absorb than other products. I was anticipating a strong tingling burn/sensation like the other products and felt next to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough it did not stain my clothing, but my skin turned yellow and peeled off where this product was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and discovered they use synthetic Camphor which is essentially made from the oil of turpentine. If you are looking for a product that uses natural Camphor made from tree bark, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I hate Tiger Balm so much.  So, so much.  It smells awful.  It gets icy cold and the icy cold feeling doesn&#x27;t go away for hours.  It burns and freezes at the same time.  I feel like Gollum.  &amp;#34;It burns us!  It freezes!&amp;#34;  The only worse thing about it is if the makers added patchouli to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, after a couple hours, I feel wonderful and healed and happy.  And that&#x27;s why it gets 5 stars.  Because it works.</li>
    <li> Nice big tin of an excellent product. I have used this for years and it really soothes sore muscles. I especially like it on the back of my neck before bed, it warms and relaxes my neck and helps me to sleep. I was so glad to find it in a nice size tin (just under 3&#x27; across the top of the tin) instead of the tiny lip balm container size I use to buy. Great value and product!</li>
    <li> I play soccer and also go for a run quite often but since im almost 30 now my muscles are starting to ache after  exercising / playing sports. I was advised to try this by my soccer coach and this stuff has done wonders. I heats up the area you apply it to and relieves the muscle pain. It is very strong and it will sting a lot but it works. One advice: once you&#x27;re done applying it wash your hands thoroughly as i made the mistake of scratching an itch in my face without properly getting this stuff off first...</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist, I use this product on almost all of my clients when I finish work on the back. Add heat to the table, and the sensation is incredible!</li>
    <li> This stuff is HOT so use sparingly... I accidentally put too much on and had to run to try and wash it off. Does not relieve pain at all, but does make the skin super hot.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! This helps relieve headaches and muscle pain when medications do not. I get frequent migraines, and often use Tiger balm in conjunction with my prescriptions. Tiger balm also works great on its own. Some people do object to the strong odor, but I like the smell of it. However, I do have one word of warning - do not get this in your eyes, or even close to your eyes, as it will cause burning and watering.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm saves the day, one down side was the package was left outside and melted, causing it to leak half the contents, but tigers balm best remedy for sore muscles, and injuries. so love it I don&#x27;t care if it leaked.... but was in too much pain to care. Two days later, much improved.</li>
    <li> I use it on my back for sever pain and it works wonders. I bought it for my mother in law and she loved it as well. I recently purchased her an additional pack for arthritis and it helps a lot. One of the best products on the market for muscle pain.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Best pain reliever I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This balm is wonderful , the sent is strong but that tells me that it&#x27;sgoing to get rid of my pain and aching muscles. Thanks for having the large size it last a long time. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stiff is hot, but then gets very cold (I usually have to put on a jacket because I get so cold). I used it when I had some acute tendonitis for an extended period of time, and slowly but surely it went away. Also feels great to use before a workout.</li>
    <li> Always good stuff - wish it was more affordable. I remember seeing it all over in Okinawa when I was in the USMC, it was what people put on mosquito bites, as well as sore muscles. Spring is coming, and so are mosquitoes, so I got the large one.</li>
    <li> It was not the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; pain reliever I&#x27;d heard it was.  Maybe I expected too much for mild arthritic pain.  Also, the odor is pretty overwhelming</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tiger Balm many times in the past--both the red and the white types.  But I&#x27;d never seen this large size before--it makes the balm more affordable -- and it works great too!  Active ingredients are camphor and menthol (11% each).  This is higher than almost any other balm of its type.  It also includes mint oil (though not how much of it) which also acts against pain generally).  I have some smaller containers I travel with, but I&#x27;ve found you can reload them from a larger container (such as this one) with your finger tip.  When I was in American Samoa I had a painful muscle in my face--oral analgesics (Naprosyn and Ibuprofen) didn&#x27;t do the trick.  But the Tiger Balm worked.</li>
    <li> I found out about Tiger Balm in martial arts in the late 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s best used for sore muscles, not so good for arthritis and joints. My skin has become sensitive since, so this product gives me rashes. I would still recommend this for simple overexertion.</li>
    <li> The best topical muscle and joint pain reliever available.</li>
    <li> Helps with aching muscles and really heats up and smell like cinnamon</li>
    <li> works great but has a very strong smell</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It works well and seems to penetrate deeper than Icy Hot. It also has a stronger effect over Icy Hot. Smell is strong but dissipates after about an hour. You won&#x27;t need much of this to have an impact on sore muscles. Very effective product.</li>
    <li> Good item, doesn&#x27;t clear the pain 100% but definitely helps with temp relief. Much better then some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years and years.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I love this big tin. I seems to melt on your fingers as you rub them in a circular motion making very easy to apply. Last very long time.</li>
    <li> Great size for repeated use.  Good value, great product.  I sue this to deal with back pain I get from sitting at a desk on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not nearly what it&#x27;s made out to be. I did not feel the heat or the cool and most of all, I did not feel any relief at all. But you can&#x27;t win them all and it may work great for some people.</li>
    <li> It works better than ice hot.. I like tiger balm a lot and I recommend this product to every one.</li>
    <li> I am undergoing a form of Chemo which is causing some serious muscle aches and tightness.&lt;br /&gt;I use some Tiger Balm every night on my calves and can sleep through the night.&lt;br /&gt;The deep heat is perfect and it does night dry out my skin like others do.</li>
    <li> Love the bigger size.</li>
    <li> healed my halmstring in as little as two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wow</li>
    <li> This is a must buy.  It helps to soothe your pain.</li>
    <li> This is so much stronger than the other varieties of tiger balm.  I actually rub it into my head when I have a migraine, then I put the hot water bottle over that, and it helps me break up my migraine.  I was so distraught when I could not get this locally anymore, so thank you thank you for selling this online.  Do not get this in your eyes, seriously.</li>
    <li> If you like Tiger Balm and want to save money, this is for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for muscle and joint aches!  I purchased this to have on hand.  I could not find this larger container at Target or Walmart, but found it here and for a good price.</li>
    <li> After an injury thus was an invaluable, healing balm.  The scent us more mind than many leading therapy creams and the results last much longer.</li>
    <li> Just awesome!!!!! This is one of the only products that I was able to find that helps treat my lower back pains!!!! I love it!!! and I just had to buy two of them for the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Item not sealed. Looks like refill.</li>
    <li> It works on my back even! I have orthopedic pins in my spine and get chronic back pain. This stuff really works, even on me! I would have given it five, but it does have a very strong smell (not bad, just very strong) and there&#x27;s no way to apply it do yourself without getting some on your hands and smelling it all day. Maybe if it was in a stick form (like a glue stick or roll on deodorant) then it might be a better fit for this stuff. Otherwise, I actually am going to give it five because it works on me.</li>
    <li> Tiger balm works great for aches and pains caused by minor sports or work injuries. I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for over 10 years and love it. The only downside is that it smells and can stain clothes, sheets, and other fabric!</li>
    <li> Order was processed immediately and arrived in good shape and on time. This really works for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product since my first trip to Asia, almost 50 years now. Superior to others of its type.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent ointment, I didn&#x27;t like the container, it&#x27;s a little difficult to open, price was good, smells nice.</li>
    <li> Really does help pain with a soothing warm feeling. Only I wish it didn&#x27;t smell so strong.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tiger Balm for several years.  I I had come upon this quite by accident (literally)...I had crushed my arm in an accident, been on pain medicine, and ever since when it&#x27;s going to rain I would be in excruciating joint pain...A friend of mine recommended this, and made it VERY clear that the smell was a &amp;#34;bit overwhelming&amp;#34;...Well, I have been using it religiously ever since, and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  It is 100 per cent better than anything else, and the smell; well, it isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;d think.  And when the cold and rain come, OUT COMES THE TIGER BALM!</li>
    <li> I have been using tiger balm for many years to help ease muscle aches. The product arrived quickly. I recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm really helps back pain...it is one of the best products my husband and I have ever used for relief of lower back pain.</li>
    <li> I have relativedly minor arthritis in the joints of one hand and this stuff warms the area up and makes me purr.</li>
    <li> Liniment does nothing at all. It&#x27;s like putting on water. Ultra was half full &amp; melted. Very disappointed. Have been using Tiger Baum for 15 years but this is not the real stuff. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this item. I bought the second one because the first one worked so well. It does smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> Was excitied to try the product, in a tin container which is fine, I&#x27;ve used badger balm before and Burt&#x27;s Bees Miracle Salve, but the tin and edge is so thin, and on so tight, NO WAY can it be pried off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment, now a hassle to send back, I thought I had read that Tiger Balm always came in a green jade like jar with a cap, how do they think someone with arthritis in their hands might be able to get this off??????  My husband has strong hands, he couldn&#x27;t get it off when he got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upset.</li>
    <li> best product ever. i have used this product for 12 years and still love it</li>
    <li> Magic stuff for weightlifting recovery. This is the easier to use size so you dont have to poke around in the tiny annoying jars.</li>
    <li> Smells as strong as it works.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST FOR SORE JOINTS</li>
    <li> aches and pains no more</li>
    <li> Works very well on my tired muscles</li>
    <li> Nothing works like Tiger Balm. It is strong but man, does it work great!</li>
    <li> ultra sports rub tiger balm offers great relief for muscle pain</li>
    <li> This works better than Biofreeze, and it lasts longer, and is cheaper. I have had chronic back pain for years and have tried many rubs and creams, including some brought to me from Asia. I keep going to back to this one. It cools and relaxes my muscles. Sometimes I use an ice pack after putting this on when the pain is really bad and the two seem to work together to numb the pain. It works great by itself, too.</li>
    <li> Both my father and husband use this product on their knees everyday and other body parts as needed.  I have recommended this product to others as well and have only heard very good responses to this product to reduce and ease their pain.</li>
    <li> My doctor turned me on to the Tiger Balm patches.  They are harder to find some times, but really worth it.  I&#x27;ve recently tried the ointment because I have arthritis in my knees and the pads are not convenient.  This is the best ointment for numbing the stiffness and pain in my knees that I&#x27;ve found. The \\&quot;red\\&quot; extra strength is to much for me (it stains) and I wish they made the ointment without the smell (very menthol) but it&#x27;s worth it to lessen the pain in my knees.  This is definitely worth a try for both back and knee pain.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all there is to it. It is wonderful and indispensable. The strongest you can get. Strong cooling sensation. Recommended to use during the day. Some people like the smell of it, others don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order in summer.  Arrived melted and leaked.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by our chiropractor for my grandmother. She keeps ordering more, so it must help her.  She says it dulls the pain, so she can stand it. It makes the skin area feel hot when applied, and no odor.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is the bestest (no such word but you understand) my love for it.  Buy, use it and you will never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is the best topical for arthritis pain that I have found. I have tried many and they were a waste of money.  This is fast and effective</li>
    <li> I bought this for a new injury, but by the time it was delivered I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  I love the original product but hated the staining aspect.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the same great product without the destruction of my bed linens.</li>
    <li> This tin is wonderful for being able to get your fingers in the balm. Where the jar has a small opening, the mouth on this tin is nice and wide.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS STUFF BC IT HELPS RELIEVE MUSCLE SPASMS I GET FROM MY DEGENERATIVE SPINE DISEASE.  I USE HEAT AND OTC PAIN RELIEVERS TOGETHER WITH THIS WONDERFUL OINTMENT. I EVEN LOVE THE SMELL. IT REMINDS ME OF MY GRANDFATHER AND MY MOM IN HER ELDER YEARS.  NOW, I SMELL LIKE THIS TOO.  IT IS COOL; I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Nothing else works as well and smells so good!</li>
    <li> Not only is it a greater value, but the larger size makes it easier to use, as it comes in mini puck-like disk, instead of a jar with a small opening.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells good (to me) and heats up nicely.</li>
    <li> Great for aches, pain, arthritis, and sore muscles.</li>
    <li> My wife says this helps with the arthritis in her thumbs</li>
    <li> Does the job but without that obnoxious menthol smell of other products</li>
    <li> This stuff is a lifesaver!&lt;br /&gt;I have myofascial pain syndrome that was spurred by a car accident I had almost a decade ago. Chronic pain is a curse.&lt;br /&gt;But nine times out of ten, when I use tiger balm, I don&#x27;t require additional medication---including otc meds, which once burned my esophagus because of overuse (which is easy to do when you&#x27;re in chronic pain).&lt;br /&gt;Ultra strength tiger balm, along with CBT and the development of effective coping skills, has strongly reduced my need for medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels amazing. Tingly and refreshing. Strong. It works wonderfully for menstrual cramps too!&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon for the large tin is a great deal!  A brick and mortar store was charging  $17.99 for the same item.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to relieve muscle pain and this is the best I have found.  It is very fragrant which can be a drawback, and it leaves a greasy residue on your hands that must be removed with soap and water, but it works wonders.</li>
    <li> before there was icey hot, etc...this is the grand daddy of it all...works great and gets the job done - the ultra smells a bit more then the reg but its not that bad.</li>
    <li> This item is a great alternative to those annoying little glass jars.  This holds a large amount, and can get tossed in a gym/gear bag without worrying about the container breaking.  Also, it&#x27;s white/non-staining in a strong strength (so no more orange/brown shirt collars if you use it on your neck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one word of warning...  Make sure you wash your hands before going to the bathroom!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much consumed with OA and Fibro and my feet are the last to be hit with OA.  Last night I rubbed TB on my feet, put on my sleep socks and NO PAIN all night into mid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used TB off and on for years along with Arnica Plus and Topricin.  Like them all but especially TB.</li>
    <li> I love tiger balm don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the  lid on this sports balm was super hard to get off and I was thankful that I still had the old tin and used that lid instead. It took pliers to get it off...</li>
    <li> I love tiger balm!!! I have been using this for years and it is the only thing that helps my arthritis on my knee. Definitely would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have used Tiger Balm for several years and find that it is a good pain reliever and provides real relief from minor strains and pains.  I highly recommend the non-staining ointment that is white in color.  The one that says it stains - stains - and it is difficult to get the stain out.  This is an excellent Balm and superior to others I have tried.</li>
    <li> 4th can I&#x27;ve bought...really great stuff</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm ultra is my go to balm whenever I am achy. Slept on the pillow wrong? On my neck, fine in no time. Low back grumpy? Slather it on. My gripe is that the small containers that are a hexagon shape make it tough to scrape out every little bit of it. I am the type that cuts the toothpaste tube in HALF to get everything I paid for (esp for pricey Toms of Maine...but I digress). This tin is the perfect size for right next to the bed. And it is easy to get every bit of product out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every balm, rub, and cream on the market for muscle aches and pains. I always come back to this. Yes it has a strong scent but they all do. At least this one is a cinnamon scent. Know what else I find? If you are having trouble sleeping, because maybe your thoughts are racing, rub a bit on the base of your neck. The smell and the sensation is distracting in a good way that helps calm the mind. A nice extra benefit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO...there are so many of us on Amazon trying to find products like supplements, vitamins, herbs,creams, etc., to manage our health and well being. I try hard to bring an honest review to you. However, much to my chagrin, I am finding paid for and planted reviews. We all know that the person selling a product is going to try and coax a couple of good reviews, but when I come across a product with an outstanding &amp; unbelievable amount of 5 stars, I looks further. For what? Too many 5 star reviews from people who have no other reviews, written in as few words as possible to make the word quota. OR a 5 star review written by someone that has maybe 1 or 2 other reviews for a couple of cheap items, often all bought at the same time. Or many of these types of quick 5 star reviews showing up all around the same time period. Then there are the &#x27;verified buyer&#x27; obvious paid reviews. I&#x27;ve read that this is worked by offering someone an Amazon gift card in exchange for that person purchasing the product then positively reviewing it, thus earning the &#x27;verified buyer status&#x27; and elevating the validity of the review. So be forewarned and look a bit further in for the high quality reviews many of us take the time to write!&lt;br /&gt;This extra post script is NOT in reflection of the product I am reviewing here; it is to educate readers as they wade through all of the reviews to try and get the correct information to make a well educated purchase with their money.buyer status&#x27; and elevating the validity of the review.

    <li> Great item, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Tiger balm may be more expensive than other brands, but it&#x27;s my favorite pain relief formula out there.  The strength is excellent and really seems to help relieve those aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is the only thing that works on aches &amp; pains in my life.  I have friends who have submitted to hip surgery very early and left with great aches &amp; pains.  I know I will need surgery on my left hip and foot some day maybe, but for now a daily Tiger Balm rub on these sore areas silences the achy-ness for 12+ hours and that beats surgery any day right now.  Don&#x27;t stop believing!!! in Tiger Balm!!!  XOSusan</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic. Not sure what its powers are, whatever they are it sure does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hike a lot and get sore spots. Tiger Balm takes all the soreness away. Presto....gone. When it wears off the soreness doesn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell. But I do put it on with a glove because I don&#x27;t want the ointment on my fingers. It&#x27;s best to only get the stuff where I need it.</li>
    <li> this balm is really good! it really works, it helps pain relief such as legs, arms, and back. i&#x27;m telling you it is the best balm! you should try it.</li>
    <li> Tiger balm is my favorite have always used it and it&#x27;s effective highly recommend it and this is a great price</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is the only thing that relieves night time muscle cramps for me. It works quickly. I first began using it for migraines and sinus pain. It does work well on headaches, although you need to use it very lightly on your face or head as redness can occur.</li>
    <li> I had a horrible allergic reaction to it.  I broke out in a rash and hives everywhere i put it.  If you have sensitive skin I would caution you.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this product recommended by a friend. Works great. It has relieved the pain in my ankles considerably. Hasn&#x27;t cured the problem but definitely makes it more bearable.</li>
    <li> wonderful product  doesnt smell too strongly although it does have a noticable scent doesnt stain clothes or sheets and most importantly It Works</li>
    <li> Best product for sore muscles. Put a little on before bed and I wake up with no muscle soreness and ready to go for the day.</li>
    <li> I have the unfortunate pleasure of suffering from chronic neck and lower back pain. I&#x27;ve used Tiger Balm patches in the past, and while great, I find that they don&#x27;t always stick on my lower back while sleeping- they tend to bunch up or fall off when I roll over while in bed. I really enjoyed the Tiger Balm Ultra as a substitute. It&#x27;s not overly oily or sticky when I rub it on, and creates a nice warm, sometimes tingly feeling that relaxes my muscles. The scent is a tad strong and might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy the smell of cloves, it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s a nice way to keep my muscles relaxed!</li>
    <li> Love my Tiger Balm. I use it every night on my neck and back. It helps me relax and fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Huge container I thought it was two smaller ones but it will do.</li>
    <li> not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is very difficult to open; I would recommend those with pain/arthritis of the hand to steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve some knee pain due to over-training.  I wish you well.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Ultra-Strength\\&quot;?...I think not.  This is a much weaker product than I used to get back in the 80&#x27;s. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> The balm smells nice, is non greasy and works very fast, but it started causing skin redness and itching for me. Initially I applied to the back of my neck and it caused redness and itching. I thought maybe the skin there is soft. But later when I applied it to my upper back and shoulders, it did the same thing! Now I am applying hydrocortisone to the affected areas. No other balm (regular tiger balm or ling nam ultra balm or bengay) I have used in the past decade has done this to my skin, so I cannot give a great review for this product.</li>
    <li> Great product use it for many years. I used this when I did tae kwon do really good for sore muscles and joints. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best rub for my lower back.  Can&#x27;t use everyday due to irritation from repeated use, but it&#x27;s not an everyday product.  Tried others, like the Ultra Sports Rub consistency the best.</li>
    <li> I actually use less pain meds since applying this to my aching body parts.... helps warm up the joints/muscles from the outside in.. I&#x27;m a believer and will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm really works good! My husband has been using it for years! It helps relieve his back pain! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great price, purchase adn delivery was quick and cheap.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff. It&#x27;s crazy powerful - for comparison, Icyhot does almost nothing for me and depending where I put the Tiger balm, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to stand at first - but it&#x27;s that strength that I need. For a couple of years I got bad back spasms, and this was the only product to cut through and help ease them out. I always have a tin of it around just in case my neck or back decides it hates me. Basically, my muscles don&#x27;t relax, they must be pummeled into submission - this stuff lets me do that. If you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;gentle warmth&amp;#34; this is not the product for you. If you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;just shy of chemical burn&amp;#34; (as well as &amp;#34;for the love of god, make sure you wash your hands well after applying it&amp;#34;) this is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Very good product for those who train like a savage. Wish it felt stronger like Zim&#x27;s Max Freeze. Still a customer.</li>
    <li> I have tennis elbo and artharitis.  This stuff goes on and gets cold fast.  It is like having an ice pack with out the drippy water.  WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> Burns fine, eases the pain. Eye of the tiger.</li>
    <li> Whenever I have a pain in the neck I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Now just I pop open this refreshing can of Tiger Balm Ultra. Just the aroma brings forth a fanfare of song inspiring my senses to keep dancing through the fire while calming and soothing my aching muscles. If you&#x27;ve got down and you&#x27;ve had enough of severe muscle pain, remember you are a champion and tiger balm ultra will let you ROAR!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me and I am so glad they did! I was a Biofreeze user for years but Tiger Balm blows it out if the water. I suffer from chronic neck and shoulder pain and this helps so quickly. I have a terrible habit of &amp;#34;cracking&amp;#34; my neck multiple times a day to the point where I can&#x27;t get it to pop and my neck muscles feel twisted. A little Tiger Balm and 20 minutes later it relaxes the muscles enough where I can pop it and all the tension is gone. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My spouse has fibromyalgia. Tiger Balm is the only topical that gives him any relief.&lt;br /&gt;We have used this product for many years. when first discovered  in a small shop located in the basement of Seattle&#x27;s Pike Place Market... back in the 70&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;We LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the most effective pain ointment in my medicine closet. Noticeably more effective than Tiger Balm Regular strength</li>
    <li> I do not clearly understand how it works, but it always does. Don&#x27;t use it often, but when I do it works. I like the smell. There&#x27;s just something about that smell... it smells like... victory.</li>
    <li> This Tiger Balm is terrific - it works, and it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it took me three days to get into the package!  I&#x27;m not even elderly.  The tin is much like an old shoe shine tin, but without the little lever to help open it.  I finally used a jar opener and a rubber jar grip together.  It shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.  Product - 5 stars.  Package - 0.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I was anticipating so much more pain relief. There was no tingling or redness on my skin; it just felt mildly warm. Tiger Balm has a pleasant smell and an easy open tin, but I didn&#x27;t experience any more sore muscle relief than I get from using IcyHot.</li>
    <li> Tiger Balm is still the best pain ointment I&#x27;ve found. Great for sinus issues as well. If I have a sinus headache, I&#x27;ll rub some on my forehead, and a small bit on my upper lip, just at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Of all the analgesic ointments on the market this is my favorite. it could be because I grew up knowing it&#x27;s &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;...it is strong and peculiar, but it works for my aches and pains and the smell is nostalgic to me.</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this by a massage therapist.  Helpful hint - use it on the bottom of your feet when you are coming down with cold or flu.  Be sure to wear socks.  You&#x27;ll feel better by morning.</li>
    <li> Like any other minty lotion. This is more like a pomade though. It&#x27;s alright! Not as good as some people make it seem. &#x3D;\</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was recommended to me by a good friend. I used to use Bengay but Tiger Balm just feels more natural and better on your muscles and skin. It relieves the tension and pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled so strong to me that I had to wash it off. It IS hot as Hades and if you don&#x27;t mind the smell I imagine it would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find out, however, that using it on skin that had icy hot on it before is BAD. VERY. BAD. It burned me pretty badly. My fault though - when I used it on a untreated spot, it was fine. Just hated the smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! And buying it on Amazon is not only cheaper, but now I don&#x27;t have to run to the store!</li>
    <li> I use this along with Shiling Oil for a CHRONIC back. Fusion....2 operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and it does give me relief.... a kind of hot and cold process. I apply on lower back and occasionally  on knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some soccer players use this ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that easily available, I don&#x27;t think.</li>
    <li> I love Tiger Balm. This was a good price and recieved it in a resonable amount of time. Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for ten years, Best used when applied to a sore back or shoulders. Provide good deep heat.</li>
    <li> It works great... smells awful.  Wore it to the office and everyone was like -- who stinks?? lol  It&#x27;s a trade-off.  Feel better or stink!</li>
    <li> Subtle, but effective. An unhappy meet up with a drunk driver resulted in major back surgery. My titanium now works better than the weather channel for predicting rain. I was happily shocked to see how well this works. The Vicodin and hydrocodine did nothing but screw with my memory. I far refer this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use to be able to purchase this tin at whole foods. No longer available. Was happy to see this on amazon. The strength of this takes the pain away instantly. Can&#x27;t be without my tiger balm</li>
    <li> It irritates my skin creating little pimples but does sooth the pain somewhat. I will try some again</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff. Relieves pain very quickly.</li>
    <li> Also can be found at most wallyworld stores. Wife likes it but the odor seems like it&#x27;s burning the corneas off of my eyeballs. BUT happy wife happy life.</li>
    <li> The classic stuff. It works great for reaching into sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday that I work out on my knees and shoulders.It helps me to warm up faster and helps ease that stiffness .</li>
    <li> Worked great on my strained shoulder muscle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! Head and shoulders above Icyhot!</li>
    <li> this is the best muscle rub on the market, its stronger than Icy Hot, and pretty much kills any and all muscle soreness.</li>
    <li> Great as always I always order this from same vendor as needed a couple time a year. Works great to relive muscle aches would recommend to anyone that may have pain issues.</li>
    <li> Just the best on the market!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. really works for injured joints.</li>
    <li> This items works great!  We use it on all our muscle and nerve problems.  It works well on muscles that have been over worked to the point of slight injury.  Also works well on nerve injuries.</li>
    <li> Best product for headaches and body aches. I will continue to buy this awesome ointment. Rawr.</li>
    <li> Right now, I&#x27;m sitting here typing while sitting on the couch enjoying the cool relief of Tiger Balm on my knee. If you are anything like me you are now thinking to yourself, &amp;#34;Wait a minute - Tiger Balm - that stuff is still around?&amp;#34; This was exactly my thinking when I received an email offering me samples of Tiger Balm in exchange for my review. I accepted the offer because I was curious to see if the product had actually changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I accepted the offer, I did a little investigation and here&#x27;s what I learned: Tiger Balm is a topical analgesic (pain reliever) medication made from herbal ingredients. Topical medications can be effective treatment options, especially for people who can&#x27;t take oral medications. Tiger Balm is recommended for relieving back pain, joint pain, stiffness, sprains, and arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history of the product is this: Tiger Balm is manufactured and distributed by Haw Par Healthcare in Singapore. Tiger Balm is based on a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; herbal formula that dates back as far as the Chinese emperors. Today, over 20 million jars of Tiger Balm are sold each year in over 70 countries. Trusted by millions for nearly 100 years, Tiger Balm’s time-proven blend of herbal ingredients provides safe and effective relief for sore muscles, arthritis, neck and shoulder stiffness, and just about any other minor muscle or joint aches or pains that may come your way. Prince of Peace Enterprises, Inc. introduced the world-famous Tiger Balm brand to the United States mainstream market in 1986 and has been the sole licensed U.S. distributor for all Tiger Balm products since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiger Balm contains camphor, menthol, cajuput, oil, and clove oil. It is available in several formulations, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ♦  Tiger Balm Ultra Strength Pain Relieving Ointment Sports Rub - Rub well on affected area. Repeat 3-4 times daily. For children 2-12 years old, consult a physician. This product contains the strongest concentration of Tiger Balm&#x27;s non-staining herbal ingredients to deliver fast, warm, comforting relief for joint and muscle pain, stiff muscles, arthritis in the hands and joints, and backaches caused by overexertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ♦  Tiger Balm Pain Relieving Patch - First you clean and dry area where patch is to be applied. Peel off the protective film and apply patch to the affected area once or twice a day. A bandage may be applied to secure the patch. A warming effect soothes aches and pains. The patches provide strong and convenient pain relief for hours with minimal odor. They&#x27;re not messy or greasy, and will not stain clothing. The ventilated hydrogel patch contours to your body to deliver optimal comfort and relief, and the pull-and-peel protective film makes it easy to apply and painless to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings: There are important precautions you should take for the safe use of topical pain relievers. Tiger Balm is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. If your condition worsens or persists for more than 7 days, discontinue use and consult a physician. The product may cause an allergic reaction in some people who have sensitive skin. Test on a small area before using the product. If severe irritation occurs, discontinue use and consult a physician. Do not apply to wounds or damaged skin. Do not bandage tightly. As with any medication, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, you should consult with a health professional before using Tiger Balm. Keep the product out of the reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, contact a Poison Control Center immediately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line: Tiger Balm, like many other topical medications for arthritis, can be purchased over-the-counter. The topical analgesic is applied to the skin and the active ingredients are absorbed through the skin. Products that contain contain menthol, eucalyptus, or oil of wintergreen may work by irritating the skin where it is applied. The skin begins to feel warm or cold, possibly serving as a distraction from the pain. Such formulations are called counter-irritants and offer temporary pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home from the Shark&#x27;s Tooth 10K last weekend (race recap coming soon), I lathered some of the Tiger Balm Ultra Strength Pain Relieving Ointment Sports Rub on my knee (the one with the ongoing pain), and elevated for a while.  While the knee was slightly swollen (as usual), it wasn&#x27;t throbbing but instead I felt this tingly warm/cool mixed feeling that made the pain go away. The remainder of my weekend was very busy and my knee held up without too much difficulty, and I truly believe it was because I used the Tiger Balm Ultra Strength Pain Relieving Ointment Sports Rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the product and will try it a few more times before making a final decision. Surprisingly, I liked the menthol smell too! I think every runner should keep a bottle of this product in their gym bag or medicine chest to head off the pain right after working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has any kind of pain. I feel that the Tiger Balm products are affordable and effective - a combination that can&#x27;t be beat!  I received some Tiger Balm product without cost in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion.eel warm or cold, possibly serving as a distraction from the pain.

    <li> Not your father&#x27;s Ben-Gay this is Ben-Gay on steroids.</li>
    <li> Great product for pain</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. But only able to buy small jars of it.  Love the big tins!</li>
    <li> Great stuff my boss turned me on to tiger balm and it is really good.</li>
    <li> Not as potent as the usual, and for some reason instead of a warm sensation it slowly delivers a cool sensation---maybe its just been awhile since I used the older stuff. This also happens to come in an unfortunately difficult container to open because of the smooth lid (you&#x27;ll see what I mean if you buy it), and the Tiger Balm is actually a white-grey color rather than a brown honey-like one.</li>
    <li> Smell is not as strong as Ben Gay, but not very potent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tiger Balm for many years. Now I find I can purchase these huge tins for a great price thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> A must have for those sore muscles. This product seems to work instantly on easing the aches and pains from sore muscles.</li>
