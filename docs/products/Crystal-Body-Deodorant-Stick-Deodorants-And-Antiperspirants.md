      <li>The Crystal rock/stick does a great job eliminating the musty sweat smell and is easy on the shirts.</li>

      <li>These sticks are amazing.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended this product and I have been using it for apporximately six months, and I have to say that for me it has been 100% effective.</li>
      <li>He is a school district administrator and his job requires him to interact with people most of his work day, so deodorant protection is very important to him in this tropical(hot</li>
      <li>Nothing worked for me until I discovered this product many years ago.</li>
      <li>order was for 4 sticks, so he is  set for quite some time because you can get many weeks of protection from each stick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred an antiperspirant to a deodorant mostly because I dislike most deodorant scents, but something in the antiperspirants react with either heat or sweat and stains the pit in my shirts.</li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my body chemistry effecting the smell of what I am putting on me.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered two more a couple months ago, but it turned out I was able to crank it out one more</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>, I read the alum concerns and the molecular responses and am satisfied with the safety of the product.</li>
      <li>Strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He said it took the first couple of days of use to get this deodorant working at full effectiveness, but that since then he has been very pleased with the protection it gives him.  </li>
      <li>Ok I&#x27;m trying to be positive but....</li>
      <li>I was surprised as to how amazing this type of deodorant is.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>He applies it after his morning shower, then is good until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I needed oil free products &amp; I really like this.  </li>
      <li>I now rarely perspire under my arms</li>
      <li>On super hot days</li>
      <li>I use it right after I get out the shower.</li>
      <li>Thank you for offering these, I will absolutely be a repeat customer!</li>
      <li>where she&#x27;s had the chance to get hot and sweaty</li>
      <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants in the last couple years.  </li>
      <li>My soon-to-be 8 yr old daughter got where when she gets hot, she gets stinky!!</li>
      <li>These used to be relatively easy to find in drug stores, but have apparently been taken off the shelves.  </li>
      <li>Okay...I was a little hesitant to try this, but I am so glad that I did!</li>
      <li>Sometimes when I wear a certain fabric I still smell but the majority of the time, I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Just too much money for me to spend on a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole family uses them.</li>
      <li>Hopefully once we get into the full heat of the summer it&#x27;ll be the same story!</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m still working on the original stick, so it lasts a really long time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I had tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and they just didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth when wet.</li>
      <li>I have not broken out or developed any type of rash.</li>
      <li>I tried to use Tom&#x27;s in multiple scents, and I just end up stinking right through it after 2 or 3 hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, so maybe it works better for me, but since abandoning the conventional deoderants, this became my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;!  </li>
      <li>I recently bought one for each of my family members and up to now, they are quite happy with the results, especially the no white residue on dark shirts.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that has consistently worked.  </li>
      <li>but SO FAR</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a complete year, so I have been through all of the seasons.  </li>
      <li>It did take my body a couple weeks to get used to it and start working properly because I was &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; (for a lack of better word) from my previous commercial gel antiperspirant deodorant.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve only had a couple days so far</li>
      <li>I perspire a lot &amp; work outside &amp; this deodorant really keeps me Dry.</li>

<li> I thought it was almost empty</li>
<li> or if I just need some &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34;, I have mixed a solution of 1/4 alcohol, 3/4 water and a few drops of essential oils in a small spray bottle.</li>
<li> /&gt;You do have to keep relatively clean-shaven in my experience - no more than about a week or so of growth.  </li>

<li> I purchased this for the husband of the administrator of the condominium where I live in the Dominican Republic because is unable to buy the product here.</li>
<li> They eliminate all everyday odor.</li>
<li> I could be on a commercial for it, seriously!</li>
<li> The second one is working just as difficult, but I am making it work.  </li>
<li> I still could smell myself periodically throughout the day and that was just not okay with me.</li>
<li> Was not effective for me.</li>
<li> My one caution is to be careful when using it so that the crystal doesn&#x27;t drop or it will break and then become somewhat awkward to use.</li>
<li> My armpits are very sensitive and I usually end up breaking out or getting these horrible lumps under my arms from using stick deodorants.</li>
<li> I might as well use nothing :-(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it every day and have purchased this product for friends and family. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Strong. Dependable. Long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product it&#x27;s nothing like it says I recommended not to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Got a skin rash from it. Likely a reaction to the salt. Wanted to love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred an antiperspirant to a deodorant mostly because I dislike most deodorant scents, but something in the antiperspirants react with either heat or sweat and stains the pit in my shirts. The Crystal rock/stick does a great job eliminating the musty sweat smell and is easy on the shirts. After about a month of use it appears that it will last a long time and save me money. I also bought the travel size that is a size difficult to find to fit my smallish travel kit. I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I read the alum concerns and the molecular responses and am satisfied with the safety of the product.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER go back to regular deodorant again! I have thrown away countless shirts because of the waxy deodorant build up in the underarms of my shirts. The Crystal solved that problem. I also feel like I sweat less. On super hot days or if I just need some &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34;, I have mixed a solution of 1/4 alcohol, 3/4 water and a few drops of essential oils in a small spray bottle. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, so maybe it works better for me, but since abandoning the conventional deoderants, this became my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I tell everyone about it. I could be on a commercial for it, seriously! Love it!!</li>
    <li> These sticks are amazing. The whole family uses them. They eliminate all everyday odor. And you can rest assured you&#x27;re not polluting yours or your loved ones bodies</li>
    <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants in the last couple years.  This is the only one that has consistently worked.  It did take my body a couple weeks to get used to it and start working properly because I was &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; (for a lack of better word) from my previous commercial gel antiperspirant deodorant.  This is actually my second purchase of this product.  Each stick this size lasts about a year or so.  I&#x27;ve actually been using this same one for a year and 8 months.  I thought it was almost empty so I ordered two more a couple months ago, but it turned out I was able to crank it out one more notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to keep relatively clean-shaven in my experience - no more than about a week or so of growth.  I shower daily and apply it immediately after.</li>
    <li> Was not effective for me.</li>
    <li> I needed oil free products &amp; I really like this.  I perspire a lot &amp; work outside &amp; this deodorant really keeps me Dry.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.... may work for someone else though !</li>
    <li> It was as I ordered. Having no fragrance is perfect.</li>
    <li> The deodorant is great, the holder is terrible.  One of them I used for two weeks and the turner was stuck and it cracked.  The stick fell out and shattered.  The second one is working just as difficult, but I am making it work.  Just too much money for me to spend on a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.....</li>
    <li> Sometimes it will take a couple of days for the deodorant to get rid of the bacteria before it works. But it works, that&#x27;s all you need to know!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good reviews on this product.....bought a two pack so that my daughter could have one too.</li>
    <li> These used to be relatively easy to find in drug stores, but have apparently been taken off the shelves.  Thank you for offering these, I will absolutely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Love this! I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my body chemistry effecting the smell of what I am putting on me.</li>
    <li> great value. great product.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m trying to be positive but....I have been using this for two weeks and I have NO effect on underarm odor or the irritated skin under my arms. I might as well use nothing :-(</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product and I have been using it for apporximately six months, and I have to say that for me it has been 100% effective. I recently bought one for each of my family members and up to now, they are quite happy with the results, especially the no white residue on dark shirts. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> its weird, straight up. nope.</li>
    <li> My soon-to-be 8 yr old daughter got where when she gets hot, she gets stinky!! I didn&#x27;t want to use regular &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; deoderant on her. A friend of mine recommended this product and I&#x27;m sooo glad she did!! We&#x27;ve only had a couple days so far where she&#x27;s had the chance to get hot and sweaty but SO FAR SO GOOD!! Not even a tiny bit of smell!! Hopefully once we get into the full heat of the summer it&#x27;ll be the same story!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Sometimes when I wear a certain fabric I still smell but the majority of the time, I don&#x27;t. Goes on smooth when wet.</li>
    <li> Okay...I was a little hesitant to try this, but I am so glad that I did! I had tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and they just didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked.  I still could smell myself periodically throughout the day and that was just not okay with me. I have been using this for a complete year, so I have been through all of the seasons.  Even in the 100+ degree summer it has been great.  I&#x27;ve only smelled myself once and it was the night I forgot to put it on after my shower.  So, I do recommend putting it on after showering, even if you shower at night.  It basically has no smell...at all. And, I&#x27;m still working on the original stick, so it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I tried to use Tom&#x27;s in multiple scents, and I just end up stinking right through it after 2 or 3 hours. This stuff is great. The only downside is that you have to wet your armpit before use, and honestly that&#x27;s inconvenient for me lol. BUT, Crystal also makes spray on deodorant, which is now one of my favorites. I DO NOT stink through these which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Nothing worked for me until I discovered this product many years ago.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. My armpits are very sensitive and I usually end up breaking out or getting these horrible lumps under my arms from using stick deodorants. The Crystal works great for me! I have not broken out or developed any type of rash. I now rarely perspire under my arms and when I do, there is no odor. The crystal lasts for months and months and there is never any residue. I use it right after I get out the shower. My one caution is to be careful when using it so that the crystal doesn&#x27;t drop or it will break and then become somewhat awkward to use. I will never use another type of deodorant again!</li>
    <li> I was surprised as to how amazing this type of deodorant is.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the husband of the administrator of the condominium where I live in the Dominican Republic because is unable to buy the product here. He is a school district administrator and his job requires him to interact with people most of his work day, so deodorant protection is very important to him in this tropical(hot and humid)environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone renting one of the apartments got him started with this product by giving him one of these deodorant sticks.  It worked so well for him that now he does not want to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said it took the first couple of days of use to get this deodorant working at full effectiveness, but that since then he has been very pleased with the protection it gives him.  He applies it after his morning shower, then is good until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order was for 4 sticks, so he is  set for quite some time because you can get many weeks of protection from each stick.</li>
