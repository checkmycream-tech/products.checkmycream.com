      <li>Arrived in good shape and is the genuine product.</li>

      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Used all kinds, but Trac II is simply the best by all criteria.  </li>
      <li>II.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trac II blades I received were made in Poland; most of Gillette&#x27;s blades are made in Eastern Europe now and has not reduced the quality of these historically famous blades.</li>
      <li>Great to see that there is a place to get the old reliable and cost effective Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glad to be able to buy them.</li>
      <li>Anyway; love these blades and love the Trac</li>
      <li>My favorite, but</li>
      <li>These have been a favorite of mine for many years</li>
      <li>This was a better deal than we could find anywhere price-wise and the price beat grocery stores and Walmart (when they carried them).  </li>
      <li>My husband is glad he can buy these replacement blades for his razor.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it has some respectable conditioners in there too.</li>
      <li>What more could anyone want?</li>
      <li>The refills arrived timely, well-packaged and safely.  </li>
      <li>Why are more words required in my response?</li>
      <li>have been using this product for years, Have always enjoyed</li>
      <li>glad to find these blades since my husband loves the handle.  </li>
      <li>but I have found, over many years, that the Two Blade razor gives me the shave that I require.</li>
      <li>Have used the is product for more than 20 years.</li>
      <li>These blades, IMHO, aren&#x27;t any better than the Personna Twin Pivot Plus blades.</li>
      <li>Only Gillette blades can be relied on to work in my Trac II razor; Works great!</li>
      <li>too many men using electric razors.  </li>
      <li>Razors are more then they should be</li>
      <li>From here on out will go with the cheapest and replace more (?) often.</li>
      <li>I believe the Trac II Plus razor blades are simply the best razor blades you can buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Trac II for about 40 years...still love it.</li>
      <li>Keep making them available and I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
      <li>Great and fast service</li>
      <li>It seems that 2 blades work better than 5 blades or even 3 blades.</li>
      <li>but gillette thought I needed a better razor and stopped makeing these blades.</li>
      <li>Just glad that I can still get these at Amazon, because I can&#x27;t find them in a store.  </li>

      <li>It would be nice if they can offer the original razor handle too.  </li>
      <li>Nice original blades.  </li>
      <li>I started useing these blades when they first came out and today the newer ones are not as good as these.</li>
      <li>They work pretty good</li>
      <li>Exactly as described at a fair price and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>Cost more but way better than the cheap Personas (which I will use up now on an accelerated schedule).  </li>
      <li>Just fine: better than 1 blade &amp; all</li>
      <li>They keep me clean as a whistle!</li>
      <li>My husband ordered these - they fit his razor and he is pleased with his purchase</li>
      <li>I found unless you have a top quality blade in a DE razor, you do not get a smooth close shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that they are still available here.</li>
      <li>I am glad these are still available.  </li>
      <li>They tend to pull more and are not as smooth.</li>
      <li>good price and fast delivery</li>
      <li>Having been using TracII Plus for many years for a clean shave.</li>
      <li>SO EASY TO BUY ONLINE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These have been a favorite of mine for many years and I will continue to use them, until they no longer available. This is personal preference only, but would recommend!</li>
    <li> merchandise received in good condition</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll take these blades anytime over an Electric Razor</li>
    <li> I bought Gillette Trac ll Plus shaving cartridges for my husband.  He&#x27;s been using them for over 10 years and he loves them.</li>
    <li> The husband swears by these nearly impossible to find replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> My husband still uses a Gillette Trac II razor and these refills are getting harder and harder to find as the new razors take their place.  This was a better deal than we could find anywhere price-wise and the price beat grocery stores and Walmart (when they carried them).  The refills arrived timely, well-packaged and safely.  I would definitely recommend product and Seller!</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought these razor blades from Amazon is because I am too lazy to go up to the drug store where I may or may find what I am looking for. Have you ever noticed how a new razor will be introduced; the accompanying blades may have the company name on the package; but never the product specific name. It took me awhile to find the blades that went with an old razor I had. The blades are fine but having these delivered to my door step was the best.</li>
    <li> My husband is glad he can buy these replacement blades for his razor.  Amazon is the only place he can find them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product in Brazil for a long time and I finally was able to find it at your site. I have been using this product this the first days of it&#x27;s sale in the market.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband loves his 2 blade razor blades.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  They are Trac II blades.  Seem fine--we were just delighted to find some as they are hard to find in stores and hubby doesn&#x27;t want to change his blades.</li>
    <li> OK, so I am an old timer.  Common instinct says to buy the cheapest but I keep thinking these have to be the best.  From here on out will go with the cheapest and replace more (?) often.</li>
    <li> Very happy with price and quality.</li>
    <li> My husband use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> It is hard to load. It is so hard even though it gives a pretty good shave , I simply do not use it. I would never recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice original blades.  Cheaper than the new zillion blade heads</li>
    <li> The only reason they make blades with more than two edges is because of marketing. In my opinion, two blades with the  lubricating strip like these cartridges have provide a smooth shave with minimal effort. These blades normally last me about two weeks. These are also getting harder and harder to find locally. Hope the are not going to be discontinued!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Trac II for about 40 years...still love it. I&#x27;ll probably continue using it forever. I&#x27;m just hoping they don&#x27;t ever discontinue making it.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. The lubricating strip dries out after 2-3 uses but I didn&#x27;t necessary want that feature anyway. If you use it as a one time deal or for traveling light it&#x27;d be great. Basically allows one to dry shave without actually &amp;quot;dry&amp;quot; shaving. Blades stay sharp for several uses and are perfect for those on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> I am glad these are still available.  I tried the 5 blade replacement and it just didn&#x27;t do the job and was a lot more expensive.  Glad to be able to buy them.</li>
    <li> I had to write a review about these blades and my new shaving experience because for the first time in 10 years I can actually shave again without worrying about my face breaking out or getting razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 years old and in my profession I meet with people daily, so my appearance is very important. I have tried so many different shaving techniques from different blades, creams, washing, exfoliating, etc. With no success and my face constantly getting irritated and broken out the day after shaving, I actually stopped using blades and switched to an electric shaver. This did not work for me either, it also irritated my skin, so I finally called it quits assuming my skin was just going to breakout and get razor burn no matter what. I then went to a trimmer and sported a stubble for almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more background, I have sufferred from adult acne and have tried all kinds of treatments from pills, creams, different washes, etc. With not success and much money thrown away to a dermotologist. About 3 months ago, I decided to google adult acne and do some research, when I came to a youtube video which recommended Acne.org and their treatment. I visited Acne.org and thought I will give it a try, and they also had a guide for SHAVING! Here is the link: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where I came across these blades and a guide to shaving. I have been using their system and products for acne as well as these blades and using only my face wash to shave my face for the past 3 months and WOW! I can finally shave again with smooth non-irritated skin and my acne is gone as well, I could not be happier and I hope this helps others out there that have had the same issues.</li>
    <li> I believe the Trac II Plus razor blades are simply the best razor blades you can buy. I went back to a double edge razor recently. I found unless you have a top quality blade in a DE razor, you do not get a smooth close shave. With a Trac II blade, you can count on a smooth, slick, close shave everytime. It seems that 2 blades work better than 5 blades or even 3 blades. When Gillette made the Trac II razor blades they made perfection. They still sell  razors for these today.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered quickly and described accurately.</li>
    <li> If you want to avoid the 3, 4 or 5 blade nonsense that exists today, get these. I&#x27;m glad that they are still available here.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 55 years.  Used all kinds, but Trac II is simply the best by all criteria.  Gillette and the stores only want to sell silly fad razors now.</li>
    <li> I started useing these blades when they first came out and today the newer ones are not as good as these.Also not as expensive.</li>
    <li> The subscription program really saves money. We can&#x27;t get Trac II blades locally at an affordable price anymore, only the four and five blade razor systems which I detest.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the greatest razor blade ever made by Gillette and the best value for its efficiency.  You see, I hate using shaving cream, because it is messy and I am lazy.  This is the only razor blade with which I can shave without using any shaving cream (that is why I prefer the one with lubricating strip).  Any other razor blades, made by either Gilette or other companies, including the expensive ones like MACH III, will simply cut me. Then Gillette stopped making them, with no reason whatsoever, probably it worked too well, like the light bulb that will last 100 years.  I complained to their customer service with no avail (they are really not a very customer responsive company)  My friend was smart, he bought a whole bunch from K-Mart when they went out of business.  I used to be able to buy them in local flea markets but lately they all but disappeared.  Therefore, I am simply grateful for Amazon.com to be able to make them available.  It would be nice if they can offer the original razor handle too.  I found the substituted one was just not up to par.  I had to pay $ 10 for an original razor handle, shipped from Canada.</li>
    <li> Amazon may be desperate for stimulus, but so are we.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll buy these at the grocery store for $25 instead.  They used to be less than $20 with S&amp;S, but some of the people who set the pricing here are idiots.</li>
    <li> Incredible value, without all the hassel of runing around reying to find the correct blades without all  the hassel.Thanks alot.</li>
    <li> I often try to buy new blades at a pharmacy or grocery store.  These are hard to find for some reason.  I enjoy the low cost and convenience of buying these through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Trac II blades are what we needed.  It&#x27;s a good value and I have no doubt that we will be ordering some more in the future.</li>
    <li> Blades are blades, the work</li>
    <li> They remain at the top of the list for sharp quality.</li>
    <li> Outstanding buy and excellent blades.</li>
    <li> I might be a little biased after 42 years of using these, but I have tried other razors, electric, triple-blade, etc., but, for me, these give me the nicest, closest, controlled shave. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not popular anymore, so the price has gone up considerably.</li>
    <li> These blades are getting hard to find locally, I like them and they work fine for me.I hope Gillette doesn&#x27;t discontinue them.</li>
    <li> My Trac II shavers just keep going and going. I must have had them for 20 years! As long as Gillette keeps making the refill cartridges and my shavers don&#x27;t break, I&#x27;ll keep buying them. They work great.</li>
    <li> they were not as the last I received from your listing. The sensor blade for Gillette is what I need.</li>
    <li> Great and fast service</li>
    <li> This definitely fit my needs.  I have been using this razor blade for over 10 years and it is getting more difficult to find them, so this was a definite plus for me.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses these and I put them on auto subscription.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these blades, they are not easy to find.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a razor and shaves you face (or whatever). Been using them for years and they do their job.&lt;br /&gt;Al</li>
    <li> I got charged for the blades, I don&#x27;t want them, I don&#x27;t know how to send them back, I want my refund, I thought I was buying the razor, but got blades, I am very disappointed, I will go elsewhere to buy a razor, but I do not need the blades, I want to return them and get my refund, Carlos M. Flores</li>
    <li> Had our razors for 45 years, Hard to find refills now.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and it is impossible to find in stores now.  I hope Gillette does not discontinue TrackIIPlus!  He has been using this product for years and finds it the best.</li>
    <li> Razors are more then they should be but these were reasonable and they get the job done, I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Hard to fine in stores...too many men using electric razors.  Hubby likes these for a clean, close shave.  Fast ship.</li>
    <li> Order then  on the subscribe  &amp; Save, always on schedule. Work like they should</li>
    <li> I thought it was pretty expensive. If it had been offered at a cheaper price it would have gained it a fifth star.</li>
    <li> Back to the future, less blades less cost, more savings.  Love the quality, and I get a good shave.  good price and fast delivery a plus. I would recommend this product to anyone tired of spending big money for other multi blade products.</li>
    <li> Great blades..  Hard to find for this old razor.</li>
    <li> These are sometimes hard to find in the shaving section of many stores. They are often sold in small packs (5 cartridges) and a really high price. These seem to be the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; - shave the same, last as long - sold in convenience quantities at a good price.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for years, Have always enjoyed the close shave&lt;br /&gt;I get with this blades. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. money lost! Don&#x27;t want many of such purchases. Just makes no sense. Won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these blades and the razor itself as well.  Don&#x27;t like all the fancy swivel heads.  Old dog wants old tricks.</li>
    <li> Razors are robbery. They work pretty good but I have been known to get a dull cartridge about every 20 used.&lt;br /&gt;Listen! get some Billy Jealously Shaving Gel and you will have a shave like never before. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but I can afford the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;The gel is unlike anything I have used before and it doesn&#x27;t take but a little to soap-up. Plus, it has some respectable conditioners in there too. If you get a bad blade you will know it instantly. These razors and Billy Jealousy gel. Done.</li>
    <li> It is as advertised. Arrived in good shape and is the genuine product. I have tried the 3 blade razors and weren&#x27;t happy. Sometimes you have to stick with what works.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just what The lady wanted for her old Trac II handle... who needs 5 or 6 blades to do a very fine job?!  By the way, part of the job is the weight of the handle.</li>
    <li> They work very well and are very gentle. I heard that fewer blades caused less irritation so I gave these a try. So far, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> There are so many razors with 3, 4 or 5 blades but all you need is 2 blades for a good shave!</li>
    <li> Hard to find this blade.  Having been using TracII Plus for many years for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Father in Law loves the blades for his OLD trusty razor.</li>
    <li> I have experimented with non-Gillette Track II Plus blades and came back to Gillette and will never try another. More expensive than the knockoffs, but they last longer and maintain a better shave. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Great to see that there is a place to get the old reliable and cost effective Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old reliable&#x27;s work and work better than what is on the market now.</li>
    <li> The blades, which I will continue to use, have two problems.  The price is exorbitant as far as I am concerned, and they don&#x27;t last very long because they clog easily with facial hair, and they don&#x27;t stay sharp very long.  I would think the problem gets worse the more blades you have on a cartridge, so I don&#x27;t go there. I get around the problem by not shaving very often.</li>
    <li> GII blades are unfortunately now getting hard to source (and Mercur seem impossible, more the worse). Exactly as described at a fair price and prompt delivery. Will no doubt buy more from the same seller if Mercur don&#x27;t become available again.</li>
    <li> Anyone that still has a tracII handle knows that it&#x27;s harder and harder to find the blades.  This package is an excellent value and will keep you in razors for a significant amount of time.  Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find original blades in local stores.  Works just fine.</li>
    <li> This was the first razor I had and after trying other fancier options, I still come back to it. I have a beard which requires the shaving of my neck, cheeks, and the areas on the left and right side below my bottom lip. While the razor is smooth on the broad areas, it really outdoes every razor ive tried at the areas where beard meets clean. With two blades, the Trac 2 has enough power to actually shave, but isn&#x27;t cumbersome like razors with 3, 4 and 5 blades. The single \\&quot;shaping\\&quot; blade present on some razors do not stand up either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the blades are pretty cheap and last decently well.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the in stores</li>
    <li> It is the best razor blade ever made. Happy we could get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> good old standby...who needs 5 blades...two work just fine...</li>
    <li> What can I say?  They are Gillete blades.  Probably the best.  These Trac II are difficult to find so this is a deal!</li>
    <li> Price  is best received.  was readily available and received in record number of days. Have used the is product for more than 20 years.</li>
    <li> glad to find these blades since my husband loves the handle.  It is small and compact which the newer models are not.  Cannot buy in any stores in our area.</li>
    <li> Cheaper at Amazon.com than dept. stores, same quality.</li>
    <li> hubby had searched for these blades everywhere and we finally found them here, thank goodness .... he didn&#x27;t want new razor, loved the one he had lol</li>
    <li> Still glad to be able to get these blades even if they are a 70&#x27;s throw back.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re Gillette TracII razors and they work. I can&#x27;t think of anything else to say.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them in the local drug store any more (my razor is 40+ years old)....got &#x27;em on AMZN for a great price and quick delivery. Bought the two pack because I don&#x27;t know when these blades will just not be produced or available anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for quite a while and in my opinion, these are the finest blades on the market. You will need to buy a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock razor to go with the blades.</li>
    <li> The TracII debuted in 1971 and was the first 2 blade razor. I&#x27;ve been using the Trac II since I started shaving, about 30 or so years ago. I&#x27;ve used every other razor there is--and there are other razors that do shave a little closer--but not for the cost of the Trac II. That&#x27;s why it still exists after 40 years.  I&#x27;ve also tried imitations of the TracII (Personna, Walgreens, etc.), but none measure up. They tend to pull more and are not as smooth. But some seem to work for some people and they may work for you and could save you money. You just have to try them.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Just as described and expected.  Been using for years.</li>
    <li> Keep  producing them, please!!</li>
    <li> Beats trying to find them at the store.</li>
    <li> My husband has had many razors over the years, but he likes this one best.  Walmart&#x27;s website said they had them in my local store, but when I went looking I could not find this Gillette product, and didn&#x27;t get a help trying to find in the store.  I tried ordering from Walmart and still couldn&#x27;t get them.  Walmart suggested I look in stores in neighboring cities to find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Pack of 2 with 10 blades each.  Since I ordered with other items I had free shipping, making these blades cheaper than if I could have ordered through Walmart. and maybe even cheaper if I had been able to find them locally.  I will reorder through Amazon the next time my husband needs them.</li>
    <li> great product--have used it for many years, but difficult to find in stores</li>
    <li> Good blades.  My favorite, but I can&#x27;t seem to find them in our local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Not as good as original product. not likely to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Trac blades for a very long time.  Put simply, the blades work for me!!!</li>
    <li> 2 blade razors are the least irritating. And the Trac II is the best 2 blade razor. It happens to be the first ever made back in the 70s and they got it right on the first try. Look no further.</li>
    <li> I have a Trac II razor and I love it but gillette thought I needed a better razor and stopped makeing these blades. I can shave for 60 times, (2 months) with each blade and they are not expensive. So i have to look for these blades wherever I can get them. Big mistake for Gillette.</li>
    <li> SO EASY TO BUY ONLINE. SAME PRODUCT I HAVE USED, KNOWN AND LOVED FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;THANK GOD THEY&#x27;RE STILL AROUND. SHIPS SUPER FAST.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his old razor but the blades are hard to find and often very pricey.  Be sure to look for the best price here too as some are not so good.</li>
    <li> Only Gillette blades can be relied on to work in my Trac II razor; Works great! Why are more words required in my response?</li>
    <li> It arrived on the day it was promised. Will do business with them again. Best shave ever. No clogs, smooth shave. Will definitely recommend. Bought it again, super fast delivery. Still a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Good quality, but found identical TracII Plus on military base less than half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my TRAC II razors for 30 years.  It&#x27;s ridiculous how expensive the replacement cartridges are.  But, they are high everywhere. So, thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> I have not found these available anywhere lately except on the internet.  Thank you for a clean shave again ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kent</li>
    <li> These blades work as good as the packs I bought locally, but the price is much better.</li>
    <li> Your star rating is not explained - we are very  satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades since they came out, and find them very satisfactory, and much more economical than any of the new products. I would recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
    <li> been using these blades for years, price is fair</li>
    <li> After all these years, the Gillette Trac II Plus blades still work well on my scalp and face. Occasionally, I break out my dad&#x27;s Merkur just to stay in practice, but the Trac II is fine for my daily needs.</li>
    <li> I have an old razor and like the shaves I get.  But blades are getting hard to find.  Amazon to the rescue!  I will continue to use as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> Very good. It is a good razor.</li>
    <li> Locally, I can only find &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; blades so I look like I just gave blood every morning. These were great to find and a world of difference for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Even though these blades are made in Poland, they work better than any other Gillette razor blades.  I think Gillette made a big mistake in not making these razors in the USA.</li>
    <li> Gillette Trac II Plus is not as popular as they once were and local stores have adjusted their inventory with the change in consumer tastes. I&#x27;ve liked the razor handle for the past 35+ years and am unwilling to give it up. The clone brands vary all over the map so I&#x27;m sticking to the Trac II Plus for the comfort of consistency and constancy in product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a significant price increase since the last time I ordered this product from amazon.  It is my contention that profit margins for all shaving products are unreasonable, and we have little choice in the matter.  The chinese made ones are not as good, and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Found the Old Style Razor blades quite acceptable to scrape the old style face off. They keep me clean as a whistle!</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades since the late 60&#x27;s and will use them forever.  They are sharp and smooth and last a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these - they fit his razor and he is pleased with his purchase</li>
    <li> Cost more but way better than the cheap Personas (which I will use up now on an accelerated schedule).  They are sharper to start (no rough burr to scrape off with the first shave like Personas and others) and they remain sharper with subsequent shaves.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cost to me; I enjoy each shave a little more, especially when I think of all the electric scubber shaves and silly high-cost, 6-blade, multi-blade shaves that can&#x27;t compare.  You&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> These are my blades.  I cannot always buy them locally.  Thank you</li>
    <li> My father doesn&#x27;t like how new razors have pivoting heads, so I bought him one of his old trac II razors.  I don&#x27;t think he liked the shave quite as much as he remembered, but mostly because the handle for it is pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> Ah, happy to be able to get this regularly through subscribe and save. Now I don&#x27;t have to go looking for it and worry it&#x27;s not in stock. This is the only blade that doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These blades are perfect fit for my very old razor.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette also has an updated version of this blade that DOES NOT FIT THE OLDER RAZORS.  Unfortunately, Gillette uses the same product I.D. for both the &#x27;new&#x27; and the &#x27;old&#x27; blades.&lt;br /&gt;So be careful when ordering if you have an &#x27;older&#x27; razor.  Examine the picture of the product package carefully and look for the words Cartridges/Cartouches/Cartuchos on the lower right of the package.  On the back of the package it also says that they are &amp;#34;made in Poland&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Gillette for  years has been my families vendor for men&#x27;s facial products. Excellent products and value. I would recommend this product highly. JM</li>
    <li> its exactly what I expected, what can you expect from razor blades, I bought razors that I needed and there it is!</li>
    <li> I have used Trac II razors for years and was initially well satisfied.  Recent purchases seem to me to have lost their edge figuratively and realistically.  With the advent of newer and multiple bladed cartridges I wonder if Gillette is trying to wean the customer from the old Trac II to newer and more expensive cartridges!</li>
    <li> What fear? The fear that these cartridges will cease to be available and I will have to buy one of the newer razors, which I very much dislike. Why dislike? Because the angle of the shaving head is very different and does not allow me to shave in the tight angles on my face. Yes, I have tried several, with their four, five or six blades, etc. They do not work well for me, simply because of the angle of the shaving head. These Trac II blades are just fine - for as long as I can keep buying them, anyway.</li>
    <li> These are good blades but, still not close enough in all areas of the neck. I have to apply more force to get a clean shave in those areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these forever and like them so much better than all the new products! Keep making them available and I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this was a \\&quot;Trac II razor\\&quot; plus 10 blades.  Only when it arrived did I learn that it was 10 \\&quot;Trac II Plus\\&quot; blades.  The blades look factory made and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be happy when the actual razor gets here.</li>
    <li> They are doing their best to phase this style out.  Don&#x27;t understand why, because it&#x27;s the best there is.  These blades last me at least a week each, and I have a tough beard.  Why do they think they have to keep fiddling with the design?  Do I hear their cash register ringing on this?  Hey.......... if it ain&#x27;t broke, DON&#x27;T FIX IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Just fine: better than 1 blade &amp; all that&#x27;s necessary</li>
    <li> This is what gives me a close shave and this is the blade I am comfortable with. Hard to find in stores and this way to purchase them is more affordable</li>
    <li> (UPDATE: First; I&#x27;ve done a comparison for my own use and find that the Trac II blades out perform my D/E razor as well as a 3 and 4 blade razor I recently tried.  In short; no other razor blade comes close to giving me the shave that the Gillette Trac II does and I&#x27;m done experimenting: Sticking with the Trac II.  Glade Gillette has resumed production of this razor and blade and is importing it to the U.S. from their St. Petersberg Russia Gillette plant.&lt;br /&gt;Next: I have a theory... Remember when we older Trac II people used to complain that the twin blades would clog? What I&#x27;m finding is when I used shaving soap and brush; either shaving soap in a mug or shaving soap in a tube or a shaving stick, the Trac II blades never clog.  I can swish the razor&#x27;s head in my sink of water and the blades come out clean every time with no effort.  When I used a can of foam and also gel shaving cream the twin blades clogged. They clogged worse with the canned foam than the gel.  The gel was easier to rinse out with full power water coming from the sinks tap; but clogged all the same. With canned foam (like Barbersol and Gillette Foamy) the twin blades clogged like they used to. I&#x27;m wondering if the CBC&#x27;s and Silicone in the foam form a glue like substance and bond the beard stubble together and glue the clump to the blades...?  But with brush and mug soap or tube or stick soap never a clog and also the blades seem to last longer; from 6 shaves per blade to 8-9.  I change my blades early as I&#x27;m picky about the quality of my shave and have sensitive, nick-cut-and-irritation prone skin so if not for that I might get 10+ shaves with the blades. Just a thought so if you have a problem with twin blades clogging try switching to a brush and mug or stick or tube shave cream and see if that helps.  IN FACT I remember in the mid 1970&#x27;s the shaving brush and mug came back into popularity and I wonder if that&#x27;s not why...?  Anyway; love these blades and love the Trac II.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trac II blades I received were made in Poland; most of Gillette&#x27;s blades are made in Eastern Europe now and has not reduced the quality of these historically famous blades. I haven&#x27;t shaved with a Gillette Trac II blade since the late 1970&#x27;s because of the price increase and switched to drug store versions and thought &#x27;why not?&#x27; when I saw these at a good price. Still the best. So far my favorite twin blade cartridge blade is the Supermax S-II blades as they are incredibly sharp, smooth shaving and long lasting (about 8 - 10 shaves per blade for me) and dirt cheap, made in India.  But my first shave the the original shocked me. There&#x27;s no comparison between the real thing and the aftermarket copies.  The Gillette is the smoothest, perhaps the sharpest of the bunch I&#x27;ve used and as in the past, a two-way shave with a few minor touch-ups and no razor burn.  Now in all honestly; I have sensitive skin and get really bad razor burn so my definition of &#x27;razor burn&#x27; is a little different. If after I apply some Lubraderm the skin cools down and the redness goes away within a few minutes I count that as &#x27;no razor burn&#x27;; as opposed to having a raw face that actually is painful to the touch and aches all day like with a D/E razor.  So no razor comes close in comfort as compared to the Schick Hydro 3 I use on &#x27;bad face days&#x27;; but I don&#x27;t expect it to. But I will say the Gillette Trac II comes in a close second to the Schick Hydro 3 and beats it hands down for not leaving any stubble or stray hairs. The Hydro does miss some beard no matter how many times I go back for touch-up and the Trac II gets it all down to &#x27;baby butt smooth&#x27; every time.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these blades are beyond debate; they are the best of the twin blade cartridges hands down. The only competition the Gillette Trac II ever really had were the Schick Super II adjustable and the Schick Ultrex as both were stainless steel with both platinum and Teflon coating. Otherwise now the only blades that come close arethe Supermax S-II&#x27;s and not a tie by any means as touch-up&#x27;s will result in razor burn every time.&lt;br /&gt;But as good as these Gillette originals are it&#x27;s the price that will send me back to the Supermax blades or looking for Schick Super II&#x27;s online somewhere. They are mass produced overseas and by today&#x27;s standards &#x27;old tech&#x27; and there&#x27;s no reason to price them as high as they do. You&#x27;d think the amount of competition with the hundreds of aftermarket choices would have an effect; but it doesn&#x27;t.  My third choice would be Personna&#x27;s version (American made, very sharp but not smooth at all) but usually leaves me with &#x27;raw-face&#x27; when done. I end up having to use the Hydro for a couple of days. I use traditional prep before every shave so I know my beard is ready for a shave; hence it has to be the blade. In the end the Gillette is still the best and I might stop quibbling over the difference in pennies and except that Gillette knows what it&#x27;s got and in this case you really do get what you pay for: Best twin blade cartridge made. Ever. (unless Schick makes a come-back with the Super II and we all know that&#x27;s never going to happen:) I&#x27;ll go back to paying a little more for this blade now that I&#x27;ve experienced how big a difference there is.the Supermax S-II&#x27;s and not a tie by any means as touch-up&#x27;s will result in razor burn every time.&lt;br /&gt;But as good as these Gillette originals are it&#x27;s the price that will send me back to the Supermax blades or looking for Schick Super II&#x27;s online somewhere.

    <li> Just like the ones you use to be able to find in the store, and,&lt;br /&gt;still expensive.</li>
    <li> Blades are excellent, as usual, and arrived quickly.  What more could anyone want?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find any where elese</li>
    <li> Good, quality product.</li>
    <li> good product and good service on delivery</li>
    <li> This product has been superceeded by a Three Blade razor but I have found, over many years, that the Two Blade razor gives me the shave that I require.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor blades, packed well, sent quick, and cheaper than I can get them locally, when I can find the . . . which isn&#x27;t often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Work!</li>
    <li> Yup, these razors have been around for 20+ years I suppose.  They now have 3 and 4 blade razors.  Most tilt and have other features.  Call me old school, but I prefer the simple Trac II.  It shaves my beard and does a great job.  What more would I want.  Just glad that I can still get these at Amazon, because I can&#x27;t find them in a store.  They were reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> These blades are not as good as some people say it is. at least not to me it is not.</li>
    <li> Genuine Gillete razor blades always perform best. These are no exception. They&#x27;re expensive but they out perform competitors including Shick.</li>
    <li> It has a tare mode, And appears to be quite accurate. If you are monitoring portions, this is the scale for you.</li>
    <li> For some reason this product is hard to find, almost impossible to find (!!) in most stores, and the price has gone through the roof in recent years.  I guess Gilette wants everyone to buy their newer razors, but you can&#x27;t beat the old reliable Trac II.</li>
    <li> I have an old-fashioned shaving setup, with a brush and soapdish.  The razor only fits Trac IIs, and they are harder to find than chickens&#x27; teeth.  Gillette stopped making these here, so these are made in Poland, and sourced through Canada, if my info is correct.  They&#x27;re fine blades, if you use these.</li>
    <li> I know I paid a ridiculous price for these.  But can&#x27;t find them anywhere as Gillette and Schick keep pumping out fancier and fancier razors that simply don&#x27;t work as well as this little engine that could.  I use Noxema and then shave cream, shave with one of the fancy razors, then use TracII to clean up.  A winner.</li>
    <li> Arrived as anticipated and is our razors of choice</li>
    <li> These blades, IMHO, aren&#x27;t any better than the Personna Twin Pivot Plus blades. However, for more or less the same money and reasons that may be nostalgic why not use the Gillette blades? Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I&#x27;ll buy &#x27;em as long as their available.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find these razors for my husband. Thanks for carrying them!</li>
    <li> my husband loves these but they are hard to find</li>
    <li> Nothing like Gillette TracII+ I&#x27;ll not ever know why they were Discontinued. But I suppose all good things come to a end. This was purchased for a present &amp; was well accepted because of the rarity of the item at least in this part of the country. The cutting edge of the blades are wonderfully smooth to the face.</li>
    <li> I have a Gillette TracII handle that was my father&#x27;s from the 70&#x27;s.  I still use it.  To me cuttin&#x27; whiskers is cuttin&#x27; whiskers.  My wife bought me one of those newer multi-blade razors a few years ago.  I use it too, and to be honest it does shave closer than my 40 year old TracII.  However, and this is a big HOWEVER, the more lblades they add, the wider the blade assembly gets.  With 4 or 5 blades its like scraping a chalk board eraser across my face.  I struggle and just can&#x27;t cut the whiskers in the nooks and crannies of my face (like that little indent where your nose meets your upper lip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I panicked when I went to the supermarket to pick up some replacement blades for the TracII and the folks said that they aren&#x27;t carrying them anymore.  HuH??  \\&quot;Discontinued\\&quot; they said.  In shock and panic I searched online and of course Amazon has an upteen-zillion, so I bought a couple year&#x27;s supply.  Stop back &#x27;round these parts in a couple years and we&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m doin&#x27; when my supply runs out.</li>
