      <li>Great fun for summer &amp; kids. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome and an amazing low price.</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply and great quality.</li>
      <li>Nicely pre-mixed paste that is easy to apply and use.</li>
      <li>It was very light and already fading, even after I put spray on the henna paste so it would have more time to stain the skin.</li>
      <li>Shipping was relatively okay.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely satisfied with this product and will buy again.</li>
      <li>So much better than buying a kit from michaels.</li>
      <li>We were so pleased with the quality and color of this product.</li>
      <li>I cant wait to buy more of this product.  </li>
      <li>Great product at a good price--I would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>overall, I am very happy!</li>
      <li>When I saw that you got twelve tubes in this package I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the quality.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>No, it is FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>You might think, “I can get it cheaper” but CHEAP is what you’ll be getting… I so Recommend this!</li>
      <li>Safe to say...</li>
      <li>Ive seen n tried way better henna</li>
      <li>They loved it since most people don&#x27;t buy henna regularly so it was a great novelty gift.</li>
      <li>Granted, I have only drawn on my hands, and can update when I decide to draw somewhere with thicker skin, but I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
      <li>we&#x27;re all in love.</li>
      <li>The kit includes everything you need to mix authentic henna as well as some transfer stencils to get you started with designs if you aren&#x27;t artistically inclined.</li>
      <li>so I can always redo it! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review for the time it takes the henna to fade out :)</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty good value, and will do many designs.</li>
      <li>but overall it left a good orange colored stain and lasted for a good amount of time which is awesome.</li>
      <li>That being said be aware that whatever you put on will be on your skin for weeks to come so it would be good to plan ahead and not put them on if you plan on going to a place you don&#x27;t want to be showing off your art.</li>
      <li>way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the color is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best henna ever, nothing like the mix-it-yourself stuff, but it&#x27;s great for those who want no-fuss henna that lasts awhile and still leaves a pretty dark stain.</li>
      <li>you can take it out and that hole itself is pretty good for intricate patterns.</li>
      <li>Now I have 3 dozen tubes of the same kind!!</li>
      <li>Fine for parties or just playing around, but not a high quality product with good color or great texture.  </li>
      <li>Good quality henna and pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the cones are really a nice solution to sharing the fun of henna tattoos with a group.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This henna started off as light orange the first day I put it on but after about two to three days it had darkened to a rich dark brown. I put tea tree oil on the henna art when I first cracked off the paste so the tattoo would be a bit water resistant. I think even with out the oil this henna would have lasted a LONG time. The henna tattoo I put on the top of my foot stayed for three weeks only fading in the last few day but still having a ghost of a design on my skin. That being said be aware that whatever you put on will be on your skin for weeks to come so it would be good to plan ahead and not put them on if you plan on going to a place you don&#x27;t want to be showing off your art. :) All in all it&#x27;s a very good product and I highly recommend it. Great fun for summer &amp; kids. :)</li>
    <li> When I used this henna it turned very dark brown and stayed for 1 and a half to 2 weeks. It&#x27;s awesome and an amazing low price. So much better than buying a kit from michaels. Awesome deal and I&#x27;m definitely buying more for the summer! So cute, love henna!!!!</li>
    <li> So when I ordered this I really though it would just be a few cones, I misread the title.my fault, but I receive 15 cones instead of 12, so I&#x27;m not even mad.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m only giving four stars though is because the consistency of it is a little to liquidy for my taste. and I know that&#x27;s a personal preference but that really is the only thing I&#x27;m not 100% happy about. Everything else though,I&#x27;m greatly please. Over all, I would recommend this to everyone who like to practice henna.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this henna paste, especially for the price.  Its stain seems to last the usual amount of time on my skin, and smells fine.  I like doing henna just for fun, and have not mastered nor do I enjoy mixing my own paste (I can&#x27;t seems to get a good consistency) or making my own cones.  I bought 15 of these cones and keep extras in the freezer.</li>
    <li> Okay, the description is a little off...The title says it&#x27;s a twelve pack of Henna Cones and that&#x27;s what it is, not the soap it talks about in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is learning to apply Henna and I found this great deal on Amazon!  She loves the cones (she was using the bottle before), you can snip the end to the size you need.  She has been spending time decorating herself, her brother, her sister, her friends and me!  What fun we are having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste goes on pretty well.  I think the only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get quite as dark as the stuff she mixed herself.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just received my henna cones, very quick shipping. But the brand was completely different, cones were red. I havent seen the finished results yet because it&#x27;s drying as I type. Hopefully it turns out nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I wasn&#x27;t the same one pictured, but it&#x27;s fine. It stains pretty darkly and stays on for a good week. Definitely getting this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered it I was a little bit worried about how they would really be. I got it, it worked great but it didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I thought it would but oh well! Still have more left so I can always redo it! :)</li>
    <li> I love these! I am absolutely satisfied with this product and will buy again. I even got three extra! :D&lt;br /&gt;I have read some reviews about the color being light, you have to leave the paste on at least an hour, to make it darker rub lemon on your skin, this insures that it will be dark, I hope I helped. :)  I promise you if you buy this product you will be happy!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and works wonderful.  Very satisfied with this product, and would buy from seller again!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s already pre-mixed in the tube and easy to apply, and lasts for days!!!</li>
    <li> my 9 year old daughter loves to do henna on her hands and mine. i have tried a few other options but this has been the best so far. the cones are great and comes with a little ball head pin at the end. you can take it out and that hole itself is pretty good for intricate patterns. or you can make the hole larger so younger hands can squeeze out patterns easily. henna inside is of the right consistency and stays so after opening and even after two months on the shelf! no heaving and hoeing with these tubes. will purchase again. i have seen something similar in indian stores too lately but this online purchase is convenient and good value for the money.</li>
    <li> All holiday break. They had friends over for New Years Even and polished off the rest of by decorating everyone there! Great product.</li>
    <li> Normally the henna I get is okay no matter where I buy it from, but this whole batch was bad. The paste was creamy and melty (even though I store my henna in a cold, dark, dry place) and it was really really light, even on the hands and feet (which are normally darkest). I did a test with three different ones from the 12 pack and they were all bad. The color hardly showed up and it faded within three days. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product from this company. I will not be purchasing from here again and taking that risk of getting a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she seemed to like it, iit seemed it was freshly made (very good). the delivery, however, it took the maximum to arrive. Although was hoping we&#x27;d get on Friday or even Sat, but no... she was happy with it. great for the value</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product. I have been tattooing myself and friends- we&#x27;re all in love. Super easy to apply and great quality. I would definitely buy again. Probably will when it all runs out!</li>
    <li> Cones are easy to use, because you just pull a pin out of the bottom instead of needing to cut the end of it. No problems with the henna, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Great stain, even when only left on for ten min *lol*. I was very pleasantly surprised. Will absolutely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this henna paste.  You don&#x27;t need to mix your own.  If you don&#x27;t use a whole tube, and it goes a long ways...... you can tape the end and save it for later.  I was pleased with the quality.  This is a messy project to do, so parental supervision is a must!  Henna stains everything!  Don&#x27;t let your teenagers try this in their bedroom or even worse, your car!</li>
    <li> My babysitter loves this henna and did fab tattos for everyone from herself to my 3 year old. great fun</li>
    <li> Ive seen n tried way better henna then this all12 of my cones were expired at 2010???? So like i even waited for an hour or so color was not red it was a light orange n well it didnt even show that well on my skin n well idk it was a let down.&lt;br /&gt;*LIGHT color (orange)&lt;br /&gt;*Kept Cold And still did not even show on skin&lt;br /&gt;*expired.&lt;br /&gt;Im beyond upset&lt;br /&gt;2 stars just cause it came quick &gt;:(</li>
    <li> Just got my 12 tubes of henna today started to play! So great! Each tube contains about 2-3 Tablespoons of henna and are so easy to use! Great product and even better price!</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good value, and will do many designs. However, the quality is not  that of a self mix.  It goes on thick. If you snipped the tip any smaller it would not come out.  Over all my 12 yr old loves it.  She mainly uses it on her hands.  Lasts only about 3 days strong because of all the hand washing. After that it fades completely away by day 5 or 6. If it was on the arm, leg or foot you may get a full week out of it before it begins to fade.  I would not recommend this to someone who wants that perfect tat, but for fun it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This product was what my wife was looking for.  She was very satisfied and will look in the future to order additional Henna from you.</li>
    <li> So I bought this 12 pack, and it shipped super fast! When I opened it, they sent me 3 extra cones! They are super convenient, because they all arrived ready to use, pre opened with a little yellow stopper at the end! It isn&#x27;t the brand in the pictures though, but it still works great! (it might even be a better brand!) overall, I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Got sent the wrong brand, shows up light. I already had the brand that i received so i decided to try something different. NOT the picture brand. Now I have 3 dozen tubes of the same kind!!</li>
    <li> This is my first henna purchase and I love playing with this stuff!  I&#x27;m still on my first cone but have made many random designs on my feet to play around and it&#x27;s just what I was hoping for. Beautiful color when the henna is left to dry for at least a couple of hours before removing.</li>
    <li> I cant wait to buy more of this product.  this is so easy to do.  I recommend this to everyone who is into temporary tattoos</li>
    <li> I needed a method of placing temorary tattoos on me for a halloween costume. I tried permanent markers first and found the mess and hassle to simple not be worth it. However, these worked excilent. Everything I have read about henna being a stain that lasts several weeks with care was true. Color was good depending on locations. The thickness of skinmakes a big difference in how well the stain will take. Hands and feet do quite well. Arms are slightly less, neck even more so, and face hardly at all. Application was simple, imagine using a icing applicator for a cake, that is essentually what you are doing here. It can be a little tricky at first, but with practice, the options are vertually limitless on what is possible. Before applying some research should be done on applying and after care, in order to get thr best results and longest life out of your henna. Would highly recommend this iteam to start out with...</li>
    <li> I am an RA from a university and these are great for programs. I do a one minute clinic for allergy test (dot on sensitive skin) and then have the program later that week. They stay on for a good 2-3 weeks and dry pretty quickly. They start out yellow and fade to orange and then brown in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is that I can&#x27;t always get the holder back in the tip. Once or twice I&#x27;ve had a bark like substance clog up the tip but it is easy to pull out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teen DD to take to Spirit Day at school to give out free henna tattoos. We were so pleased with the quality and color of this product. It is pale at first, but deepens overnight to a true dark brown/red.  Dozens of kids were given henna art that day, and it lasted for days and days. We&#x27;re storing our extra tubes in the freezer, can&#x27;t wait to use them for more great body art.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to come out as dark as it should have, left it on for two hours and no luck but overall it left a good orange colored stain and lasted for a good amount of time which is awesome.</li>
    <li> I got this for a birthday party of mine! It was so much fun! I used it a month prior, kept it on for an hour, and it lasted for 3 weeks! Everyone invited loved it also and enjoyed drawing designs on each other. The one negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell good! Other then that great quality!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  It does not come with henna design ideas but those are easy to find online.  The dye stays on for almost two weeks.  Great price for 12 tubes!  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best henna ever, nothing like the mix-it-yourself stuff, but it&#x27;s great for those who want no-fuss henna that lasts awhile and still leaves a pretty dark stain.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter.  She has given us all Henna tats.  It takes a hour or two to dry then just falls off or you can bursh off.  It gets a little darker the second day and lasted any where from one to two weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in July to do hennas on myself because I was charged $12 for a henna that was the size of three fingerprints... It was ridiculous. When I saw that you got twelve tubes in this package I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I immediately started henna&#x27;s and I did about twelve fist sized ones on me and my friends. I barely used half of the tube. Now in the end of September, I still haven&#x27;t used all of the first tube and I have done several on me and my friends since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great, It shows up dark, even gets darker the next day and last for weeks.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with henna, I love henna art and i love the smell of pure henna! This is the best ready/mixed henna I&#x27;ve ever used! I usually do it my self so i design one palm and wait till it dries then i design my other hand/palm. for each design the henna dries fast relatively (depends on your lines, the thicker the line the more time it needs to dry) but even if it is dry i keep it on, i stayed around 1 hr 40 mins before i remove the paste from my hand (it dries within 30- 40 mins with medium thickness lines) at first the color was dark orange and i put lemon juice then olive oil to help darkening the color. I slept without washing my hands with water then when i woke up the color was a GREAT DARK BROWN and the SMELL IS AMAZING. SO PURE HENNA COLOR AND SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this product! Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review for the time it takes the henna to fade out :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to try to convince her that a large tattoo would be problematic with certain outfits, or in certain situations. Well, the joke is on me because she has been playing with this stuff to the point it is making me crazy. Every time I turn around, she has created another design somewhere. She loves it and it seems easy to use, is consistent...but it also expired within a month after shipping. I don&#x27;t think it will matter much, but it is kind of cheap on their part since there are so many tubes involved.</li>
    <li> This henna does not work well. Very faint light marking after applying. I left it on for plenty of time, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this product is very good, I&#x27;d say the only bad thing about it is that its kind of thick and hard to do small designs but if you leave it on for an hour or more it turns out like a dark orange and its veryy easy to use and i have had no problems with using it on my skin. I would definitely buy this product again!!! Very good henna, it smells like henna should smell, very earthy! :)</li>
    <li> I do henna tattoos at events and have made my own paste, and bought it pre-made such as this is.  I found this to be high quality paste and the paste lasted for over a month with no noticeable difference in the older  tubes to the ones I used right away.  I was able to do about 12 fairly large henna tattoos per tube.  I like to squirt my wet paste (once applied on the skin) with a sugar, lemon, oil mixture so it stays on longer and stains deeper.  I would absolutely re-order this and recommend it.  It has a nice henna smell to it, and is very smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use but I couldn&#x27;t get the plug back in. I had to use an old post earring to plug the tube back up. Lots of henna for your money. I even gave some out as stocking stuffers for Christmas to my nieces. They loved it since most people don&#x27;t buy henna regularly so it was a great novelty gift.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t come in the package pictured but was still a decent product and the color comes out a nice strong orange mostly, I had some places in my designs that looked more brown. Fades in about 4 days for me, washing my hands only when necessary and so forth. overall very nice.</li>
    <li> Nicely pre-mixed paste that is easy to apply and use. The tip comes precut which is a lovely convenience and good for quality control on size.</li>
    <li> These little comes are great. My daughter and I used them last night and one cone goes a pretty long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the color is pretty good. The longer you leave it on, the darker it is.  I left mine on for almost the full hour it recommends and the color is as dark as any henna I&#x27;ve ever had done. My daughter did not leave hers on for very long, and it is definitely lighter.  It of course darkens overnight after it has been rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice-- the packaging says to use within 2 months of date on package.  Don&#x27;t buy these months in advance, I guess.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter and me. The package arrived on Friday. We have been using one tube so far and have some really nice and dark designs on ourselves and any friend that will stand still long enough. They are so easy to use and do a great job of delivering the product. You just have to be careful for blockage if you cut your tip very small.  Just push the henna back, massage it and it comes out smooth again.  I would totally buy these again. Great for a party or just for fun.  They would also make a great gift for a teenager or just fun loving person. (not sure why my last name didn&#x27;t change to Allen)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 8 cones and out of them, one was clogging because of a stone.  Otherwise, beautiful scent, nice bead flow &amp; consistency, and colour is true.  Nice Mehndi, dark brown and lasts a full week or more with good care (clean prep area, lemon juice, let reddy, let sit overnight for best results, then lotion daily or more.).</li>
    <li> Got these for my 7 year old daughter for xmas.  They worked way better than I expected.  We only left it on for 30 or 40 minutes.  The color was VERY faint at first, but then got darker the next day.  And it lasted well over a week.  For the price and the ease of use, I give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I got a henna tattoo recently and decided that I wanted to try to use hennas. It is addictive, I&#x27;ve been practicing on everyone I can. The stain is very dark and really lasts, more so than the one I paid for! These cones are quite long and a little difficult to maneuver for a beginner, but they go a long way! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> awesome! not watery or thick!  its a pretty color when it dries too! definate recommend to anyone who likes henna tattoos!</li>
    <li> Worked just fine..not much else to say about it but for some reason Amazon needs more words to articulate a relatively simple product with a very simple function.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product over the others because of the ratings and price.&lt;br /&gt;First time henna art was fairly easy to do. Clean the tip frequently because there can be clogs.</li>
    <li> An amazing product, a little different from my previous experiences, but better than I expected. The henna even stays moist between uses.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this henna a couple months ago expecting 12 cones to be just enough to last me and my friends a couple days. Safe to say, I still have 9 cones in my fridge that are still perfectly usable. I will definitely buy this henna again! Absolutely amazing deal and very good quality!</li>
    <li> I like Henna for medicinal purposes as well as the artistic design and the paste I received is not the paste pictured. Little to no eucalyptus smell at all which kind of defeats the purpose for me! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad paste but it sure isn&#x27;t the paste that I was led to believe I was ordering! Not as dark as the other pastes that I have used but I guess you get what you pay for! I won&#x27;t be ordering this again!!!!</li>
    <li> This henna was VERY runny. It almost seems like the maker mixed powder and water together at a bad ratio. I did henna tattoos at a school festival, I saw one of the tattoos I did a couple days after it was done. I was very disappointed with the stain. It was very light and already fading, even after I put spray on the henna paste so it would have more time to stain the skin. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It gives me exactly what I expected. I loved the amount of henna and it is good quality. It is also very useful for people just trying to have fun and try henna but aren&#x27;t super serious about it.</li>
    <li> I chose to give this product two stars, because it does not darken well.  I applied it as I would any other type of Mehandi cone, and the results were barely visible.</li>
    <li> i love henna, this brand doesnt stay on very well and washes off with in two days.  however you get alot which is fun to use to practice with but it just doesnt last long or get very dark even after wearing for 6 hrs or more</li>
    <li> The packaging looks different, but this is a great product.  We decided to go with henna tattoos instead of face painting, and it was a great hit.  I leave the paste on for up to an hour in order to get a darker result.  The tattoo gets  darker on the second day.  We had a lot of fun with these and one tube goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Hi! I recently started applying Henna for others and one thing that&#x27;s always important to THEM is how the color turns out. Let me assure you...the colour from these cones is great! At first it seems light (right after application), but the colour kept building and the next day it was a nice dark brown. I didn&#x27;t even leave it on for long to test it out, maybe 40 minutes? This was 3 days ago and the color is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only annoying part is...why won&#x27;t the seller change the description :s it is NOT soap! It was very confusing for me as a buyer to understand what I would be receiving in the mail. Safe to say...they&#x27;re Henna cones! Well priced, good quality. Kind of small but they come out to $.80 ish per cone, so what&#x27;s the harm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m order more right now!</li>
    <li> I was VERY pleased with this product. I was able to do about ten Henna&#x27;s per tube including several large and intricate designs. The color darkens really nicely the next day and even better the longer you leave it. Also adding a sugar and lemon juice mixture helps it get a nice dark color. Lasts about two weeks.</li>
    <li> First, you cannot beat this price! I bought this for a Bollywood party to save a lot of time and money mixing the real thing. The cones were a real success and went quite far. Each tube providing the opportunity to make multiple patterns for each \\&quot;artist.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is to be careful trimming the tips. There is a fine line between no flow of the paste and too thick a line. Otherwise, the cones are really a nice solution to sharing the fun of henna tattoos with a group. I would really recommend them to anyone trying henna for the first time or looking to cut a few corners (like myself).&lt;br /&gt;If you have never done henna before or wish to try mixing it yourself, I suggest [[ASIN:B0002CNZLM Earth Henna Henna Tattoos Body Painting Kit 1 Kit]]. The kit includes everything you need to mix authentic henna as well as some transfer stencils to get you started with designs if you aren&#x27;t artistically inclined.</li>
    <li> I bought this with no real expectation. I was getting them to practice my drawing and little else because I was under the impression that henna so cheep could not produce a dark stain. Well, This does produce a very nice stain that stays. Granted, I have only drawn on my hands, and can update when I decide to draw somewhere with thicker skin, but I am very happy with this product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The tip isn&#x27;t quite as fine as I would have liked, but other than that, these cones did a great job and the paste darkened well. I wish they smelled a little nicer (some smell like lavender or other essential oils, but this one has more of a neutral earthy scent. Not bad, by any means, but not particularly pretty.) Great product at a good price--I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many pre-made henna brands in the past, and in all honesty, they always came out a light brown shade, like the type you see in a Crayola box. This one came out a good shade darker (got to brown on the Crayola spectrum), and on my fingers and other areas of my arm and hand that aren&#x27;t exposed to the weather often, the color is a very very deep brown, and in some areas like the areas right under my nails, the color verges on black. The shipment came on time as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the hole cut into the tubes allows for good flow without being too big, and it still lets you do thin lines if you&#x27;ve gotten used to the design or are generally experienced in doing henna (in my case, I usually draw on my hand with a gel pen before doing complex designs so I don&#x27;t have to go slowly, no negative effects). Not a bad buy if you don&#x27;t feel like mixing your own henna!</li>
    <li> Very pale color, even after leaving it on for a day. You get what you pay for. Fine for parties or just playing around, but not a high quality product with good color or great texture.  Lasts only a few days, so it&#x27;s actually probably good as a *very* temporary henna.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a program to do in my res. hall.  It worked perfect.  Having multiple tubes was really convenient for the crowd we had.  The company even send a few extra tubes, not sure if it was a mistake.  But it was so very helpful.  I am definitely going to order these again.</li>
    <li> I Got the Henna in perfect condition and Fast. It was packaged nicely, and had small plastic &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; inserted in the pre cut holes.  The henna went on DARK DARK and stained in Minutes...It dried quickly too.  The next day the stain was Heavy Dark Orange/Brown Perfect!!!!... Some of the designs I used had Very fine lines, and the stain came out perfect on them too.  I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s lasting cause IT&#x27;S STILL STAINED! This is Day 5 and being a nurse washing my hands 20 thousand times a day, this henna has staying power!!!  I&#x27;m learning to henna professionally and have been trying different brands of henna for about a year, and let me tell you… THIS is the only one I’m buying from now on! MAN oh Man this stuff ROCKS!!!! Buy it! It’s sooooo worth it.  You might think, “I can get it cheaper” but CHEAP is what you’ll be getting… I so Recommend this! THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> The color of this henna has lasted a very long time on my skin, despite daily showers and lotion. The fragrance indicates to me a genuine product, and the cones are well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These cones are easy to use and are so convenient! I will definitely be purchasing these cones again when I run out.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been trying to find Henna that leaves a darkish stain and so far after my first attempt Ihave a dark brown stain of the outsiders mark. It looks great. I highly suggest letting it dry in direct sunlight for darker and better results. As an artist I&#x27;m glad to have found this and Will definitely be buying some more from here. Shipping was relatively okay.</li>
    <li> We invite family and friends over and watch a movie and give each other henna tattoos. This product has served us very well. We could not believe how much henna we were able to make with just one single tube. We did enough that we could have decorated someone&#x27;s entire body with a single tube! It comes out dark brown, hardens really quickly and eventually cracks/peels off and starts out looking orange, but after going to bed and waking up, it turns a nice, dark red/brown. Great for beginners looking to make henna art for fun</li>
    <li> I received 15 cones from the seller; I expect the extras were in case any of them broke, but luckily none of them did! The cone was very easy to use, and the opening at the end is very small so you could actually get some pretty good detail from it.  Also, the color got as dark as henna I&#x27;ve had done previously from local artists, and it&#x27;s lasted a week so far, even after doing a few days of hot yoga, and looks like I&#x27;ll get another week at least out of it.</li>
    <li> The henna doesn&#x27;t smell bad, its not messy, it leaves a good stain for a long time...whats not to like?&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism i could give is that once its opened its hard to preserve. It does last though and if you love it as much as i do theres not much leftover anyways :) have fun!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair vibrant red/copper/orange. Good quality henna and pretty cheap. The amount of henna is good enough for 4 treatments on my hair, which is down to my bra. One issue is that it doesn&#x27;t really heavily dye my roots, just the part of my hair that has been previously been colored and is easily effected by hair dye. So my hair goes from black to a nice red....which is pretty in right now.</li>
    <li> Bought on a whim, thinking that even if it sucked, it wouldn&#x27;t have cost me that much. No, it is FANTASTIC! Long lasting, looks great. you can cut the tip super small and get thin lines, and it lasts a long time! GREAT BUY! once I run out, I WILL be coming back!</li>
    <li> It has a nice consistency and is very easy to work with. At first it is light orange but it turns darker after a few hours! I love it!</li>
