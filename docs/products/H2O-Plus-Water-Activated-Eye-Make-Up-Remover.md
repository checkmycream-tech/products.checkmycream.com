      <li>Love this and wish it was easier to find!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>

      <li>Most makeup remover leaves my eye area a lighter shade than the rest of my face!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Does what it says fairly well, but there are better products out there.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to get remove everything.</li>
      <li>And I absolutely love the way it makes me skin feel.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>And I must say the oil-based one does a better and faster</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed is it&#x27;s a gel like consistency which is good</li>
      <li>it came off easily.</li>
      <li>and it is so easy and not greasy.</li>
      <li>I clean it one more time with a eyelid cleanser.</li>
      <li>It melts away mascara easily and there is no residue.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product cleared my acne for the first time in 15 years!&#x27;Terrified that it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
      <li>so anything oil free is what I need.  </li>
      <li>Removes eye makeup easily and cleanly with no residue.  </li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it because I always used Almay oil free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and your skin feels completely clean.</li>
      <li>Skin is clean and all makeup is gone, no residue or breakout.  </li>
      <li>This is extremely gentle, removes eye makeup super quickly and easily, and rinses clean quickly.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this as it&#x27;s claims of gently cleaning eye makeup off are appealing as is the price point, but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
      <li>this is my first time to use the eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many, many times in the past.  </li>
      <li>I first came across this product while shopping at TJ Maxx.</li>
      <li>Finally found an eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t greasy and easily washes off.  </li>
      <li>It also takes a lot longer and is less effective since it just turns mascara into a slushy gooey sticky substance.</li>
      <li>it comes out way too fast.</li>
      <li>There is no sticky residue, and it is gentle on the eyes.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I love this product so much I wanted to write a little review/recommendation.</li>
      <li>However, this particular batch was too runny.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin or allergic contact dermatitis DO NOT BUY THIS!!</li>
      <li>The skin around my eyes actually feels soft and clean afterward.</li>
      <li>I picked it up because I wanted to try a new eye make-up product and figured I would give this a shot.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for sensitive skin/</li>
      <li>Amazon is the only other place I have been able to find it</li>
      <li>If you wear mascara and liner - try some you will be so pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I love the company H2O+ and usually purchase this item when visiting another city.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t require that you use much and even after evenings where I have caked on layers of eye shadow, primer, numerous layers of mascara and eye liner-</li>
      <li>and I used it frequently.</li>
      <li>It was able to remove my eye shadow and brow pencil, but it full on fails to remove the three different mascaras I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
      <li>Originally got this product at TJ Maxx a few months ago.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to using micellar water to get my eyes clean with far less scrubbing.</li>
      <li>Not only did it sting and dry out my eyes, but it did absolutely nothing to rid me of my make-up.</li>
      <li>I just put a dab on my fingertips gently rub my closed eyes occasionally adding a bit of water.</li>
      <li>And I love bold waterproof smudge proof eyeliner and somewhat of a heavy mascara so needless to say eye makeup remover is essential for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first came across this product while shopping at TJ Maxx. I picked it up because I wanted to try a new eye make-up product and figured I would give this a shot. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t require that you use much and even after evenings where I have caked on layers of eye shadow, primer, numerous layers of mascara and eye liner- it came off easily. It lasted me a couple months (at least!) and I used it frequently. Amazon is the only other place I have been able to find it and I don&#x27;t think I will switch eye make-up removers again!</li>
    <li> Love it! This product gets every trace of eye makeup off within one use.  It&#x27;s not greasy and your skin feels completely clean.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this as it&#x27;s claims of gently cleaning eye makeup off are appealing as is the price point, but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough. It was able to remove my eye shadow and brow pencil, but it full on fails to remove the three different mascaras I&#x27;ve tried it on. You end up with partial mascara removal even after an uncomfortable amount of scrubbing. I&#x27;ll be going back to using micellar water to get my eyes clean with far less scrubbing.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I wanted to write a little review/recommendation. I have oily/combination skin so anything oil free is what I need.  And I love bold waterproof smudge proof eyeliner and somewhat of a heavy mascara so needless to say eye makeup remover is essential for me. The first thing I noticed is it&#x27;s a gel like consistency which is good but it&#x27;s not too thick. But beware! it comes out way too fast. You only need a teeny tiny bit to do the job. Maybe they could fix this with a different tube or maybe a pump or even just a smaller hole, that hole is way too big for this product (Or just be careful). I just put a dab on my fingertips gently rub my closed eyes occasionally adding a bit of water. To my surprise all of my liner and mascara was gone, once I rinsed my face. Usually I have to take a q-tip to my bottom lash line, with this I didn&#x27;t. And I absolutely love the way it makes me skin feel. The formula is great I have pretty sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The skin around my eyes actually feels soft and clean afterward. No residue, grease, or oily feeling. It&#x27;s got quite a bit in it and only using a drop at a time this tube will definitely last a while!  ***apolishedobsession.blogspot.com***</li>
    <li> I love the company H2O+ and usually purchase this item when visiting another city.  However, this particular batch was too runny.  I do like the product when it is less runny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many, many times in the past.  I love it!  Removes eye makeup easily and cleanly with no residue.  Best ever!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or allergic contact dermatitis DO NOT BUY THIS!! It contains Methylchloroisothiazolinone which can cause a bad reaction in some people. I tried it out unknowingly and ended up with red, puffy, burning skin.</li>
    <li> Finally found an eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t greasy and easily washes off.  Love this and wish it was easier to find!</li>
    <li> Good luck if you can find it - I&#x27;ve bought it all out everywhere! This is the only makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes. I had to use baby oil, and that caused problems too. This is extremely gentle, removes eye makeup super quickly and easily, and rinses clean quickly. I can&#x27;t believe I found this product. I&#x27;ll buy it anywhere I see it since it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> My Mom put this in my Christmas stocking last year. I hadn&#x27;t used it because I always used Almay oil free. When I finally tried it I was truly amazed. All traces of eye makeup came off in one wash. I immediately called my Mom to see where she got it. She had found it one-off at TJMaxx. Of course we couldn&#x27;t find it there again. I looked at Ulta but they only had H2O liquid eye akeup remover. I am grateful to have found it here at Amazon. I only wish I had known how little I needed to use before I was half through the tube. It could probably last 6 months if you are careful. If you wear mascara and liner - try some you will be so pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye make-up remover for years.  It melts away mascara easily and there is no residue.</li>
    <li> To say I hated this product would be a generous understatement. Not only did it sting and dry out my eyes, but it did absolutely nothing to rid me of my make-up. I looked like a raccoon that had gotten into a bar fight after I used it--red, irritated eyes surrounded by a mess of smudged mascara and eyeliner. I used it twice in an attempt to clean up my face, but it only made things worse, which is ridiculous considering I don&#x27;t even use water-proof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was expensive and quite possibly the worst make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. The only reasons I gave it two stars instead of one are because the shipping was prompt and the product&#x27;s bottle is sleek and well-designed.</li>
    <li> I am sad to read this is back for &amp;#34;a limited time&amp;#34;. This product is excellent. Other products are irritating to my eyes. This is the only product I have found that works for me. I better stock up!</li>
    <li> The best eye makeup remover out there! There is no sticky residue, and it is gentle on the eyes. A little goes a long way, and it certainly does the job.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE BRAND. this is my first time to use the eye makeup remover. It is very easy to get remove everything. But if this put into my eyes.it make me feel uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Does what it says fairly well, but there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> This make-up remover, quite simply, did not remove all of my make-up.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Most makeup remover leaves my eye area a lighter shade than the rest of my face! This one doesn&#x27;t do that at all and it is so easy and not greasy. Definitely Recommend!</li>
    <li> I use both an oil-based remover and this one... And I must say the oil-based one does a better and faster job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to rub quite a bit using this one and it stings if it gets into my eyes. It also takes a lot longer and is less effective since it just turns mascara into a slushy gooey sticky substance. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves behind a sticky feeling, I&#x27;m never sure if it&#x27;s actually clean or not so I go over it with a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done with my shower I have raccoon eyes, so I clean it one more time with a eyelid cleanser.</li>
    <li> Stocked up on this great product. Highly recommend for sensitive skin/eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Dissolves all eye makeup - no mess and so simple to use with just a little water.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or sting and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face or eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Betty - from Betty&#x27;s One Stop!&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service and excellent shipping. Will shop with you again!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Shipped fast</li>
    <li> Outstanding product cleared my acne for the first time in 15 years!&#x27;Terrified that it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> Besides using this product to remove eye make up, also use all over face to remove make up then rinse off before washing with facial wash.</li>
    <li> Originally got this product at TJ Maxx a few months ago. Tried it out and strongly feel that it&#x27;s superior to any eye makeup remover on the market (that I&#x27;ve ever tried)! I ran out of it and hopped on the net to find a replacement... Ended up ordering two to ensure that I&#x27;m covered for quite some time.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin friendly makeup remover!  Excellent for removing makeup and oily skin friendly.  Skin is clean and all makeup is gone, no residue or breakout.  Leaves skin moisturized w/ out oils.  I always keep extra!  My go to face wash.  A splash of water and it&#x27;s all gone, eye makeup and all.</li>
