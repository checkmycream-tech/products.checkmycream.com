    <li> So so cute and comes up above the knee exactly like the photo. Also, the ribbons are stark white, not off-white like the photo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the Black socks with white lace top over knee socks  5 stars. When I received the  Black socks with white lace top over knee socks in the male the packaging was good. The material they were made of was really nice and soft. The white of the lace didn&#x27;t stain when I washed them and I also receive a pair of free earnings with the socks. I would definitely recommended this product to people because the product is Great and they&#x27;re really cute and made with really good materials.</li>
    <li> came a lot faster than expected, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, very high quality materials, little bit tight though, that was expected i&#x27;m a slightly bigger woman. over all very happy with the product</li>
    <li> These socks are very cute. They are warm and comfortable and fit snug. The lace is really cute, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far.</li>
    <li> I love these socks. The only issue is that they only go knee high on me. The picture shows them to be thigh high. I am a taller person but there is no way they go above the knee. Quality is good. I&#x27;ve worn them a couple of times and they don&#x27;t come down.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me, its super cute but beware, it is a very small size since its made in Asia. Since I have chicken legs it fits snug a little past my knee.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I got them today, and they are perfect &amp;#60;3 a few days before expected. They are sooooo soft and fit nicely. They don&#x27;t go too high like shown in the picture but it&#x27;s absolutely fine. They are right were I like them. And the bows untie and tie so you can adjust to your likeness. Overall they are very lovely and an amazing buy</li>
    <li> Love it :D very clean, the lace was not broken, no holes and the knee high socks are beautiful .</li>
    <li> these are very comfortable and warm...wish they were just a cm wider but they are nice and I would buy them again</li>
    <li> Love them!! So sexy and fit very well. I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t come up all the way but its a great fit.</li>
    <li> I love the lace at the top and they stay up pretty well. They are also very comfortable and made with good material. Would recommend.</li>

    <li> Perfect condition just like in the picture.  Fits well on my GF and can&#x27;t believe that it really looks like the picture for this price.</li>
    <li> Love, love these over the knee socks.  Yes, these feel like socks, NOT STOCKINGS! And I wear them , well wear them out.  Need to re order. I was in garment bag, line dry and they hold up well. Just wish they had more of the lace tied ones in other colors.</li>
    <li> Cute, but the lace is cheap.</li>
    <li> Adorable little socks, indeed! However, the bows do not go on the sides, more like the back of the leg. And these didn&#x27;t go over my knee, but right at it. Regardless, they are so soft and very cute! My boyfriend sure liked them! ^.~</li>

    <li> I was so excited about these socks because they looked cute &amp; sexy. They are not. The lace is made of some kind of shiny polyester that is so ugly and unappealing. &amp;#34;Tacky&amp;#34; actually a clarifying adjective. I just threw them right back in the envelope and sent them back. Apologies to those who like tacky, cheap looking lace.</li>
    <li> These socks look just like the picture and are super cute and soft! They arrived sooner then expected and came with a free gift.</li>
    <li> Very sexy. Love them. They look old timey, and classy. They are a great compliment to lingerie or to just wear with a skirt.</li>
    <li> Cute but the socks are definitely two different lengths and it&#x27;s very noticeable. Not really wearable/functional.</li>
