<ol>
      <li>The Braun 2000 is the best shaver I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>I feel these are about the best one can get for now.  </li>
      <li>Excellent.  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>I gave another star for the company&#x27;s excellent response, and another star for the good shave</li>

      <li>It is great because no one else could tell me where to go to get through replacement parts.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit.</li>
      <li>The shave is good.</li>
      <li>The delivery service was good, the product packaged well</li>
      <li>The shave is good.</li>
      <li>Also the blade looks good.</li>
      <li>think the search for official Braun replacements for our beloved 2000 series may be at an end.</li>
      <li>The Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter block fit my dad&#x27;s Braun 2000FC Micron 1000/2000 perfectly.</li>
      <li>This was a perfect replacement, razor looks like brand new...</li>
      <li>Fits perfectly, runs like new OEM product with NO pulls.</li>
      <li>Products arrived quickly and in great condition.</li>
      <li>I know Braun doesn&#x27;t make them any more, so there aren&#x27;t a lot of choices.</li>
      <li>Also I noticed that in the top description of the product it says &amp;#34;Foil is stamped 420/U.&amp;#34; It has no stamp on it at all.</li>
      <li>I was going to Sweden, so said to myself that since it had a switch to 220v, this razor would be perfect to fix finally.</li>
      <li>I still love my Braun shaver -</li>
      <li>They are OK.  </li>

      <li>This replacement foil and cutter are easy to replace.  </li>
      <li>fit my husband&#x27;s Braun perfectly just as stated in the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>it fell apart, cheap construction</li>
      <li>First I will say that the foil is very smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>and it works just as the original assembly</li>
      <li>The plastic that Shavetronics uses is inferior to the original.  </li>
      <li>420/U is stamped on the original Braun in the picture I posted.</li>
      <li>Was not an original Braun package but appears to work satisfactorilly.</li>
      <li>At first it worked fine but after 2 1/2 months of use the clip on one end broke.  </li>
      <li>As I pointed out before, the foil is smooth with a nice sheen and the cutter seems very sharp.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>I applied a hot iron to the plastic rivets to flatten them</li>
      <li>I applied a hot iron to the plastic rivets to flatten them</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as shown with fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>bought the &#x27;60 Second Shaver&#x27; by Shavetronics from Shavers.com, which is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>who then sent me a very apologetic email with the choice of replacement or refund.</li>
      <li>My original Braun foil lasted for years with daily removal for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>The unit functions, but sounds and feels different from the original Braun parts.</li>
      <li>Since it shaved nicely and I need it, I&#x27;m not sure whether to repair it myself or send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I opened the box for this foil/cutter set, the foil is already inside a new foil holder!</li>
      <li>There are a lot of us with older braun and etrons out here.</li>
      <li>SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET REAL BRAUN PARTS!!</li>
      <li>The plastic that holds the foil broke within 1 month under normal use.  </li>
      <li>It looked like an exact replacement for the original Braun 2000 except for its stiff power cord.  </li>
      <li>So, I have to live with it.</li>
      <li>I have not tried this new set yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on its performance.</li>
      <li>I ordered a new one from another seller on Amazon, another $10.</li>
      <li>It makes my Braun Shaver like new again.  </li>
      <li>Ah well, live and learn.</li>
      <li>have to retire my decades old Eltron for lack of decent quality replacement foils.&lt;br /&gt;SHAME</li>
      <li>I disassembled my old unit and the replacement and found them made nearly exactly the same.</li>
      <li>old micron 2000.</li>
      <li>As expected, they didn&#x27;t hold up and the reinforcement bar popped right off.</li>
      <li>(the piece that the cutter snaps on to) of the new unit onto my Braun since mine was so loose the cutter would nearly fall off, tightened the screws that hold the vibrating motor into the case and had a new, old Braun 2000 until the plastic of the foil broke.  </li>
      <li>This one was priced the same as official Braun foil/cutter sets, so I reasoned that it will probably be the same as a real Braun foil/cutter set.</li>
      <li>did.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who might still have one of these old razors, which were built to last.</li>
      <li>After reading reviews for this and similar (but cheaper) product, I ordered this for my 10+ year old Model 2501 Braun.</li>
      <li>It is too thick and will not shave closely, nor will it fit correctly into the housing--</li>
      <li>They were useless, so I ended up buying a new Braun shaver, which I have had for more than a year and</li>
      <li>I (Jeanine&#x27;s husband) had read the reviews of the other foil/cutter sets that are much cheaper</li>
      <li>I now remove it once a week for cleaning and the first one lasted a little over a year.  </li>
      <li>So not only did I spend almost 3 times as much for the set (as opposed to the other sellers)</li>
      <li>This is a non-factory replacement for my father&#x27;s old Braun electric razor that has long been out of production.</li>

<li> Too bad, especially since they charge so much :-(.</li>
<li> /&gt;Update (2/13/13) I contacted Amazon about replacement of the broken foil.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> This is an expensive razor but durable and he has had it for over a decade.</li>
<li> it is way too difficult to get in and out for cleaning.</li>
<li> I was shocked when I opened the box</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: (2/1/13)</li>
<li> It worked for 4 months, then the brittle plastic at the base of each end snapped.</li>
<li> on Amazon for allowing this crap to be listed on</li>

    <li> Perfect fit. I wished I ordered it through Amazon years ago. I was suffering with a broken foil because I thought it was no longer available.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as shown with fast shipping.  It is fortunate to be able to get parts for a shaver that is no longer in production.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter are easy to replace.  It makes my Braun Shaver like new again.  I&#x27;ve been buying this and replacing it in my saver about once every 2 years for the last 15+ years.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Over 20 years ago, I accepted a trade for a Braun 2520 razor with a pair of Timberland boat shoes that I had bought for $25 dollars... but the razor had a busted foil! For years I planned to buy a replacement for it, but never found the time... I was going to Sweden, so said to myself that since it had a switch to 220v, this razor would be perfect to fix finally. This was a perfect replacement, razor looks like brand new... too bad it doesn&#x27;t cut coarse hair worth a flip! Ah well, live and learn.</li>
    <li> These \\&quot;knock offs RATHER SUCK!!  The plastic on mine CRUMBLED!! The REAL BRAUN foil cover head does NOT FIT these copies,either!!  SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET REAL BRAUN PARTS!!</li>
    <li> After market product.  Poor quality.</li>
    <li> Products arrived quickly and in great condition. The Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter block fit my dad&#x27;s Braun 2000FC Micron 1000/2000 perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is great because no one else could tell me where to go to get through replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Was not an original Braun package but appears to work satisfactorilly. I don&#x27;t know how durable it is. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> FRAUDULENT product listing.&lt;br /&gt;Grossly inferior product compared to the past.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to retire my decades old Eltron for lack of decent quality replacement foils.&lt;br /&gt;SHAME on Amazon for allowing this crap to be listed on it&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;Please, Mr. Bezos, stop playing with drones and hire Quality Inspectors to protect your customers.</li>
    <li> Braun bid for parts brand and received was a generic brand, I am dissatisfied with the order.</li>
    <li> I will never give up my 35 yr. old micron 2000. Even with the inferior \\&quot;aftermarket\\&quot; foil &amp; cutter,  it outpreforms all the newer brauns I&#x27;ve tried. There are a lot of us with older braun and etrons out here. They could be brought back into production with the same german presision and quality. I don&#x27;t see why not. At LEAST improve the \\&quot;aftermarket\\&quot; offerings to a decent level.</li>
    <li> They are OK.  Expect the foil plastic to only last about a year.  My original Braun foil lasted for years with daily removal for cleaning.  These will not last through daily removal.  I now remove it once a week for cleaning and the first one lasted a little over a year.  I am now using my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought others on line that were crappy quality thrown in a box for shipment.  I feel these are about the best one can get for now.  At least until Braun starts making them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the &#x27;60 Second Shaver&#x27; by Shavetronics from Shavers.com, which is no longer available.  It looked like an exact replacement for the original Braun 2000 except for its stiff power cord.  It lasted about as long as the foil head plastic.  Plastic parts inside the unit broke within a year.  I disassembled my old unit and the replacement and found them made nearly exactly the same. The plastic that Shavetronics uses is inferior to the original.  I basically swapped the drive shoe (the piece that the cutter snaps on to) of the new unit onto my Braun since mine was so loose the cutter would nearly fall off, tightened the screws that hold the vibrating motor into the case and had a new, old Braun 2000 until the plastic of the foil broke.  The Braun 2000 is the best shaver I have ever had.  So, I have to live with it.</li>
    <li> Beware what you receive is an aftermarket product made or sold by Shavetronics. The unit functions, but sounds and feels different from the original Braun parts. Two stars for showing Braun parts in the photo, but sending aftermarket parts instead.</li>
    <li> It worked for 4 months, then the brittle plastic at the base of each end snapped. I know Braun doesn&#x27;t make them any more, so there aren&#x27;t a lot of choices. Too bad, especially since they charge so much :-(.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I read the reviews and this Braun replacement fit my husband&#x27;s Braun perfectly just as stated in the other reviews.  This is an expensive razor but durable and he has had it for over a decade. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a non-factory replacement for my father&#x27;s old Braun electric razor that has long been out of production. The delivery service was good, the product packaged well and it works just as the original assembly did.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who might still have one of these old razors, which were built to last.</li>
    <li> This is a foreign knock off aftermarket foil. It is too thick and will not shave closely, nor will it fit correctly into the housing-- it is way too difficult to get in and out for cleaning. Next time, I will only buy a Braun factory foil and cutting block.</li>

    <li> This is exactly what we needed. Received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I (Jeanine&#x27;s husband) had read the reviews of the other foil/cutter sets that are much cheaper and they were described as being after market junk. This one was priced the same as official Braun foil/cutter sets, so I reasoned that it will probably be the same as a real Braun foil/cutter set. I was shocked when I opened the box and there was an aftermarket set. At least it was in a blister pack and not loose in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another disappointment is that my original foil holder was broken and I needed a new one. I ordered a new one from another seller on Amazon, another $10. When I opened the box for this foil/cutter set, the foil is already inside a new foil holder! Not as pictured!!!  So not only did I spend almost 3 times as much for the set (as opposed to the other sellers), I also spent an additional $10 for a holder that was not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the search for official Braun replacements for our beloved 2000 series may be at an end. I have not tried this new set yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on its performance. 1/30/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: (2/1/13) I added some customer shots. Also I noticed that in the top description of the product it says &amp;#34;Foil is stamped 420/U.&amp;#34; It has no stamp on it at all. 420/U is stamped on the original Braun in the picture I posted. I hope all 5 pictures I took will be posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: (2/3/13) First I will say that the foil is very smooth and shiny. No defects. Also the blade looks good. I have used it twice, and it broke. In the pictures I posted, you can see the plastic rivets. As expected, they didn&#x27;t hold up and the reinforcement bar popped right off. Since it shaved nicely and I need it, I&#x27;m not sure whether to repair it myself or send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (2/13/13) I contacted Amazon about replacement of the broken foil. They contacted Shavers.com. who then sent me a very apologetic email with the choice of replacement or refund. I chose a replacement which came in just a couple days. The replacement is the same quality as the other. As I pointed out before, the foil is smooth with a nice sheen and the cutter seems very sharp. I think the manufacturer may have the same molds that Braun used and the same foils. They need to melt the plastic rivets to hold the foils in place. I applied a hot iron to the plastic rivets to flatten them and I think they will hold. The shave is good. I gave another star for the company&#x27;s excellent response, and another star for the good shave I&#x27;m getting from the repaired foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (3/10/15) After repairing by melting the rivets, the rivets held for another couple months and gave out. I should have updated this way back then. They were useless, so I ended up buying a new Braun shaver, which I have had for more than a year and a half.ent is the same quality as the other.

    <li> I cannot recommend this item.  At first it worked fine but after 2 1/2 months of use the clip on one end broke.  It still worked so I used it.  Two weeks later the clip on the other end broke and the whole thing was useless.  The previous one I bought from a store I had to walk into lasted several years.  Other observation: the picture of the packaged product on the Amazon website had &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; on it but the package I received did not.  I still love my Braun shaver - just wish I had a foil that worked.</li>
    <li> The plastic that holds the foil broke within 1 month under normal use.  This was a waste of money.  Save your money don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> it fell apart, cheap construction</li>
