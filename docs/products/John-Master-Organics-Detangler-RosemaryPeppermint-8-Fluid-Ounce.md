      <li>This is a fantastic product that I found in Hawaii while on a trip.  </li>
      <li>This smells really nice , goes on just right and is more natural than most conditioners.</li>
      <li>This stuff works, I love it, used up my first bottle, ordering another.</li>

      <li>Great stuff and not overpriced like lots of other organic brands.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, and also has a low score on EWG.</li>

      <li>I think it is light enough to use both ways, and I love the fresh rosemary mint smell.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I ordered it when I got back home!</li>
      <li>This detangler really makes my hair clean.</li>
      <li>My blonde hair needs a better detangler.</li>
      <li>Smells great but left my hair a bit dry.</li>
      <li>I never thought I would be able to keep my hair long ..</li>
      <li>I have struggled with trying to find a conditioner that would detangle my hair and keep it smooth - yet not be too heavy or too light.</li>
      <li>I was trying to find an alternative to conditioner, which leaves my fine hair too flat.  </li>
      <li>I have a very fine hair and every conditioner i tried made it look and feel heavy.</li>
      <li>The conditioner works as a detangler (I even use is on my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair) and gives great shine (I use a tiny pea sized amount on the ends of my hair without washing it out and then blow dry).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Rusk in the past and like that better.  </li>
      <li>Hair is soft prevents breakage!</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I had absolutely no trouble ordering as I obtained this through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
      <li>This is the only natural conditioner that works for me!!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend apply, just prior to getting out of the shower, because if you let the water run on you too long afterwards, you will rinse the product out too much.</li>
      <li>But, it does make my hair really soft and manageable, finally!</li>
      <li>Even though it contains no silicones, my hair is left feeling so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit so the price is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>This makes my hair sooooo silky and soft, that I will be buying it again, but I am pretty bummed that it comes in a small bottle.</li>
      <li>I have straight, dark hair.     </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy and limp.</li>

<li> Just a little bit needed.</li>
<li> It usually takes me forever to brush it out.</li>
<li> Not sure if this is it,</li>
<li> The scent is not overwhelming.</li>

    <li> I have baby fine blond processed hair and it takes 20 minutes just to comb it out after washing. And that is after combing it out before washing!! This stuff works, I love it, used up my first bottle, ordering another. You only need a little bit, too. Best hair product I have ever used on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy and limp. I have straight, dark hair.     This detangler really makes my hair clean. I use this after using John Masters Rosemary Lavender shampoo. My skin breaks out in rash and cyst like pimples whenever I use shampoo that contains sulfate!    John Masters products are a bit expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.     I do wish they come in different sizes though. Like bigger sizes to save money or travel sizes for when.... duh, I travel.</li>
    <li> Really good! I never thought I would be able to keep my hair long .. now it is long and manageable! Just a little bit needed.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find an alternative to conditioner, which leaves my fine hair too flat.  This product is just right and smells wonderful.  I still use a deep conditioner monthly but after my daily  shampoo I will continue to use this detangler.  I also like the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.  I had absolutely no trouble ordering as I obtained this through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that I found in Hawaii while on a trip.  I needed something that would moisturize my hair and take care of my humid \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  I loved it so much that I ordered it when I got back home!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy long hair. I have struggled with trying to find a conditioner that would detangle my hair and keep it smooth - yet not be too heavy or too light. This is just perfect. Doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and it smells wonderful and refreshing!</li>

    <li> Very nice lightweight conditioner. I bought it to use as a leave-in conditioner based on a review, although it is only instructed to be used as a standard conditioner on the bottle. I think it is light enough to use both ways, and I love the fresh rosemary mint smell. I have been looking for an alternative to Khiel&#x27;s leave-in conditioner since it was discontinued. Not sure if this is it, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rusk in the past and like that better.  Not as sticky and smells better.  My blonde hair needs a better detangler.</li>
    <li> I have problems with thinning hair and had gotten a travel size version of this detangler, that I have been using as a conditioner.  I loved how light it was on my long hair.  The smell was really nice as well. I would recommend apply, just prior to getting out of the shower, because if you let the water run on you too long afterwards, you will rinse the product out too much. It just is not going to coat the hair as heavily as other products, but that is why I personally like it.</li>
    <li> I have a very fine hair and every conditioner i tried made it look and feel heavy. I was frustrated, because without conditioner my hair felt dry and had lot of static electricity. I discovered this brand through Ralph Lauren Model&#x27;s blog and decided to give it a try. Im glad i did. This is the best conditioner so far. My hair feel light and very hydrated. Great stuff and not overpriced like lots of other organic brands. I bought it from his website and the delivery is always free.&lt;br /&gt;Im happy!</li>
    <li> This smells really nice , goes on just right and is more natural than most conditioners. JM makes good products overall. We use their shampoos too. Very unique you will enjoy :)</li>
    <li> This is the only natural conditioner that works for me!!! Leaves no residue and detangles like a dream!!!!!! Even though it contains no silicones, my hair is left feeling so soft and shiny. I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, and also has a low score on EWG. It immediately detangled my hair, and smells great. Great product and SAFE!</li>

    <li> Smells great but left my hair a bit dry. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> this is great conditioner, makes my hair feel so good!</li>
    <li> I have long, thicker hair and it always gets tangled. It usually takes me forever to brush it out. Im very impressed with this! Doesnt weigh down my hair and untagles it.</li>
    <li> This stuff was great other than the very strong smell, didn&#x27;t smell of mint to me, but very medicinal</li>
    <li> Detangles hair, smells great, and truly softens hair. Only con is that I needed a lot of product to achieve the desired results. Also I recommend leaving in for about 5 min.</li>
