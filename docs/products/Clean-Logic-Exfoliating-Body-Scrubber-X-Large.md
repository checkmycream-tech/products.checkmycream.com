### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am very happy.</li>
      <li>This product is the best body scrubber I&#x27;ve come across and nothing else beats it.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Best Cleansing Cloth ever\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The pad feels great and it works</li>
      <li>It has great exfoliaters on it and they have not balled up or turned to pillage yet.</li>
      <li>Delivered on time and great product</li>
      <li>These are great bath/shower sponges</li>
      <li>LOL)...</li>
      <li>This is a great scrubber for those who like a nice ruff surface.</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>Good size, but</li>
      <li>I especially love the way it works on my knees and elbows (they tend to get super rough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scrubber is great, just make sure</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad I could order online as they are great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about a month now, and it has held its shape nicely.</li>
      <li>Kind of is not as affective when in liquid.</li>
      <li>and I really love how the surface of these are good for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>But would love it more if it had a bit more scrub to it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>The item is awesome,it really works Great on your skin...</li>
      <li>This is more like using a wash cloth that wasn&#x27;t softened by fabric softener.</li>
      <li>I do love it.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good scrubber.</li>
      <li>but I like it just fine.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that you do not have a mess in the shower.</li>
      <li>this is not for people with sensitive skin, you need to be able to like being scrub clean!!  </li>
      <li>I love these - they really help me scrub off dirt - grime anything!  </li>
      <li>I had bought a smaller one of these sponges and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Out of the package it seemed scratchy, at least to my spouse, but felt absolutely wonderful on my skin in the shower.  </li>
      <li>because I figured the more coarse it would be, the better it would work.</li>
      <li>Great American made product &amp;lt;3! Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Its huge and literally stretches more than 3X its original length so cleaning my back has never been easier...</li>
      <li>Like magic it washes out like its brand new...</li>
      <li>Great for the first couple uses, then it&#x27;s not really an exfoliating spoinge anymore</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see the purpose of it, but it might be useful to someone, I suppose.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, very lightweight, and easy to lather up, but took a bit longer than a comparison loofah sponge to remove excess soap from the scrub.  </li>
      <li>This works well - it holds a lot of suds and is just the right roughness, which is to say noticeable but not damaging.</li>
      <li>Love this larger body scrubber it has a loop on one side to hang in the shower, it does exactly what it was made to do, EXFOLIATE</li>
      <li>My skin gets a spa treatment every time, its never felt better, plus the first time I used this thing I felt like I has lost ten lbs...</li>
      <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Bought her first at the Tuesday Morning store.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much...</li>
      <li>have bought it if the described rightly.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy if you are looking for something that really scrubs, exfoliates..</li>
      <li>Very durable, and cleans me very well.  </li>
      <li>if you order it you are okay with receiving a pink one.</li>
      <li>I originally found these in a local store</li>
      <li>But i&#x27;m thrilled I finally found it again and will be ordering another one for a backup for when this one wears out (which will be a long time ) !</li>
      <li>It is not green and probably many people loves pink</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>And the scrub is a little more course than I like.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it works great- with a little shower gel or body scrub this sponge foams up like crazy and gets skin super smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>Would have liked it a little bigger as I bought these for my husband.</li>
      <li>Seems to do a good job of de-foliating man skin (we don&#x27;t exfoliate), removes grit, grease, grime, and tattoos if you scrub hard enough!</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s so big, it seems to not hold up its shape after the first use.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>However, the one I received WAS NOT GREEN.  </li>
      <li>Product is as soft as a baby&#x27;s sponge, just wasn&#x27;t as described.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I thought it would be harsher, it was a tad too soft for me.</li>
      <li>I have to order a few more for back ups.  </li>
      <li>The size is good, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like the hardness or harshness of the scrubber.</li>
      <li>A smaller size may fix this issue, so don&#x27;t try this extra large size.</li>
      <li>X large is not very large.</li>
      <li>barely the size of your hand.</li>
      <li>I live by myself, so I&#x27;ll rock this pink one anyways.</li>
      <li>this product always helps me keep clean and refreshed after a long hard working day at the oil rigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month, so not sure how long it&#x27;ll last.</li>
<li> I have always used this ,but finding it where i live is really hard.</li>
<li> (it IS coarse, just not super rough...)</li>
<li> It collapses when wet.</li>
<li> It does not scrub as I expected.</li>
<li> This sponge is about the size of a sandwich, covered with a rough material on both sides, and has a elastic band over one side so that it&#x27;s sort of like a &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; for exfoliating.</li>
<li> If you have dry flaky skin and find the smaller exfoliating scrubber too small for your hand use this one.</li>
<li> They do tend to snag on rings and earrings - be careful !</li>
<li> I had this scrubbie one other time</li>
<li> The scrubber gets floppy after getting wet a few times.</li>
<li> The grip is hard to apply force and the surface is not &amp;#34;scaly&amp;#34; enough to scrap off dead skins.</li>
<li> It scrubs without being too harsh.</li>
<li> Downside is that it has an antimicrobial chemical embedded in it - I usually try to avoid products like that.</li>
<li> This makes it hard to wash because it folds over itself while trying to scrub.</li>
<li> Hopefully I get at least 3 months out of this thing.</li>
<li> finally no more dirt or makeup stains on my rag!!!</li>
<li> This thing makes any soap lather like crazy.</li>

    <li> The scrubber gets floppy after getting wet a few times. This makes it hard to wash because it folds over itself while trying to scrub. A smaller size may fix this issue, so don&#x27;t try this extra large size.</li>
    <li> I rated this product 5 stars! This product is the best body scrubber I&#x27;ve come across and nothing else beats it. I started purchasing this scrubber online because none of the locals store sells it anymore. I don&#x27;t have an dislikes about this product. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good scrubber.</li>
    <li> I have always used this ,but finding it where i live is really hard.I found it thru you ..The item is awesome,it really works Great on your skin...Its&#x27;  easier than anything I have found, One pad will last Two months...The best part is that you do not have a mess in the shower.Thanks so much...</li>
    <li> I originally found these in a local store so I&#x27;m glad I could order online as they are great. These are great bath/shower sponges and I really love how the surface of these are good for exfoliating. They make my skin feel so invigorated. They come in two sizes.</li>
    <li> I love these - they really help me scrub off dirt - grime anything!  They do tend to snag on rings and earrings - be careful !</li>
    <li> Hell yeah this product always helps me keep clean and refreshed after a long hard working day at the oil rigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have been buying this item for a couple years now and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> If you have dry flaky skin and find the smaller exfoliating scrubber too small for your hand use this one.</li>
    <li> Good size, but because it&#x27;s so big, it seems to not hold up its shape after the first use. It collapses when wet. And the scrub is a little more course than I like. But it does exfoliate as advertised. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month, so not sure how long it&#x27;ll last. Hopefully I get at least 3 months out of this thing.</li>
    <li> I had bought a smaller one of these sponges and loved it.  Then I found the larger one and it is even better.&lt;br /&gt;Love this sponge on my skin.</li>
    <li> The pad feels great and it works ok but I&#x27;m used to using a loofa.  This is more like using a wash cloth that wasn&#x27;t softened by fabric softener.</li>
    <li> I have to order a few more for back ups.  This is a great scrubber for those who like a nice ruff surface.</li>
    <li> This is a Sponge-- but I like it just fine.  It scrubs without being too harsh. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for the first couple uses, then it&#x27;s not really an exfoliating spoinge anymore it&#x27;s just a sponge with a strap. But nonetheless I still use mine and I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This sponge is about the size of a sandwich, covered with a rough material on both sides, and has a elastic band over one side so that it&#x27;s sort of like a &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; for exfoliating.

    <li> Delivered on time and great product</li>
    <li> Love this larger body scrubber it has a loop on one side to hang in the shower, it does exactly what it was made to do, EXFOLIATE</li>
    <li> Hubby loves these to scrub his back. Good product</li>
    <li> OMG! Can I say...\\&quot;Best Cleansing Cloth ever\\&quot;...Wow! I actually like showering now (LOL)...My skin gets a spa treatment every time, its never felt better, plus the first time I used this thing I felt like I has lost ten lbs...no kidding. I just had to come look up the website (got mine in Marshall&#x27;s for $3.99 +tax)....You can literally see all the yukky dirt that it cleans off your skin...but guess what? Like magic it washes out like its brand new...finally no more dirt or makeup stains on my rag!!! This thing makes any soap lather like crazy. Its huge and literally stretches more than 3X its original length so cleaning my back has never been easier...it feels sooooo guddd!!! Un-freaking-believable...stocking up !!!! Great American made product &amp;lt;3! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about a month now, and it has held its shape nicely. It has great exfoliaters on it and they have not balled up or turned to pillage yet. It has an elastic handle on the back that I haven&#x27;t used and I don&#x27;t see the purpose of it, but it might be useful to someone, I suppose. Not that it matters, but mine is pink, even though the picture is blue.</li>
    <li> X large is not very large. barely the size of your hand. Would have liked it a little bigger as I bought these for my husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to sponges, but this one seems to work as intended.  However, the one I received WAS NOT GREEN.  I live by myself, so I&#x27;ll rock this pink one anyways.</li>
    <li> It is not green and probably many people loves pink I don&#x27;t, It is a sponge I do not like sponges as they got with the use, XL size is the  size of my hand. It is O.K.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is great, just make sure if you order it you are okay with receiving a pink one.</li>
    <li> This works well - it holds a lot of suds and is just the right roughness, which is to say noticeable but not damaging. Downside is that it has an antimicrobial chemical embedded in it - I usually try to avoid products like that.</li>
    <li> I had this scrubbie one other time and I didn&#x27;t remember where I got it ... I know it wasn&#x27;t on line ... But i&#x27;m thrilled I finally found it again and will be ordering another one for a backup for when this one wears out (which will be a long time ) !</li>
    <li> It does not scrub as I expected. The grip is hard to apply force and the surface is not &amp;#34;scaly&amp;#34; enough to scrap off dead skins.</li>

    <li> My wife has been using Cleanlogic Body Scrubbers for years.  She loves them.  Bought her first at the Tuesday Morning store.  They do not carry them on a regular basis.  I have to go online to purchase them.  It&#x27;s the simple things in life that can keep you the happiest.</li>
    <li> Out of the package it seemed scratchy, at least to my spouse, but felt absolutely wonderful on my skin in the shower.  Very gentle, very lightweight, and easy to lather up, but took a bit longer than a comparison loofah sponge to remove excess soap from the scrub.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I do love it. But would love it more if it had a bit more scrub to it. Kind of is not as affective when in liquid.</li>
    <li> Very durable, and cleans me very well.  this is not for people with sensitive skin, you need to be able to like being scrub clean!!  if you are that type of person than this product is for you.</li>
