      <li>;)</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I still feel the need to wash my hair every day, because when I don&#x27;t and use either this shampoo or my regular one, more hairs fall out during showering than not.</li>
      <li>Less hair in the drain equals more hair remaining on my head!</li>
      <li>I have fybro, and I had large amount of hair falling out in the shower.</li>
      <li>I do not like when company change their formula product and start substitute with cheap/ alternative ingredients, because it make it hard for customer to find a good shampoo in market.</li>
      <li>This comes out in a foam,  and it&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
      <li>bought a 3 month supply directly from their website (HairGenesis company) back in Oct. 2013 and was ok with the results</li>
      <li>This unique shampoo is also ALL NATURAL, all the ingredients are directly from nature.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so thick, and my scalp never before felt so clean and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have very long (to my waist) fine hair</li>
      <li>I do still use my conditioner because I find that this shampoo dries my hair (and flattens it; I normally have very wavy hair).</li>
      <li>Pumps stopped working and still have more than half a bottle.  </li>
      <li>But I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars because I do like their system (shampoo/conditioner/treatment) and was having decent, acceptable results.</li>
      <li>Before star using the product I installed a shower filter that will help with reducing Lead,Mercury, and chlorine which are one of the main cause for hair loss.</li>
      <li>Secondly there is an overwhelming menthol scent and when i put it in my hair trying to use it it actually burns my scalp.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo as a solution for thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m highly curious on how this shampoo is pure liquid (before turning into foam), if ingredients &amp;#34;claims&amp;#34; it contains many different types of OILS(Macadamia nut oil, seed oil, Evening Primrose Oil), which would make sense to result in a thicker oily shampoo...</li>
      <li>Because fybro can be very fickle about what you put in your body, I needed an all natural way to fix this problem.</li>

<li> this stuff works fast to stop hair loss....as long as you keep using it at least 3 times a week.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just a losing proposition in the long run.</li>
<li> You must of course, rule out other medical issues with family doc</li>
<li> There is absolutely no lather.</li>
<li> so please be careful if you plan on buying this product.</li>
<li> + dollars I spent.</li>
<li> My sixth bottle is difference from other bottles I purchased .</li>
<li> Two years of excessive hair loss and trying different products..</li>
<li> If you suffer from hormone-related hair loss due to PCOS, THIS is the stuff for you.</li>
<li> (I do not feel any buildup on my scalp, as I did with every other shampoo.)  </li>
<li> It was not worth the $30</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it every day; maybe 3-4 days per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t been using the shampoo as often as I should have, maybe down to 2-3 days a week.</li>
<li> It seems to have started working a little.</li>
<li> Wasted my money</li>
<li> Not sure why they just didn&#x27;t ship me the shampoo instead of refunding me the money.</li>
<li> Im not sure if there is batch issues or whats going on</li>
<li> I let it sit for a few minutes, but I still need to use conditioner with it because it seriously dries hair</li>
<li> Not till lately, I &#x60;ve noticed a change in formula.</li>
<li> I also have low Vit D levels so my hair has been falling out like crazy.</li>
<li> I use it 3 times a week and my hair loss has decreased quite a bit.</li>
<li> I noticed a slightly decreased amount of hair in the drain after the shower, but I have not noticed any regeneration...</li>
<li> Reviews are fake</li>
<li> I was not impressed with the shampoo, as it neither prevented hair from falling out nor made me want to commit to using it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
<li> I was desperate for finding another shampoo that work against hair loss.</li>
<li> Once i put in my hair it just disappears so its impossible to work into my hair.</li>
<li> I am really disappointed with product.</li>
<li> but this time around was terrible and unusable.</li>
<li> Terrible, would not lather up at all</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After Nixoin changer their formula and started manufactured their product in Mexico. I was desperate for finding another shampoo that work against hair loss. After a deep search, I came a cross HairGenesis and the product was great alternative. Before star using the product I installed a shower filter that will help with reducing Lead,Mercury, and chlorine which are one of the main cause for hair loss. Nonetheless, My hair was still falling for about week after using Hair Genesis \\&quot;which is normal stage it happens every time when you switch shampoos\\&quot;, and the second week my hair fall reduced by 79 percents. My hair start growing and the bald spots start to disappear after the third bottle. Moreover, the hair became thicker. I was amazed with product results. Not till lately, I &#x60;ve noticed a change in formula. My sixth bottle is difference from other bottles I purchased . It has a strong smell of menthol and my hair falls out much.  I am really disappointed with product. Now I have to search for another shampoo. I do not like when company change their formula product and start substitute with cheap/ alternative ingredients, because it make it hard for customer to find a good shampoo in market.</li>
    <li> Terrible, would not lather up at all</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 4 times. twice through this seller and twice through others. Love the product but the recent one i received is nothing like the previous. There is absolutely no lather. Once i put in my hair it just disappears so its impossible to work into my hair. Its like i am just washing my hair with water and no product. Secondly there is an overwhelming menthol scent and when i put it in my hair trying to use it it actually burns my scalp. Im not sure if there is batch issues or whats going on but this time around was terrible and unusable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 5 years now. I realize when I run out because my hair starts to fall out again. All I can tell you is... this stuff works fast to stop hair loss....as long as you keep using it at least 3 times a week. Well worth the cost to keep what I have.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has not done anything for my thinning hair.  It was not worth the $30+ dollars I spent.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever had in my life. My hair has never been so thick, and my scalp never before felt so clean and healthy.  I am a woman at 39 who had thinning hair all around.  After just two months of using HairGenesis Revitalizing Shampoo, I and my friends saw a visible differnece....Yes I do have fine hair, but now it is much thicker,has more volume, and my scalp feels very clean. (I do not feel any buildup on my scalp, as I did with every other shampoo.)  It has been six months now.  I am also taking 1 biotin supplement a day, and 1 vitamin a day.  Now, I have the best hair I have ever had in all of my life.  This shampoo did stop the falling of my hair, and cleanses my scalp the best so that deposits do not remain that could cause hair to fall. Of course, I keep my hair not longer than shoulder length, as longer hair does tend to fall more. This unique shampoo is also ALL NATURAL, all the ingredients are directly from nature. I highly recommend this shampoo as a solution for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> --- updated review ---&lt;br /&gt;Since my review I&#x27;ve finally received an email response to my many inquiries. They claim the order was never fulfilled (which it wasn&#x27;t) and that I wasn&#x27;t charged (which I was). I provided proof that they were paid by credit card via PayPal. They promptly send a full refund to my PayPal account. So the issue is somewhat resolved, but I never received the shampoo. Not sure why they just didn&#x27;t ship me the shampoo instead of refunding me the money. I guess they don&#x27;t want my business. But I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars because I do like their system (shampoo/conditioner/treatment) and was having decent, acceptable results. So beware of service, but their product was working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- original review ---&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 3 month supply directly from their website (HairGenesis company) back in Oct. 2013 and was ok with the results so I ordered a new one in March. I have yet to receive it. They charged my credit card, but the status shows never shipped. They will not answer my emails and their phone number gives busy signal every time. I think they went under so please be careful if you plan on buying this product. I&#x27;m going to contact Amex to see if I can contest the charge.</li>
    <li> It seems to have started working a little. But I didn&#x27;t keep up with it...it won&#x27;t make hair magically grow, but for people like me that have psoriasis, folliculitis, &amp; dermatitis on their scalp which causes the hair to thin, it really does help to re-vigorate ones scalp to help keep the blood circulating therefore bringing oxygen to the damaged parts to help the scalp renew the damaged area quicker &amp; healthier so the hair will grow back in &amp; stay in b/c of a healthier, vigorous scalp.</li>
    <li> Pumps stopped working and still have more than half a bottle.  Won&#x27;t try again.  Don&#x27;t know if it works??  Wasted my money</li>
    <li> Working on a return.  Didn&#x27;t seem to help hair loss at all.  I bought this because the pura d&#x27;or I had been using seemed to quit working.  I Was using the blue. This comes out in a foam,  and it&#x27;s very drying.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  You have to use a lot to seem to get your hair clean because it&#x27;s a foam.  Will update to a 3 if they process return without costing a fortune to return it.  Might work for some but didn&#x27;t for me.  Ordered the gold pura d&#x27;or and seems to be working again like the blue bottle did.  Just a top,  vitamins are crucial for women&#x27;s hair loss.  Vitamin D and iron are big factors.  I have quite the regimen,  but my stylist is impressed because I have a lot of regrowth.  I have hashimoto and hypothyroidism after a total thyroidectomy.  Good luck to women out there suffering like myself.</li>
    <li> I came back from I high stress environment working overseas with some major hair loss.  Utilizing this as directed has helped me grow back quite a bit of the hair I lost.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers amazing, the bottle lasts along long time.  Am I for sure its the thing thats working ?  I can&#x27;t be sure, but its pretty nice.</li>
    <li> The bottle looks different from the pic. I have fybro, and I had large amount of hair falling out in the shower. I started using this product for the dandruff, and bums forming on my scalp. It defiantly cleared up my scalp after about 2 weeks. Because fybro can be very fickle about what you put in your body, I needed an all natural way to fix this problem. If you are looking for a all natural way to take care of your scalp, you should defiantly give this a try.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 3 stars for now. I noticed a slightly decreased amount of hair in the drain after the shower, but I have not noticed any regeneration...yet, hopefully. I am using this shampoo on Mon, Wed, and Fri (just so I can remember) but may try it every day and then reduce by one day going forward. I do still use my conditioner because I find that this shampoo dries my hair (and flattens it; I normally have very wavy hair). I will update again in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Not bad but not what I thought it would be. I still see some thinning, but fewer hairs are in the drain after a shower. I don&#x27;t use it every day; maybe 3-4 days per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t been using the shampoo as often as I should have, maybe down to 2-3 days a week. I still feel the need to wash my hair every day, because when I don&#x27;t and use either this shampoo or my regular one, more hairs fall out during showering than not. What I have noticed is that the lather in the Hair Genesis has gotten bigger; it used to take 2 washings for any lather to show up. I let it sit for a few minutes, but I still need to use conditioner with it because it seriously dries hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on whether or not this stuff works. I did decline to buy the full product set; I do not wish to take a pill or anything to fight my own DNA...it&#x27;s just a losing proposition in the long run. I also still don&#x27;t like the flattening my hair has experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  6 months in and I have stopped using this product.  I was not impressed with the shampoo, as it neither prevented hair from falling out nor made me want to commit to using it. It flattened my hair too much and dried it out. I switched to Garnier Fructis and have noticed that less hair is falling out - sometimes none - and my hair looks good. I&#x27;d recommend the Garnier over the Hair Genesis. I&#x27;m settling on 2 stars, one for chemicals and one for effort.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working :)</li>
    <li> I actually think this stuff works... Go figure! Less hair in the drain equals more hair remaining on my head! ;)</li>
    <li> Did not stop hairloss nor revitalize hair for me.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from hormone-related hair loss due to PCOS, THIS is the stuff for you. For best results, use this stuff every day when you first get it, then you can cut it to 4 times a week. But trust me when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything out there from lifestyle changes to taking saw palmetto and NAC supplements... I can&#x27;t believe a topical shampoo solved my hair loss issues AND gave me a fresh crop of new growth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I was trying to stay away from sulfate shampoo because it strips your hair. When I use this shampoo, my hair does fell tingly but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I have very long (to my waist) fine hair and I found that from the first use of this shampoo my hair is now much thicker and cleaner!  It stays clean and is more easily styled too.  The scent is fresh and I really am hoping to get my husband to use it too!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but i feel like I should add my good experience with this product. I have thyroid disease and to boot I also have low Vit D levels so my hair has been falling out like crazy. I have tried everything out there except of that horrid Rogaine stuff. I purchased this as a last resort and used it with a lot of skepticism but I WORKS. I use it 3 times a week and my hair loss has decreased quite a bit. I still have some hair loss due to medical issues but this product does help one keep their precious hair. I would highly recommend it. I have only been using it for couple of weeks so I cant say i am having tons of new growth but what i have i am keeping it with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Pretty good only been using it for 4 weeks. It&#x27;s strong. But Im Still waiting to see result. Can&#x27;t complain so far. P.s. Get the conditioner too. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly curious on how this shampoo is pure liquid (before turning into foam), if ingredients &amp;#34;claims&amp;#34; it contains many different types of OILS(Macadamia nut oil, seed oil, Evening Primrose Oil), which would make sense to result in a thicker oily shampoo...</li>
    <li> Two years of excessive hair loss and trying different products..but just three days of using this and cut the loss in half  Happy happy. You must of course, rule out other medical issues with family doc but my gyn doc told me about this product to reduce DHT at scalp level.</li>
    <li> didnt help for me. Reviews are fake</li>
