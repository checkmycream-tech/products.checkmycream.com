      <li>Recently, I purchased Heatnclick&#x27;s pads to replace Earthing&#x27;s and they are vastly superior in many ways.</li>
      <li>found more pads on a cruise in Fort Lauderdale, and needed more with new mesager&#x27;.  </li>

      <li>I rinsed them off quickly with luke warm water, to make sure no body oils stayed on the pads, but still, the stickiness did not last long at all.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>and they work pretty well.</li>

      <li>liked them, sticky stuff only last about three uses.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>May be a little gummier but ok to use and they stick.</li>
      <li>I really needed these as my old ones wouldn&#x27;t stick anymore.  </li>
      <li>These work great, and for the price can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
      <li>These are long-lasting pads that are also easy to reactivate with a little water.</li>
      <li>Cost is far less than original equipment and they seem exactly the same.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
      <li>These are the same as the pad that came with my IQ massager and the price is much cheaper than buying them at the show I went to.</li>
      <li>The sticky surface is a little different than the originals but work fine.  </li>

      <li>I needed new pads for my Pinook mini massager for my lower back and couldn&#x27;t seem to find them local.</li>

    <li> liked them, sticky stuff only last about three uses.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re OK, they seem to work.  I could have bought them at a local drug store had I bothered to look.</li>
    <li> Gave 3 stars because they don&#x27;t stick well.</li>
    <li> These work just as well and last as long as the name brand ones.</li>
    <li> The sticky pads were exactly what we expected. They work with our IQ Massager, and we were able to buy more than one or two sets which was very nice.</li>
    <li> Fit my irest machine. Looks the same as the pads that came with it.</li>
    <li> easy to buy and well delivered</li>
    <li> As a user of Earthing technology for 4 years, their one INFERIOR product has been their patch for localized pain use. It&#x27;s expensive and fraught with problems. Recently, I purchased Heatnclick&#x27;s pads to replace Earthing&#x27;s and they are vastly superior in many ways. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> They work wonderful with my XFT-320 Tens Unit.</li>
    <li> All 5 showed up as promised, with no surprises.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> These work well. They did the job I expected them to. For the price you can&#x27;t bea them.</li>
    <li> this is a great purchase both product wise and price wise</li>
    <li> The pads met my expectations! Just like what you get from the mall.</li>
    <li> I really needed these as my old ones wouldn&#x27;t stick anymore.  They arrived as promised and work great!</li>
    <li> SIMPLY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!</li>
    <li> replacement for pads used over past  three years. Bought mesager at Mall in Portland on a Christmas trip. found more pads on a cruise in Fort Lauderdale, and needed more with new mesager&#x27;.  Great aid for sore shoulder when one can&#x27;t use pain relivers</li>
    <li> works well with my health mate unit.</li>
    <li> These word will with my Pinook mini massager</li>
    <li> Work good. The sticky surface is a little different than the originals but work fine.  Been using regularly since getting them.</li>
    <li> Bought a tens machine from a chart in the mall, finally needed replacement pads. These work great, and for the price can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
    <li> Super deal, now I have lots of extras.</li>
    <li> Outstanding replacement. Received in the time frame and in the condition stated in the ad.The adhesive is much better than the original making better contact.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!!!!  Works great and sticks just as good as the Original (Pinook)..  Price is Great..  5 Pairs for the price of 1 from Pinook.</li>
    <li> Very good and very relaxing</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, I just wish they were a bit more sticky &amp; thicker. I&#x27;ll continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> good deal --- work well and good price</li>
    <li> Only used once so far but it works perfectly.  Fits my mini masseuse massager.</li>
    <li> Product not great. it serves its purpose, however, you will get 3-5 uses from the sticky gel, then you need to lay on top of them or they won&#x27;t stick to you. I rinsed them off quickly with luke warm water, to make sure no body oils stayed on the pads, but still, the stickiness did not last long at all.</li>
    <li> These are long-lasting pads that are also easy to reactivate with a little water. They adhere well and are compatable with all snap type units. I gave the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the fabric covering is a little stiff and does not flex well over some areas of the body. They are a great value as compared to other pads and I have purchased them twice already.</li>
    <li> They work great with my Hi-Dow.</li>
    <li> These work great and are a good replacement as long as you only need the &#x27;smaller&#x27; pads.</li>
    <li> Loved these Massage pads... I need to order more.</li>
    <li> WORKE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Had these a while. They&#x27;re great was a fabulous deal!</li>
    <li> fit my healthmate tens unit. good price. good quality. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked as well as originals. May be a little gummier but ok to use and they stick.</li>
    <li> Perfect product &amp; fast sending!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> This produced fit my Palm Massager perfectly will be ordering more in the future</li>
    <li> Inexpensive replacement pads. Cost is far less than original equipment and they seem exactly the same.</li>
    <li> put to good use  aloha</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a good price!</li>
