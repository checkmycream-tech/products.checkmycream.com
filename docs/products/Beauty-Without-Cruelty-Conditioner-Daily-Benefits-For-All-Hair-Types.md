    <li> while the conditioner is on it leaves the hair easy to detangle, but as soon as you rinse it off its like you never applied it. the hair stays dry and not moisturized(at least for me).</li>
    <li> After using a wide variety of natural shampoos and conditioners (Desert Essence, Nature&#x27;s Gate, etc.), I feel that this has been the best for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down, doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, smells great, and is cruelty-free! I also need to emphasize how great this conditioner smells. It&#x27;s a light, citrusy, clean smell. Originally I received a sample in my Vegan Cuts beauty box and I was thrilled ever since I finished the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian, I have straight black hair (no color treatment), and I&#x27;m a low-maintenance type gal, so I don&#x27;t usually straight-iron or use products in my hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft with no residues. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Shiny, natural clean hair. BWC is the stuff you search for over the years. Something that makes your hair shiny and soft and not grossly stuck to your head half way through the day. Conditioner is tricky, this company found the right ingredients</li>
    <li> Great natural conditioner</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it. I bought several of their products thinking they were natural. The shampoo has sulfate in it and lists of other ingredients I&#x27;m not sure about. The conditioner has alcohol in it. I&#x27;m probably going to send them back. I guess the name implies no animal testing not necessarily natural. The brand came up as I surfed for natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent of this product, it&#x27;s so natural. And EWG gives it the score 3, what&#x27;s not perfect but much better than other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now. I love this. My hair gets oily fast, so I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner, but this is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t over condition. It smells great, and it the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free is just a super bonus. I&#x27;m very picky about beauty products, this is one my top favorites. I even have my boyfriend using it now!</li>
    <li> I really love the performance of this hair conditioner. I have a very thick head of hair and this product is lush and does a great job of softening and taming it. I bought it faithfully for quite a while thinking it was completely animal-product free and cruelty free but I read somewhere that it is vegetarian only. It&#x27;s a great product and is very cost effective but I&#x27;ll continue to also use Broo products until I fully understand its standing as Veg or vegan.</li>
    <li> I was not aware of Beauty Without Benefits, until I read reviews of it on Amazon. Most consumers seem really happy with their products. I can see why. This conditioner is thick, so, you really don&#x27;t need too much of it. You use it with their Daily Benefits Conditioner, as a companion to it, to ensure proper absorption of nutrients, without completely leaving your hair stripped, sans moisture. After you have left this on your hair for about two minutes or so, rinse completely. My hair is shiny, manageable and soft. Also, it isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavey long hair, and this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a nice subtle herbal scent, and it does not weigh down my hair, bring out my natural waviness.  I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances, and this one does not bother me at all.  Also, it has good ingredients, and the dangerous manmade ingredients are not in this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love, love , love this brand. Works very good for me, the smell is light and citrusy, texture is nice and rinses very well. I never buy any of high salon products anymore. My hair looks healthy, easy to manage and very strong.</li>
