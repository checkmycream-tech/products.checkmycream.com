<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!  </li>
<li> I tried leaving it on the counter overnight upside down thinking it will either leak like crazy or at least the oil should lubricate around the ball</li>
<li> These are poorly crafted &amp; the seller doesn&#x27;t care once they have your money.</li>
<li> Frustrated</li>

    <li> Great product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> Great size to carry my essential oils in my purse. I have had to use my headache blend a few times and it&#x27;s so convenient not to have to carry the large bottles around.</li>
    <li> Great size to give away a small amount of oil for someone to try.  Love these!  I have ordered these a few times and still like them.</li>
    <li> Love these bottles.  Arrived in perfect condition .</li>
    <li> Do not bother with these.  I mixed up several oils and gave them as gifts to friends only to get phone calls that the oils would not come out of the bottle.  Either the rollers didn&#x27;t roll or they could roll them with their finger but not get them to dispense to apply.  I tried one myself after being alerted of this.  The oils would not dispense, I even tried priming the ball with some oil to help facilitate the process.  Frustrated I contacted the seller.  The seller advised that &amp;#34;if the ball rolls, the oil will come out, and to tap the bottom while holding the bottle upside down.&amp;#34;  So I tried doing so &amp; still nothing came out.  I tried leaving it on the counter overnight upside down thinking it will either leak like crazy or at least the oil should lubricate around the ball and it should dispense.  Still nothing. I have tried repeatedly to rub the roller on my arm, shaking, tapping &amp; pushing down hard &amp; it just will not dispense.  Finally, I pulled the whole roller mechanism out &amp; threw it away.  Now it is just basically a small vial that I apply with my finger.  I have bought from other sellers &amp; never had this problem. These are poorly crafted &amp; the seller doesn&#x27;t care once they have your money.</li>
    <li> Perfect use for kids and perfect travel use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!  The rollerball does not work.  The ball snaps down into a tight plastic top and DOES NOT roll at all.  Do NOT purchase these!!</li>

    <li> 2ml is tiny.  The ball does roll pretty well, but has some trouble simply due to size constraints.</li>
    <li> Great Seller AAA+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx...</li>
    <li> These are great little bottles.  Convenient to carry with you.  Not too big.</li>

    <li> rollers do not work correctly</li>

    <li> I love these. It took several rolls to get the ball moving but once I got it &amp;#34;rollin&amp;#34; they have worked as expected and NO LEAKS so far!  I love them for travel size blends to keep in my purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> I buy little bottles from Grand Parfums all the time.  Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cute bottles - great idea, but the roller fitments don&#x27;t work.  They don&#x27;t roll.  The one bottle I tried, the roller ball popped out.  After some back &amp; forth emails, they are in the process of refunding me once they received the 5 unused ones I returned.  So, I&#x27;m happy they are doing the right thing.</li>
