      <li>To be completely fair, I think if it were truly toxic, there would be a more general warning than, &amp;#34;Solvent abuse can kill instantly.&amp;#34; And I will also acknowledge that, yes, butane and propane are heavier than air, so they should sink away from where I&#x27;m breathing fairly quickly.</li>

      <li>The Batiste Dry Shampoo definitely works the best at getting rid of the oily look and feel of my hair.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh, neutral smell, and makes my hair fresh in between shampoos.</li>
      <li>This half size is great for travel but the large bottle is worth it.</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use it to make cow-licks go away - if you spray it in that area, you can get it to all come out together - kind of like the classic football helmet, except you don&#x27;t have to make your hair be that big.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this.  </li>

      <li>Just practice a few times at home before you go full zombie out the house.</li>

    <li> Made my hair &amp;#34;white/gray&amp;#34; - so disappointed. Sprays on w/ a white/gray tint.  Makes me look 70+.  Very disappointing. Not worth the time &amp; effort to send back.  I&#x27;ve used this before &amp; really liked it so I came to Amazon to get it @ a better price.  I think the products I bought on here are OLD???  I don&#x27;t know else to explain it....</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo that actually works and this small size is perfect for a trip. Just gives your hair the lift it often needs on day 2.</li>
    <li> Product works fine; however, product seems to weigh hair down until washed out. Does not give hair any body as expected. I might use product once a month.</li>
    <li> According to my own experience, this product is not suitable for oily hair.And this is also much smaller that I expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried Redkin brand and it did nothing.  I love using it after a work out if I don&#x27;t have time to shower.  I get greasy hair really easily and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite among all the brands I&#x27;ve tried so far, including Bumble &amp; Bumble, Sexy Hair and Tresemme. It is a powder based system and it is white in color - so I need to be careful to rub it all in on my black hair, so it doesn&#x27;t look like yucky dandruff. Unlike all other brands of dry shampoo which left my hair feeling sticky, Batiste gives a clean feel after use. It even adds a little bit of shine to my hair when I brush it through. In addition, I love that it comes in a 1.6 oz. travel size - this is perfect for my job which requires a substantial amount of air travel. My only complaint is that I run out of it far too quickly - I wish there was a way to &#x27;Subscribe &amp; Save&#x27; with this product.</li>
    <li> love this!&lt;br /&gt;my sister is a hair stylist so i usually stick to the top brands she recommends, but gave this a try when i was desperate on a business trip because it was all i could find.&lt;br /&gt;Totally pleased and ordered more on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible to have this dirty hair, and this stuff really makes you look fine for another day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use it to make cow-licks go away - if you spray it in that area, you can get it to all come out together - kind of like the classic football helmet, except you don&#x27;t have to make your hair be that big.</li>

    <li> I have dark brown hair and bangs.  I was using baby powder before I tried this, but it only worked for a couple of hours.  If you follow the directions - there&#x27;s no powdery residue, it works great!  I only used it on my bangs, but it worked all day and into the next. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this.  It is a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY dry shampoos (expensive and inexpensive) and this seems to be the best one! I love that it is at a great price too! Always have the full size and travel size on hand.</li>

    <li> I have dark red hair and I worried that it would leave my hair white. Well I do think it lightens my hair very slightly but not like other dry shampoos (Aveeno) that I&#x27;ve used. I used it the other day and got a compliment on my hair looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; so I think it&#x27;s fine. I like the smell and I usually just use it at my part and by my ears. My hair is very thick and I have a lot of it so generally I don&#x27;t wash it very often anyway but this helps me out a lot! I highly recommend it. This half size is great for travel but the large bottle is worth it. You can now pick this up in CVS and Urban Outfitters has carried it for some time. Just in case you can&#x27;t wait for delivery from trusty Amazon. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have fine hair and it requires to be washed daily, but there are times when that is not possible. This product works well to absorb the oil and leave your hair more presentable until you can get a shower in. It&#x27;s not something we could use on a daily basis, but works well for us in a pinch. We have tried the colored version, and find it to leave more of a residue than this. Both of us have dark blonde hair and it works for us.</li>
    <li> This product is a mini sample. Good to use for 2 times only, the product is Ok, expensive for a trial size</li>
    <li> Great for getting the oil, but a lot of white residue. Trade off I&#x27;m ok with. Just practice a few times at home before you go full zombie out the house.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin, fine hair, and have found dry shampoo to be a great styling product. I use it on wet (clean) hair to create volume. Lift sections, spray, repeat, then use your fingertips to sort of scrub it into the scalp and fluff the hair. Does a great job in giving my hair body. Batiste is a great brand and much more affordable than the stuff my stylist uses (same results).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.. and yes I followed directions. It left white in my hair where I sprayed it and didn&#x27;t seem to make it cleaner or fluffier.</li>
    <li> My hair gets oily very quickly, and I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos.  The Batiste Dry Shampoo definitely works the best at getting rid of the oily look and feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> I took this with me on a road trip when I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shower regularly. (My hair gets too oily for my liking after just one day of not showering.) I was extremely happy with the way it refreshed my hair, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-The small size was perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;-Shampoo was very easy to use: shake well, spray hair, massage into the scalp to even it out. It took literally five to ten seconds for me to get desired results.&lt;br /&gt;-It worked very well to remove the oily look and didn&#x27;t leave any visible residue on my hair (dirty-blond).&lt;br /&gt;-I have pretty fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;-The fragrance was a nice and mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-This shampoo is sort of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;-The product is extremely flammable, as labeled on the container.&lt;br /&gt;-The ingredients cause such concern to me that I will not be purchasing it anymore. Listed on the back of the container, &amp;#34;Ingredients: butane, isobutane, propane, oryza sativa (rice) starch, alcohol denat., parfum (fragrance), limonene, linalool, geraniol, benzyl benzoate, distearyldimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, every time I smell the product after I use it in my hair, I worry that I am also inhaling small amounts of butane and propane. To be completely fair, I think if it were truly toxic, there would be a more general warning than, &amp;#34;Solvent abuse can kill instantly.&amp;#34; And I will also acknowledge that, yes, butane and propane are heavier than air, so they should sink away from where I&#x27;m breathing fairly quickly. But I&#x27;m just not comfortable. For a much cheaper price, I will sacrifice a bit of convenience/effectiveness and just use plain rice starch instead.</li>
    <li> Nothing special with this product.</li>
    <li> My hair looks oily sometimes, so I thought it would make it look better. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do the work.</li>
