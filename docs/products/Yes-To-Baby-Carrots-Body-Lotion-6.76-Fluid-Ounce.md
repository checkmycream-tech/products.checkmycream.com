      <li>I prefer a lotion with some scent to it, but my husband HATES strong odors of any kind.  </li>
      <li>Love the \\&quot;clean-ness\\&quot; of the product.  </li>
      <li>Love Yesto Carrots.</li>
      <li>Not just for babies. :)</li>
      <li>The EWG rates that ingredient as an 8 on its scale of 0-8 for reproductive toxicity tests.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to keep searching for a more safe lotion.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Desert Essence Baby Lotion</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion for babies with sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how light this lotion is.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, it makes my sons skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Great natural lotion that is moisturizing and leaves a clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>That is when I switched to cetaphil cream and noticed a HUGE difference in his skin.</li>
      <li>Both my coworker and I use it every time we wash our hands, and we both enjoy it.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and spreads well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s our new favorite!</li>
      <li>If you baby does not have dry skin, then this works great along with the wash.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well &amp; good as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>being safe, 10 being highly toxic.</li>
      <li>I find that this product works best as a daily moisturizer if you or your kids don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, but instead are just using it for maintenance to add a bit of moisture and softness to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the light smell of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is great for an everyday moisturizer lotion for you or your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>I love this brand for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>There is no grease, it just soaks right in.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>I find that it leaves our skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The lotion is hypoallergenic and sinks into my skin nicely.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more in the future.  </li>
      <li>then I suggest asking your doctor or pharmacist for a stronger, more moisturizing lotion, like Cetaphil or Eucerin, or a prescription lotion, if necessary.</li>
      <li>The first was on the baby wash that goes with this product.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it rubs into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>We really like this alternative</li>
      <li>It is not too thick and great for babies sensitive skin and the tube is really big the first tube lasted 9 months.</li>
      <li>But if you or your child only has mild to slightly moderately dry skin, and you want a light, almost odorless, non-greasy lotion, then I recommend Yes to Carrots.</li>
      <li>Decent price point.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is not clean or safe for babies,toddlers or anyone for that matter.</li>
      <li>Now my infants skin isn&#x27;t dry at all, but I just don&#x27;t find this to leave her skin soft, feels like cheap lotion.</li>
      <li>My son has extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find this to be a soft creamy lotion at all.</li>
      <li>Although this lotion does have a scent, it is very understated and does not last very long after application.</li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin and has problems with some other natural products but not with this one!</li>

<li> you or your child has eczema or extremely dry skin</li>
<li> aware product is on the thin side, not a cream.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and is different than the typical Johnson&#x27;s.</li>
<li> However, it is not for skin with problems with dry patches or eczema as it is not strong enough to moisturize extremely dry skin.</li>
<li> It makes me sick that so many companies put harmful ingredients in their products and market them as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> However, after I few weeks, I noticed that my son had some dry patches, not even 2 hours after using this product.</li>
<li> My son had terrible eczema soon after he was born and this moisturizer works instantly on any dry skin patches he has.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have an annoying odor, and is practically odorless.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second review on Amazon ever. The first was on the baby wash that goes with this product. This product is not clean or safe for babies,toddlers or anyone for that matter. There is an app called &amp;#34;Think Dirty&amp;#34; that rates products on their safety. 0 being safe, 10 being highly toxic. This product was rated a 9.....9!!! For developmental and reproductive toxicity. It makes me sick that so many companies put harmful ingredients in their products and market them as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;. At the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t matter what the label says but what the ingredients say.</li>
    <li> Read the different labels of yes products, THE INGREDIENTS ARE ALL THE SAME.  Would you trust these folks with your baby?</li>
    <li> I prefer a lotion with some scent to it, but my husband HATES strong odors of any kind.  This lotion has virtually no smell and he loved it.  It goes on nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for babies with sensitive skin! We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It goes on after every bath as part of our daughters bedtime routine. She loves it. There is no grease, it just soaks right in.</li>
    <li> I love this brand for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the light smell of this lotion.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering and is different than the typical Johnson&#x27;s. Also, it is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Very nice, it makes my sons skin soft and smooth.  He has very sensitive skin and has problems with some other natural products but not with this one!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very gentle on baby&#x27;s skin. However, after I few weeks, I noticed that my son had some dry patches, not even 2 hours after using this product. That is when I switched to cetaphil cream and noticed a HUGE difference in his skin. If you baby does not have dry skin, then this works great along with the wash. If they do, I recommend using the wash and switching to a moisturizer like cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after Amazon stopped shipping the Burt&#x27;s bees.  We really like this alternative, it&#x27;s smooth and spreads well.  And, I&#x27;ve heard great things about this company.  Will be buying more in the future.  It&#x27;s our new favorite!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s not slimey and goes on well. It&#x27;s really good for our cloth diaper solutions as well. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great natural lotion that is moisturizing and leaves a clean feeling.  I prefer something a bit thicker in the winter months.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion looking for a healthier and safer alternative to the big name brands, but was alarmed to find retinyl  palmitate listed as an ingredient on the label. The EWG rates that ingredient as an 8 on its scale of 0-8 for reproductive toxicity tests.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to keep searching for a more safe lotion.</li>
    <li> My son had terrible eczema soon after he was born and this moisturizer works instantly on any dry skin patches he has.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how light this lotion is.  My son has extremely sensitive skin and this is our go to lotion.</li>
    <li> We have been using this lotion since our son was a newborn.  It is not too thick and great for babies sensitive skin and the tube is really big the first tube lasted 9 months.</li>
    <li> Love Yesto Carrots. Smells great and is great for sensitive skin.  This is the only line of products my baby girl uses.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a very thin, light lotion with no greasy feel and no fragrence. Although this lotion does have a scent, it is very understated and does not last very long after application. The lotion is hypoallergenic and sinks into my skin nicely.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Absorbs well &amp; good as a daily moisturizer.  Love the \\&quot;clean-ness\\&quot; of the product.  Decent price point.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware product is on the thin side, not a cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be a soft creamy lotion at all. My son is 3 yo and I put it on him at night, by the next morning his legs look dry. Now my infants skin isn&#x27;t dry at all, but I just don&#x27;t find this to leave her skin soft, feels like cheap lotion. I LOVE Desert Essence Baby Lotion My Sweetie Pie - found it after not liking this purchase. Smells wonderful and leaves my kids skin soft.</li>
    <li> I keep a tube of this lotion on my desk at work, and it works wonderfully as a hand lotion. Both my coworker and I use it every time we wash our hands, and we both enjoy it. Not just for babies. :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for an everyday moisturizer lotion for you or your baby&#x27;s skin. It doesn&#x27;t have an annoying odor, and is practically odorless. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it rubs into the skin very well. I use it on my kids after the bath and on myself daily, as well. I find that it leaves our skin soft and smooth. However, it is not for skin with problems with dry patches or eczema as it is not strong enough to moisturize extremely dry skin. I find that this product works best as a daily moisturizer if you or your kids don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, but instead are just using it for maintenance to add a bit of moisture and softness to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you or your child has eczema or extremely dry skin then I suggest asking your doctor or pharmacist for a stronger, more moisturizing lotion, like Cetaphil or Eucerin, or a prescription lotion, if necessary.
