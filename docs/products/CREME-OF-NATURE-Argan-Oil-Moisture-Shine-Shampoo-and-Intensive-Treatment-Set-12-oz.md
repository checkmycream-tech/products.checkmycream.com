      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all but seems to work.</li>
      <li>MY hair smells really good..</li>
      <li>Product smells really really good</li>
      <li>It was surprising to me when the product arrived and it contained parabens.</li>
      <li>This is not the best smelling product I have used but it is well worth trying!</li>
      <li>Shampoo is OK but could have done better elsewhere sulfate-free conditioner wise!!  </li>
      <li>A noticeable difference shows in the sheen and healthy look of my hair!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love them all!</li>

      <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling like silk and my hair smells so amazing for days after conditioning.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say I can see the difference in the softness of my hair.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way my hair felt after I used it.</li>
      <li>I get stopped tworking to three times a week by people asking me what do I use and complimenting how nice and bouncy my hair is.</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the shampoo</li>
      <li>It smelled nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The conditioner smells okay, kind of smokey and vanilla-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far the best detangling shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for those of us with naturally kinky curly hair.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have a hooded heater to sit under, you&#x27;ll have better luck with this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m better off buying Herbal Essence or Pantene...</li>
      <li>Love the way they smell</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE.</li>
      <li>I love creme of nature shampoo and conditioner.</li>

      <li>I have finally found a product that makes our hair smell, look and feel great!</li>
      <li>I love that this product line is sulfate-free.</li>
      <li>Love Argan Oil products</li>
      <li>I love how I can wash my hair more than one time without it feeling like it stripping moisture out.</li>
      <li>It smells VERY good, but I need to use like half the bottle of shampoo to get a good lather, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and it detangles both natural and relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>I love the agran oil shampoo sulfate free and it does hydrates and detangle the hair</li>
      <li>int it, all natural and works great for my waves.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I used my shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo...which btw is the absolute best shampoo ever, I absolutely recommend it)</li>
      <li>I was hesitate to use this because I was trying to avoid shampoos for my fine type 3 hair.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good too; they both have an usual but great smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Great product for the entire family.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is not sulfate free</li>
      <li>Smooth and no tangles after use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different hair shampoos and conditioner for my daughter who has really curly hair, and this is 1000% the BEST!!!!!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it dried her hair out even more!!!</li>
      <li>pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to something in this, so</li>
      <li>Clean my hair without stripping.</li>
      <li>And it leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>I love how soft my hair feels and how nicely my curls formed, but my hair was pretty frizzy.</li>
      <li>Requirement to wear a cap and under dry is over the top!!</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo not so much the conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair has behaved very well with it and when I ran out I will be looking for more.</li>
      <li>hair feels nice and soft</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any true difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>Well, super frizzy.</li>
      <li>It will leave your hair smelling delicious all day and night, and I just pair it with my other Organic Coconut Milk or Burt&#x27;s Bees Volume conditioner because it seems to be lacking in something, but works better paired with other natural conditioners. :)</li>
      <li>It left my hair smelling amazing.</li>
      <li>The conditioner actually smelled nice, and after my hair was done, I did like the smell.</li>
      <li>My hair never felt better because I&#x27;m going natural now</li>
      <li>I have used it frequently and just love it.  </li>
      <li>The price is fair and reasonable, but I wish that they came in a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>It cost more but it works better and its a safer product that I know both the shampoo and conditioner do not have sulfer and a bunch of other things</li>
      <li>LOVE this product, it feels good, smells good and is one of the few sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s that actually foams a little.</li>
      <li>In all, I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos that I&#x27;ve liked much more.</li>
      <li>but  it leaves it soft and easy to manage</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel much moisture after my first or second use, but the smell is RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased more and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I really really like the smell too!</li>
      <li>After the first shampooing, my hair breakage was to a minimum and after 3 shampooing and conditioning treatments, my hair is no longer falling out or breaking.  </li>
      <li>The first day I used it</li>
      <li>so you are constantly using more..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Likes the way it makes my hair feel and smell</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells like hair dye. Shampoo and conditioner combo made my hair dry and frizzy. Only used it once but the smell and frizziness made me return the product.</li>
    <li> The product worked better than expected .. the smell is not so bad but it made my wavy curly hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is a scam It made my hair dry and itch af</li>
    <li> leaves hair too heavy</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the way is softens your hair without weighing it down. And it leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> made my hair greasy.. maybe just not for my type of hair</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works well</li>
    <li> I love that this product line is sulfate-free. In addition, the shampoo and conditioners are great detanglers. It is perfect for those of us with naturally kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling soft and clean</li>
    <li> I have used it frequently and just love it.  My hair has behaved very well with it and when I ran out I will be looking for more.</li>
    <li> I love the agran oil shampoo sulfate free and it does hydrates and detangle the hair it does what it says. I love how I can wash my hair more than one time without it feeling like it stripping moisture out. Makes it soft and easy to manage and actually feel it moisturized. The argan oil intensive conditioner treatment is great I don&#x27;t have a problem with it but it does great also with detangle and does what it says. I don&#x27;t see how a product like this make your hair hard for some of the comments on this. Everything isn&#x27;t for everyone hair everybody hair is different. I&#x27;m actually planning on continuing using this awesome product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is wonderful. Moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped. The conditioner is so-so. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair any easier to detangle even after I leave it in with a cap on.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has to be the worst this stuff dries your hair out and u don&#x27;t get a good lather so you are constantly using more..going in the garbage</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling like silk and my hair smells so amazing for days after conditioning.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE. I&#x27;ve been using this set for a few months and I can honestly say I can see the difference in the softness of my hair. I will continue using this set for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are great for my hair. Smooth and no tangles after use. Clean my hair without stripping.</li>

The conditioner is good too; they both have an usual but great smell. The price is fair and reasonable, but I wish that they came in a bigger bottle. Love this combo.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is OK but could have done better elsewhere sulfate-free conditioner wise!!  Requirement to wear a cap and under dry is over the top!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any true difference in my hair. And the treatment made my hair tangle. I would recommend Pantene</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> These products were recommend by my stylist. I started using them in December 2013, and I must say, &amp;#34; My weave looks fabulous.&amp;#34; I would recommend these products to all my fellow 100% Indian human hair sisters.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This particular product,  my hair didn&#x27;t agree with</li>
    <li> Love!! MY hair smells really good..especially when I braid it wet and take out later! Recommend not blow drying hair after using since the scent is 10x stronger</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was not happy with this product. The shampoo left my hair feeling dirty and limp. The conditioner is not actually for everyday use, but for use sitting under a heater. Without the heater, using it like a regular conditioner, the ends of my hair were straw-like and brittle. Maybe if you have a hooded heater to sit under, you&#x27;ll have better luck with this. In all, I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos that I&#x27;ve liked much more.</li>
    <li> Love it! A noticeable difference shows in the sheen and healthy look of my hair!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I opened the box to see how small the bottles were for the price.  Expecting normal size bottles of shampoo.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> i love these products! the seller wrapped them up so that they would travel well and not be damaged. and for the price i will be buying again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, it feels good, smells good and is one of the few sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s that actually foams a little. I have purchased more and would definitely recommend this product. Icing on the cake its a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a vlog on natural hair, but shampoo stripped my hair and conditioner did absolutely nothing for my 4B hair. Product smells really really good (that amber smell) but pass on this one naturals category 4. I&#x27;m wating to pass it on to a 3ABC sister.</li>
    <li> Great product for the entire family. I have finally found a product that makes our hair smell, look and feel great!</li>
    <li> My daugher is mixed race and I have been in search of something that will help her hair. I was told by several people Cream of Nature products work wonders. So, I bought these expecting good results. Unfortunately, it dried her hair out even more!!! I tossed them out after the 1st use. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is absolute and utter trash. It left my hair dry, tangly, knotted mess. It&#x27;s probably the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Love it! The first day I used it I wore my hair down, walked into work and the two girls I was working with that day and immediately same at time said, &amp;#34;YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO THICK!&amp;#34;.... I have really thin hair and this definitely makes my hair feel soft and super thick. I love it! I also bought a &amp;#34;Straight and shine leave in conditioner,&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Perfect 7 in 1 treatment&amp;#34;,  and the oil treatment. I love them all! I really really like the smell too! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow. Perfection in hair care products. I have struggled my entire life with coarse, frizzy, horse- like hair. I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars trying to manage my seemingly genetic and incurable &#x27;curse&#x27; for hair. Not only have I had issues with my hair but i have had yet to find a cleansing or conditioning product to relieve my dry, flaky, and very sensitive scalp. THIS IS THE CURE ALL! My scalp issues... GONE. My horse- like hair... soft and shiny. This is not the best smelling product I have used but it is well worth trying! It may not be for everyone- if you have fine, thin, or greasy hair this may not be for you but for those with coarse hair give it a try! You WILL NOT be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> The shipping was great. This product is excellent for weaves. It leave ypur weave shiny and like new. Would reccommend on human/remy hair</li>
    <li> I have used Creme of Nature for years so thought I would try this. Conditioner better than shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all but seems to work.</li>
    <li> Love the way they smell</li>
    <li> My hair never felt better because I&#x27;m going natural now my hair is so thick but  it leaves it soft and easy to manage</li>
    <li> This product is awesome great smell however in my package I only received the shampoo and not the conditioner hopefully I can get this worked out because I paid 17 bucks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this shampoo and conditioner are formulated for my hair type.  I&#x27;m a blonde caucasion.  They didn&#x27;t work so well for me.  The shampoo worked a couple times but the conditioner made my hair feel strange.</li>
    <li> I saw this on some beauty site that recommended the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products for curly hair. Well...I have very thick, curly, medium length hair, and this set is horrible. It smells VERY good, but I need to use like half the bottle of shampoo to get a good lather, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I&#x27;m better off buying Herbal Essence or Pantene...</li>
    <li> I seriously wish I could be an ambassador for this company and be provided a lifetime supply lol.  I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different hair shampoos and conditioner for my daughter who has really curly hair, and this is 1000% the BEST!!!!!  It takes very little (like quarter size) shampoo to make a very rich and creamy lather, not sudsy, it&#x27;s a creamy lather! It&#x27;s AMAZING!  It&#x27;s hard to describe how this feels when I put it in her hair, like it turns into slithery creamy clean hair.  You just have to try it to understand.  I like the conditioner as well, both of these together are exactly what I&#x27;ve been wanting and I&#x27;ve purchased them already a few times this year.  These are a little higher than other shampoo and conditioner, but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> SHAMPOO: heavy chemical smell / very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;CONDITIONER: Smells nicer than the shampoo / made my hair feel soft, but also made my hair super frizzy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching for products to use on my thick/curly/mixed race hair (I&#x27;m guessing type 3B), I found Creme of Nature brought up by a few different bloggers and users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo felt very moisturizing and lathers very well for a sulfate-free shampoo. I really liked the way my hair felt after I used it. My only complaint about the shampoo is that is has a very heavy chemical smell. It reminded me of what hair smells like right after using at-home / boxed hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner had a tiny hint of that smell, but it was not as strong as the shampoo. It smelled a little sweeter and it did overpower the overall chemical smell of the shampoo. The conditioner actually smelled nice, and after my hair was done, I did like the smell. It smelled nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied conditioner and then combed out my hair with a wide-toothed comb. I was a little worried at this point because my hair seemed more tangled than usual. This conditioner did not allow a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when it came to combing out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do not have access to an overhead heater (as recommended in the directions), I put my hair in a processing cap and then applied heat via a blow dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. I rinsed and then allowed my hair to air dry. I love how soft my hair feels and how nicely my curls formed, but my hair was pretty frizzy. Well, super frizzy. I dampened my hair again and added coconut oil, and that did the trick. It is irritating though, because I co-wash often with just about any conditioner I can find and I don&#x27;t usually have this much frizz. The next day, my hair felt really dry and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the shampoo but I am hesitant to use the conditioner again. I will try it again in a week or so since it is an &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34;. I doubt I would buy the conditioner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Tried the conditioner again. Was not impressed. Threw it out and went with another brand instead.gain. Was not impressed. Threw it out and went with another brand instead.</li>
    <li> My hair was breaking off due to over processing.  Tried the Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature Argan Oil Moisture products and feel in love.  After the first shampooing, my hair breakage was to a minimum and after 3 shampooing and conditioning treatments, my hair is no longer falling out or breaking.  In fact, I am noticing my split ends are on the mend.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its nice , but the conditioners smell gives me a headache and it is so hard to wash off, its like no matter how much you scrub its still soapy</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells funny and the shampoo even has a weird smell to it as well. If your a srious waver and your looking for an over the counter product, use the Shea Moisture products. It cost more but it works better and its a safer product that I know both the shampoo and conditioner do not have sulfer and a bunch of other things int it, all natural and works great for my waves.</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this shampoo but I have tried washing my hair with it several times and have had the same results each time. After using it my hair feels like it&#x27;s coated with something. It doesn&#x27;t feel clean. In fact the last time I tried it my hair felt so yucky that I actually got back next the shower and washed my hair again with a different shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love creme of nature shampoo and conditioner. I have medium coily hair and these products work really well for me. Especially the conditioner treatment I always use it for my co wash. And it leaves my hair very hydrated and my curls are defined.</li>
    <li> I got the conditioner at WalMart for $4.96 I think? Under $5 anyways.  It was a last minute/rushed purchase for a natural conditioner (I already had shampoo, I go through conditioner twice as fast as shampoo!;). Anyways, I used my shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo...which btw is the absolute best shampoo ever, I absolutely recommend it) then used my new Argan Oil Conditioner.  On the bottle it says to let the conditioner sit under a wrap on your head, under a hair dryer for 10-15 minutes...but I don&#x27;t ever do that, I just let it sit in my hair while I finish the rest of my shower. I didn&#x27;t really feel much moisture after my first or second use, but the smell is RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING.  It will leave your hair smelling delicious all day and night, and I just pair it with my other Organic Coconut Milk or Burt&#x27;s Bees Volume conditioner because it seems to be lacking in something, but works better paired with other natural conditioners. :)</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with this product yesterday and I have nothing negative to say.  The  shampoo feels better than the intensive treatment which is crazy I love the fact that the shampoo is sulfate free and didn&#x27;t dry my hair out left my hair feeling bouncy with less breakage.  Good buy</li>
    <li> It was surprising to me when the product arrived and it contained parabens. If someone goes through the trouble of excluding sulfates in their shampoo and boasts about it containing organic Argan oil, it seems that they would also leave out the parabens. No such luck. The shampoo contains 2 different types of parabens and the conditioner contains 5. The conditioner is not sulfate free eventhough it comes packaged with a sulfate-free shampoo. Why would someone care about sulfates in their shampoo but not in a leave-in conditioner? Makes no sense to me. Also why is there no mention of the parabens? I believe on average more people are paraben conscious than about sodium lauryl sulfate. The way this product is listed/described is misleading at best and uses trickery at worst. If you are trying to avoid ingredients that are questionable don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It feels good on your hair and it&#x27;s sulfate free. Everyone that uses this product that I know of Love it</li>
    <li> The shampoo + conditioner combination actually made my long, straight to slightly wavy hair less manageable than my usual non-fancy, non-salon quality shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized.  Also, the shampoo has an awful smell like household cleanser.  The conditioner smells okay, kind of smokey and vanilla-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to something in this, so I&#x27;ll be giving it to someone else.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans and conditions hair nicely hair feels nice and soft</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a favorite of mine. I had a bad dry scalp issue and used products that failed to cure it. I came across this when my mom purchased this from the Black Women&#x27;s Expo last year. I was hesitate to use this because I was trying to avoid shampoos for my fine type 3 hair. I gave it a try and was blown away. The itch was completely gone and I ended up with soft to the touch beautiful curls that felt like butter when applied on my wet hair. It left my hair smelling amazing. I had a sample of the intense conditioner and used that as a DC for 30 mins under my hair therapy wrap. The sample was enough because I have short hair. If you&#x27;re a natural, like me or transitioner, this product won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> terrible! After washing and conditioning, my hair was dry and tangled, like it wasn&#x27;t conditioned at all. Threw it out, will never use again.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner set I&#x27;ve found,</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo not so much the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that has helped to revive my badly damaged hair. I am African American and had the unfortunate experience of having my hair over processed over  a 15 year time frame. My hair broke off and this product has helped to grow back my and hair and get it back to beautiful naturally curly thick state again. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love Argan Oil products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Creme of Nature products for years. My hair is medium textured with a medium curl pattern and always seems to needs moisture. The shampoo and conditioner both do double duty in conditioning and detangling my hair. Because the shampoo is so conditioning I can sometimes just shampoo and leave it on my hair as a conditioner. My hair is soft, shiny and no tangles. When I do use the conditioner, I use it as a deep conditioner. I use only about a nickel to a quarter size of the conditioner as it weighs my hair down, but works great.</li>
    <li> Great product! ! I&#x27;ve been using for several months now and I can see a major change in my hair. I get stopped tworking to three times a week by people asking me what do I use and complimenting how nice and bouncy my hair is. This product line is a must buy.</li>
    <li> If feels great in the shower when you put it through your hair but after that my hair looked like it had been run over by 2 dumptrucks and then a family of mice ran through it. Horrible, horrible, horrible.</li>
