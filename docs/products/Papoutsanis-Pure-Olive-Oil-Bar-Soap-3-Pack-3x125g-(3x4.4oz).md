      <li>I was pleased.</li>

      <li>So clean, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>Leaves a squeaky clean feeling, so nice in that way.  </li>
      <li>It rinses off so easily.</li>
      <li>It is an olive soap, so I did not expect it to smell fragrant or floral, but this seemed quite strong to me.  </li>
      <li>This soap is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Lovely olive oil soaps and very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Takes a couple of weeks to get here, since it&#x27;s shipped from Greece, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait!</li>
      <li>The smell is the first thing I notice, and it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s lovely either.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my skin, lathers really well, nice large bars, Clean, nice scent.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!!!</li>
      <li>A good general mild soap.</li>
      <li>I am 75 and my skin is dry and it is so good for it.</li>
      <li>took a while for it to arrive in that it was shipped from Greece, but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>She likes the way it leaves her skin feeling - very clean and soft and NOT slippery.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try a new olive soap after my favorite was out of stock, and both the price and mostly positive reviews on this one convinced me to try it.  </li>
      <li>I researched the ingredients, and it is pretty simple--and the price is right.</li>
      <li>business is increasing at a very fast pace</li>
      <li>For anyone, but especially those with sensitive or dry skin, this is an excellent product and I recommend it.</li>
      <li>We fell in love with on a  recent visit to Greece.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Tried it on my body the first day.</li>
      <li>I really like this soap, it lasts a lonnnggg time!</li>
      <li>The oil smell in the auto shop smelled exactly like this olive</li>
      <li>But I most likely will not be buying from this brand again.</li>
      <li>Truly the longest lasting soap I have ever used, easily doubles others life.</li>
      <li>100 percent pure olive oil soap.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my newborns delicate skin!!!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it a lot to wash with.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it as much on my hair.</li>
      <li>They were shipped fast and arrived a week before estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>but they cost $10 a bar, which is too much money in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my husband who absolutely has to use a &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; soap.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first, thinking it&#x27;s too good to be true for this price.</li>
      <li>The price is great too--the cost of a three-pack is a little more than the cost of a single bar of some other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had high hope for this</li>
      <li>Lovely green color.</li>
      <li>you are debating whether to purchase this one or not, I think there are enough positives to make it worth giving it a chance, but if you are sensitive about scent/smell, or if you don&#x27;t like the oily smell you notice at a car mechanic&#x27;s shop, then this soap might off-putting.</li>
      <li>If only it didn&#x27;t smell like a car mechanic&#x27;s bay, I would have given it a much higher rating.  </li>
      <li>Natural, no chemicals.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel soft and supple.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the soap is great--lathers up nicely but not too much, the bar seems quite hard and therefore does not melt as quickly as other soaps.  </li>
      <li>Actually, the skin on my arms was soft and glowing.</li>
      <li>Surprised I could buy it at such a low price, including shipping on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
      <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, and this soap neither made my skin feel dry</li>
      <li>I had purchased the larger sizes for less than 2.00 a bar and these were 1/2 the size but almost as much.</li>

<li> only negative is that they are real soft.  </li>
<li> Lately, a friend gave me another handmade soap bar and that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin much.</li>
<li> I will second the poster who noted that this takes a while to arrive because it is shipped from Greece, but given the distance, it still arrived when Amazon told me it was due to arrive, and in fact it was a couple of days early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The skin on my legs were not as dry as it used to.</li>
<li> I no longer have to use any oils in my bath (which were constantly getting in my hair) and I am using less moisturizer.</li>
<li> It has little to no scent.</li>
<li> They work on my friends&#x27; skin but it dried out mine.</li>
<li> He was using another brand that had chemicals and dried his skin.  </li>
<li> I found that my skin didn&#x27;t feel dried.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive handmade soaps.</li>
<li> they were actually the 125 gm soaps, so I was disappointed when they arrived.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife loves this soap. My second order for her.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a new olive soap after my favorite was out of stock, and both the price and mostly positive reviews on this one convinced me to try it.  I will second the poster who noted that this takes a while to arrive because it is shipped from Greece, but given the distance, it still arrived when Amazon told me it was due to arrive, and in fact it was a couple of days early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it this morning, and while the soap was not greasy, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent.  It is an olive soap, so I did not expect it to smell fragrant or floral, but this seemed quite strong to me.  I was trying to think what it reminded me of, and then it came to me:  I had taken my car in for an oil change last week, and waited while they did it.  The oil smell in the auto shop smelled exactly like this olive soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the olive soap does not last, though, and when I got out of the shower, I could not detect the scent of the soap on my skin.  Otherwise, the soap is great--lathers up nicely but not too much, the bar seems quite hard and therefore does not melt as quickly as other soaps.  My skin is somewhat sensitive, and this soap neither made my skin feel dry (a big problem with some soaps) nor make me itch (another big problem).  If only it didn&#x27;t smell like a car mechanic&#x27;s bay, I would have given it a much higher rating.  The price is great too--the cost of a three-pack is a little more than the cost of a single bar of some other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are debating whether to purchase this one or not, I think there are enough positives to make it worth giving it a chance, but if you are sensitive about scent/smell, or if you don&#x27;t like the oily smell you notice at a car mechanic&#x27;s shop, then this soap might off-putting.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Great Price!! 100 percent pure olive oil soap. Takes a couple of weeks to get here, since it&#x27;s shipped from Greece, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Maybe okay for goathide but not this hide! Forget About it!</li>
    <li> Leaves a squeaky clean feeling, so nice in that way.  I had hoped for a moisturizing soap, so will not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful all natural soap! LOVE the smell! Super fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> good price.  only negative is that they are real soft.  leaves a lot of soap on soap dish</li>
    <li> This is nice soap. I use it on my face and decided to try it in place of the Kiss My Face olive oil soap I have been using. Do not see or feel a noticeable difference, plus it takes longer to receive it as it comes from Greece.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband who absolutely has to use a &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; soap.  He was using another brand that had chemicals and dried his skin.  He loves this soap.  I researched the ingredients, and it is pretty simple--and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This soap, which came from Greece, arrived faster than I thought it would and it is delightful. I use it as a regular soap and soap for felting. Natural, no chemicals.</li>
    <li> This soap lasts forever and you can sense the olive oil moistening your skin. Truly the longest lasting soap I have ever used, easily doubles others life. The scentless soap is not an issue. Reading up on the company, it is the largest soap provider in Greece, and it&#x27;s business is increasing at a very fast pace Surprised I could buy it at such a low price, including shipping on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Papoutsanis, you deserve lot&#x27;s of customers.</li>
    <li> I am always happy with this olive oil soap, its awesome</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  It makes your skin feel soft and supple.  The bars last a long time.</li>
    <li> this is excellent soap!</li>
    <li> A good general mild soap. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, it lasts a lonnnggg time! My only criticism is the scent. It&#x27;s not fragrant or perfumey at all. But it&#x27;s a deal!</li>
    <li> The smell is the first thing I notice, and it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s lovely either. I had high hope for this but it&#x27;s looking like II&#x27;m going to look for a different maker/brand for the olive oil soap. The soap was pretty good too but due to the smell being so horrible I haven&#x27;t really used it a lot to wash with. It didn&#x27;t make me itch, turn red, burn or peel so that&#x27;s a good thing. Also when washing the soap off it left a drying sensation that I was concerned about, however, after drying off the sensation went away. But I most likely will not be buying from this brand again.</li>
    <li> This soap is not what one would call a beautiful scent; however it is such a good soap for the skin.......I am 75 and my skin is dry and it is so good for it.</li>
    <li> Lovely olive oil soaps and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.  We fell in love with on a  recent visit to Greece.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for it to arrive in that it was shipped from Greece, but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap. Gentle on my skin, lathers really well, nice large bars, Clean, nice scent. Lovely green color. Moisturizing and softens my skin. Use it every day.VERY glad I bought this wonderful soap!</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry to begin with, especially my legs. I&#x27;ve tried other expensive handmade soaps. They work on my friends&#x27; skin but it dried out mine. Lately, a friend gave me another handmade soap bar and that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin much. I was going to buy more of that but they cost $10 a bar, which is too much money in my opinion. So I kept on searching and found this.  I was skeptical at first, thinking it&#x27;s too good to be true for this price. I ordered this 3 bars. They were shipped fast and arrived a week before estimated delivery date. I was pleased. Tried it on my body the first day. The way I test if the soap dries my skin out is not to apply any lotion after shower. I found that my skin didn&#x27;t feel dried. Actually, the skin on my arms was soft and glowing. The skin on my legs were not as dry as it used to. The second day, I used the soap on my face as well. My face felt softer afterwards. The third day I used it to shampoo my hair. Didn&#x27;t like it as much on my hair. It left a film on my hair and it felt sticky.  Now it has been a week since I started using this soap and will never go back. My skin texture is improved and looks healthier than ever. It rinses off so easily. I don&#x27;t mind it has no fragrant and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scent on my skin after shower. This will be a keeper for the rest of my life if they don&#x27;t change the formula or the process of this soap bar. No need to say how happy I am to have healthier looking skin without costing me a fortune. Thank you Papoutsanis!</li>
    <li> The best olive oil soap!</li>
    <li> I no longer have to use any oils in my bath (which were constantly getting in my hair) and I am using less moisturizer. It has little to no scent. I keep the extra bars in the freezer and each bar has lasted about 2 weeks. For anyone, but especially those with sensitive or dry skin, this is an excellent product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! So clean, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered the 250 gm soaps like I had purchased before at a museum shop- they were actually the 125 gm soaps, so I was disappointed when they arrived. I had purchased the larger sizes for less than 2.00 a bar and these were 1/2 the size but almost as much. I like the soaps, but the price was more than I have paid, but value wise, I could have done better at the museum shop. I would not purchase from here again because I like good value for my money.</li>
    <li> My spouse loves this soap.  She found it while in Greece.  She likes the way it leaves her skin feeling - very clean and soft and NOT slippery.  She also likes that the bars last a long time.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes a long time to get here - they are shipped from Greece.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d. very quickly, and in excellent shape.  I&#x27;ve already given one as a beautiful token gift.  This soap is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my newborns delicate skin!!!</li>
