<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super Hydrating for sure! Love the way my face feels after use!</li>
    <li> Finally a mask I can use everyday if I want to. It says it is a tsunami on your face! I don&#x27;t know about that but nice to put it on before bed and wash or wipe it off 15 minutes later. Sometimes I put it on before I get into the shower and wash it off then. Great price I like this item!</li>
    <li> Have used this and the moisture cream for about three weeks. I like it very much, and my daughter says that she can tell a big difference in , my complexion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, have to use it on daily basis for age 50 plus</li>
    <li> Leaves skin nice and soft. I like it!</li>
    <li> I like it because it stays clear, not like &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; on my face. It makes my skin feel taught but not dry and wrinled</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Best mask I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you need to, because you will see and feel a difference almost immediately when you start using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a little while, so I can&#x27;t attest to any long term efects. But from my experience, I am so pleased with the way this mask has made my skin feel.  It&#x27;s made my skin incredibly soft and even felt a little &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34;.  The old saying about &#x27;soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; was the first thing I thought of that could describe it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, makes my face feel wonderful and easy to integrate into my skin care routine. I recommend this product because it makes my skin feel &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and truely pampered!  5  Stars!!</li>
    <li> Oz products are great.  This is my 5th one.  This mask really hydrates your skin, feeling plumper with less visable wrinkles.  I use it a couple times a week.  I use it for 30 minutes since my skin is more dry and I am slightly older.  Then just rinse off.  Then I apply serum and moisturizer.  After using your skin feels so refreshing like after a good night&#x27;s rest.  It&#x27;s nice to pamper yourself without the costs of a spa.  I did receive this prodoct&lt;br /&gt; complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried several of the skincare products from Oz Naturals &amp; I have been very satisfied with the results that I’ve gotten from all of them. Now I have received the Amino Herbal Hydration Mask to test &amp; review. I’ve used several types of facial masks but this one is different from the others that I use reguarly.&lt;br /&gt;This mask comes in a tube instead of a tub which I really like. It is a lightweight gel with a nice aloe scent. I love that it has some of my favorite ingredients like Jojoba Oil &amp; Rosehip Seed Oil. Unlike the mud masks that I use, this mask is designed to hydrate your facial skin. It goes on smoothly &amp; dries clear. I leave it on for 20 - 30 minutes each time I use it. It doesn’t take much of this product to cover my face so this tube will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a hydrating mask, it is safe to each every day but I usually use it 2 or 3 times a week. I have somewhat sensitive combination skin &amp; have experience no irritation or redness from using this product. It leaves my face feeling very soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
    <li> Well, I am really impressed!  My experience with face masks is of the thick clay variety; effective  but often requiring mixing, messy application, careful timing and laborious removal.  This hydrating mask is completely different.  It is a creamy, off-white gel, conveniently packaged in a large tube and ready to apply.  It spreads easily, just like a cream, clings to my skin effortlessly, is very easy to apply exactly where I want it and dries to a clear, shiny finish.  The directions say to leave it on for 15-30 minutes.  I did that the first time.  But then, in the spirit of extreme testing, the second time I left it on for an hour and the third time much longer, as I did not set a timer.  In each case, after removal, my face looked fresh and rosy and, at my age, that takes some doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other masks, it does not set in a stiff, unwieldy way followed by crazy-cracking.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t crack at all, it remains somewhat elastic and I forget it&#x27;s there.  My face is not frozen in place, there is no pulling effect and I don&#x27;t scare any unsuspecting passers-by.  It washes off easily in warm water and leaves no awkward residue along the hairline.  For this reason, it is ideal as preparation for a night out or social occasion.  My skin emerges tightened but with a soft, smooth feel, lines less evident, pores well closed, ready for moisturizer and make-up.  I can see why they say it&#x27;s suitable for daily use!  Something else which is unique in my mask experience:  I can put it all over my face, including the eye contour.  Today my husband had been telling me that I looked tired but, after the mask, he thought I had put my make-up on ... when I had not.  I&#x27;m 61, and really appreciate that kind of comment!  So, a product that leaves my skin refreshed, renewed and visibly improved.  I&#x27;ll be using this mask a lot!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin this is the mask for you. Should your skin look like you are worn out and dull.  This will make your skin look like you have been sleeping well. When in my case currently I am not getting as much sleep. So I guess you could say this mask makes you cheat on how you really feel. I love the fact it is more organic herbs in this mask. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I am noticing more companies promoting it that way. There is no alcohol or parabens and I am currently watching the products more on my skin. I love it is healthier for you too. As huge thing you should know it is animal cruelty free. That is with the oz program. I will keep using this product and suggesting it.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser Contains Powerful Vitamin C, OZ Naturals Facial Mask, OZ Naturals -  Retinol Moisturizer Contains 2.5% Retinol Cream, Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + VITAMIN B5 and OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum, four items total.  I&#x27;m 48, light brown skin black American.  I want anti aging and skin brightening products.  Now, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve already have gotten some hot days here in DC which my skin tends to oil up compared to winter months, but I got a pimple above my right eye brow, then two small pimples on the left side  of my of the jaw, which I do use a rotary razor.  Then another one where I shave left side side face.  I&#x27;m light brown skin and don&#x27;t&#x27; have severe acne, but they may pop up here and there. Today, I have another small pimple right side shaving area. But before OZ, I used another brand which uses all natural 100%, men anti aging; don&#x27;t know if I should name it, RSVP. But I thought I would try OZ.  RSVP products were used during winter when my skin is dry, not oily and no problems.  I have some pigmentation spots due to chicken pocks when I was 19, so they didn&#x27;t totally go away. But my face looked pretty good.  So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll return OZ or stick it out. On my second week at least with the products.  I don&#x27;t think my face can take a lot of lotions and creams, maybe with the warm days, oily skin and such, my pores getting clogged. I do a mud facial mask and use apricot face scrub too; store brands.  *** UPDATE 6/12/15 *** I&#x27;m still getting pimples and now too late to return.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> i have used so many masks over the years and this one os my favorite by far. i lokie the texture of it, it is clear when you put it on and it doesnt run all over your face and it doesnt irritate my eyes. i have it on for about 20 minutes and wash it off and my skin feels rejuvinated and fresh and smooth. it is not oily at all. it is fragnance free. It&#x27;s easy to use - simply rub the cream substance on your skin in circular motions, avoiding contact with your eyes and leave it on your skin for about 20 minutes. When you&#x27;re ready to take it off, just use a cotton pad.&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask and followed the instructions exactly and was very impressed that my skin felt healthy. Usually overnight I develop dry, crusted flakes on my face and neck  from the dry air, but this kept my face hydrated enough to prevent that from happening! I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and my skin has never felt softer. It also looks like my skin looks and feels a lot cleaner. The packaging it came in is very professional and the tube is very easy to use. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;i received a free sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> I am 52 and tried this mask once leaving it on for 30 minutes - I found the wash off not easy and it left my skin very sticky.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be itchy, sting or dry out my face for some reason, It never fails that always happens to me. Not one of these things happened. It comes out of the tube, as a clear gel like substance, putting it all over my face. It dries quickly, and does not itch, or peel off like a facial mask, you do have to use water and a hand towel. It will leave your skin so soft, and clean feeling. My skin does feel very refreshed, and bright! I do use a light moisturizer afterwards as advised. I love that this is gentle enough to use daily! Oz Naturals makes some great products, now I cant wait to try more!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> Works for short term but can&#x27;t use more than one night in a row because of sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Soothing mask. Goes on smoothly, stays soft &amp; feels great afterwards. I frequently forget I have it on when I use it, which is a nice plus since a lot of masks drive me crazy &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to wash them off.</li>
    <li> This mask is the BEST! Love that it goes on clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking crazy when someone comes to the door. I&#x27;ve been doing this mask weekly and am already starting to notice the results - skin looks more hydrated, fine lines are diminished and my pores seem smaller.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to switch our household into using more and more, green friendly products. We use natural cleaners and some natural skin products as well as other items. It is extremely hard for me to find green skin care products. I can usually use some all natural products, but they do not get the job done. At thirty four I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin, a combination that skin care manufacturers have not seemed to be able to master. I was eager to try out Oz Naturals when I heard how well they work to deep clean and unclog pores as well as use all natural ingredients. All Oz Natural products are cruelty free, organic and contain no alcohol, parabens or sulfates. Oz Natural products are safe for all skin types. Their products are made in the USA and are FDA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to also try out the Oz Naturals US2 Facial Mask. The Oz Naturals US2 Facial Mask is an ultra hydration mask that plumps your skin by delivering ample amounts of moisture directly into your skin cells with a calm and cooling effect. It is made from Aloe Vera juice, rosehip oil, pro-vitamin B5, amino acid complex, and other organic and herbal blends that deeply nourish and penetrate your skin. Plus it is safe enough for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the Oz Naturals US2 Facial Mask. It is one of the few masks I have found that really feel like they hydrate your skin all day long. I use it once a week and get great results from it. It has filled in old acne scars and wrinkles by using it. I also love that there is no mess with it and it washes off extremely easy. Definitely one of my favorite masks on the market by far. My only complaint is that it comes in a small bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! this is gentle, the smell is nice and I just really love the brand and what they stand for!  *I was sent this but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh...and the fact that I can use it daily is a bonus! I use other OZ products and have never been disappointed. I definitely recommend this facial mask!</li>
    <li> I haven’t used a lot of facial masks in my life but I am trying to take better care of my skin.  A few things that intrigued me about this product OZ Naturals Facial Mask before using it was that it was all natural and cruelty free. And that it had a hydrating system to it.  It’s also stats safe to use daily but I’ve been doing it every other day.  It goes on very smoothly and when drying it doesn’t turn into one of those uncomfortable tight masks on your face.  It rinses off easily and leaves your skin feeling so smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve now incorporated it into my routine and really highly recommend it.  A very nice product that I will continue to purchase and tell my friends about.</li>
    <li> Love Oz products. Use two others which I love and purchase reguarly but this one did nothing for me. My skin is combination (T-zone).</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 bcz when I was trying it its gel is smooth, but since I have sensitive skin I was scared to try on my face, so I tried on the back of my one hand and one inside of my arm, As in the pic, the red part is where I put the product, it feels burn in my arm, I can imagine if it was on my face. So for the effect, it really dries my arm and my hand, so I won&#x27;t give it a try to my face. Hope to return the product if it&#x27;s possible.</li>
    <li> Need to clear the ingredients list of the few non-organic ingredients found in it.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNaturals Sea Kelp Mask is the One if you like a great mask!</li>
    <li> This facial mask is the best of many worlds for me. I was previously using a tea tree face mask from The Body Shop, which was great at helping to calm and cool my face for acne purposes, but did not revitalize and brighten my skin as I hoped it would. I came across this mask by OZ Naturals because I have purchased several other products from them - all of which have been incredibly high-quality and effective - so I decided to purchase to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, one of the best facial masks I have used. Quick run-through of the positives (many) and negatives (if you can call it that):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Incredibly hydrating. My skin felt very nourished even an hour after I had cleaned off the mask&lt;br /&gt;- Makes skin very soft. It cleared away all of the dead skin cells as an exfoliator would, so that my face was left feeling smooth to the touch&lt;br /&gt;- Very revitalizing for skin. My skin was much brighter after I applied and cleaned off the mask than it was before. I honestly felt very beautiful when I looked at myself in the mirror&lt;br /&gt;- Contains rosehip oil. This is a huge bonus for me, as I already use rosehip oil on its own as part of my beauty routine. I love that this contains rosehip oil because it&#x27;s truly like a 2 in 1 for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in a tube, so it is smaller than my other products that typically come in huge tubs. Not a huge deal considering that you only need to use a dollop at a time, and this tube is sure to last at least a couple of months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a must try. I can almost guarantee that you won&#x27;t be disappointed - this mask worked wonders for me, and that&#x27;s saying a lot considering I have pretty difficult skin to work with and have used many facial products prior to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Love OZ Naturals!  Wish they has travel sizes.</li>
    <li> I am Erika Lohr - I bought the whole collection of OZ naturals and I must confess that I am in love with all products because after the first day using on  my face I could see an amazing diference It looks healthy, with a great glow and refreshing. No doubt I will buy again OZ ..</li>
    <li> Only tried once - did not notice any major results. Need to use a few more times before I can give a full report.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I have been trying desperately to fix my damaged skin (bad laser treatment destroyed my skin) and this has been the only thing to bring back the moisturer! I will continue to use! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this line very much and use all of their products. This mask really makes your skin smooth and soft. Feels like you just had a facial :)</li>
    <li> Works ok, definitely not the best moisturizing mask on this price.</li>
    <li> After applying this face mask, my skin felt SO SOFT! I&#x27;ve been using this 1-2 times per week in the evenings and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference... this winter has been REALLY rough on my skin. Normally I have combo skin - normal to oily... but for the past few months it&#x27;s been extremely dry. This has been amazing in combating this. I&#x27;m so happy that OZ sent this to me for review.</li>
    <li> makes your skin feel clean and refresh</li>
    <li> Great for any skin type make my skin feels smooth and softness I have dry skin love this mask I use it day and night</li>
    <li> I had dry skin really badly this mask hydrated my skin on girlllll you need this. My face is like the softest thing my make up goes on so smoothly I can&#x27;t get enough of this!</li>
    <li> Great.  Definitely works great. Love it.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful! So hydrating! My skin feels like a newborn after I use this. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this mask before. I use to have little bumps on my cheeks and they are completely gone! Honestly this stuff if worth it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my 50-yr old skin dewy soft!</li>
    <li> I am honestly a mask junkie. I love to use facial masks. I don&#x27;t always do one a week, but generally speaking, taking an average, I probably use a mask at least once a week, sometimes three, sometimes only every other week. Obviously when I do that I am not using the same one if multiple per week. Anyways... This mask is a GEL! Yes, a gel! And I LOVE IT!!!! It&#x27;s like taking aloe, vitamins, herbs (like rosehip), mixing them with gel/glycerine, and relishing in the goodness that it is and provides for your skin. I love how it smells, feels while on, and how my skin feels after using it. What&#x27;s great about it is that you can use it on areas you wouldn&#x27;t normally want to put a mask on, like if you try not to get too close to the eyes, you can apply this in an area like that. It&#x27;s safe, natural, organic - almost too good to be true. This brand and this mask in particular just might have converted me into a lover of gel type facial masks!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is doing anything for my skin. I continue to use it hoping this is helping even though I can&#x27;t see or feel results, plus it was $20 something bucks and I don&#x27;t want to waste that money. I have even slept with this on a few times and still no difference that I can notice. The mask is clear, it goes on easy enough and does not shrink up to make your face feel pulled tight, it does not flake off at night and it washes off very easily.</li>
    <li> this really broke out my skin and I am 60 yrs old and got pimples after using&lt;br /&gt;It may have just agreed with my skin .</li>
    <li> I found that it stung my skin very badly, so I was really disappointed with it and had to rinse it off immediately.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this facial mask, it makes my face feel so smooth and clean. When I put on my foundation my skin looks and feels like velvet.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this mask are great but I can&#x27;t say I feel/see a difference.  But I do it anyway, it smells nice, the ingredients are good. I may or may not buy again.</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals are awesome products.  See my review on the Cleanser.  I have used these products for almost a year.  I started with the cleanser, AHA and C serums.  I liked them so well that I expanded my collection to include the Eye Gel, Retinol Moisturizer, and this facial mask.  I am 61 and had a women today who was complaining about turning 50 this year.  I jokingly told her to wait another 11 years.  She was shocked at my age and thought I was younger than her.  I get that a lot!!  Thank you Oz Naturals!!</li>
    <li> Works well for my older, Arizona skin.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy oz products but I really enjoyed this mask! It is very refreshing and left my skin feeling extremely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a reduced price in order to review it. I do not endorse or promote products I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend to my friends or family.</li>
    <li> This mask is super mositurizing and I really love it! My skin is soft, refreshed and glows after using it and I&#x27;m totally a fan!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the ingredients in this wonder tube too. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t harden is similar to the Japanese face masks where a &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; is put over your face and this helps impart moisture into your skin I think. Anyway, Japanese women have amazing skin and I like that this is kinda similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is great!  My face feels n looks so soft!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line! Please check out my full review here on YouTube! Click on this link: [...]</li>
    <li> I really like these products, they seem to be very effective and working!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am not sure exactly what this does, but I like the way it makes my face feel while it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;m on the fence about whether it improves my skin or not.</li>
    <li> This face mask is really a life saver! I used to use the mint julup mask for my skin and while it worked good it stung me so bad and made me tear up. So i got this mask and instantally it felt nice, smelled wonderful, and left my skin hydrated,soft,smooth and pores diminshed! Id def. Recommend this mask for any skin type!!</li>
    <li> This is the Very Best !!! Hydration mask I have Ever used !!! I&#x27;ve used at least 5 , and this one exceeds the others by Far ! Your face feels so smooth and soft after using it . I would Definatly buy it again !! I was given this product to try and review . This is the third item I&#x27;ve used from this line . They are All Great !! Buy it , you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel smoothe and younger!</li>
    <li> I just dont feel anything, used couple times</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes your face so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a light, refreshing mask for naturally hydrating dry skin. My skin is quite sensitive, and the product passed my skin patch test before I committed to a full facial mask treatment. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, but after two weekly treatments my face feels smoother and more supple.The non-greasy formula has plenty of aloe juice and essential oils to soothe exfoliated skin, and would be a real treat after sports or an extreme sun or wind exposure. It dries nicely after a half hour, without the heavy cracking mud feeling of other products. Although frankincense oil is listed as an ingredient the fragrance is pleasantly mild--a nice touch for a product you need to wear more than fifteen minutes.</li>
    <li> I was not paid to write a review :)  I am 54 years old and have dry, dry, dry, sensitive skin!  After just one use, my skin feels soft as silk with absolutely no irritation.  Really excited to have found something that actually works.</li>
    <li> This product is gentle enough for everyday use, which is great. I especially appreciate oz naturals vegan, cruelty free philosophy!</li>
    <li> My face has burning feel after applying it. I think there are many chemical compositions in it. I have sensitive skin, so I usually use some natural brand like Origins. I try it because I saw its name including &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; .  I found I was wrong.  I do not want to use it again.</li>
    <li> This mask is not like your typically thick face mask but this is a gel that is slightly white in color and applies thin and clear to the point where you almost can’t see it on.  To me it has a smell similar to what some hyaluronic acid products smell like.  I am not crazy about the smell but it is tolerable.  When applying (you only need a little) it has a real wet feel and a slight tingling on my face, almost like a mint rub feels like.  It didn’t irritate or burn my skin but if you have really sensitive skin, I am not sure I would use this.  You leave this on the skin from fifteen to thirty minutes.  It dries on the skin but unlike a regular mask that hardens, this dries clear and I really could barely tell it was on my face.  It is easier than a mud mask to rinse off.  The skin does look more hydrated and nourished but I will say I don’t like this as much as other face masks or as much as I do other OZ natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I always read the ingredients of whatever products I buy whether is food or something for my face. I have acne problem and I am more careful now with products I use for my skin. The OZ Naturals facial mask has great ingredients which makes is the best for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tube which gives you the control of the product to use. Using product from the tube instead of a open mouth jar is more hygienic. It prevents contamination from bacteria as your fingers. It is white in color but once you apply it, it is clear. No one can noticed you have something on your face. I remember when I used to apply clay mask or anything white mask my toddler used to get scared of me lol. Now no one even know that I have something on my face. When it gets dry it still stays clear. When you wash your face after the mask you skin is so firm, youthful and soft. Usually after applying any other mask my face gets so dry but with this mask, I dont feel dryness.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so soft, smooth and youthful. I have noticed so much difference in my skin texture. It is great for improving your skin from aged to young. It is great for healing and improving your skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;I received the oz naturals facial mask as part of a promotion to give an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial mask. I have not ever used a facial mask after a breakout I had with another one. I got to try this one free to review and I was glad because lately I have been breaking out from the hotness of outside. I only left it on for about 25 minutes and wash it out in circular motions. It was very easy to remove from my face not complicated at all. My face felt very clean and refreshed after using it. And a few days some pimples that wanted to surface didn&#x27;t because I was using the facial mask. Overall, I have had a great experience with this product. Would definitely buy and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Like it but not love it as other products from the same brand.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals has yet again done a great job making yet another great product! This facial mask is definitely a must have product! The tube it comes in is a pretty decent size and since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it at a time it will definitely last for awhile. This facial mask makes my skin feel very nourished. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin which I have sensitive skin so that&#x27;s a great thing for me! There is no horrible smell at least to me personally there isn&#x27;t. I love this facial mask and would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> It irritates my skin( I tried it twice and my skin was getting red immediately. I heed to throw out this mask or give to someone else unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Another amazing product by OZ Naturals. I can put a facial mask on and not scare the family :) It&#x27;s clear and the best part, it does not get hard. I put it on the top of my hands too. It leaves your skin so soft and hydrated and has a nice calming effect. Nice Healthy glow....</li>
    <li> It left my skin feeling very soft and glowing.  No adverse affects.</li>
    <li> I love oZ Naturals and their amazing line of products.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was reluctant to buy it but it works amazingly!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It feels so good on my skin.  I put it on and go about my housework.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face mask for a few days,let me tell you,it has a light smell,it goes on easy,it washes of easy, and it leaves your skin very smooth and hydrated,very soft,it contains vitamins,natural ingredients that will benefit your skin.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED</li>
    <li> Great product and I could tell a difference for the better when I use it a few times a week (brighter, softer skin, clear skin). I usually use OZ Cleanser with it as well, but not always. I do agree with a few other reviewers that after you&#x27;ve left it on for 10-30 minutes, best to dab off any remaining mask with a warm wash cloth or hop into shower. If I don&#x27;t do that, the little bits left tend to glob up like little sticky beads around your face (best way I know to describe it). Truly a gentle and effective mask that I continue buying and using regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, can&#x27;t complain about the price. Compared to department store Masks. A must try</li>
    <li> I have this on my face right now. One thing I noticed right away is that it doesn&#x27;t ITCH terribly like other masks I&#x27;ve used. That alone is worth its price in gold. Additionally, other masks I&#x27;ve used are in giant tubs. This comes in a nice tube, which feels more sanitary. I don&#x27;t have to worry about germy fingers contaminating the batch.  I leave the mask on for 30 minutes to get the most benefit possible. You don&#x27;t have to scrub your face to get the mask off, which is nice, because with other masks I&#x27;m always pulling bits off my face. After I cleaned my skin, it was soft, nourished, and my larger pores in my t-zone were visibly improved.  As for the ingredients in this product: color me impressed.  This mask contains Aloe Vera, Vitamin B 5, and Organic Avena Sativa. It also has Rosehip Oil - which has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. I use rosehip oil on its own, so seeing in in the ingredient list pleased me. Overall, the ingredients are clean and effective, the product is effective yet gentle for my 32 year old skin, and I enjoyed pampering myself with this clean product. Fully recommend for someone looking for a face mas.  Disclosure: The facial mask was provided for a review, without any obligation. My results and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the way this made my skin feel, from the first time that I used it.  I don&#x27;t use hydration masks often, because I am worried that they will make my skin feel too oily.  But this mask was great, and only made my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  I left it on for 30 min. and my skin felt great after using it.  The tube is a generous size, so it should last for awhile - a great value!  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I love this product, leaves my face feeling really soft</li>
    <li> *product provided for review*&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this face mask, as I am not a tight masking kind of mom. When I have heard of mask it brings image of a solid hard piece over face created by some product drying. This was very unusual to my expectations, it came in a tube not a jar or bottle. I first tried on my hands, it applied easily and when dried it didn&#x27;t stiffen up but just looked dry(which i liked) I did leave it on the 15 min minimum it asked and proceeded to wash off with soap and water, it rinsed so easily and didnt feel goopy or sticky to wash off. Since I have tried it on my face and feel the same results I like the way it makes my skin feel so refreshed not tight. As with all the products the OZ line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I must have about 15 different facial masks in my beauty arsenal, most of which I try once and forget about. Not this one. This mask is the only one I use ALL the time. It&#x27;s very gentle so you can use it every day if you want to. I usually put it on at night after taking my makeup off and it makes my skin feel unbelievably hydrated and refreshed. Another bonus I&#x27;ve discovered: I get migraines very often and have started using this mask to help ease the pain. It really works - gives your skin a nice cooling sensation and relaxes your muscles. Within about 10 minutes I notice that the pain is almost completely gone. If this product ever gets discontinued I&#x27;ll probably go nuts.</li>
    <li> I use this product to relax while IU refresh my skin!  It provides a tingling sensation when applied then dries into an invisible mask.  It is refreshing and relaxing,  When I rinse it off, the moisture I feel on my face and fingers is amazing.  I look forward to relaxing when I use it.</li>
    <li> You put this mask on and when you can easily wash it off. When you do, your skin is smooth and tight, pores are small. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This Mask is really fantastic I have used other masks before but this one stands out because it really makes my skin glowing after use . its very hydrating and easy to use . it will not only hydrate but will also nourish the skin cells with a very natural blend of herbals and amino acid complex.&lt;br /&gt;Some masks can be filled with things that make my skin feel a bit dry and some are so oily as to be unpleasant. what I love about this one is it is removed with warm water so you do not have that struggle to peal off or scrape off the product. its easily removed and thats a huge deal for me because I had a mask once that took forever to remove completely and you really do not want to be pulling and tugging on your facial skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get a whole lot of this mask and a little goes a long way. I am 54 and found this mask a wonderful change from the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;  I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> I have never used masks before. My skin has started showing signs of aging and hence was looking for a mask which contains natural ingredients. After seeing so many positive reviews decided to try it. As folks have said, it goes clear on the skin. I do get a tingling/cooling session on my skin which makes me feel that it is doing something :)&lt;br /&gt;After washing I felt my skin tighter and also looked more fresh. Planning to continue using it and see how the results are after the usage of a complete tube.</li>
    <li> The texture is very good, it&#x27;s like a gel. I leave it for 30 minutes and during that time I feel a great skin tightening effect. It&#x27;s very easy to rinse. It leaves my skin softer and hydrated but I can&#x27;t say that the effect is visible.</li>
    <li> Mask no moisturizes the skin!After using it my skin became just a little bit softer.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Fast shipment.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! this is a very gentle facial mask! i have oily to combination skin type. After my general cleansing routine, i will apply a thin layer of this milky white gel. One small tip, I usually put it into the fridge before use for 15 mins, and i found it helpful in reducing my redness. my skin become energetic, nourished, with tightened skin pores. Can&#x27;t be more happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Just started using he Oz Naturals product.  REcommended by a family member.  I love these products.  I have tried many many&lt;br /&gt;products from very expensive to drugstore quality and find that this these to not bother my skin.  Leave it feeling soft and&lt;br /&gt;glowing.</li>
    <li> I had previously been using Lush&#x27;s Mask of Magnaminty and had really been enjoying it, however I think I was ready for a little bit more of a &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; facial mask to help reduce the appearance of some of the fine lines I have developed in the year since having my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten to use this facemask twice and have been super impressed with the results. I am also using the retinol facial moisturizer as well as an ocean mineral toner and cleanser from this brand, and while I was seeing great results from the other products, this mask really supercharged the results. I look like I have had a full nights sleep, which I can assure you I have not! It plumped up some of my wrinkles and just gave my face that dewy fresh appearance that I remember having in my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received samples of these products to test, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results. I will certainly be purchasing more from this line.</li>
    <li> Irritating and ineffective for dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this mask several times over the last few weeks and am impressed with how well it works.  I was skeptical at first because it is different from any other mask I have used. It goes on more like a gel, wasn&#x27;t expecting that for a mask.  It made a believer out of me after the first use.  My skin felt smooth and moisturized.  Hard to believe that this gel like mask provided so much rich moisture!  Wonderful product!!  It hydrates my skin better than other more traditional masks that take at least 30 minutes to work and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy like the heavy masks do.  I am using it twice a week now but will probably increase the frequency as the weather turns cold.  I am looking forward to a winter free of dry, chapped cheeks.</li>
    <li> I use this after I use my Aztec/ACV clay mask once a week.  I love this stuff, makes my face feel so hydrated and soft- I will always have this on hand! It is so easy to use, no mess and you can still preform other tasks while it is on your face.  Just rinse off, no peeling or scraping needed!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a natural clear substance  that does not have a scent. It quickly absorbs after 20 minutes, and after rinsing my face, my skin felt really soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I was to test this product completely free thanks to OZ Naturals and I absolutely love it! It gives me such a clean and refreshing feeling. I love the fact that it is organic and it works so well with the fact that I have sensitive skin. The smell is great too. My skin has been so much more moisturized than it has been in the past. It is super easy to apply and as it sinks into your skin, it feels like heaven! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is a good facial mask. If you follow directions and leave it on for about 30mins, you will feel a great skin tightening effect.&lt;br /&gt;When i rinse it off, it leaves my skin very smooth and ready for my PM serum / moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to say if it is doing anything special for my skin since it is a part of my regimen. It definitely does not break out my skin but I am not sure if using it daily (per OZ, it is gentle enough for daily use) is a good idea. I try using it twice a week only.&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth trying for sure.</li>
    <li> LOVE HOW THIS MASK GOES ON SO LIGHT AND MADE MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT</li>
    <li> Loved it! I don&#x27;t normally use masks, for the main reason that I hate when my face can&#x27;t move because I have hard goop on it.  This was nothing like that.  Went on smooth,  stayed soft and didn&#x27;t get hard on my face.  I don&#x27;t have time to use it every day,  but I try doing it at least every 2 days.  It makes my skin feel healthy and light and more radiant.  I definitely recommend this protect</li>
    <li> Truly the BEST hydrating mask I have ever tried</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet</li>
    <li> I was chosen to try this new product for free, saying that this is a great mask. It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and has a lot of great ingredients. I use it once a week as a special treat to myself although you can use it everyday. One thing I forgot to say with all the products is that they are made in the USA to me that&#x27;s a huge, I like to support companies in our country.</li>
    <li> My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and I thought this would be the cure. However I have seen no change on my face after months of use.</li>
    <li> feels good - good product</li>
    <li> I really like how this leaves my skin clean. I also enjoy the tingles I feel when I use it. I only wished it was a peel off type. Great product though!</li>
    <li> Have you ever felt a baby&#x27;s skin? How could anything get that smooth or that soft as an adult? Well, I&#x27;ve just found the jewel.  This comes out as a smooth, opaque gel and has a very subtle scent-perhaps the Frankincense? The directions recommend to leave it on for 15-30 minutes and then gently wash off. They weren&#x27;t kidding when they said &amp;#34;gently!&amp;#34; You barely have to wipe it off with wet fingers or wet wash cloth.  I love that characteristic! You see, I am one who doesn&#x27;t like to put on heavy creams or masks and then have to use scrubbing power to get the mask off.  So, how does your skin feel once the mask is removed? As smooth as butter...I am absolutely amazed.  I don&#x27;t use it daily because I believe I have gotten my skin to a good place.  I have to confess, I use many of OZ Naturals products and my face has never looked better. This Mask is honestly the best mask I have ever used because it is so light and easy to remove resulting in a tangible smooth and soft face.</li>
    <li> Using Amino Herbal Hydration Mask by Oz Naturals is a unique experience for me. The mask comes in a plastic tube, which I prefer over an open jar because the ingredients stay fresher, with less chance of bacterial contamination. The substance is a milky white gel that glides on your face in a clear application. This gel does NOT stiffen the way I have been accustomed to with other facial masks, nor does it turn any of those scary colors. It remains clear, and since there is none of the usual stiffening, it does NOT crack either. Therefore, you can move your face around rather than staying expressionless and stiff. While I had this mask on, I was able to take a short phone call and even drink some water. When I walked around the house, no one knew that I had anything on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state to leave on for 15 – 30 minutes. I compromised and left it on for just over 20 minutes. Washing the mask off was simpler and easier than I have ever experienced after using a facial mask. Scrubbing was NOT necessary, it was as easy as washing my face after using my facial cleanser. My result was soft, nourished skin, with tightened skin pores. I felt refreshed and clean, and then I immediately used a toner right after to keep and lock in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one who does read ingredients. I do it for the food I eat, and I do it for anything that I put on my skin, and yes, it does make a difference, I can assure you from my experiences. Although, I am now a little older, my skin is much better. Some lines and wrinkles are inevitable, but my complexion is bright and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I checked out all the ingredients in my typical way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amino Herbal Mask Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask contains Aloe Vera, which has ANTI-BACTERIAL PROPERTIES, along with Vitamin B 5, and Organic Avena Sativa, which is Oat. These are to help with acne and other skin problems while providing properties to heal, soothe, moisturize, and relieve burning and itching, to calm and help hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense Essential Oil - acts as an anti-inflammatory, used to reduce skin irritations, like rashes. For overly dry and flaking skin, frankincense can have a soothing effect. Evidence has shown it to reduce redness and scaling and improve dry patches in people who massage the essential oil into their skin regularly. Those with aging skin use products with frankincense to help reduce fine lines and smooth out complexions. It may also help reduce the appearance of scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil - is a natural acne and eczema treatment, it’s anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin. This oil is a safe solution to repair the skin&#x27;s surface, restore elasticity and protects against sun and pollution stressors that can lead to wrinkles. This is a Nourishing oil that both moisturizes and hydrates dry skin. Another benefit of Rose Hip Oil is used as a scar treatment, stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns and scars. Its astringent and skin nourishing properties will help to speed up the healing process, as well as hydrate and moisturize the area. As a premature aging prevention, this oil helps to smooth fine lines and wrinkles and even up skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil – offers some protection against the sun’s harmful rays, fighting the dryness that is known to promote both fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), - is an ANTIOXIDENT, Neutralizing free radicals UVA, UVB, infrared radiation A, and replenishes skin&#x27;s Lipids (giving structure to cell membranes) therefore, increases firmness, and helps to reduce wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(14) Silk Amino Acid Blends - amino acids are essential for maintaining healthy cell function and renewal, as well as the skin’s structure and natural moisturizing factors. Amino acids also have ANTIOXIDANT properties that help repair free radical damage. Amino acids are added to anti-aging skin treatments to help replenish the collagen and elastin fibers that give skin its strength, texture, and resiliency. Our bodies use these organic molecules to synthesize collagen, elastin, and other essential proteins in our skin. L-form amino acids also have a natural tendency to form strong bonds with water molecules, so they can dramatically boost the skin’s moisture level as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botanical Hyaluronic Acid (HA) - The loss of natural hyaluronic acid is one of the causes of wrinkles. Since topical products with HA cannot penetrate to deeper layers, the moisturizing effects from these will only last a few days. Repeated use of HA will maintain moisture levels in the skin, preventing dehydration. Hyaluronic acid is useful for reducing or removing wrinkles, which makes the skin look younger and increases better skin tone, more smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kosher Vegetable Glycerin – an emollient, attracts moisture to the skin, and therefore hydrates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Sorbate – and - Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin - are safe useful preservatives for personal care and beauty products, used as a safe alternatives rather than the controversial parabens. All beauty products that contain a large amount of water need to be preserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Amino Herbal Hydration Mask by Oz Naturals is effective and yet, gentle enough for everyday use. It provides me with a healthy refreshing, and hydrating facial experience.

    <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. I use almost every day. Tightens skin slightly to give a &#x27;lift&#x27;. I love all OZ products. This is my 2nd order of the mask. It is at its best if left on for 30 mins but 15 is still good</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> This product burns and gives me lots of little pimples along my hair line. These pimples are really itchy and my skin is really dry. I won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I really liked this facial mask. It consists of rosehip oil, pro-vitamin B5, amino acid complex and an organic herbal blend that deeply nourishes the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the tube packing as it makes the application less messy and easier to apply. It also prevents contamination from bacteria as your fingers do not come in direct contact like the lid opening packs.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is white n color but upon application gets clear on the skin and is easily absorbed. It is suggested to keep it applied for 15 minutes. After you wash off your face you can feel your skin tightened a little and also very smooth. This face mask does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;This mask contains Aloe Vera which is one of my most favorite ingredients. It has anti bacterial and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended product. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to try this but decided to give it a shot. I have combination skin and thought it was going to be a thick moisturizing mask. It is actually a gel mask and my skin loves it! It really does hydrate and make my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This mask feels amazing and so refreshing on your face! Give you a nice glow after using it.</li>
    <li> The title says it all...this is the BEST facial mask I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Denver, translation: everything is DRY all the time. My skin feels like sandpaper since moving to the Mile High City. I seriously thought I had excema at one point because it was flaky and cracking around my forehead and on the sides of my face. No matter how much I scrubbed or moisturized, NOTHING helped. As opposed to seeing a dermatologist just yet, I opted to try the Oz Herbal Hydration Mask, just to see if it would do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that it has! After using this every day for the last week, my skin feels and looks hydrated. What&#x27;s even better is that I have noticed my pores are a little smaller too (YAY EXTRA BONUS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, squeeze out about a quarter sized amount of the mask, smooth it onto clean skin...and then leave it on for 15-30 minutes. Carefully rinse off and kind of dab at it to remove. The mask semi hardens into a sheen mask that is transparent (so if you go outside to check your mail or walk the dog, you will NOT look like a freak with a green mask LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering trying this, I would say, give it a go. The price is right and it really does hydrate well and give skin a youthful clean look again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a disclaimer, I did receive this for free to try out and test this product. I promise that I am giving you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. For real. I used this, I like it and I will be purchasing my own because this has completely transformed my flaky dry skin.</li>
    <li> This facial mask was very surprising. It tingled my skin and I love facial cleansers, masks, serums..etc that tingle! When it tingles, it usually means that is a pretty good indication the product is doing something amazing!  This facial mask is not like any other mask I have ever used. It seemed more to me like a heavy serum. It didn&#x27;t peel, and didn&#x27;t have a consistency that you would expect, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying this.  This mask settles deep into your pores and once it&#x27;s washed away, your skin is left feeling incredibly silky smooth!  I actually left my mask on too many times, WAY longer than suggested. By hours.. and it didn&#x27;t harm my skin, it made if feel softer and more supple. I can&#x27;t rave about this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FTC DISCLAIMER: This product was sent to me complimentary for testing purposes.*</li>
    <li> Shipped within 3 days which is awesome! I have used this only once but so far and I like it. It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t get too tight when drying. Comes off very easily and makes your face feel nice.</li>
    <li> I used it as directed. It did nothing. If anything my face felt dryer and lines more noticeable.</li>
    <li> This mask will give you younger looking skin and that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to use this instead of her clay mask. She decided to use this every other day and would keep me abreast of the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use she noted how much softer her face was versus the hard mask type. At the end of the week the old school clay mask was in the trash. I assumed she liked this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used it after shaving and was looking forward to the results. I left it dry while watching a rerun of Seinfeld (about twenty minutes or so), then washed it off with warm water. My manly skin was softer than normal there was no need for lotion that I normally. I even had my wife touch my face and even she said it extra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how this comes in a tube and not a jar which is less messy. Also, this goes on more like a cream and does not harden and crack up like a clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> I love this! Feels great and I wear it forever, longer than recommended..... I use it everyday</li>
    <li> This mask softens and moisturizes and heals on the first application.  I recommend this product with the other products in the line of OZ naturals.  All systems are designed to work together.  I have the whole line and love it.  i did receive this product at a deep discount for my hones opinion. .  And this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Of all the skin care products available, I think masks are the finest. You apply it, let it dry, and then relax while it works, or fails to work, whatever magic is promised. Oz Naturals Amino Herbal Hydration Mask is one such mask that works, and unlike a lot of other such products, it’s clear. There’s no need to panic if the doorbell rings. There’ll be no need to make a mad dash to the bathroom to wash it off before receiving a visitor. Heck, nobody will even know you’ve got a mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, the skin feels tighter, firmer, and its tone and coloring looks more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
    <li> I love this mask. Very gentle and goes on clear, easy to use and no mess. Most masks leave my face feeling irritated and dry. This one did just the opposite  leaving it feeling smooth and refreshed with notacibly smaller pores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a few times and really like it.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft and tightened.  The ingredients are of good quality and the scent is subtle and pleasant.  I really like the Oz Naturals line!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the cold winter wind that has just dried out my skin and body horribly. After doing a patch test, I applied the Oz Naturals Facial Mask and left it on for about 15 minutes. The mask was like a glass of water for my skin, I loved how hydrated my skin felt! This will definitely be a weekly ritual for me. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this, I&#x27;m one lucky girl!</li>
    <li> We so often use masks that are drying to our skin but this one is great (and unique). I used it a few times each week in the shower and my skin felt so soft. I am a new fan of the eye gel and vitamin c serum which are both great products at a reasonable price. I thought I would also sample some of their other products. Although it&#x27;s not something I have time to do every day it&#x27;s a great way to rejuvenate your skin while taking a long shower or bath.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I&#x27;ve been a fan of masks for years and this one takes the cake.  Really feels great when I use this and rinse.  It brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> Not for my 74 year old skin it is for a much younger person. Very mild  I need something more like clay to pull my skin tight.  Ha Ha</li>
    <li> I have never used skin care masks much in my life - I always thought of them as very thick, stiff, and difficult to remove - until now.  This mask is very lightweight, gentle, and moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I have chemical sensitivities and am allergic to some fragrances, so I appreciate that this product is 72% organic ingredients. It feels very natural and does not have any strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it after cleansing and before moisturizing.  It is recommended to apply it for 15-30 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have time to do it every day, but it is safe enough to use every day.  After using it I notice that my skin seems firmer and smoother.  After a few days I noticed my skin seems more refreshed and glowing than it did before.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. I plan to continue to use these products and hope to keep my skin smoother and prevent some signs of aging in the future.</li>
    <li> Quick, fast service.  Love the mask, has a great cooling feeling when it is on and my skin felt softer when I rinsed it off.</li>
    <li> Like product, using  2 times weekly</li>
    <li> This review is based on 8 weeks of testing.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike your usual type of thick creamy face masks this is an almost scent free light gel. Both my daughter and I used it once to twice weekly. Using a few pea sized amounts to cover the face, whilst leaving the eye, lip and nostril area clear.&lt;br /&gt;The result has been quite interesting, my daughter at 24 says it makes her skin feel softer, less dry and also less oily. I am in my 40&#x27;s and I really noticed the difference. My skin feels fresher and less dry. Both the mask and the [[ASIN:B00KWTYYWE OZ Naturals Facial Moisturizer - This Sea Infused Face Moisturizer Is Not To Be Underestimated - Contains Powerful Vitamin C &amp; Algae Keratin Extract For Superior Moisturizing &amp; Antioxidant Benefits. The Vitamin C Infused Seaweed Proteins Act As Powerful...]] have a cooling effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to keep the mask on between 15 and 20 minutes and I am happy to say that unlike other face masks it stays smooth and soft on the skin. It is easy to wash off with warm and doesn&#x27;t leave any unsightly residue.&lt;br /&gt;When used in combination with the cleanser, toner and moisturizer by OZNaturals my skin received an overall lift in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product, courtesy of OZNaturals for the purposes of reviewing the item.</li>
    <li> I suffer from facial seborheic dermatitis, and while using diluted dandruff shampoo on my face does help it can be extremely harsh on my skin. A friend introduced me to this mask and the difference I noticed makes it worth every penny. I use it daily and have no flakiness, no flareups or scaly skin, just glowing skin. If you have seb dem, give it a try. It&#x27;s hard to find consistent solutions but this has worked perfectly for me for a while now.</li>
    <li> Love it! When I first used it, I began to get a burning tingling on my skin but that went away after a while. After a few days of use, my skin was a lot smoother and moisturized. It also look a lot healthier. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask.  Goes on very light and it&#x27;s for everyday use. If I wasn&#x27;t so lazy I would use it everyday.  Love it, will order again, but I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this one was a flop for me.  My skin is very healthy right now, with no active breakouts and balanced moisture barrier, though I am prone to clogged pores and sensitivity if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a gentle cleanse, I applied this to one of my cheeks to test it out (since my cheeks are a little drier than the rest of my face.)  Within about a minute what started as tingling turned into a  painful burning sensation and I had to immediately rinse it off.  Luckily water neutralized the burning, and there was no lasting irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad really, I would have loved to have a gel-like moisturizing mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of positive reviews so this probably works for most people, but always remember to patch test since everyone&#x27;s skin is different!</li>
    <li> Love the facial mask. This has rosehip oil and several other powerhouse ingredients. Natural and no side effects observed. Sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> Feels great on, tingling sensation, after removing my skin is plump and moisturizer. Great for winter months or before makeup. My skin felt very balanced after using.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask, It leave your skin so smooth and hydrate, i use OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this serum helps sooth your skin,i would definitely recommend this product.  GOT THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR AN EXCHANGE OF HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I left the mask on for 5 minutes  didn&#x27;t have time for the recommended 15,and face still  felt very refreshed, clean, and smooth. It was really enough time to work and I used a wash cloth to rinse it off. This was three days ago and I will use it again tonight for the full 15 minutes. Lovely herbal blend  and it does leave the face hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this oz natural facial mask , I have tried almost all products , samples n gift but I feel by far this is one of the best facial mak  I have ever tried . I have a combination skin n my skin is very sensitive, this product gives me that smooth n shiny skin . I would definitely recommend it to all .</li>
    <li> I did not care for this.&lt;br /&gt;It felt more like a wash and not a mask.&lt;br /&gt;just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> (Note: I received this as a review product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my skin tends on the dry side, I avoid any product that says &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s because most masks are drying to my skin. But this product claims to be moisturizing, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear, without the clay in many masks, so there is no spooky cracked mask-effect after 15-20 minutes. But it does dry &amp;#34;taut.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of rose hip oil seem straightforward enough, but this mask does not feel oily.  I&#x27;m also not sure what pro-vitamin B5 and an amino acid complex will do for my skin; I doubt published studies are devoted to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask leaves my skin feeling soft and supple but definitely ready for moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have the time for a regular routine with this mask, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I like this mask. I do it after a mud mask and it soothes any dryness and irritation that comes from doing those masks. It also moisturizes the skin and feels refreshing. I am not sure that I would buy it again though because it seems that any aloe based moisturizer would do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Cleansing, cool feeling. Broke out a little the next day, but that could be because the mask pulled everything to the surface. I will use it again.</li>
    <li> We had a spa day at my house.  I decided we would pamper ourselves.  And let me tell you...our faces felt wonderful when we were done.  Skin was so soft. Definitely keeping this in stock at our house.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I got this product because I have sensitive skin so I washed my face and did a spot test on my cheek. I left it on and then removed with water and washcloth my skin was fine so later that week I applied it to my whole face after washing it. It went on smooth and was soothing. It came off easily with water and a wash cloth. My skin felt plump and Smooth! This is a great product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> After first use didn&#x27;t notice improvement on hydration as I had hoped.  But I&#x27;m willing to try it again.  I do love that all of the products in this line are really ALL NATURAL..</li>
    <li> This facial treatment is a clear gel with a faint herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not what I would normally think of as a facial mask, because it doesn&#x27;t harden and need to be peeled off like liquid masks or make a mess like clay masks.  It is an intense hydrating treatment with natural ingredients that soothe, soften, hydrate, and restore the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has a combination of dry, normal, and oily areas and this mask works well.  I also use it on dry areas such as the knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  After cleansing and exfoliating, apply and leave on skin for 15-30 minutes. Moisten and gently rinse to remove, and pat skin dry. Follow with serums, and lastly moisturizer. Gentle enough for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (72% organic):  Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf juice (aloe vera), kosher vegetable glycerin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, Cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), panthenol (vitamin B5), silk protein amino acid blend (sodium L-pyrrolidone carboxylate, sodium lactate, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-valine, L-proline, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-histidine, L-phenylalanine), organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil), organic Avena sativa (oat), frankincense essential oil (active, not for smell), organic Rosa canina (rosehip seed oil), opacifier, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided facial mask for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I am very leary of what I put on my face. Especially, the older I get. I dont want to add more problems or make my skin dry. I decided to try Oz Naturals Facial Mask because I really wanted some extra help. I was pleasantly surprised at the results! It make my skin feel smoother and a bit younger looking! I am waiting a bit before using it again just in case it might aggervate it. I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> Easy on the skin and feels like nothing is there when you put it on.  Sometimes I even forget that I have it on and have to wash it off the next day.  Very good product and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Forget about hard, crackly facial masks that are messy and a hassle to use. This one is refreshing, applies like a moisturizer and leaves my face feeling renewed, soft, and smooth. I apply it and leave it on for about 30minutes as I go about the house doing other things and then simply rinse it off. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as I received the product to try out free of charge. And I love it! Such a calming mask for my sensitive skin. I use it weekly and it makes my skin so soft every time!</li>
    <li> Awesome face mask. Use it once a week. Rejuvenates skin, reduces acne, fine line and tightens skin. Awesome awesome product.</li>
    <li> WOW is all I can say.  I have never used a moisturizing face mask with the immediate results this one has.  I kept the mask on for the extended time of 30 minutes and rinsed off with warm water.  My skin was incredibly soft and more importantly, my fine lines were extremely less visible.  I love using organic/vegan products on my skin and am thrilled to have found this product.  I will plan on using this mask 2-3 times weekly and will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I think face masks are such a fun product. I was hooked on a completely more expensive mask that came from overseas, but I just loved how it made my skin feel after. But after trying this product, I&#x27;m making  a switch. My skin felt just as good if not better then when I used the other product, and this product is half the cost of the other one, plus it&#x27;s Prime! :) Two days and I can have a new stock. I really like all the ingredients they include in their natural products, and everything they leave out. I try to eat healthy so why wouldn&#x27;t I want to make sure the things I&#x27;m putting on my skin are healthy too? This product rocked, easy to use, my skin felt great, and I didn&#x27;t have a bad effect at all! Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle mask with soothing ingredients.  It tightens as it dries but not strongly and washes off easily.  Enjoyable to use.    Update: I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and am seeing even better results.  My skin is definitely feeling more plumped and I am noticing fewer wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck.  This is a great addition to my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> What a great facial mask!! This product is fantastic! It smells good, hydrates well and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I use other products in this skin care line and they all have been fantastic! My skin is now in the best shape. I highly recommend this product as well as others in the Oz Naturals skin care line. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other skin care line. Will continue to be a faithful customer!    Disclosure: I received a sample of this product to review, however, the results are my own and my opinions are my own.  What a great skin care line!</li>
    <li> I really love this Facial Mask. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. When applying it after washing my skin I leave it on for the full 30 minutes like it says. I believe it was 15 to 30 minutes. I was worried about leaving a mask on for so long and doing daily activities. However, it drys clear so that I can go about and do my business without anyone noticing I have a mask on my face. It is a great herbal mask that I am going to keep using for sure. Oh and the smell is amazing. This product was provided to me free for the purpose of inspection and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love it, it keeps my skin soft and looking younger!</li>
    <li> Enough can&#x27;t be said of how happy I am with this facial mask from OZ. I, like most people have tried EVERYTHING from EVERY company that makes claims and promises. As someone with oily skin, and in the travel industry, THIS is the solution !! A definite way to pamper myself, even for the 15-30mins that I decide to leave the mask on. Easy to apply, I love the way my face looks refreshed, the feeling is great......of course using with the other products from OZ, your skin will NEVER be the same. I can&#x27;t even think of going back to what I was using before finding OZ. No more home shopping channel, mall visits, or &amp;#34;Mart&amp;#34; / drugstore purchases when it comes to my skin / facial regimen !! THANK YOU OZ NATURALS !!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product works really well with the OZ Facial Wash and gentle enough to be used every night. However, I don&#x27;t recommend it because it will not last that long. The consistency is lose and spreads really easy and also washes off easy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not your average facial mask where is goes on thick, white/green and creamy -- it&#x27;s not! It applies to your skin as a clear, thin film like substance that dries to your face after a few minutes... after about 20-30 minutes, it has hydrated and unclogged your pores, leaving your skin extremely refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about twice a week, after washing my face with the OZ Facial Wash because my skin is extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts after 2 weeks (4 applications) of testing this product [:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best facial mask I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  Good price, also.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but BURNED and irritated my sensitive skin. My skin is still red, dry, and irritated 3 days later.&lt;br /&gt;When I look back, it is VERY obvious that almost all of the reviews are fake because they are not made by &amp;#34;verified amazon purchases&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Evil company, terrible product, DO NOT FALL FOR THE SCAM.</li>
    <li> Great for dry, dehydrated skin! I love using it in the morning for a little facial pick me up :) The fact that it is all natural and cruelty-free makes this vegan girl super happy. I LOVE OZ Naturals products!!</li>
    <li> This mask burn my skin so bad and made my face break out. It&#x27;s not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am  a big fan of facial masks and this one did not disappoint!  it was easy to use, and left my skin feeling great afterwards. I will now be using this as my go to mask!</li>
    <li> This facial mask left my skin feeling very refreshed and radiant!  I would recommend this product to all of my family and friends who want to pamper their skin with ethically-sourced, cruelty-free ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. It goes on light clean and clear.  No scaring my family or dog with a clay mask anymore or ruinning wash clothes removing it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt nice and smooth with pores noticably smaller or at least unclogged.</li>
    <li> Love this product....such a soft clean feeling when used...still waiting for my free samples of products!</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It glides on smooth. It dries smoothly, per directions I keep it on for about 30 minutes. After rinsing my skin feels very clean and smooth. Follow with OZ serum, retinol moisturizer and eye gel.  All reasonably priced products that really work. I am very impressed with every OZ naturals product I have tried. The serum and eye gel I am on my second purchase. Seriously, great products for the price.</li>
    <li> • The packaging of OZ Naturals’ Amino Herbal Hydration Mask boasts it as “a botanical tsunami for hydrating and nourishing skin cells.” The mask is 72% organic and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;• The Amino Herbal Hydration Mask has a pleasant smell (which piques my interest because, try as I may, I cannot pinpoint the aromas in the super secret herbal infusion! Lavender, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;• I have been using this mask once a week, as part of my skincare regimen. I apply a light layer of the mask to my face and leave on my face while I give the bathroom a quick cleaning. After about 15-20 minutes, I wash off in the shower. It definitely leaves my skin feeling more nourished and plump with moisture.&lt;br /&gt;• As someone who frequently breaks out from skin care products, I was pleased to find that I experienced no breakouts from the Amino Herbal Hydration Mask. Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using—please see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, “What have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!”</li>
    <li> The tube was much larger than I was expecting. Normally the face mask products come in much smaller tubes so this is going to last me a long time. I have combination to dry skin and this is hydrating. I was concerned that it may not help my stubborn and dry areas but much to my surprise I have noticed that my flaking skin isn&#x27;t flaking anymore!!! You leave this on for 15-30 minutes and your skin will feel amazing when you wash it off. I love that these products are paraben free and natural. It makes me feel better about how I am taking care of my skin. Great company!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizing mask!</li>
    <li> Love this facial mask. Definitely does as its advertised.</li>
    <li> Try and use it daily, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I just got this product today and I immediately used the mask. It was only one time so far but the first time was pretty good. My face felt hydrated and not dry. It also felt really thoroughly cleansed. Seems to work good and I love that it&#x27;s mostly organic!</li>
    <li> Winter has always dried out my skin. This mask had helped put the moisture back into my skin. Very easy to use and it works. I have made it a bi weekly ritual since receiving it and am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizing mask. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and live in the South. This mask restores my skin every night. It is perfect for someone with sensitive skin like me. I want to also thank the seller for getting it to me sooner than scheduled delivery. Very happy !</li>
    <li> I use the product once a week and it is working as the product reviewed .  You don not need a lot to smooth the face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love how this made my skin feel!! Will be paying it forever!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, made my skin feel soft &amp; supple.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for several weeks a couple times a week. I really am happy with the glow my skin has. It is easy to use and ready to rinse in 15 minutes!</li>
    <li> Finally products that are eliminating embarrasing problems I have had for over a decade. Oz naturals are the only line of skin products I will ever use. Noticed great results in less than a week and my skin just continues to improve. Have dreaded even going to get my hair done for years because I was too embarrassed to sit in front of the mirror on that awful lighting. I am finally able to live in the moment without constantly worrying about my skin every second. These products truley have given me back my joy. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> These feels great going on. It&#x27;s very cool. It dries to a thin film and you leave it on for a while then rinse off. I thought my skin looked great after using it. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing mask I have ever tried, I use it 3-4 times a week after a good exfoliation. Feels great and really leaves your face well moisturized.  An added is the compliments that I get about how good I look (rested and skin just looks good.</li>
