      <li>Seems to only work when you first start to use.</li>
      <li>i no longer have any knots , and the vacuum is showing me that i am not loosing near as much hair as i was a month ago !</li>
      <li>So im wondering if this product is old or a knock off..pretty dissapointed.</li>

<li> Had high hopes for this product but all I got from it was dry, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I have highlighted, dry frizzy hair, and last spring I burned my hair with a flat iron.</li>
<li> I have to be very careful what I put in it because a lot of leave in treatments leave it looking greasy or feeing coarse.</li>
<li> I use it on both wet and dry hair.</li>
<li> I was expecting to get ONE BIG BOTTLE, but instead I got SEVEN LITTLE BOTTLES.  </li>
<li> My hair got so dried out in a short amount of time</li>
<li> and it naturally curly and thick ,</li>
<li> I had previously had a long illness that caused my hair to fall out</li>
<li> It does seem to make my ends less dry.  </li>
<li> :((&lt;br /&gt;this product seems to require a lot in application so may be better for shorter styles.</li>
<li> My hair was breaking badly, so my hairdresser got matrix total results to help calm the hair cuticle.</li>
<li> greasy and did not weigh down my hair, just had no effect.  </li>
<li> and then I saw this was slightly cheaper</li>
<li> I have dry, thin hair from coloring and straightening and all this does is make it easier to comb through my hair when its wet if I choose not to drench it in conditioner that day.</li>
<li> Not sure what type of hair it might work for, but definitely not my fine, curly hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the repairing results but as far as texture, this product works wonders!</li>
<li> I got a sample of this from a parade (believe it or not).  </li>
<li> My hair looked dull and damaged.</li>
<li> Very hard to find.. works in all climates....</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
<li> ,I was shocked.</li>
<li> and it was thinning rapidly and the ends of my hair looked horrible.</li>

    <li> The product must be old. It&#x27;s incredibly watery and literally does nothing for my hair. It is so watery that I have to use several pumps, and still nothing. I&#x27;m disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Love the lightness of this product on your hair and leaves it feeling so soft.  No fly-away hair for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE this for my hair! Does wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the repairing results but as far as texture, this product works wonders!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from a parade (believe it or not).  Thought I would give it a try and I love it.  I have used it twice and my hair looks and feels so much softer and healthier.  I will definitely be buying this product!</li>
    <li> i love this , it goes with a shampoo and conditioner  , it does work , it is even helping with my hair falling out . i am 34 , and my hair is to the middle of my back and it naturally curly and thick , and it&#x27;s always falling out or breaking or both , i have been using this shampoo and conditioner and the anti breakage total repair hair fix leave in , that goes with the shampoo and conditioner , and i have noticed the difference already ! my hair looks better , and feels better ! i was getting knots every day the back of my head would be full of knots . i no longer have any knots , and the vacuum is showing me that i am not loosing near as much hair as i was a month ago !</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Matrix repair shampoo and conditioner.  It is good, not super amazing, but my hair is very color treated and curly so everything helps.  I&#x27;ve used Matrix products since I was a teenager.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The first time i bought this product, i bought it in a local salon. I absolutely loved it. I wasnt able to find it anywhere in my area afterwards, so i came to amazon to purchase it. The product i recieved in the mail was not like the original i purchased in the salon. Its really watery, almost to the point where its just like water. NOT the consistency it should be. So im wondering if this product is old or a knock off..pretty dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and prone to tangle and break . I have to be very careful what I put in it because a lot of leave in treatments leave it looking greasy or feeing coarse. This does none of that. My hair feels soft and smooth -even the split ends-- It looks shiny and healthy and there are no more tangles.</li>
    <li> better than nothing but not as good as it was in the sample. :((&lt;br /&gt;this product seems to require a lot in application so may be better for shorter styles.</li>
    <li> We had a problem with our water.The softening system was not adjusted properly.My hair got so dried out in a short amount of time,I was shocked.A friend who was a hair dresser got me Break Fix.It was amazing!!In only a couple of weeks my hair is now back to normal.I will continue to use Break Fix,especially in the summer with sun and salt water.The best part is it does not weigh your hair down or feel greasy.Definitely a great product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it on both wet and dry hair. No heavy build up feeling it&#x27;s  very lightweight</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews and asking around about this product, I received all positive responses so I tried it.  Well, I think it is ment for younger hair, not over 40 hair.  It has done nothing at all for me.  Still a lot of breakage, no repair. I am now done with the bottle and no change in my hair.</li>
    <li> Already placed order for another.  Great for my hair.</li>
    <li> It does seem to make my ends less dry.  I use it every time I shampoo along with a product for heat drying and some mousse.</li>
    <li> I have waist length hi lighted hair and using this daily has helped my hair stay soft and shiny :) smells good and I need only a dime size.. Have thin hair and too much would not feel good! Nice size bottle at a good price :)</li>
    <li> I have highlighted and color treated hair and got this in hopes it would help with frizzies and make me hair softer. I  sure everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it just did not work for me. I just couldn&#x27;t tell it was doing anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t necessarily notice that it has made a difference in the amount of breakage in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used to use Redken Anti Snap and then I saw this was slightly cheaper so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Doesn&#x27;t hurt that my hair dresser uses it, too. It smells so good and works just as well as the Redken.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted, dry frizzy hair, and last spring I burned my hair with a flat iron. My hair was breaking badly, so my hairdresser got matrix total results to help calm the hair cuticle. I used the matrix shampoo and conditioner that worked well, but I have switched to loreal intensive nourishing shampoo and conditioner to use before the matrix. The results are amazing. The matrix repair makes my hair shiny and it feels so soft!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product but all I got from it was dry, frizzy hair. Not sure what type of hair it might work for, but definitely not my fine, curly hair</li>
    <li> Really effective, I can&#x27;t live without this product, I use it all the time.  It leaves my hair soft and silky!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, color treated, and I swim in chlorinated pools.  I&#x27;m getting it cut every 7 weeks for split-end maintenence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair stylist gave me a complementary bottle to try.  Had no effect good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t greasy and did not weigh down my hair, just had no effect.  I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found cheaper and more effective products for styling/heat protection and smoothing at CVS and beauty supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Matrix Total Results Conditioner and most every other Matrix conditioner  I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It sucks does nothing it smells good thats all i can say is good about it my hair is damaged didnt do anything for it</li>
    <li> This product is doing wonders for my hair. I had a lot of \\&quot;split ends\\&quot; in the strands of my hair. My hair looked dull and damaged. I had previously had a long illness that caused my hair to fall out and it was thinning rapidly and the ends of my hair looked horrible. This product is amazing! It works fast on \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; my hair because I did not think any product could help my hair. I have tried many products over the last two years and this product really helps my hair. Matrix has great products and I am so thankful for this product. Each time I use this product I notice the improvements of my hair. I will continue to use this product because it is very good for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I love it.  I am in my 80&#x27;s and are mourning my beautiful head of hair when I was young.  However, when I started using this product I found that my hair seemed much thicker again and kept a wave and hairdo looking good longer.  Great product.</li>
    <li> amazing value! recommend highly</li>
    <li> works great on my fine hair</li>
    <li> My wife wont live without this stuff.  :)  Enough said.  :)</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get ONE BIG BOTTLE, but instead I got SEVEN LITTLE BOTTLES.  I think I&#x27;ll take the time to go to the store when I run out of these \\&quot;sample bottles.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Styles, moisturizes and repairs your hair.Very hard to find.. works in all climates.... I never go without it</li>
    <li> best leave in conditioner, especially if your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> great frizzy hair product</li>
    <li> I will buy it again.  My hair is softer and less frizzy with not over the top shine.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Matrix Total Results Repair Fix Leave in Elixir, is amazing.  Sure it does what it says it will in the title, fixes breaks, but the shine it leaves in your hair is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love the product great moisturizer without being heavy or sticky. Great seller and price!</li>
    <li> I use this product before blow-drying my hair. I have found that not only does it protect my hair, but has restored some of my split-end damage. The only problem though is that you must use A LOT of the product at once- but it DOESN&#x27;T leave my hair feeling greasy. So yes, definitely works, but you&#x27;ll go through the bottle quickly.</li>
    <li> It smells bomb, but thats it. I have dry, thin hair from coloring and straightening and all this does is make it easier to comb through my hair when its wet if I choose not to drench it in conditioner that day.</li>
    <li> This product does not make your hair greasy, and it&#x27;s great for everyday use.  I don&#x27;t style may hair at all unless I&#x27;ve put this product in my hair first.</li>
    <li> Seems to only work when you first start to use. If you put to much your hair will become sticky.</li>
    <li> received as described. didnt notice a difference in my hair, but it may just be my particular hair</li>
</ol>
