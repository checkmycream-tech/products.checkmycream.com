      <li>Nice light oil without a scent.  </li>
      <li>my wife and i love it:</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t immediately absorb into the skin, so you can massage for quite awhile w/o needing more...</li>
      <li>The label looks like it was printed from home (perhaps on a high-end printer, but parts of the words were cut off on the top and bottom of the label), and there is no seal on the bottle when opening it.</li>
      <li>(yes, I tried it to check) :)</li>
      <li>Love it and will buy again.</li>
      <li>maybe it me:)</li>

      <li>I enjoy giving and receiving massages but this oil makes the experience not at all enjoyable.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t come out of the sheets as easily</li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the price :)</li>
      <li>Hands slide easily on the skin being massasged.</li>
      <li>it made me feel like a sweet exotic Brazilian beauty</li>

      <li>Nothing special, I bought it</li>
      <li>Adds a fun smooth glide when giving head.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both suffer from very sore feet because of our jobs, and after many by-hand foot massages we decided to try an electric massager to make the job easier.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, but I find that I need to use a lot more oil than I had anticipated...or</li>
      <li>It is a combination of many different vegetable and seed oils, and also has an agent that makes it much more soluble in water.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t stand up to kamasutra oil but its a quarter the cost so for a quick rub</li>
      <li>But I like EO product better, particularly because it did not ruin my linens yet.</li>
      <li>after spending my life savings on this product i highly recommend it to everyone who dares know what it feels like to ride unicorns on top of rainbows.</li>
      <li>Use very hot water.</li>

      <li>washing massage sheets, use some TSP (Home Depot or Amazon) along with laundry detergent to cut the oil grease right away.  </li>
      <li>no real scent, goes a long way, and feels great!</li>
      <li>(sometimes I just use a hot damp cloth to wipe it off).  </li>
      <li>Absolutely NO odor or fragrance of any kind.  </li>

      <li>My husband bought this for me because I have never been quite comfortable with going for a professional massage.</li>
      <li>As far as massage oil goes, it was not bad - went on</li>
      <li>After massage, wipe down client with paper towels, then warm, moist towelette.  </li>
      <li>very high viscosity</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  Smooth, thin, silky.  Leaves no heavy residue. After massage, wipe down client with paper towels, then warm, moist towelette.  This ensures no oily residue on sheets, which turn rancid with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing massage sheets, use some TSP (Home Depot or Amazon) along with laundry detergent to cut the oil grease right away.  Use very hot water.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  No smell and no stain, and no skin reactions either.</li>
    <li> Given all the positive reviews, it must have been a bad batch what I had received. It did have a light woody scent. Not too bad, but when it touched the linens, and I put them through the washing mashine the resulting smell was quite awful. Ruined 2 sets. I had tried washing, steaming, using scented fabric softener, sanitizing in vinegar and lemon juice. Nothing helped. So it must have been one of the components that went bad. As far as massage oil goes, it was not bad - went on smooth, not greasy. But I like EO product better, particularly because it did not ruin my linens yet.</li>
    <li> No smell as they say, well packaged, the oil is really soft and I used it realy easy...!  Gets off even with tissue paper, water is far. :p</li>
    <li> This oil is excellent. You only need a quarter size amount to do an entire arm, shoulder,hand and neck massage.  The oil itself is quite light compared to other oils and cleans up easier as well.</li>
    <li> It was okay. Not too slick.</li>
    <li> Light, non greasy, and absorbs easily into the skin. Used it on my boyfriend who has very sensitive skin and it did not irritate him one bit.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best oil for the money . Long lasting because it doesn&#x27;t take much and stays slick . No oder just friction free pleasure . Can&#x27;t say enough , we have tried several brands but this is our favorite .</li>
    <li> This massage oil, although it is supposed to be unscented smells gross. It has a stale smell and isn&#x27;t very smooth. This made the massage less enjoyable because the oil has a weird feel to it. I enjoy giving and receiving massages but this oil makes the experience not at all enjoyable. The oil leaves the skin feeling greasy even when used sparingly. Without even mentioning how I felt this oil to be, my husband also had the same things to say about it.     Beware!! It also stains fabric and furniture. I never allowed the bottle to spill or get messy and it still managed to stain my furniture leaving yucky rings. What a rip-off!    I do not recommend this massage oil at all!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this oil, smelled like fried foods or the kitchen, looked at the ingredients and found various types of oils, including canola and palm oil ... no wonder it smelled like Crisco!  Ended up throwing the bottle away.</li>
    <li> Not sure the difference between this and baby oil but it makes everything slide around alot easier</li>
    <li> My husband hates oily, filmy, girly-scented massage oils so I bought this based on previous reviews and I must say it definitely lived up to everything that was written about it. Spreads nicely without being too oily and is really easy to wash off (sometimes I just use a hot damp cloth to wipe it off).  If left on the skin, it simply feels like a light baby oil.  I also hate massage oils with a screw cap since it&#x27;s difficult to screw the cap on with slippery fingers so it&#x27;s a plus that this has one of those press tab dispensing caps.  Great product, especially for the price :)</li>
    <li> Great massage oil, great price for this amount and is lasting us a long time. My husband and I both suffer from very sore feet because of our jobs, and after many by-hand foot massages we decided to try an electric massager to make the job easier. We bought this along with it, and it&#x27;s been great. There&#x27;s no weird or girly smell, it washes off nicely, and this is a great price ($10) for this size bottle. We&#x27;ve had it for MONTHS and it&#x27;s not even half gone, though we do daily foot and back massages. Love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a massage oil that doesn&#x27;t have an odor. My wife has real issues with heavily scented products and this massage oil made it worth pulling out the massage table</li>
    <li> It doesnt soak in 100% but also doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin. It feels nice, and a little bit does go a long way. buying some flowers and spreading them across the bed, and using this to massage your wife/girlfriend&#x27;s entire body, will create a night she will never forget</li>
    <li> Wife and I love this oil.  Not sticky and has a good working time before you have to re-apply.</li>
    <li> This massage oil is a very good product.  It is a combination of many different vegetable and seed oils, and also has an agent that makes it much more soluble in water.  Clean up is very easy.  Most importantly, it is very smooth and lasts a long time.  My wife loves it, especially because it does not leave her feeling oily the rest of the day.  Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> just a great product, first time time ever buying/using massage oil. my wife and i love it: no real scent, goes a long way, and feels great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. No smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really try the product. it seems home-made. The label looks like it was printed from home (perhaps on a high-end printer, but parts of the words were cut off on the top and bottom of the label), and there is no seal on the bottle when opening it. There is a little red cap insert that acts like a pretend seal, but it comes right out without any struggle, so it is not a seal.  Then the bottle itself was a little greasy feeling (as if the oil had somehow leaked just a bit), and finally, when I looked at the solution, it didn&#x27;t seem to be crystal clear massage oil inside (I know it&#x27;s not supposed to be clear but with a yellow tint, but you get the idea). That just creeps me out that it might be home-made when it wasn&#x27;t advertised as such.</li>
    <li> My husband gives a phenomenal massage with benefits.  This is an amazing product.  It&#x27;s unscented, warms in his hands and has no taste.  We&#x27;ve used it as a lube, sort of, when it ends up all over both of us.  Adds a fun smooth glide when giving head.  Love it!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil that I have used for massages.  It is great for the skin. This oil dries very and is applied sparingly.  It is also non allergenic and has no odor or perfumed smell.  This oil only takes a dime size amount for each area of the body and does not leave a sticky residue after applying.  The wife and I love it.  She prefers this unscented oil over the scented oils.  If you prefer unscented or scented, I suggest the Master Massage brand.</li>
    <li> No smell, and a great buy for massage.  Purchase with confidence.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t come out of the sheets as easily as they might have you believe, it took several washings.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but I find that I need to use a lot more oil than I had anticipated...or maybe the people I&#x27;m massaging just have dry skin (?). This is great for people who are allergic or sensitive to smell.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in purchase and not worth the time returning it.  This is not what I received and the product was very oily and hard to clean.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect oil for a lil one on one time with your spouse. I will be ordering this again. ;)</li>
    <li> I broke out in hives and had severe itching. I had to shower immediately. Looked like I had a sunburn. I must have been allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has no problem with it.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil without a scent.  It really does wash out without leaving an oily stain.  Perfect for a good backrub.</li>
    <li> this lotion made me feel things that my wife could never make me feel. it made me feel like a sweet exotic Brazilian beauty was rubbing my love buttons with her silky smooth hands whilst running through a field of daisies singing what a wonderful world. the rich buttery sensation all over my chest was comparable to a full body orgasm. after using this love butter my noodles were more tender ever. every minute i&#x27;m not covered from head to toe in luxuriously creamy unscented fragrance it feels like my skin is crawling and i start shaking and feel so cold until jump into my love tub full of 77 8.5oz bottles of this lotion and bathe in its juiciness as i slowly drift away into the deepest of sleeps, and dreaming of such tender yet compassionate females rubbing me ever so gently. after spending my life savings on this product i highly recommend it to everyone who dares know what it feels like to ride unicorns on top of rainbows.</li>
    <li> The oil is completely unscented and works well for back/neck massages. In my usage I found that one application is enough for 20+ minutes of massage, and I estimate that the bottle contains enough oil for at least 40 applications. I purchased the product based on the other reviews and I am completely satisfied with my decision, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil! Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling icky or greasy. Have never had zits or skin issues with its use. In addition to using it as a massage oil, I love using it regularly after getting out of the shower and before heading out the door. Has never stained anything I wrote while using it. Highly Recommended! High quality oil! I have yet to find a message oil that tops this one!</li>
    <li> Nice quality non-greasy massage oil.  I would highly recommend this product and would personally buy it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. No strong scent, very soft and smooth when massaging with it. Not sticky or too runny. Good consistency.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the feel of this oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far and it was good. Odorless and didn&#x27;t stain, which is what I was hoping for. However, it was a little greasier than I had thought it would be, after having read numerous descriptions and reviews online. But it is a good basic and gentle oil for massage, at a great price, I will continue using it, and do recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Great oil, does not leave thick residue behind. Hands slide easily on the skin being massasged.</li>
    <li> very high viscosity so it doesn&#x27;t immediately absorb into the skin, so you can massage for quite awhile w/o needing more...once absorbed not greasy...would buy again...</li>
    <li> This Massage Oil was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had no scent that it was smooth to the skin and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me because I have never been quite comfortable with going for a professional massage. So now I can have a great massage in the comfort of my own home.  And he is happy to give me one because the oil makes it easier for his hands to go to work!</li>
    <li> Nice massage oil to be used with a warmer. Wife loves it, or maybe it&#x27;s the massage itself that she likes...........maybe it me:)</li>
    <li> Over all it&#x27;s alright but a little weak over all.  it doesn&#x27;t stand up to kamasutra oil but its a quarter the cost so for a quick rub I&#x27;d go with it but for the deep tissue spend the extra money and get a better oil.</li>
    <li> Based on that description about the oil, I ordered a bottle. When it showed up, it proved to have an ingredient my wife is indeed allergic to (sunflower oil, as it happens), rendering the oil useless to me. A check of the listing showed that the ingredients were NOT listed on the page, making it impossible for me to ever order from this company again. They state that the ingredients might change at any time - but how would I be able to know that it would be safe to use on my wife? Only by ordering a bottle and checking the ingredients on the bottle - at which point, it&#x27;s too late if it proves to have sunflower oil, wasting my time and money as happened here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to call it non-allergenic, it needs to *BE* non-allergenic.</li>
    <li> This is the best massage oil I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down. I was expecting this to dry up easily, but it didn&#x27;t. It goes on smoothly but does not leave a greasy feeling. It has no scent at all and will not irritate the skin. It does dry after a while but you won&#x27;t feel like you have to hurry up and wash it off. My only gripe is that the bottle leaks due to the generic cap, so be careful if you&#x27;re transporting it around.</li>
    <li> Great product, absorbs very good in the skin, scentless and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> No smell, which is nice  The lube is great, glide is great, and there is no residue left over.  Nice.  Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted out of an unscented massage oil. Makes the skin sleek, has no odor or taste (yes, I tried it to check) :)</li>
    <li> Nice feeling massage oil, washes easily, very little scent.</li>
    <li> This one is completely odorless. It is also not sticky and does not leave any residue on the skin. Overall a very good massage oil.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Oil has no real odor, does not stain, sufficient lubrication, good moisturizing.  There are no disadvantages in this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely NO odor or fragrance of any kind.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, I bought it I tried it and I won&#x27;t purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I can go to the mall and buy the same thing if I ever desire to.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT LEAVE THE SKIN OILY THE SKIN ABOSORBS THE OIL, IT DOES NOT HAVE SCENT SO IT IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a no-scent oil for a serious massage, this is the one.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for years.</li>
    <li> Any massage oil will work fine.</li>
