    <li> I am so glad I found this product because Midnight Pomegranate is no longer sold in Bath and Body Works stores. This bottle is just like what I used to buy from the stores, only cheaper. I would buy it again. I would recommend this to any of my friends. It smells heavenly, does not cause my skin (which is extremely sensitive) to break out, and it sprays evenly and to a proper amount. I use it every day.</li>
