      <li>one good thing I can say it did look good over my pink polish.</li>

      <li>Super cute</li>
      <li>its different and looks great.</li>
      <li>It arrived very fast and the color is perfect, it lasts a very long time,</li>
      <li>I only wish they were more popular and easier to find.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful pink that, even though it&#x27;s sheer, is still bright and noticeable after 2 coats.</li>
      <li>I love this so much.</li>
      <li>Really adorabe love it</li>
      <li>Love my new nail Polish.</li>
      <li>Shopping was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>My nails, only better!  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Yes it takes some work compared to a creme but its worth it.</li>
      <li>This is totally worth</li>
      <li>Makes for a quick, pretty manicure.</li>
      <li>I was impressed at first, it was pretty on, but didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>a plus OPI seems to always come up with something different and these tints are advertised in many magazines i have .</li>
      <li>I love this polish because it is sheer yet with enough color to make it interesting.  </li>
      <li>Out of the sheer tints this and the purple are my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this color, I use it for French manicures....</li>
      <li>I love the sheer tints collection because it&#x27;s so versatile.</li>
      <li>For the record, let me say that I LOVE sheer nail polishes!!!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter and was very surprised just how nice this looks alone or with a top coat when we used a red polish and completed the look with the sheer tint</li>
      <li>these look great over white polish with the other to make a pretty pastel color</li>
      <li>also made the red more vibrant .&lt;br</li>
      <li>too much color, really changes the color of the polish</li>
      <li>Was going nuts looking for a shiny top coat with a hint of pink to wear when I don&#x27;t feel like getting a manicure.</li>
      <li>and she really likes it too.</li>
      <li>The sheer tint is great, and the color has more pop to it than standard pink french manicure, which I like.  </li>
      <li>I chose this OPI &amp;#34;Be Magentale With Me&amp;#34; because I was really wanting a pink shade, and I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s dark and it looks good bouncing off of the white tips.</li>
      <li>, I love this product and it can be as dark as you want.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy no clumping or streaks its a wide Brush</li>
      <li>when I want a nice pink gloss (2 coats) underneath the white tip.</li>
      <li>A little thicker than most OPI polishes but</li>
      <li>But the consistency of this polish is different than any other Opi, this sheer tint kind is goopy and when it dries I can peel it off in sheets!  </li>
      <li>some OPI Drip Dry does a quick job in drying.</li>
      <li>However it does peel a little too easy</li>
      <li>I think I would like it better if it weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
      <li>Really pretty intense but sheer pink color.</li>
      <li>The formula&#x27;s a little thick but that can be fixed with a good thinner.</li>
      <li>we painted over a Pink polish it looked lavender so pretty and even alone</li>
      <li>Not what I was expecting, I was hoping it would give a natural look to the nail with a french manicure, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It goes on very thick and is hard to get the application on just right because it dries pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>When I originally searched for some sheer polishes, only these OPI ones and a few (overpriced) American Apparel ones popped up.  </li>
      <li>It wears really well;  the pink part of my nails look pinker and the white parts</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s pretty ugly on bare nails.</li>

    <li> Love my new nail Polish. I&#x27;m shocked by how fast my product came!</li>
    <li> This tint actually adds color..I wear it all the time</li>
    <li> lt&#x27;s on the thick side, so its not as thin as l was hoping it to be and it can get patchy when applied unevenly because of the thick consistency, but l do like it. A polish thinner can fix that.</li>
    <li> Love this color, I use it for French manicures.... when I want a nice pink gloss (2 coats) underneath the white tip. Looks really nice!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for this type of polish! This is a deep pink tint, it&#x27;s not a solid color. I love how as you add more layers of polish, the color intensifies</li>
    <li> I love this so much. I love that dark pink look on my french manicure as the base coat. This is perfect. You can build this up, and I take it to my nail tech and she really likes it too. I use two coats of this so it&#x27;s dark and it looks good bouncing off of the white tips. This is totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had nails since I was 16 and I am now 26, I love this product and it can be as dark as you want. It is made to be built up. But two coats is plenty dark. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this polish because it is sheer yet with enough color to make it interesting.  I doesn&#x27;t streak when applying. Makes for a quick, pretty manicure.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and was very surprised just how nice this looks alone or with a top coat when we used a red polish and completed the look with the sheer tint her nails had a beautiful shine also made the red more vibrant .&lt;br /&gt;,when we painted over a Pink polish it looked lavender so pretty and even alone its different and looks great.Goes on easy no clumping or streaks its a wide Brush so thats also a plus OPI seems to always come up with something different and these tints are advertised in many magazines i have .</li>
    <li> Really adorabe love it it leaves a sheer effect on your nails&lt;br /&gt; That reminds me of jelly. Love it alot</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product thinking it would be the perfect topcoat over a light pink nail.  The polish is thick and difficult to put an even coat on.  Then it started chipping the next day.  OPI needs to go back to the drawing board and work on this product.&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing I can say it did look good over my pink polish.</li>
    <li> My nails, only better!  It wears really well;  the pink part of my nails look pinker and the white parts whiter, all in one step.</li>
    <li> It goes on very thick and is hard to get the application on just right because it dries pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I like OPI nail polish but this tint is very thick and hard to apply. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Uggg....want to love this, but can&#x27;t.  The sheer tint is great, and the color has more pop to it than standard pink french manicure, which I like.  But the consistency of this polish is different than any other Opi, this sheer tint kind is goopy and when it dries I can peel it off in sheets!  It&#x27;s like that polish you had as a kid!!  Doesn&#x27;t even last me a day and I&#x27;ve tried multiple application attempts.  So sad.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique and beautiful color. I used three coats and loved it.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is transparent with a reddish color.  I think I would like it better if it weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I was impressed at first, it was pretty on, but didn&#x27;t last long.  Started to chip after a day.  Then had a awful time removing it.  7 cotton rounds and almost a 1/4 bottle of polish remover.  Ugh.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Shopping was fast and easy. Arrived on time. Was as described.</li>
    <li> It is a sheer tint so on that account it gets 5 stars. It may just be my coloring but the tint seems a bit garish on my pale skin. May work well for darker complexions but not sure. It does stay on well without peeling or cracking even on toes.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted. A Clear pink hard to find!</li>
    <li> Just as expected! However it does peel a little too easy</li>
    <li> The formula&#x27;s a little thick but that can be fixed with a good thinner.</li>
    <li> Super cute these look great over white polish with the other to make a pretty pastel color I think these would last forever</li>
    <li> Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> For the record, let me say that I LOVE sheer nail polishes!!! I only wish they were more popular and easier to find.  When I originally searched for some sheer polishes, only these OPI ones and a few (overpriced) American Apparel ones popped up.  I chose this OPI &amp;#34;Be Magentale With Me&amp;#34; because I was really wanting a pink shade, and I was not disappointed! It&#x27;s a beautiful pink that, even though it&#x27;s sheer, is still bright and noticeable after 2 coats. Definitely one of my favorites, and I&#x27;ll be ordering the other 3 OPI sheer colors soon!</li>
    <li> The price for this was perfect because I was looking for the entire collection. I love the sheer tints collection because it&#x27;s so versatile. These are a must have for any time of the year, not just spring!</li>
    <li> Still applies with a lot of color after only two coats, but jelly consistency. Long lasting too. Better than the Sally Hansen ones.</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast and the color is perfect, it lasts a very long time,</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting, I was hoping it would give a natural look to the nail with a french manicure, but it doesn&#x27;t. It looks too pink k.</li>
    <li> This polish is a bit tricky to use.  It&#x27;s kind of sticky and I&#x27;ve never experienced this type of polish before.  It&#x27;s also hard to remove.  My acetone-free remover did not work and had to buy some with acetone in it in order to remove the polish.  You&#x27;d think that it would be quite durable and long-wearing but it wasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a tad disappointed in this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  The seller sent the polish quickly so it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault that the product itself is mediocre.</li>
    <li> Out of the sheer tints this and the purple are my favorite.I heard some say these are gloopy but I found them to apply like most jellys. I almost didn&#x27;t get them due to the complaints that I heard but I am so glad I got them anyway.Yes it takes some work compared to a creme but its worth it.</li>
    <li> Better quality then in the stores</li>
    <li> too much color, really changes the color of the polish</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s pretty ugly on bare nails. I&#x27;ll try layering it on various other colors, but I&#x27;m not optimistic.</li>
    <li> Really pretty intense but sheer pink color. I applied two coats and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Was going nuts looking for a shiny top coat with a hint of pink to wear when I don&#x27;t feel like getting a manicure. This is exactly what I was looking for! A little thicker than most OPI polishes but some OPI Drip Dry does a quick job in drying. Love this polish will be ordering more!</li>
