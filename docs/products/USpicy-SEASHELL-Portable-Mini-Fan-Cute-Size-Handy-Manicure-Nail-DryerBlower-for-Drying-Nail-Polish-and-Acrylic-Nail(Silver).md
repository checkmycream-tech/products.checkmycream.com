      <li>This of course sounded like a good idea</li>
      <li>well the good ones aren&#x27;t I should say.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>Good product though.</li>
      <li>I always needed a nail dryer just never knew where I could find one at a good price.</li>
      <li>Loved it....</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>For as cheap as this was, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Instead I put my own set together for her.</li>
      <li>It does what it&#x27;s suppose to however I would have liked to have gotten the A/D wall adapter as well.</li>
      <li>The fan isn&#x27;t very strong..</li>
      <li>I think it would be an awesome gift for a teen/pre-teen, since my 12 year old daughter has been running off with mine since the day I got it.</li>
      <li>but I soon learned that if you want your nail polish to look nice, smooth and even DON&#x27;T USE IT!</li>
      <li>Good product and very reasonable price!</li>
      <li>The night I gave her the set she thought it was hilarious</li>
      <li>it better than nothing?</li>
      <li>Just be sure to have a set of double-a batteries on hand</li>
      <li>it does the job :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for a beginner</li>
      <li>I like the option of the dryer being battery operated, but using an electrical outlet is a better option for the setup in my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
      <li>Kind of a cheap plastic with no cords battery operated</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have issues with my fingers or toes touching the sides or the top.</li>
      <li>I love this....    </li>
      <li>Cute and helpful for the price</li>
      <li>All in all, would have went with a better model.</li>
      <li>It looks cute on my nail desk tho</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for so for almost $12, I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>so glad we got it.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to have a set of double-a batteries on hand</li>
      <li>the price was okay</li>
      <li>I am ery satisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>But I do love that you can travel with it</li>
      <li>This nail dryer is so cute.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t work any better than using a fan.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok since it does run off batteries</li>
      <li>It works pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small size makes it really handy and is perfect for taking with you while traveling.</li>

      <li>I know it was cheap to begin with</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to keep this dryer right with all my nail supplies.</li>
      <li>Very useful.</li>
      <li>, I use mainly for kids nails, or if I am playing with my own nail designs.</li>
      <li>Two freshly painted thumbs up!</li>
      <li>I love this size, since anything too large and bulky can end up being a hassle to use or to find a place to store.</li>
      <li>The twin pack is good for drying both hands at the same time or for splitting between my two homes.</li>
      <li>not bad for the price</li>
      <li>Best of all, it really cuts down on drying time for you nails.</li>
      <li>My hands fit nicely into the opening, with enough room to spare to allow the thumb nail to get some of the excess escaping air.</li>
      <li>. . . hearing Sweet Thing complain that she messed up her freshly painted nails.</li>
      <li>However, if you try to fit your thumb inside you will certainly smudge your nails.</li>
      <li>it is very noisy and cheap looking</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not huge, but it still works great.</li>
      <li>I think this fan is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I have a running joke with a friend of mine that she should open up her own nail salon.</li>
      <li>Simple but effective.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought because I bought a fast drying top coat.</li>
      <li>I use it to dry my toes and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I also received it pretty quick even though it did not have a tracking number.</li>
      <li>I took away one star because it blows a lot of air right out of the front</li>
      <li>so when you get it, you can start using it right</li>

      <li>Isn&#x27;t very loud and can be taken anywhere, its light and compact.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for on the go. However, you cannot fit all five fingers in the nail dryer if you have wet nails and you don&#x27;t want to mess them up. You will have to place your 4 fingers then thumb to dry. But I do love that you can travel with it and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Nowhere in the description did it say that the cord wasn&#x27;t included! I like the option of the dryer being battery operated, but using an electrical outlet is a better option for the setup in my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
    <li> Loved it....it does the job :)&lt;br /&gt;Good price</li>
    <li> I love this product - it works fabulously - my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with the ac adapter so that I didn&#x27;t have to use the batteries - I would rather use the adapter</li>
    <li> Kind of a cheap plastic with no cords battery operated unless you by the ac-dc cords separately. If you have large hands they will not fit unfortunately. Feet definitely don&#x27;t fit I don&#x27;t even know why they have that on there b/c you have to push a lever inside for it to began to blow. Cute and helpful for the price but I should have just bought regular table fans b/c clients do not like to have to hold lever down.</li>
    <li> Did what it said it would and its nice and portable the sis loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife &amp; She loves it. We read on an earlier review that the noise might be that of a hair dryer! It&#x27;s not it much quieter! She loves it and uses it constantly! We would recommend this product for anyone that does their own nails vs going to a nail salon! For the money it&#x27;s a great deal! Buy It!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be quiet, but it does the job. The only reason why I took off a star is because you have to hold down the button and it is a bit annoying for my impatient daughter to do. Other than that so glad we got it.</li>
    <li> I think this fan is worth the money.  I took away one star because it blows a lot of air right out of the front so it will make you cold and I do not like that. You also have to press your fingers down hard and hold the pressure to get it to turn on and stay on.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6919c7989b2a80c167cd8d91720e0a55]] This nail dryer is so cute. It&#x27;s the perfect size too. Just large enough for your fingers and toes to fit inside, but not so large that it&#x27;s a hassle to pull out and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:&lt;br /&gt;This is considered a mini size. It&#x27;s not huge, but it still works great. I love this size, since anything too large and bulky can end up being a hassle to use or to find a place to store. I&#x27;m able to keep this dryer right with all my nail supplies. I&#x27;m can easily fit all my fingers inside, except for my thumb (since it&#x27;s not long enough to reach inside). But I don&#x27;t find this an issue, because the rounded shape of the dryer blows the air outwards and right onto the thumb as well. So even though my thumb isn&#x27;t inside the dryer, it&#x27;s getting fan blown air on it as well. I can also dry my toes with this, and all my toes fit right inside. I don&#x27;t have issues with my fingers or toes touching the sides or the top. I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could have problems with their nails touching the top, since it&#x27;s several inches high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power:&lt;br /&gt;You can power this dryer using either batteries or an adapter. It does not come with either one, so if you want to use a wall adapter, you&#x27;ll have to pick one up. I&#x27;m using cheap disposable double-A batteries with it and so far they have lasted through a few nail paintings of both my fingers and toes. I haven&#x27;t needed to change the batteries yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;There is no on/off switch, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about messing up your nails by flipping switches. Instead there is a large button that runs the whole length of the dryer that your fingers/toes rest on when you put them inside. You activate the power by pressing down on this when you want the fan to blow on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This USpicy nail dryer works great for both finger and toe nails. I think it would be an awesome gift for a teen/pre-teen, since my 12 year old daughter has been running off with mine since the day I got it. It drys nails without blowing so hard on them that is messes up the polish. It&#x27;s small size makes it really handy and is perfect for taking with you while traveling. Just be sure to have a set of double-a batteries on hand so when you get it, you can start using it right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.ay I got it.

    <li> Smaller than I had thought but works well.</li>
    <li> It pretty much does exactly what it says. My daughter and I use this weekly. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and have had no problems. It&#x27;s great for the price. I wish it was a little bit larger, though. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> While the size is very nice, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have the power needed to actually dry standard or even speed up quick drying nail polish. The fan&#x27;s alignment sends the air current in a poor location, which can lead to bumped tips. All in all, would have went with a better model.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed at this product. I know it was cheap to begin with but I expected more than just a tiny fan thay you can buy at the dollar store. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all unless you like paying $15 for a fan you can get for a dollar.</li>
    <li> For as cheap as this was, it is a great product. I use it to dry my toes and it works pretty good. I would like it to dry them faster but you get what you pay for. I would still recommend it!</li>
    <li> The button that you hold down to start the dryer is easy  enough for a small child.  Product seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The twin pack is good for drying both hands at the same time or for splitting between my two homes. However, the units are set up for both battery operation or electrical, but the electrical cord is not included.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work any better than using a fan.  A hairdryer would be faster than this thing.  For the price it&#x27;s ok since it does run off batteries and you can take it anywhere, but it still takes a long time.</li>
    <li> the price was okay but it is too small to put your whole hand in you  have to put a few fingers in at a time. it doesn&#x27;t raelly dry the polish either</li>
    <li> I rated it a three because it needs a cord that doesn&#x27;t come in the package. It&#x27;s ok for a beginner and I&#x27;m happy with the quality! but I would have paid an extra few bucks to have the cord.</li>
    <li> The only thing I have to say is that this product should come with an electrical cord which would be more practical.</li>
    <li> This dryer is small enough to store easily, but sends out enough air to do a good job. My hands fit nicely into the opening, with enough room to spare to allow the thumb nail to get some of the excess escaping air. It is easy to hold down the place that turns the unit on. I am very happy with this purchase. I did not get any smeared nails when I used this dryer! Hooray!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend and she seems to like it. says it does the job . not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Fan turns on when you place your fingers underneath and would have to keep pressing to keep it on. Simple but effective. Also a good size and does not take much room. Shipping was fast and arrived early.</li>
    <li> This of course sounded like a good idea but I soon learned that if you want your nail polish to look nice, smooth and even DON&#x27;T USE IT! I had all sorts of ripples in the stuff that did dry and the rest were just a mess since I assumed too quickly that they were dry. I confirmed this with a friend of mine who went to Cosmetology school.</li>
    <li> Takes to long to dry.</li>
    <li> For my 6 year old, it meets needs and she uses it.  I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s getting much air, but...it makes her happy.</li>
    <li> the information stated that it came with a cord to plug in and it did not.  who has time for batteries.</li>
    <li> Now i don&#x27;t have to wait for my nails to dry, this wind blower can do it for me, the noise is not that bad.</li>
    <li> It took a while to be delivered and did not dry quickly. I left my hand in the dryer a few minutes and it still got smudged. Looks like I&#x27;ll still be needing to do the polish before bed time. Or was I expecting too much? Most videos on you tube tend to say that it will not dry fully right away. I might take on using cooking spray or olive oil like they suggest.</li>
    <li> didnt even get one use out of it..... it works for a minute or two and then stops and doesnt work again. its also VERY small so you could easily mess up</li>
    <li> I always needed a nail dryer just never knew where I could find one at a good price. When I received this, I was so happy! It works pretty good for the price. It is sort of loud, so I can&#x27;t really use it at nite. I would say it is about the noise of a hair blow dryer on Medium Air Flow. But other than that, it&#x27;s great! I also received it pretty quick even though it did not have a tracking number. I was a little worried, but I recieved it earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s daughter and she absolutely loves it. Good product and very reasonable price! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast.  This was a gift for my niece and she loved it!!</li>
    <li> It drys nails fast not loud at all only needs battery to power so no messy cords. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought because I bought a fast drying top coat. It looks cute on my nail desk tho</li>
    <li> not the most powerful little fan, but it does the job. You have to press down very firmly to activate the fan and must be careful not to smudge your nail color when inside the cave. i have very small hands so if your&#x27;s are quite large, this would be difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Little grandkids can dry their nails before wandering around the house.  Batteries seem to last quite a while, as while. ;)</li>
    <li> I love this....    I was skeptical about it,but for the price gave it a shot...  Glad I did!! I am going  to order a few more for back up</li>
    <li> This was bought for use in a nursing home to do the nails of women unable to do their anymore.  Very useful.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable manicure/nail dryer. It works well with batteries or an adapter. I have both. It does not come with the adapter so you do need to buy one but those aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> It works awesome, and arrived on time</li>
    <li> . . . hearing Sweet Thing complain that she messed up her freshly painted nails. I don&#x27;t mind that she likes to doll herself up (I really don&#x27;t mind!) but invariably I&#x27;ll hear about a smeared nail. Tragic. So, I bought this for her to speed up the drying process. It works, she&#x27;s happy and it didn&#x27;t break my bank. It&#x27;s also battery powered and small enough to take along on trips. Two freshly painted thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Was sad to have fan work for a few seconds then falter and die, over all was not happy with this as it seems very cheap in quality and also very small hand opening.</li>
    <li> Dryer works great and it is the perfect size! Isn&#x27;t very loud and can be taken anywhere, its light and compact. Great product!</li>
    <li> when I opened this product I could not even get all my fingers in it plus it made it sound like it came with the AC adapter and didn&#x60;t it is very noisy and cheap looking i would not even pay $5.00 for this little noise maker.</li>
    <li> I am ery satisfied with this product.  I gave it to my mom and she uses it every day, no complains.  The only problem is that i cannot find the AC adapter for it.....</li>
    <li> The fan isn&#x27;t very strong.. I have better luck holding my fingers up to a small &amp;#34;room cooling&amp;#34; fan than this device.&lt;br /&gt;Is it better than nothing? Probably. Is it great? No...&lt;br /&gt;The device looks as described, and is large enough to fit one hand. However, if you try to fit your thumb inside you will certainly smudge your nails. Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product, I hardly ever use it anymore. It is loud and not really worse the hassle.</li>
    <li> its a cheap, battery operated fan-  daughter used it like, once.  save the dough and use your current fan at home.  Tip: to use home fan for this, AIM fan at feet- very tough to do...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Cheaply made product, you may as well just put your wet nails in front of a regular fan. Very noisy and does not dry nails very well either.</li>
    <li> Has held up very well, I&#x27;ve used this for a while, either batter or cord operated works great, I use mainly for kids nails, or if I am playing with my own nail designs. It is a little loud, but very easy to move or reposition or carry when i am trying to get supplies together to meet a friend for a nail date.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and is just what i expected, works well for a small battery operated item. so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to however I would have liked to have gotten the A/D wall adapter as well. I can only do one hand(minus my thumb) at a time but the wind coming from the fan has a lot of power behind it. I use it for my toes as well . Enough to dry a base coat ,two coats of polish and a top coat.  I would recommend this product but suggest  you get the adapter too. Batteries are not cheap!!!! well the good ones aren&#x27;t I should say. Good product though.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, but crappy follow through. I likes a couple things but I mostly hate it lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Benefits&lt;br /&gt;1. Small and portable&lt;br /&gt;2. Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Shallow nail \\&quot;bed\\&quot;. It&#x27;s shallow; my thumb can&#x27;t even fit inside it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Loud!&lt;br /&gt;3. Sucky drier. Spins fast but little air blows and it isn&#x27;t consistent.&lt;br /&gt;4. The pressure pad isn&#x27;t very good. You have to press fairly hard and it really does get tiring after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;5. Hardly shaves off any drying time on multilayer designs. I typically only use it to dry between steps and layers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I had to do it over again, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for 15 bucks. I saw the exact same thing at walmart last week. For the 15 I paid here, I could have gotten the drier in black and like 30 nail polishes (they came together in a Christmas set).</li>
    <li> Love this! My nails get dry really fast! It is a little loud tho! But, i still use it a lot!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for so for almost $12, I guess it&#x27;s okay. The fan seems to lose momentum the more you press down on it. There&#x27;s no place to really put your thumb if you have long fingers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use at arts and crafts shows to help with rapid drying of my knots on elastic bands for my home based jewelry business.  This unit works great and is compact for travel but  I really needed one that blows warmer air especially in chilly or damp climates.</li>
    <li> I have a running joke with a friend of mine that she should open up her own nail salon. Over the Christmas season I saw a manicure set with a mini nail dryer for $5 in a catalog but it was already sold out before I could log in to order it. I&#x27;ve been waiting for it to come back in stock but so far it&#x27;s no go. I searched for one on amazon but it turns out that the set no longer exists. Instead I put my own set together for her. The night I gave her the set she thought it was hilarious and we immediately began painting our nails. This dryer is not the strongest but it did dry our nails faster than waving them around in the air for an hour lol. It&#x27;s a little loud too but for a novelty gag gift it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from a mini dryer, but I didn&#x27;t even receive the brand that was advertised. I suggest that you should not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Received this product just as I had expected.  Really like that it is a shell - so that it can circulate the air when the fan blows all around the finger nails.  Like that it turns on when you press down, instead of some fans I&#x27;ve seen that just turn on and can waste batteries.  It is not loud at all.  Best of all, it really cuts down on drying time for you nails.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much! perfect!</li>
    <li> It works great for the price. I really like it. It is battery operated to it is portable. You don&#x27;t ever have to worry about finding a outlet.</li>
