<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well made but not as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> The best clippers for men that I have ever owned. They fit well in the hand and have a no skid lever so they will not slip. Very well and I made expect they will last many years.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very sharp and work as advertised.  A small nit is I find the cutting blades a little thick, so putting them underneath nails a little bit of a stretch.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers.  I got these for my husband but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m keeping them.  They have a brushed finish and a few extra design elements that I found appealing and slightly masculine.  They are sturdier than your typical store bought clippers and you can tell that from the minute you hold them.  They are slightly heavier than your standard clippers and the top part that you push down to clip your nails doesn&#x27;t slide around.&lt;br /&gt;They did a great job clipping my nails and I loved the little hidden file on them; it worked great.  The reason I say I might keep them is because I knit and their slightly compact size fits perfectly in my knitting kit.  By compact I mean that they are a little smaller than the large clippers that you typically find but are larger than they little clippers that you can get pretty much anywhere.  They would be great to keep in a tackle box or a first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very attractive and it showcases the clippers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a great product that I would recommend to for men or women and especially anyone who likes a well designed, well made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied this complimentary product for review and am very grateful to have a chance to provide my unbiased and honest opinion</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my wife because she has very thick toenails after several toe surgeries and I was looking around for one and saw a promotion so hopped on board.  She loves it!  She finds it easy to grip and strong enough to get through her nails without them tearing or flaking off.  It gives a nice clean cut too.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Dreadful.  We all know that high price doesn&#x27;t guarantee quality, and that&#x27;s certainly true in this case.  These clippers are hard to fit under your nails (if you keep them closely cropped as I do) and they don&#x27;t cut particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would be better than my old drug-store clippers, but actually, they&#x27;re not as good.  Don&#x27;t pay more for less, like I did.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of different brands of nail clippers out there. Most of them just are not good enough for my husband to use and not destroy his nails. They never seem to cut right. These worked great. They are very sturdy, but light weight. I love the design of them. You can tell while looking at them that they are very nicely made. They cut through my husbands nails with ease. Quite impressed.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s favorite nail clipper.</li>
    <li> Sharp and has a good grip.</li>
    <li> Strong sharp quality nail clippers!  Stainless steel.  Won&#x27;t break.  Won&#x27;t rust. One sharp cut that don&#x27;t leave jagged edges! Far better than anything available at the local grocery store!  Deep bite to fit the whole nail. Great for fingers and toenails.  Great size.  Nonslip grip. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> These clippers work great.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers? Really? My immediate reaction when approached to review this product was a huh-moment. One would be hard pressed to find a junk drawer in America that doesn’t hold at least one dime store nail clipper. So I didn’t think there was anything a manufacturer could do to improve upon something so basic in male grooming. Wrong! These aren’t the same cute little chrome clippers; they’re turbo-charged. I’m talking strong, durable stainless steel, and precision sharp at the business end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a single guy, a million years ago, I learned that first impressions go a long way when meeting women. They are very detail oriented, and a man’s fingernails are a visual calling card that can be more impressive than a platinum bankcard. Virilem Nail Clippers are well made and very sharp - sharp enough to also do a great job on toenails. But clear the room, because those thick toenail clippings can be semi-dangerous projected missiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this device looks like most other nail clippers, once you hold it in your hand, the difference is clear. It has the feel of a real tool. Virilem has designed and manufactured a high quality clipper that precisely cuts nails. But there’s more! The rounded edge of the clipper’s lever is perfect for pushing back cuticles to facilitate uniform nail growth. So it’s a complete nail grooming station in one little device. A lifetime or 30-day money back guarantee tells me that Virilem Nail Clippers For Men has set a new gold standard for the well-groomed male. Highly recommended! A sample product was provided for this unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have always liked using pocket nail clippers and these are the ultimate! The usual ones are chrome plated but these are solid stainless steel, sort of like military spec. I use nail clippers also for removing splinters(I haven&#x27;t tried doing open heart surgery with any yet). There is also a saphire nail file built into the handle. There are two slots that you could put a carrying strap through. These make nice medium priced gifts for both men and women as stocking stuffers, grab bags, secret Santas and so forth.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  Great quality.  Cuts very cleanly.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and accurate. They replaced several from the drug store.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and high end quality product.</li>
    <li> WOW......possibly the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used...........received as a gift to test and review.........This clipper works on even the heaviest toe nails..........smooth action... great size............get your clippers today..........highly recommended</li>
    <li> It was a little odd in getting this item as a review item but I&#x27;m glad I was asked.  I honestly figured a nail clipper is a nail clipper ans so on, boy was I wrong. They are a nicely engineered piece of metal that goes the distance in getting your nails cut.  I have DVT issues in my legs so the circulation causes super thick toe nails and which are very tough to trim.  These clippers had no problem in getting through the nail and making short work of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers have a nice weight to them and are engineered to really make a difficult job much easier.  You get a lifetime guarantee and a 30-day money back guarantee so there are no worries with this handy little piece of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> First off these clippers may be aimed towards men but I think anyone could use them. They are made extremely well and well worth every penny that there selling for. Very sturdy and easy to hold, these clippers cut effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Excellent Clippers. Very sturdy, compact and sharp.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers very sharp.  But I had a problem get close cuts on my nails.  Maybe the way it was design or the shape of my fingers,but I could not get close cuts.</li>
    <li> Reached a frustration level with my &amp;#34;fail&amp;#34; clippers and decided to order several promising higher cost clippers. Four brands arrived today and these are the winners. Clear winners.</li>
    <li> Awesome sharp, so it does not hurt my brittle nails! I got very weak soft nails that my dermatologist asked me to take a lot of beta colarotine for treatment. Still, my nail usually cracks a little bit when I use normal nail clippers. But this one is so sharp that my nail was nicely cut with cracking up. I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth. Great quality.</li>
    <li> This clipper was great out of the box, but after about a month of minimal use, the blade has become dull and tears my nails rather than cuts them. It is now unusable. I have gone back to my $4 clipper I&#x27;ve been using for well over a year.</li>
    <li> These are a wonderful set of nail clippers. I got them for my husband and he loves them! They are very sharp and cut through his nails with no problem and they are thick. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well I was able to grip them. They have a nice anti slip grip and they are so well made! I received a discount on this item to review them.</li>
    <li> These are Great.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> great clippers very sleek and sharp!</li>
    <li> Good thing that I got it in time because my old one already broken. I love this product because more comfortable to clip and durable too.</li>
    <li> Good quality clippers</li>
    <li> I got tired of the cheap clippers that never actually worked properly. They would rip and tear the nail more than actually clipping it. These were more expensive but worth it. I work with my hands and jagged/split nails are just annoying.</li>
    <li> I got this nail clipper for my fiance because he has some super strong nails on his fingers and toes and I&#x27;ve watched him time and time again struggle with clipping his nails with my regular nail clippers. He absolutely loved this nail clipper because it is sharp and strong enough to clip his nails without having to struggle with it. The nail clipper clipped his nails so effortlessly that he actually sat there for a few minutes in surprise. It&#x27;s also made of stainless steel which is great since it won&#x27;t rust in the near future and hopefully he will be able to use these clippers for years! We would definitely recommend this nail clipper to anyone with strong stubborn nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> It appears to be a strong nail clipper. It cut my nails cleanly. It has a lifetime guarantee. I wish it had a pull out nail file instead of a rectangle on the clipper where you can rub your nail over it. Overall a good clipper. I was offered clippers at a discount for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> very well built and sharp work great</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers, I&#x27;ve never been happier with clippers :)</li>
    <li> Top shelf quailty nice and sharp</li>
    <li> Very good clippers even though they are made in China</li>
    <li> It has always been hard for me to find a good pair of nail clippers.  I had a pair for years that I loved until they got lost and ever since then I&#x27;ve struggled with cheap drug store clippers.  I recently gave these a try and I am thrilled at the quality and sharpness.  They came packaged in a nice box which included information on the lifetime warranty.  There is a small nail file built in that does a very good job.  You can tell that they&#x27;re a quality set of clippers as soon as you take them out of the box.  They feel heavy and strong and cut my nails with minimal effort.  It leaves a very smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a retail set free of charge for a promotion but I would honestly buy these for gifts or if I ever lose mine!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6a3dce5339bded4d61d4c4e296ec9299]] From time to time  manufacturers will send me a product and ask me for my opinion.  When they asked me to evaluate this clipper, they made it a point to tell me how these were extra strong, and much sharper than most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they were claiming these were \\&quot;extra strong\\&quot;, I wanted to see if I could give them a much bigger challenge than simply cutting my fingernails.  Besides, I don&#x27;t think anyone would be interested in a video of me cutting my nails.  So, I found a bunch of items and put them to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that just about anything I could fit into the opening cut with minimal effort.  Just as important, I also wanted to see if those items would damage the blade.  I&#x27;m happy to report that the Virilem clipper came through with flying colors.  It easily cut through the items and after close inspection with a magnifying scope, the blades were not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is clearly of superior quality, and it has a nice masculine feel to it.  There is an integrated file under the handle which does a great job of smoothing out any rough edges.</li>
    <li> The clippers are very nice, incredibly sharp, and make nail cutting a breeze!  Maybe joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sadly there is one issue in which the clippers fail.  And because of that failure, I am still required to carry my old pair of drugstore clippers with me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper has NO tool to allow you to clean under your nail, one of those curved tips that allows you to make your nails look clean after they have been trimmed.  Kinda sad.  I will certainly use the clipper because it cuts so nicely, but I wish I still didn&#x27;t have to carry another tool with me in order to get the real job done.</li>
    <li> A very nice small tool for fingernail.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband who has the thickest fingernails in the world.  They are not wide enough to go over his thumbnails or toenails, but will cut his fingernails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the dollar store, but have to concede that one of the worst products I ever got there was a nail clipper. It was so flimsy that the lever would pop off if you didn&#x27;t center it perfectly. So when we were offered this product for review we gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the sturdiest and sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. My one quibble is that the blades are too small for toe nails.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, I hope they really last as long as they say.  The blade is a little big, almost big like toenail clippers but not quite.  Still, great product.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, well made and sharp. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> A very good pair of clippers. Sharp and designed to where they are comfortable to carry. There are 2 slots at the back that are perfect to tie on a bag.&lt;br /&gt;The grip on the top is a unique design that holds your thumb in place.&lt;br /&gt;This really is a cut above the rest!!</li>
    <li> My fiance has been carrying around pink polka dot nail clippers and it bugged me so bad! I cam across these which are masculine and I love them! They are easy to use sharp and clean cut! Light weight and easy to use! I highly recommend the quality it great! I recieved  these nail clippers at a discounted price to test and review!</li>
    <li> My husband has the hardest nails and these nail clippers work so well for him.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and well constructed product. The clippers have a very nice feel and heft when holding it. The clippers are very sharp and makes a clean cut. It also doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to squeeze the clippers. I would highly recommend this product over the inexpensive clippers that you can find in dollar stores or found in gift packages that see every holiday season. The only con and this is basically a personal preference is that I find the cutting edge a little too curved for my tastes. I like my nails cut close to the top of the finger and the curved cutting edge is a little too much. To be fair, it&#x27;s not just these clippers, but this seems to be true in most all other fingernail clippers that I have come across. If it was a little less curvy, I would definitely give it five stars. See it next to my &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; generic clipper in my photo.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp!!!  Heavy duty!!!  But, lightweight!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. The clipper, however, feels a bit &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; (as in basic) to me. The Seki clipper is just as good at clipping, and feels more refined.</li>
    <li> Nice weight and easy to squeeze.</li>
    <li> Finally a finger nail clipper that REALLY WORKS !</li>
    <li> Nice sharp nail clippers and very compact to.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are sharp, they have a nonslip Matte finish with the sharpest cutting edge.  My nails get clipped smooth and I don&#x27;t have to file afterwards.</li>
    <li> These are a great product. I am so use to clippers not working well......these are the best. Works great.</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  Since the cutting edge is stainless steel they should stay sharp. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product and should last a while.  I would suggest one design improvement, as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one looks down on your big toe, there is an arc from left to right.  When you take a downward view of the clippers, you will see a similar arc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now look at your toe from the front.  There is a similar arc in the vertical plane.  These clippers, as others I have owned, are *flat*.  Because the toenail is curved, the clippers do not fit properly over the nail.  One has to &amp;#34;nibble&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;chew&amp;#34; at the nail with the edge of the clippers in order to make a cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest a 3D curve would make for a more effective product.</li>
    <li> It works great and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Finally nail clippers that work and so easy to use</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Threw away all others!!!</li>
    <li> I have used more than 10 different kinds of nail clippers in the past, and It has always been hard for me to find a good pair of nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;The order from Virile arrived on time packaged in a nice box  My first impression is that I like the appearance, does not look so shiny, which is the color for man.  It is made of stainless steel, and a little bit heavier than other nail clippers that I had, and is rally sharp, which cut my fingernail, and even thick toenail easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Who knew nail clippers could be such high quality!  I was very surprised and pleased when I open the package!  First, the feel of the clippers is impressive, and most of all the cutting edge!  Hey,... cutting edge technology!  Seriously,  when you buy these clippers, you will be very happy you did, so don&#x27;t delay, but today!!</li>
    <li> Not just for men, I use these clippers on my kids and myself.  Love the feel of them and they are nice and sharp for effective cutting.  Such an improvement over the old drug store clippers we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> These have been the best nail clippers that i have owed to date.  I have to keep taking them back from the wife.  Great product.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clipper I ever owned. The nail clips are so sharp, leave your nail with clean cut that does not require filing. The clipper is solid stainless steel, look and feel very nice. I also really enjoy the Matte finish and the little filer on the clipper handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great nail clipper. I am planing to buy more to replace my other ones.</li>
    <li> WOW!!  By far these are the BEST fingernail clippers I have ever used/owned!!  Looks Great, Clips Great, a conversation piece with in themselves!!  With a product this great I don&#x27;t understand how you could keep from putting your name on then somewhere!  Precision made!!</li>
    <li> High quality! Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> These are great nail clippers in ways that are so obvious that it stuns me how few, if any, other companies incorporate these features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they are designed for men. Men tend to have larger hands and the often pointed, narrow, slippery lever (or whatever you call the top part you press down) on most nail clippers just does not work well for men. These clippers have a nice, wide lever with a matte finish that actually lets you do the job without misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, on this same top part is a rough rectangular area used for filing the nails. Instead of having to pry a tiny, toy-like nail file (with virtually no ability to actually file nails) from inside of the unit, the filing surface is right there for easy use, and it works! That filing surface is protected when the clippers are closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the cutting edges have a wide enough separation that you can actually clip thick nails, and so that the clipped nail generally does not jam inside of the unit. The blades make a clean, effortless cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds silly to basically say that the top part doesn&#x27;t slip from your fingers, the nail file actually files, and the blade actually cuts-- but that is exactly what sets this nail clipper apart from the other junk out there! These nail clippers are attractive with a burnished look. They could easily be used by both men and women. Yes, they cost more than the typical drug store variety but they&#x27;re worth it. Great product!</li>
    <li> These are not your dollar store fingernail clippers. They are very sturdily made,with cutting edges that look wickedly sharp and that will hold its edge for a long time. They make it easy to clip your fingernails,hang nails,and buff down the rough edges so your hands look elegant.I really like these and think they will be the last pair i ever have to get.&lt;br /&gt;I received these for testing and i really recommend you get them,having the nail file on top really makes it convenient. Also if they break they have a great lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
    <li> I admit, I was skeptical, for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The cost.  I usually spend about $3 on nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;2) The gender requirements.  Really?  For men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review, though, so I decided to give them a shot.  And even though I am not a man, I am very impressed.  Unfortunately, my husband has decided that they are for him (since he is a man), and keeps stealing them.  Apart from that, though, they are GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something about the weight of the product that makes it clear that they are simply a higher quality than what I usually buy at the drugstore.  The pieces fit together snugly - my problem with drugstore clippers is that after a year or so, the top piece gets slidey and I&#x27;ve even had them fall apart in my hands.  I haven&#x27;t had these for very long, so I&#x27;ll have to check back in later, but they just *feel* better put-together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file part actually files nails, instead of just being a pretty criss-cross design like on the drugstore clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their design is also sleek and sophisticated, which I didn&#x27;t think I cared about, but they do look nice.  I imagine if somebody is snooping in my bathroom cabinets and they see these, they will think I&#x27;ve made some good life choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut cleanly and don&#x27;t leave any hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their lifetime guarantee is a nice touch.  Again, I go through drugstore clippers on a fairly regular basis, because they fall apart after awhile.  It&#x27;s nice knowing that these have a guarantee behind them, but to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t seem like I will need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, even though I am not a man, I do love these clippers.  They have become a hot item in my household.</li>
    <li> I love these! With cheap clippers the nail gets thrown across the room. I found these clippers can do small precise areas. Love how it doesn&#x27;t spit the cuttings everywhere. Love the feeling of the handle so they don&#x27;t slip out of your hand. Package came very fast and great packaging. Easy to open and remove the clippers.</li>
    <li> Very cute and durable metal unlike those shiny cheap metal, the lifetime warranty makes it evenbetter</li>
    <li> Maybe I have strange fingernails, but i had a bit of a difficult time getting the clippers onto my nails, otherwise yes they are sharp and the file on this is actually MUCH better than the standard cheap nail cutters.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4d65a25856db6bbff3c283d1098e6511]] **UPDATE** I was traveling through Baghdad, and there was an IED that was discovered by a unit just down from my hotel.  The bomb tech needed something to cut the tough little wires, but his pliers wouldn&#x27;t suffice.  I had my Virilems in my pocket, and not only did it save the lives of 14 people that day, but their nails looked simply fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Sharper than a katana.&lt;br /&gt;- More beautiful than Brad Pitt.&lt;br /&gt;- Faster than a drunk Snookie.&lt;br /&gt;- More attitude than a two year old who wants more cheesecake.&lt;br /&gt;- Grooms better than a cat tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars.  These will last 3-4 lifetimes of normal clippers--they will pay themselves off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy cutting.</li>
    <li> Love these! Got them for husband and he has strong toenails! These make it so easy and quick! And lifetime warranty?! Yes please!</li>
    <li> From the first feel out of the package I could tell that this was a superior product. Then, when I put it to use I found the feel matched the function. Effortless cutting and my nails felt smooth after. No jagged edges. I would certainly recommend this product. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is very sharp, but I like the older style clippers better.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  Cut very easily and are designed to be easy to hold onto while cutting.</li>
    <li> These are well designed and really nice clippers. They definitely seem heavy duty. They have great clipping action and it cleanly. They also look sleek and manly. More than just a tool, this is for sure a stylish hygiene accessory.</li>
    <li> Excellent, as advertised!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like a well groomed man? And the nicely cut and well cared nails are the part of the whole image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband usually buys nail clippers in a drugstore. In a month or two he needs to replace them because they break or the cutting blade loses it sharpness and the clippers become useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I got these Fingernails Clippers by Virilem he agreed to try them. He was skeptical because “what can be different in nail clippers, right”? Well, let’s just say he doesn&#x27;t think this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tried them on his hand nails and on toenails and  got great results on both. The cutting blade has a round shape that fits nicely with the shape of the nail. It is very sturdy and cuts the tough toenails pretty easy. It did take two times to cut the thick toenail but there was no ripped edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also comfortable to hold and has a no-slip grip because of the matte finish. My husband also really liked the built-in nail file. It is small but comes handy when you need to file down the edge of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fingernails Clippers by Virilem cost more than the ordinary drugstore clippers but as the saying goes “you get what you pay for”. In this case the price is well worth it and with the lifetime guarantee the company stands by it’s a no-brainer. You save money in the long run because you do not have to replace them all the time like the cheaper versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fingernails Clippers by Virilem are small enough to keep them in your bag in case you need to use them on-the-go but sturdy enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband actually threw out the pair of nail clippers he was using before and keeps these clippers in his bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention LADIES! You can use these clippers too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says “for men” but I&#x27;ve decided to try it on my toenails. It worked great and it was easy for me to use. I like that it is lightweight and is comfortable to hold. I liked the clippers so much that I might buy one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I would definitely recommend these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are 100% mine.iked the clippers so much that I might buy one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I would definitely recommend these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice pair of clippers. They are easy to hold onto because they are gripped. They are very sharp and cut very clean.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He was amazed, as he has some unruly toenails.  He mentioned that most clippers break when he tries to clip his toes and these actually were able to cut this toe nails without any problem. Very durable, great product.</li>
    <li> Good quality, and nice packaging. Seems like it won&#x27;t rust, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> These are seriously amazing. My son has ridiculously strong fingernails and toenails and regular clippers either break or hurt his fingers. The cut with no pain and are very well constructed so they remain in tact. These will now be my go to clippers and  I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Unlike other clippers,  this one is not flimsy at all and right sized.  It is convenient to use.  It does not slip out of your hands every time when you clip you nails</li>
    <li> Made in China.  Overpriced and poorly made.  Buy the Seki brand from Japan instead.</li>
    <li> Work great. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> My husband love these clippers!! Regular clippers didn&#x27;t work so well and these are made of great quality material.</li>
    <li> The design it too blunt for shaping the nails as you cut them.  They&#x27;re very good for cutting my thick nasty toenails, though.</li>
    <li> these were ok. they are well made but they are hard to grip.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and very sharp probably the sharpest I have ever had, wish they were bigger for my feet.</li>
    <li> They are great clippers. Very easy to use. Most clippers I bought lately do not last long. They get dull or break easily. These are great!</li>
    <li> It is a nail clipper and it works. the only thing that I really like is that the ends are flared out so you have more grip.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very precise and the file works well, although it&#x27;s a little small. You pay more than other brands but it seems to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> These clippers come with a lifetime warranty, but I don&#x27;t expect to ever need a replacement.  These are strong, well-built clippers that seem like industrial strength.  They can handle the toughest nails.  At the same time, they are easy to use for fingernails and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they had the sharp nail file that some clippers have that can be helpful for hangnails and cleaning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get they hype. I bought these for 1 cent through a promotion I saw online. I only got them for the novelty of getting a pair of expensive fingernail clippers for 1 penny. I don&#x27;t understand why they would normally cost so much otherwise. They&#x27;re functional and do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, that&#x27;s about all I can say for them.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. Easy to use</li>
    <li> THESE ARE WONDERFUL!!  THEY ARE NICE AND STURDY.  THEY ARE HIGH QUALITY AND I KNOW THEY WILL LAST</li>
    <li> It used to be that you could get some decent fingernail clippers, for example, Revlon was a good brand, for a couple of bucks. I don&#x27;t know what happened in manufacturing, but it seems like for the last couple of years, all the fingernail clippers I buy are lousy, and not only cut nails poorly (almost tear them, rather than cut them). Plus they break easily and the levers tend to go off kilter and you can injure yourself. So I read the reviews on this, and though I don&#x27;t have much money, decided I&#x27;d rather buy something decent that won&#x27;t damage my nails, will work properly, and which will have a chance to last longer than a few months. These cost more than decent clippers used to, but they are made well, have smooth lever action and the lever seems secure, and they don&#x27;t tear the nail, though they are a little sharper than I am used to. The older clippers you could use on dry nails, but these newer ones recommend you cut your nails when they are wet, like right out of a shower. There is no cleaner for under the nail, but there is a small nail filing section on the upper lever. Also no hole for hanging from a key ring. Good metal though.</li>
    <li> I have been using nail clippers my whole life, which is longer than I care to think about, and I&#x27;m really impressed with these little guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the construction.  They&#x27;re lightweight, but feel solid and well put together.  There&#x27;s no looseness with the handle, and everything moves smoothly with no unusual resistance or clicking.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the design is a bit more stylish than your average pair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head is definitely on the small side, but not unusually so, and allows for easy shaping of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the definite highlight is that these suckers are SHARP.  Many cheaper clippers will crush their way through the nails as much as cut them, but these cut nails like a knife through butter.  This gives you a much cleaner finish, and generally looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> True Story:&lt;br /&gt;You know how when you stick your fingers In your pocket your nail gets hung-up In the fabric,Oh Man does that hurt.&lt;br /&gt;And you didn&#x27;t know your nail was cracked and or broke?&lt;br /&gt;This shakes you to your nerves core like an exposed nerve In your tooth A very upsetting feeling,I know It happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;These took care of It nicely by cutting the shredded part off of the nail then filing It down A little relief.&lt;br /&gt;Most men don&#x27;t like clipping their fingernails including me especially the thumbs I hate that sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to worry using these for repair work or the cutting of the nails these make It so much more comfortable and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these and the seller EDQ Products run by John &amp; Company out of PA.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I discovered these,puts my two other nail clippers to shame.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to open package and very well-made and I like having the built-in file make this A winner.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I bought these clippers for my husband. He was thrilled with both the appearance and performance of these. A good pair of nail clippers is something often overlooked. Thanks for manufacturing these at such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> they are pretty good sharp and good leverage, a bit cheaper castings than I expected. but worth the cost over the cheap ones</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The stainless steel nail clips are very nice. I would recommend them as a good purchase.  I like the way the spring action is strong and smooth.  My husband has arthritis and they are perfect for him.  They give a good, smooth clean clip.  I also like that they have a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how sharp this clipper is.</li>
    <li> These fingernail clippers are a great gift or stocking stuffer for boys, men, and college students.  The handle makes them extremely easy to grip and use and they are very strong.  My son has very hard nails, and we struggle to find clippers that cut them without having the work hard.  These are it - they work on strong, thick nails and cut through them with ease.</li>
    <li> This Fingernail Clipper looking nice.  My husband use like it. Good use.  But when I use it for clipper for my nail dead skin it ok, but not come out complete. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They sturdy, durable and do a great jib!</li>
    <li> gREAT STURDY SET OF CLIPPERS</li>
    <li> this is a very well made product. however i bought it for 2 bucks it works grt and the feel is grt. but i think if you are buying for 14 bucks its not worth.</li>
    <li> Very sharp easy to use</li>
    <li> These are a bit industrial but good solid clippers. I purchased them for my self for my toe nails. They worked well. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a fan of was when moving them they almost gave a nails on the chalkboard sort of effect for me but that seemed to go away after using them a bit more. They are sturdy and look to be made well.</li>
    <li> Great strong clipper here. Not like the flimsy one&#x27;s we had. Need to check if they make a toenail clippers too.</li>
    <li> I thought what could be so great about a nail clippers. I was so used to buying just any clippers and not thinking much about it.  These clippers are very good quality.  You need to try them to know the difference.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect clippers for my husbands tough monster nails!</li>
    <li> I just received these clippers and used it right away. It&#x27;s very light weight and does the job right. It was very easy to clip my nails and didn&#x27;t have to struggle clipping my nails like when I use other clippers. Very good product and happy to have the opportunity to try them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many cutters I&#x27;ve tried over the years. This is the first nail cutter that gives me a clean cut every time. Use this nail cutter and you will never get a chip or ragged edge. If they make more products I would definitely give a &amp;#34;look-see&amp;#34;. I recommend this nail cutter to everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent Nail clipper!, the best I have.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy clippers!  Definitely worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Very sharp and works well.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers that I have ever used. They are very smooth and clip nicely.</li>
    <li> I was opening the clipper to trim my nails and it completely disassembled into 3 pieces. I was shocked in disbelief. After 15 minutes i managed somehow to reassemble it. Also got the 3.3&amp;#34; nail clippers and am very careful to open them as i don&#x27;t trust the integrity of the tools.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper you can have</li>
    <li> Have only used it a few times, but it has been all right.  Slightly more curved than other clippers I own, which makes it a bit more difficult to work with.</li>
    <li> Great nail clipper!! It&#x27;s made with quality stainless steel, you can just feel the quality when you hold it for the first time. It is sharp for cutting nails and bigger handle for men with big fingers.</li>
    <li> I love them! Best nail clippers I have ever owned! While nothing revolutionary here they seem to be out of a high quality metal and will hold up better than the cheap ones from walmart or the drug store!</li>
    <li> Great quality just wish the clipper part was not as thick.  It is hard to reach in the tight areas</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp, strong, and sleek. They have held up well!</li>
    <li> Very sharp clippers - cut cleanly and do not crush nails. Minimum effort required.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a pair that works very well for my kids and myself. Most are either cheaply made or too expensive. These were a good price and cut very nicely. They are not heavy but not light either, in between. I would definitely recommend these to my friends and family. Great product!</li>
    <li> High quality clippers for a great price.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better than the 1-3 dollar one at the store so why not!?</li>
    <li> Design flaw. Post hole diameter too large and upper blade tips into it when trying to close. Clippers work well. Will return.</li>
