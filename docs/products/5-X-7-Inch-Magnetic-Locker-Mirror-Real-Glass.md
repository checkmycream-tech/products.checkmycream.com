      <li>This mirror started out the school year fine.</li>
      <li>I suppose I can only provide my 2 cents, but it works great for me and my metal filing cabinets.  </li>
      <li>mirror seems to hold up well on my fridge with the magnet, it is real glass and has a nice border.</li>
      <li>it is not the cabinet, it is the cheap magnets on the mirror.</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be really cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Yep, I can look for spinach in my teeth before that important meeting at work now.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately for me, I didn&#x27;t need it to stick</li>
      <li>and just looked cheap to me</li>
      <li>These were cheap which is why I bought them.  </li>
      <li>So they made a cheap product and got me to buy it</li>

      <li>night I noticed my mirror wasn&#x27;t where it was sitting on my fridge originally</li>

      <li>Well, it certainly did, but when I got it, I emailed the seller and asked for a replacement with better padding.</li>

      <li>I have this mirror on my filing cabinet at work for quick checks.  </li>
      <li>Very glad I took the time to read reviews of similar products before buying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you plan on putting it up, using it and taking it down, great.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews about the magnet not being strong, but I&#x27;m gentle with my locker door and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
      <li>I tested the interior of the door with another magnet before I placed this order, and the magnet pulled strongly and held fast.</li>
      <li>This is really a great little mirror.  </li>
      <li>Great little mirror.  </li>
      <li>This company really went cheap on the magnet.  </li>

      <li>As such, this will be entirely suitable for our use.  </li>
      <li>The mirror itself is very good, but the magnet is ridiculously weak.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how strong the magnet is.</li>
      <li>The Mirror itself works fine, but the magnet on the back is barely enough to hold its own weight.</li>
      <li>It fell and broke within the first week of school.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a quility (and inexpensive) product!</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>The mirror is not distorted; it&#x27;s a great reflection, and its small and compact and the magnets work very well.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a decent mirror and the magnet is strong enough to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall off my filling cabinet when I open and close the drawers.</li>
      <li>It is quite large:  </li>
      <li>The mirror is clear, real glass and doesn&#x27;t distort, but it&#x27;s of no use as I intended which was to stick to my filing cabinet so I can take a quick glance before I go to a meeting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this mirror for camping because it was small and magnetic.  I didn&#x27;t expect much.  This is really a great little mirror.  Super sturdy with no bending or give between the frame and the glass.  For something so small and light, it is really nicely constructed.  The other nice thing is the magnet on the back.  It is quite large:  I would say about 2 inches thick by maybe 4 inches wide.  If you are looking for a small, quality mirror, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Magnet was almost dead. Would barely hold a paper clip let alone hold itself to anything. Returned for almost postage as much as paid for it (which I probably should have just ate).</li>
    <li> I really liked it and put it up at work. Someone else must have liked it too- it was stolen.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror.  I use this in my office and it&#x27;s the ideal size.</li>
    <li> Wow!  All I wanted was a small, inexpensive mirror to keep at my desk for, you know, strawberry seeds, whatever.  Not only is this a good size mirror, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about distortion due to the fact it is real glass, and the magnets - bonus!  I have had several people come by my desk and go, oh cool, I can check out my hair etc.  This mirror makes you more popular, that&#x27;s all I have to say! :)</li>
    <li> The mirrors are great for people who work in a cube in an office.  They adhere to the metal storage bins and come in handy.  I received the mirrors within days of ordering.  I plan to order more for Christmas gifts for co-workers.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my daughter to put in her locker. She likes that it&#x27;s plain black because it doesn&#x27;t clash with her other decorations. It is pretty basic, but it&#x27;s just what she wanted. It is reasonably well made and a good value for the money. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This locker mirror does what I want a locker mirror to do.  It sticks well to the inside of my door, doesn&#x27;t move or slip off, and gives me a clear view with enough room to see my face and if my hat is on straight.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> not good for a kids locker as it seemed dangerous with the exposed edge. and just looked cheap to me</li>
    <li> I had simple expectations...like the expectation that the mirror would actually stick to the metal door of my daughter&#x27;s locker as any magnet worth it&#x27;s sticking power should do.  This doesn&#x27;t stick well at all.  The magnet was so weak the mirror would slide down the locker door repeatedly.  And to make matters worse you couldn&#x27;t shut the locker door as you normally would or it would literally fall off from the jarring action.  No one slowly and carefully shuts their locker door by lifting the mechanism and gently sliding the door closed as if something may fall of if they aren&#x27;t careful.  O brother.  And I have twin girls so I bought two mirrors.  They BOTH were lousy so you can&#x27;t say I just happened to get a bad one.  I bought 2 and they were both worthless.  These were cheap which is why I bought them.  Well, suppose I got what I paid for.  The manufacturer skimped on the magnet obviously.  So they made a cheap product and got me to buy it (all the time probably knowing how worthless it was.)</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror! I got it for my daughter for her locker and she loves it. The only thing is that the magnets on the back fell off after a year or so and we had to replace them, otherwise it was a great product.</li>
    <li> I have this in my locker at work and it is just the right size. The magnet could be a little stronger but it will do.</li>
    <li> Very glad I took the time to read reviews of similar products before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy a locker mirror with a plastic reflective part; so many people who do are disappointed because the surface scratches easily, and the reflection is murky or distorted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror&#x27;s element is glass, so the reflection is crystal clear. The magnet is plenty big enough and strong enough to make it hard to dislodge. My daughter has this mirror in her locker at school, and thinks it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Unlike other locker mirrors, this one is a REAL mirror... it doesn&#x27;t distort your face when you look at it. And although it&#x27;s not made of plastic, I think it&#x27;s secured with a nice frame and good magnets to prevent it from falling and breaking. I&#x27;m absolutely happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just right in price, size and mirror quality, but the magnet is too weak to hold the mirror to the metal interior of my locker. I tested the interior of the door with another magnet before I placed this order, and the magnet pulled strongly and held fast. This mirror&#x27;s magnet won&#x27;t hold at all. Pretty disappointed that I have to hack the mirror to get it to stick, because it&#x27;s not worth returning at this price.</li>
    <li> i ordered it and i got a garlic crusher and never go the mirror. total waste of money dont buy this.</li>
    <li> Magnets work well, I use it at work.  Very pleased with it&#x27;s stability, never have to worry about it falling off the metal cabinet it&#x27;s placed on.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much what I expected when I ordered it. The glass is clear and flat (no warbly distortion). The frame is very simple; but, everything fits. The only downside is that the magnet on the back of the mirror is pretty weak. Still...I&#x27;d call it a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> The magnet on this mirror is weak. If your going to place it on a metal surface like a tool box it might work better for you. I wanted it on the door of my locker and evertime I closed the door,the mirror fell off. I finally had to use velcro to keep it on.</li>
    <li> It broke before i really got the chance to use it. But it seemed Like it would ideal for a cubicle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and is perfect for my needs, but as far as price, it is a little high for the size of the mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror came cracked in three places.  I was going to send it back but not enough time in the day to follow the process.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what i was looking for.Exellent condition, reasinable price, delivery on time as was mention.I would recommended to anyone who needs similary supplies</li>
    <li> It is convenient to stick it somewhere you like. The black color really suits my desk! Satisfied with this mirror!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for me. Price is reasonable, and the size of it is perfect for my use in the bedroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. It is a cheap reflective surface. The magnet is weak but strong enough to attach to a refrigerator and it came with a few scuffs but they are not so bad that I would return it. Overall I would say I got what I paid for, a cheap reflective surface.</li>
    <li> This magnet is not strong enough to hold the mirror up. I work in a cubicle and attached this to a stationary metal surface and it would not stay up. If you want your mirror to stay in place then don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
    <li> It appears that the adhesive used just wasn&#x27;t up to snuff because it didn&#x27;t stick at all.  Fortunately for me, I didn&#x27;t need it to stick so it still works fine for my purposes.</li>
    <li> A magnetic mirror&#x27;s prime functions are to give an accurate reflection and to stick securely to metal.  This thing fails at both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnet is weak.  It barely has enough force to hold the mirror in place on a smooth metal surface.  If you jar or bump the mirror even a little bit, it will slide or fall.  Don&#x27;t even try to stick it to metal that has any kind of texture.  It just slides down the front of my refrigerator door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could fix the weak magnet problem by gluing on more/stronger magnets.  But, even then, my mirror fails in it&#x27;s other main function:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reflection is distorted.  My mirror has a line of distortion that runs through nearly the middle of the reflective surface.  The surface of the glass feels smooth, but some defect inside or under the glass causes a line of distortion. Other reviewers seemed to be satisfied with the reflections in their mirrors, though, so I maybe my issue is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, I&#x27;m still going to keep this thing.  I&#x27;ve fixed the weak magnet issue and decided the distortion will not be enough of a detraction based on how I plan to use it.  It was also too cheap to bother with a return.</li>
    <li> this is awesome if i need to fix my hair on the way to class or something its great !!!!!</li>
    <li> Kids enjoyed it. Kids used it for school in there locker. So not to sure how it worked for them</li>
    <li> I have this mirror on the inside my locker door in my cubicle at work.  Its perfect for checking my hair and make-up before I meet with a client.  I like that it is a real mirror and not a piece of plastic that gives off a warpped image.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent mirror and the magnet is strong enough to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall off my filling cabinet when I open and close the drawers.</li>
    <li> The magnet that is glued to the back of the mirror doesn&#x27;t hold. I put this thing on a metal cupboard door above my desk at work and left for the day. When I came back the magnet was still on the door, but the mirror came off, fell on my desk, and broke.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for - reasonable price, but the magnet is very weak - will not stay attached to metal cabinet. Would not trust on locker - would fall and break with vibrations from door(s) shutting.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised; however, the magnets are just stapled on to the plastic casing.  This caused the magnets not to hold very well.  I unstapled the magnets and then used a strong adhesive to glue the magnets to the plastic.  It holds up nicely now.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> It reflects back my image and sticks to my locker at work, as promised. I highly recommend it for others in need of a magnetic mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a teen girl&#x27; s locker.  Good quality, no distortion, and great magnets.  Would definitely recommend.  My teenager put it on the refrigerator door for a while, and it was good inspiration.  Will order another.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. I was surprised how strong the magnet is. Its stays on the fridge very securely.</li>
    <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;1/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;Last night I noticed my mirror wasn&#x27;t where it was sitting on my fridge originally and my husband said he didnt move it so I put it back. This morning it had slid down again and he noticed that the magnet piece was no longer attached to the magnet. There is a thinner magnet which had some sticky substance between that and the bigger magnet. It is no longer sticking to my fridge. I don&#x27;t think I had this thing 2 weeks yet and there already is a problem. Thankfully it didnt fall all the way down, if I wasn&#x27;t for my chip clip holder container sitting further down on my fridge (that saved it), this thing would have fell on the floor and broke!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror seems to hold up well on my fridge with the magnet, it is real glass and has a nice border. My only complaint was although it came packaged in its original plastic, the item was extremely dirty, dusty and fogged.</li>
    <li> Loved the size of this mirror and it worked well in my daughter&#x27;s locker at school. More durable than most that you buy, and it doesn&#x27;t have film on the mirror after peeling off protective sheet. My daughter also liked the frame.</li>
    <li> I use the mirror in an office...good size...no problems with it staying attached to metal cabinet...simple and useful...no complaints with product.</li>
    <li> I have this mirror on my filing cabinet at work for quick checks.  It works well and stays put.  What else can you ask for in a mirror.</li>
    <li> I was concerned ordering this product online. I thought it was going to be really cheaply made. It was not. Thanks for a quility (and inexpensive) product!</li>
    <li> This is not a magnetic mirror.  It does not hold to metal AT ALL...just falls to the floor.  The mirror is clear, real glass and doesn&#x27;t distort, but it&#x27;s of no use as I intended which was to stick to my filing cabinet so I can take a quick glance before I go to a meeting. The \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot; strip is really just a piece of plastic glued onto another piece of plastic.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is very good, but the magnet is ridiculously weak. Every time I close my locker, the mirror falls off. If you glue this to the wall it will make a nice mirror. If you want this to stick magnetically, I would NOT buy this product. I gave this mirror only one star because I bought this to be mounted magnetically, and I can&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I hung this above my desk so that I could see people enter my office door behind me (when I cannot hear with headphones in) and although it suits the purpose and is a good size for my use, it fell once when I opened it and immediately cracked. I still use it but a better quality mirror would certainly last longer.</li>
    <li> The magnet is sufficiently strong to hold the mirror to my locker, but the powder-coated finish leaves it prone to sliding when opening and closing the door, a small piece of tape on the back resolved this. Overall, the mirror is well constructed and gives a clean reflection.</li>
    <li> I expected a standard locker mirror, and that&#x27;s what I got.  It&#x27;s decent quality and was intact when it arrived.  No complaints here!</li>
    <li> After taking it out of the package and putting it on the refrigerator, I can understand why so many people are upset about this product.  Since it is being advertised as a Magnetic LOCKER Mirror and knowing the magnet is as weak as it is, it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to what it could/should be.  As soon as a locker door would be shut, this mirror is likely to slide down, if not fall off.  Open the locker and SURPRISE! CRASH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we have no intention of using it in a locker but inside of our pop up camper.  As such, this will be entirely suitable for our use.  Also, the fact that this has real glass is great for us.  But for those who want to use it for its intended use.  Don&#x27;t bother, you&#x27;ll earn yourself 7 years bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;d recommend this mirror with reservations.  If you plan on putting it up, using it and taking it down, great.  If you plan on putting this up and leaving it there while swinging a locker door shut, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
    <li> The mirror fell off the magnet after a couple or days and the mirror slid out. Cheap design. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Magnet was not strong enough to hold the mirror to my daughters locker.  It fell and broke within the first week of school.</li>
    <li> Nice glass, clear mirror image, plastic covered edges. Magnet only strong enough to stick to fridge walls, it will not hang on metal pipe, for example, but for frigde I bought it, and it hangs well  ... Good value for the money ...</li>
    <li> This mirror started out the school year fine. It fit perfectly in my daughter&#x27;s locker. But after a few falls off the door, the glass cracked. Then after a few more, so did the plastic border. The edges were very sharp and I&#x27;m glad no one cut themselves. This mirror needs to go somewhere that won&#x27;t be slammed shut so it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> The mirror is not distorted; it&#x27;s a great reflection, and its small and compact and the magnets work very well.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the magnet not being strong, but I&#x27;m gentle with my locker door and thought I&#x27;d give it a go. The magnet IS very weak, and the mirror would come off if the door was slammed. So I figured I&#x27;d get double-sided tape or velcro to support it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I left it on my locker door for the weekend, and when I came in on Monday, the mirror was broken at the bottom of the locker. The magnet had held, but the adhesive holding the magnet to the mirror had \\&quot;let go.\\&quot;  Grrr...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it to me to return the stupid thing, but I&#x27;m unhappy, and will go unkempt without a mirror until I come across something that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> The Mirror itself works fine, but the magnet on the back is barely enough to hold its own weight. Any vibration causes it to slip down. I have 4 more magnetic items on the cabinet where I keep the mirror and they all hold fast, so it is not the cabinet, it is the cheap magnets on the mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the seller \\&quot;LAPOLO\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all. The mirror came in a very thin bubble-wrap package, and when I opened the package the mirror was completely shattered. It didn&#x27;t even come with a packing slip/invoice! I bought this product to use it for my school locker, so I ordered it early so it would get here before school started. Well, it certainly did, but when I got it, I emailed the seller and asked for a replacement with better padding. They never replied. I want this mirror because it has a simple border and will match my wallpaper and it won&#x27;t distort my face like plastic mirrors would. I didn&#x27;t buy this to have to beg for a replacement! Do not buy from the seller \\&quot;LAPOLO\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my locker at the gym.  It will not stay up on the steel door to my locker.  The magnet strip attached to the back of the magnet is very weak.  This company really went cheap on the magnet.  I would not recommend buying this product.  Try another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is also something I bought after my son moved into the dorms.  easy to hang, very useful, Exactly what he needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good locker mirror for the money.  Not sure why people are complaining about the magnet.  Mine hasn&#x27;t slipped at all, and I open/close the door it&#x27;s attached to all the time.</li>
    <li> This was sent to Djibouti, Africa for my boyfriend to put in his wall locker.  Excellent gift for anyone deployed.  Thank you</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this in her locker at school and loves it! It does have real glass which makes cleaning the mirror much easier.</li>
    <li> Yep, I can look for spinach in my teeth before that important meeting at work now.  It does it&#x27;s job just perfectly and the magnet holds it tightly onto my metal cabinet in my cubicle.  Hey, it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just saw some of the reviews and see that not everyone had the same experience as I did.  I suppose I can only provide my 2 cents, but it works great for me and my metal filing cabinets.  The mirror is real and does not distort.  I use it all the time and even other co-workers will come into my cube to use it.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror for the gym it adheres well to my gym locker.  Better than the others that I have tried</li>
    <li> Mirror itself is great and I like the size. I bought this for my cube at work for quick checks. Problem is the magnet is extremely weak and doesn&#x27;t stick on any of the magnetic surfaces in my cube. I guess I&#x27;ll just stick in on with adhesive.</li>
    <li> I needed a small mirror so that I can cut my hair in the tub.  This glass is very clear.  As one reviewer stated, the magnets in the back are stapled to the mirror making it seem like it won&#x27;t hold very well in the long run but I don&#x27;t know since I just bought it.  I got it for 2 dollars, 97 cents + 3 dollars 21 cents for shipping; so I might as well buy 2 mirrors then.</li>
    <li> The product arruved on tune in excellent condition. It met my especations, and works in he way I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It us istalled in my gymn locker.</li>
    <li> Works well. I have it on the overhead bin at work and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It was received quickly.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for any magnetic surface .. It is Also just the right size for your locker at school or at work. Mirror is not wavy, it is very clear</li>
    <li> Good size mirror but, as others have said, the magnet is just not strong enough.  It keeps sliding down the door.  I had to put little silicone pads at the bottom edge to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple and reasonably priced magnetic mirror to attach to the metal file cabinet in my cubicle. This is simple and does the trick, the magnet is strong and doesn&#x27;t slip or slide down and the mirror is clear, not &amp;#34;foggy&amp;#34; like some cheaper mirrors can be.</li>
