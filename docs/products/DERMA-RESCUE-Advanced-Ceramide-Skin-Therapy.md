      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>I have used everything under the sun and the results are temporary at best.</li>
      <li>Recommended by a nurse and has truly been great.  </li>
      <li>This over the counter product was a great improvement.  </li>
      <li>works on my hands and face great,, used lots of products prescription and OTC</li>
      <li>Derma Rescue is THE BEST over the counter moisturizer and better than any prescribed lotion I have ever used.</li>
      <li>As a guy that works a lot with my hands, my skin has never looked or felt this good</li>
      <li>this is as good as any prescription I ever got..</li>
      <li>Works wonderful, well worth the money</li>
      <li>I continued to use it through the winter and my cuticles have never looked better!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>but because I would rub the rest of the product into my hands and face, that skin on both has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I have been a faithful customer for this product for a couple of months now and can say I have seen amazing results in my psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of DERMA RESCUE!</li>
      <li>It takes time for Derma Rescue to soften the plaques in psoriasis to be able to reach the deeper areas that psoriasis attacks.</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff....</li>
      <li>My hand was sore, itchy, with cracking skin and on top of it all was a wart-like lump.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I have sent my husband to many doctors and nothing ever worked until this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is the best for treating dry or chapped skin, burns or itching rash.</li>
      <li>$50 aint cheap,, but if you use it sparingly it pays off.</li>
      <li>and I dont say this lightly &amp;</li>
      <li>While helping her apply it, I realized how effective it was for my own dry skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>I was extremely lucky and grateful to be a part of Derma Rescue&#x27;s clinical trial in 2014.</li>
      <li>If anyone from the company is reading these reviews, it would be nice to have a larger tube or bottle.</li>
      <li>truly worth the money.</li>
      <li>Two weeks worth.  </li>
      <li>Not only did she love the feel of it and the way it easily absorbed into the skin - it also worked!</li>
      <li>After the first couple of applications my skin looked irritated because it was pushing out the poisons</li>
      <li>Well the packets came first and the tube came after that.</li>
      <li>It did remove some of the scaling, but for $50 it didn&#x27;t do much!</li>
      <li>I  know and say it work fast!</li>
      <li>The treated areas can never &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; since they&#x27;re covered in shoes (and often socks or pantyhose) and literally walked on every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to look at the physical proof of my success with Derma Rescue by checking out my before-and-after photos on Kinderma&#x27;s website in their Before &amp; After Gallery.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this was good for my psoriasis</li>
      <li>I have seen it work on many problems from rash, dry skin, poison ivy to skin bumps because I shared my samples with people</li>
      <li>I am very much looking forward to trying the new and improved version!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Very misleading picture.  </li>
      <li>It really did not help.  </li>
      <li>They really care about their customers.</li>
      <li>I saw this product on The Drs, Show ordered it, and am so glad I finally found my son his hands back.  </li>
      <li>but there so many different kinds definitely was for my mother inlaws...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a versatile product that it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>For those thinking about buying this but are on the fence, let me say this; For the first few weeks it seemed as if Derma Rescue was just a very powerful moisturizer that did make quite a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Both during the trial and recently when I restarted it, I was nearly finished with the tube before any positive effects were evident.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It says, however, that it really improves the general skin&lt;</li>
      <li>This will be my third tube purchased but the first tube purchased on AMAZON.</li>
      <li>I heard about this brand from a friend and originally purchased it for my ten year old daughter who has eczema last Fall.</li>
      <li>Some of the products that I purchased in the past were very costly and others relatively cheap</li>
      <li>For me it took 6 months for me to completely clear</li>
      <li>I now had to start all over, when my symptoms completely returned.</li>
      <li>Years ago I was introduced to a sister product - Hand Kind Scrub - and I have been addicted ever since.</li>
      <li>That said, by the 2nd and later tubes, it absolutely does the trick—significantly reducing and/or eliminating the itching, scaling, peeling, and even some of the cuts.</li>
      <li>No other cream has given me the results and satisfaction.</li>
      <li>several applications a day) and his hands are clear.  </li>
      <li>only reason I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 is that for me (but not for others, apparently), it takes quite a while before it starts to work.</li>
      <li>I was a slight doubter in the beginning but after doing as they said and give it a chance to do its thing I am an absolute fan of Derma Rescue.</li>
      <li>I got a long response back that was extremely informative that I would really begin to notice a difference after 4-5 weeks of use.</li>
      <li>and now I stay clear with minimal application.</li>

<li> This has been the only product that has outperformed all other products that she has tried from including prescription creams.</li>

<li> I figured I would give it a try because during this time of year my hands become dry and cracked.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve started applying it to my dry, cracked heels.</li>
<li> I suffer from severe dry skin and had noticed a wart-like lump on my thumb.  </li>
<li> My skin was dry and cracked and itched all the time.  </li>
<li> I have since used this product daily for approximately 3 weeks straight</li>
<li> The only down side is that if she runs out of DERMA RESCUE, her eczema will start to reappear after a couple of weeks.</li>

<li> While on their website a few months back, I learned about this product - Derma Rescue.</li>
<li> I have spent thousands of dollars on prescription medications and over the counter skin care products.</li>
<li> I see in the other reviews that someone mentioned that the product comes in packets and not a tube.</li>
<li> Only one of the many branded prescription injectables had worked and it was unfortunately taken off the market (due to extremely dangerous side effects).</li>
<li> I had serious skin issues from working outside all day, every day.  </li>
<li> He had been to 2 Drs &amp; 4 Dermatologist only to get Steroid Creams and shots, which are not good for you and very little results.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> You just need to give it time and you will be pretty shocked.</li>
<li> and my skin is no longer cracking and said lump is faint, barely noticeable and the soreness has disappeared.  </li>
<li> Not no better than ordinary hand lotion.</li>
<li> A member of my family who has had eczema for the past five years on her arms purchased DERMA RESCUE.</li>
<li> The only relief I ever had previously was from painful self-injections into my abdomen.</li>
<li> Your skin is an organ and psoriasis effects the deeper layer of the skin and skin cells take at least 21 days to renew.</li>
<li> and it has helped heal the painful splits I get on the tips of my fingers (no more super-gluing my skin back together!).</li>
<li> Seriously, try it.</li>
<li> It is expensive (for me), and there&#x27;s no insurance coverage for it—don&#x27;t make the mistake I made of stopping its use.</li>
<li> So inconvenient that I have not put it on consecutively to see if it works.  </li>
<li> (I had some psoriasis plaques in some inconvenient places).</li>
<li> my elbows where getting so cracked that it was painful.  </li>
<li> Really disappointed!</li>
<li> The product was and is my miracle solution for the horrible psoriasis I have on both feet.</li>
<li> I broke out terribly from this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using DERMA Rescue for 4 months now and I can tell you that this stuff WORKS! For those thinking about buying this but are on the fence, let me say this; For the first few weeks it seemed as if Derma Rescue was just a very powerful moisturizer that did make quite a difference in my skin. But miraculous, not yet. I sent an email inquiring as to when I would start seeing these big changes in my skin condition (I had some psoriasis plaques in some inconvenient places). I got a long response back that was extremely informative that I would really begin to notice a difference after 4-5 weeks of use. At about the 5 week mark it was like someone flipped a switch and I could notice almost day by day the reduction of my plaques! Awesome! Not only that, but because I would rub the rest of the product into my hands and face, that skin on both has never looked better! I was a slight doubter in the beginning but after doing as they said and give it a chance to do its thing I am an absolute fan of Derma Rescue. Seriously, try it. You just need to give it time and you will be pretty shocked. As a guy that works a lot with my hands, my skin has never looked or felt this good and they have me as a faithful follower!  I see in the other reviews that someone mentioned that the product comes in packets and not a tube. Well, my girlfriend saw a deal here on Amazon for a supply of travel packs PLUS a tube for the same price! Well the packets came first and the tube came after that. It&#x27;s definitely a tube of product. I think that was some sort of promotion. If anyone from the company is reading these reviews, it would be nice to have a larger tube or bottle. Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful customer for this product for a couple of months now and can say I have seen amazing results in my psoriasis. After the first couple of applications my skin looked irritated because it was pushing out the poisons but as time went on the dryness, cracking and itching subsided. This product is the ONLY cream that has helped ease my pain and improve my skin. No other cream has given me the results and satisfaction. I have thrown out all creams and only use Derma Rescue!</li>
    <li> This product was a lifesaver.  I ordered for my son who has suffered with rough plaque building up/split finger tips on his fingers and hands for years.  He used Derma Rescue for 1 months (several applications a day) and his hands are clear.  He had been to 2 Drs &amp; 4 Dermatologist only to get Steroid Creams and shots, which are not good for you and very little results.  I saw this product on The Drs, Show ordered it, and am so glad I finally found my son his hands back.  I will continue to order it for him.  I did speak with Kinderma and they are the best.  I have worked in Customer Service for 20 years and I dont say this lightly &amp;#34;They are the Best&amp;#34;!  They really care about their customers.</li>
    <li> The product arrived with a disclaimer that it does not purport&lt;br /&gt;to cure any condition and I would agree with that.  It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It says, however, that it really improves the general skin&lt;br /&gt;condition and I can see no evidence of that.  I will not&lt;br /&gt;be orering again.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, I have sever psoriasis. I broke out terribly from this product.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe dry skin and had noticed a wart-like lump on my thumb.  Derma Rescue was introduced to me by the friend and I can only say thank you!  My hand was sore, itchy, with cracking skin and on top of it all was a wart-like lump.  I have since used this product daily for approximately 3 weeks straight and my skin is no longer cracking and said lump is faint, barely noticeable and the soreness has disappeared.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Derma Rescue is THE BEST over the counter moisturizer and better than any prescribed lotion I have ever used. It is the best for treating dry or chapped skin, burns or itching rash. I have seen it work on many problems from rash, dry skin, poison ivy to skin bumps because I shared my samples with people I  know and say it work fast! I use Derma Rescue because I have psoriasis. For those who have a skin condition like eczema or psoriasis you need to give Derma Rescue a chance to work. Your skin is an organ and psoriasis effects the deeper layer of the skin and skin cells take at least 21 days to renew. It takes time for Derma Rescue to soften the plaques in psoriasis to be able to reach the deeper areas that psoriasis attacks. You need to give it at least 3 weeks - I guarantee you will start to see positive changes. For me it took 6 months for me to completely clear and now I stay clear with minimal application. Psoriasis is multi pronged so what you eat also effects your condition - staying away from alcohol, night shades and sugar also helps to improve your results Derma Rescue changed my life - let it change yours!</li>
    <li> Years ago I was introduced to a sister product - Hand Kind Scrub - and I have been addicted ever since. While on their website a few months back, I learned about this product - Derma Rescue. I figured I would give it a try because during this time of year my hands become dry and cracked. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I apply the lotion/cream twice a day and it has helped heal the painful splits I get on the tips of my fingers (no more super-gluing my skin back together!). It&#x27;s worked so well on my hands I&#x27;ve started applying it to my dry, cracked heels. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on healing the damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I had serious skin issues from working outside all day, every day.  My skin was dry and cracked and itched all the time.  Sometimes my hands would even bleed.  I thought I was going to have to give up my job.  But this product changed my life.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of DERMA RESCUE! I heard about this brand from a friend and originally purchased it for my ten year old daughter who has eczema last Fall. Not only did she love the feel of it and the way it easily absorbed into the skin - it also worked! While helping her apply it, I realized how effective it was for my own dry skin. I continued to use it through the winter and my cuticles have never looked better! My older daughter uses it on her back and face to prevent breakouts and now it&#x27;s hard for me to keep a tube to myself! I typically buy multiple tubes at a time. I have also recommended this product to friends who have come into contact with Poison Ivy or burned themselves topically. It&#x27;s such a versatile product that it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> my elbows where getting so cracked that it was painful.  Recommended by a nurse and has truly been great.  My mother has started using it on her psoriases and it has helped her too.  I have already bought a second tube.  truly worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not no better than ordinary hand lotion.Waste of money. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> I was extremely lucky and grateful to be a part of Derma Rescue&#x27;s clinical trial in 2014. The product was and is my miracle solution for the horrible psoriasis I have on both feet. The only relief I ever had previously was from painful self-injections into my abdomen. Only one of the many branded prescription injectables had worked and it was unfortunately taken off the market (due to extremely dangerous side effects). Before Derma Rescue, NO topical product had ever worked for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 is that for me (but not for others, apparently), it takes quite a while before it starts to work. Both during the trial and recently when I restarted it, I was nearly finished with the tube before any positive effects were evident. If I could rate it a 4.7, I would have! That said, by the 2nd and later tubes, it absolutely does the trick—significantly reducing and/or eliminating the itching, scaling, peeling, and even some of the cuts. In my case, however, the redness improves, but never disappears. It is expensive (for me), and there&#x27;s no insurance coverage for it—don&#x27;t make the mistake I made of stopping its use. I now had to start all over, when my symptoms completely returned. It is possible that my results take a little longer because of the location of my condition. My psoriasis is on the soles of my feet and they are aggravated constantly. The treated areas can never &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; since they&#x27;re covered in shoes (and often socks or pantyhose) and literally walked on every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to look at the physical proof of my success with Derma Rescue by checking out my before-and-after photos on Kinderma&#x27;s website in their Before &amp; After Gallery. I took those pictures and they tell the story. I am very much looking forward to trying the new and improved version!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this was good for my psoriasis but there so many different kinds definitely was for my mother inlaws...</li>
    <li> Very misleading picture.  Comes in packets that you open and must use at that time.  So inconvenient that I have not put it on consecutively to see if it works.  Total joke.  Maybe 20 packets.  Two weeks worth.  Total ripe off.</li>
    <li> Consistency is the key! And patience!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, well worth the money</li>
    <li> Have only used it for 2 weeks and already see a big difference in the psoriasis on my legs. Product was recommended on the doctors TV show.I have used everything under the sun and the results are temporary at best. This seems like it&#x27;s actually healing the skin from the inside out. I wish  I had taken before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> works on my hands and face great,, used lots of products prescription and OTC this is as good as any prescription I ever got.. $50 aint cheap,, but if you use it sparingly it pays off.</li>
    <li> This over the counter product was a great improvement.  Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.... because it WORKS!</li>
    <li> A member of my family who has had eczema for the past five years on her arms purchased DERMA RESCUE. This has been the only product that has outperformed all other products that she has tried from including prescription creams. The only down side is that if she runs out of DERMA RESCUE, her eczema will start to reappear after a couple of weeks. Once she starts to reapply DERMA RESCUE, her eczema subsides, the redness and itching goes away. I have started using it on my face when I get razor bumps after I shave and I am amazed at the results. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It did remove some of the scaling, but for $50 it didn&#x27;t do much!</li>
    <li> I saw Derma Rescue featured on the Doctors Show in November, Since then, I have purchased two tubes of Derma Rescue. I have spent thousands of dollars on prescription medications and over the counter skin care products. Some of the products that I purchased in the past were very costly and others relatively cheap but nothing compares to how Derma Rescue has helped me with my skin problems.This will be my third tube purchased but the first tube purchased on AMAZON. I just compared and found that AMAZONs&#x27; shipping is inexpensive. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff. It works. I have sent my husband to many doctors and nothing ever worked until this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for psoriasis. It really did not help.  Really disappointed!</li>
