<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> BEST PRICE FOR THIS FANTASTIC LEAVE-IN PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My hair was recently bleached from a dark red to blonde with highlights and my hair is damaged, brittle and dry. BUT after using this my hair feels NEW again! After blow drying it feels SO SO SO SOFT!! I would recommend this product to anyone no matter what hair type. I noticed less breakage after only the first use and this is my very first time ever using this.</li>
    <li> I literally have been using this product for ten years. I have done a ton of color and bleach processing to my hair and every hairdresser I have ever had has commented on the wonder it is that my hair doesn&#x27;t display more damage, when I run out, I order more instantly. It makes my hair strong, shiny, more manageable, and tangle free, which is am accomplishment, my hair is down to my waist. It&#x27;s also totally non greasy. I use it root to tip and multiple times between washes. If anything it makes it looks fresh longer. Added bonus, it smells subtle but amazing. I would never go without it!</li>
    <li> My hair is about to my belt line...and this stuff helps to keep it that way! The hair is pretty fine, and yes, &amp;#34;processed&amp;#34; with color ( for the grays!), so it tends to break pretty easily. I can definitely say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with less breakage...thankfully!</li>
    <li> A very good product for helping dry and damaged hair. I have used it a long time and love it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My hair looks shiny and tame. It is worth every penny</li>
    <li> this is a great hair product, and i was surprised to see that you carried the product. Great job amazon. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> *I purchase from a beauty supply storefront locally*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always trying new hair products. Some are amazing (ie, Nexxus Emergencee, Coconut Oil, Paul Mitchel Moisture lines, Sebastian, Tressemme, etc), while others are epic fails (read my WEN review). Well, I LOVE LOVE LOVVVVVVVVVE this Redken Anti Snap product! I&#x27;ve used it for several years and would have an attack if Redken ever discontinued it. lol It&#x27;s a MUST-HAVE product if you bleached/highlighted/and, or, frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after every shampoo/conditioner use.&lt;br /&gt;I apply Extreme Anti Snap to my towel dried hair and comb through. Follow with a tiny (tiny!!) dab of coconut oil and comb through. Then, I spritz with Tressemme&#x27;s heat protectant spray and I blow dry. I ALWAYS end up with perfectly blow dried STRAIGHT hair that looks and feels healthy and shiny and thick/full/lush, even after a full head highlight service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often rotate my shampoos and conditioners (from high-end salon products, to less expensive drug store brands), but I ALWAYS ALWAYS use Redken Anti Snap!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to try Anti Snap+ coconut oil after using my Wen Almond Mint conditioning cleanser and Wen 6 Thirteen Conditioner, in hopes that Anti Snap can make the Wen salvageable. If Redken Anti-Snap can&#x27;t help me make Wen work, then NOTHING can. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the Redken \\&quot;strengthening plus\\&quot; treatment. Will be posting a review as soon as I use it. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s as fabulous a product as the Anti Snap.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Loved it. Hair is so much more healthy.</li>
    <li> I didnt seem to work better then organex products but I think I thought because of the price it has to be better but its really not. I like the smell kinda smells like fruity Peebles!</li>
    <li> I am a relaxed. I use this weekly to strengthen my hair. I love this product. I use it on wash day.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that breaks easily then this is for you.  I wish I found this product years ago.  I&#x27;ve had to cut my hair short to rid myself of previous damage but now with this my hair is growing back beautifully.</li>
    <li> i like redken&#x27;s all-soft heavy cream conditioner so i thought getting a leave-in product from the same line would give equal results but was sadly mistaken. all this product does is make my dry hair look wet, like crunchy, out-of-the-shower, towel dried hair....why do i want this look from the 80&#x27;s? it hasn&#x27;t improved my hair at all and the smell is awful. maybe my nose is sensitive but it smelled like a mild perm solution when i first started using it. i guess i&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell since then and it now just smells like a mildly rancid lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldn&#x27;t even mind it if it didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking wet all day, but that&#x27;s the last thing i was looking for in a product like this.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling like silk!</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and packed well.&lt;br /&gt;Product does a great job and will last a long tome.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair easy to manage and feel stronger.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews,  I thought this product would be a miracle worker!  I have used this for about two weeks now and have not seen any major results or drastic improvements to my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is great as usual, but the MAIN thing is that it was actually wrapped properly to prevent it leaking in transit. So few do that.</li>
    <li> Redken Extreme Anti-snap leave-in treatment is simply amazing. If there is another product that works like this, PLEASE comment or email me and tell me it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts about it when I was buying it, but this stuff works so well. I have way less breakage and now having used this for a long time I have way less split ends as well. I notice my hair seems to have much more elasticity. MY HAIR FELT LIKE STRAW before this product. Now it feels like silk. Even after the first use it stopped feeling like straw, and I know that it didn&#x27;t fix my problem after the first use, but it made my hair feel great and look much healthier, which made me feel a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use two pumps of this through my hair and I put it on when my hair is still damp but not soaking wet. The smell is nice, i actually love the smell.</li>
    <li> Helped my hair with breakage so&lt;br /&gt;Much!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is so much healthier thanks to anti-snap :)</li>
    <li> bought this for minor dandruff that I have, this works really well and leaves my scalp and hair smelling great.  Way cheaper here than at Great Clips which is where I first learned of it.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a fine mist but it is not. It didn&#x27;t work for my hair but works great on my daughters so that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars. Good product, but might not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny, smooth and smells great.  My hair was really damaged and using this product has helped a lot.</li>
    <li> excellent product!!! even for baby fine hair such as myself!! doesn&#x27;t leave hair Oily. Reccomended for all hair types wow!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for restoring my hair it takes about a week to notice the difference in the volume of my hair and it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy anymore. Although, I didn&#x27;t get must results when I used heat toward my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife is using it for a while now and the hair still breaks just as much as it did before. She does not recommend it. The only thing she likes about it is that it makes her hair feel a bit softer.</li>
    <li> As expected. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Really cuts down on the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this stuff yet...I just started using it so I can&#x27;t really tell you but I haven&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference.  My hair I think brushes easier after I use it which I think prevents the breaking.  I say it&#x27;s worth a shot if you are looking to protect against breakage!</li>
    <li> I feel this product gives strength to my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> this is the best leave in conditioner a must if you have long hair  or use chemicals on your hair</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Love the product</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair look and feel especially since it is colored and naturally curly (subject to being drier than normal) I will always keep it handy:-)</li>
    <li> This product is the very best light-weight leave in conditioner I have ever tried....I have been using it for many years and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent leave in product that coats your hair to provide excellent healing and protection against heat damage due to flat irons and blow dryers. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am African American and struggled with  breakage&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great but didn&#x27;t help my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this along with a few other redken products but was not pleased. This really did nothing for my hair and I used it only a few times.  It was useless for split ends and I really felt as though it did nothing it claimed to.  I switched over to another product was far happier and saw much greater results.  I now use the Kerastase for a deep conditioner once a week, Nutrisse for a reg conditioner and use Silk Elements Megasilk as a heat protectant.  Have seen a HUGE improvement.  The Kerastase is definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It really helps untame hair if you color it and use blow dryers/hot irons. It also gives you some lift after a shampoo which I like. Otherwise my hair is a bit flat. So glad I tried this years ago because it is still a must in my household!</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I was trying to grow my hair out. When my hair starts getting long it starts getting dull and split at the end. This product put a stop to that. My hair is stronger and I have less breakage and stray strands falling out. Love it!</li>
    <li> Holy smoke! This stuff does NOT leave any kind of sticky residue and works like a charm on the tangled hair of my three elementary school daughters.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely watered down, I have to use about 5 pumps of it just to feel any product is in my hair. Also I don&#x27;t see any less breakage in my hair. I could find a better product for way less. For reference I have medium length fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is passed dryed out! First time I used it my hair felt and looked amazing. Great product. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I didnt see any difference when using this product &#x3D;( i could get netter results from a drug store brand.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> It did not stop the breakage of my hair. I am a black woman with relaxed hair. However Apagee has helped with the breakage. I put it on my hair and put a plastic cap on and sat under the dryer for 20 min. then rinsed.</li>
    <li> This product is so good I mean good my daughter works at hair  salon and they can&#x27;t keep enough on the shelf I ordered from Amazon so I don&#x27;t run out as hers is back ordered,,</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning this product help bring it back. Highly suggest this product for damage hair or falling hair</li>
    <li> I can only guess I got a knock-off version - this stuff has zero effect on my hair and left my hair crunchy. It has a bizarre smell - something like old apple pie. Not pleasantly fruity or fresh like others said it would be.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are different than the Redkin product purchased previously from another vendor. The product does not perform well when used on my hair compared to the Redkin product purchased previously from another vendor. The label had been pasted on the bottle, and appeared to be cut to fit. Very disappointing, as it was as expensive as the product sold in a salon. Will not use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I had soft, shiny, well-conditioned hair . . . until I used this product. I thought it would help relieve some of the breakage, but it literally ruined my hair after only one application. I am shocked beyond belief. Not only are my ends fried and brittle, my entire head of hair is ruined from mid-shaft down. I cannot understand all of the positive reviews. This is the worst hair product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Nourishing and not too heavy if you use the right amount for your hair.  Makes a big difference for fine hair that tangles or breaks easily. It also increases the volume of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of fine, straight hair.  I think split ends show up more easily on straight hair (no curls to hide), so I am always looking for ways to fix this problem.  I use this exclusively with Bonacure sealed ends and can go what feels like forever between haircuts without it looking like my hair grew branches.  One pump of each in your hand, mix, and rub into the ends of damp hair, then do whatever else you would do to style.  LOVE IT.  Smells nice, too.  Not too strong.</li>
    <li> This past New England winter has killed my hair! Frizz, breakage, it&#x27;s tired of cold weather and dry heat blowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has broughten it&#x27;s life back! It&#x27;s smooth again and my ends look better than ever! It&#x27;s barely breaking even though the winter hasn&#x27;t let up yet, but this stuff has made my hair better than before! ....and it smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world! My hair was so over-processed and I started using this and my hair stylist said how much of an improvement she saw in my hair. I can tell by looking at it how much healthier it is, too. Not nearly the amount of split ends I used to have.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for about 2 months and i dont really see a difference. I think this smell is horrible. Very chemical and gross. Also i believe this formula is too liquidy. Hardly a a conditioner. I shouldnt have believed all the hype and wasted $17 on this.</li>
    <li> I have fine, limp hair that is prone to looking greasy, so there was no way I would have even tried this product if it weren&#x27;t for a recommendation from a friend. I apply this to only the ends of my damp hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy at all. I was very pleasantly surprised by this. It has really helped my split ends and makes it easy to pull a brush through my hair. I don&#x27;t know if I got an odd bottle, or if they all are like this, but the stuff shoots out of the bottle like a rocket and I have more than once squirted myself, the floor, the walls and counters with it. Gotta be careful, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This product I have used for the last 10-15Yrs.  My hairdresser started me using this..Just love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Works great on wet and dry hair. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> It is less than I expected from a Redken product.It is just average.. so nothing special..I hope the next time I get something better</li>
    <li> I am glad that I ordered this product- it leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use it. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thin hair and was in desperate need to use something to condition it. This worked!</li>
    <li> Love this been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that damages easily. Since I have been trying to grow it out, I have had the WORST time with split ends. I purchased Neutrogena deep recovery hair mask, and this did nothing- even after leaving it on for a long time. I even bought moroccan argan oil and saturated my hair with it every day, but that didn&#x27;t work either! I was becoming very frustrated and did lots of reading reviews on conditioners. I wanted a leave-in conditioner because my hair tends to tangle even after the use of a regular conditioner. This is unlike any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy at all. It&#x27;s super light in my hair, and after it&#x27;s dry, you would never know that I had product in it. Oh, and it smells amazing. I will forever have this in my cabinet. Thanks, Redken!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure who invented this delicious hair potion but they deserve the highest praise, a nobel prize, and a yummy cupcake cuz HOT DANG!&lt;br /&gt;When styling your hair with heat and through washing, coloring, or even just styling your hair, it can damage the protein in your lovely locks. When this natural protein is removed, you get dry, brittle hair. That&#x27;s just sad. SO! To combat hair for bird&#x27;s nests, you need to replace the protein you&#x27;ve lost. That&#x27;s where this product comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after a shower, when my hair has been towel dried, as an end mender and protein replacement. I use it when my hair is dry before I straighten or wave my hair. It works wonders to make my hair moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product for awhile before leaving a review and I am glad I did. I have been dying my hair for over 10 years and about 6 months ago I bleached my hair and went a bright vampire red and the bleaching destroyed my hair. It was stretchy like a rubber band and was so bad that I thought I was going to have to shave my head. I gave this a try and I am so glad I did. Within a couple uses I could already see AND feel a difference in my hair. I would recommend cutting off as much of your hair as you can which will help your hair grow because all that dead hair will never be fully healed. This product is wonderful and I will be purchasing it again which won&#x27;t be for awhile, I use a lot and still have a ton which is great! It might seem a bit pricey for a hair product but it lasts a long time so, it&#x27;s worth it because it actually works.</li>
    <li> Not knowing much about hair products, it does seem to be doing some good to my hair quality.  I would recommend this product to others to at least give it a try.  Especially if your hair is fragile.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my local hair cuttery.  I straighten my hair at least once a week but I keep getting split ends and having significant breakage. I can see a noticeable difference in the my hair&#x27;s overall look and it&#x27;s much softer and not as dry when it&#x27;s straight.  I will keep buying this product.  Also has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great leave in product. The only problem I have is with the smell. For some people it does not effect them, but for me I am sensitive to smells and perfumes. This one gives me a headache. I basically put the product on and  tolerate the smell for a few seconds. But, if you are sensitive to perfumes you might want to  take this into consideration.</li>
    <li> This product, combined with the Redken Extreme shampoo &amp; conditioner is the first thing that has actually made a true, obvious difference in the quality of my hair. Over the years, my hair has become thin and brittle and I have been struggling with it through dietary changes and exhaustive product searches. I&#x27;ve tried Nioxin and even, as a last resort, Rogaine. I even got a water filter for my shower. Nothing made a difference. I ordered the Extreme line and noticed a change immediately. My hair is stronger, bouncier, shinier and it has stopped falling out and breaking off. I feel like these products will allow all of my broken hair to finally grow all the way in. As a side note, I went to a friend&#x27;s for a few nights and was without these products. I used hers (and they are of very high quality AND she has better quality water) and my hair went back to it&#x27;s old frizzy, dry brittle ways! Got home and went back to Redken Extreme and my hair was happy as can be. THIS STUFF IS A MIRACLE!</li>
    <li> Great product for dry hair.  Very pleasant smell.  I add a little to damp hair.  After drying and straightening, I add a little more if there are dry ends sticking out.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair so soft and you can just feel it working. It&#x27;s a real blessing.Thank you. So glad I got.</li>
    <li> This product gave me amazing results. Two years ago I had the Brazilian blowout done and my hair never looked so good. The BB was supposed to last about 3 months, but it&#x27;s two years later and my curl is still gone, and now I have extremely frizzy hair, that is now broken and damaged because I have to flat iron everyday. I started using As I Am cowash, and that helped but I needed something to strengthen my hair since I have to flat iron my hair so much. I have to say that I absolutely love what this has done for my hair. I still use my heat protectant before using the flat iron for added protection but my hair now looks as good as it did when I first got the Brazilian blowout done. It&#x27;s important for anyone using this product to know that you shouldn&#x27;t use it everyday because it will actually do the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it twice a week and the cowash takes care of my hair in between uses. I highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with extremely dry and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I recently went from a dark brunette (natural color) to a light ashy blonde. Combined with the Japanese straight perm at the bottom of my hair, my hair was damaged and &amp;#34;in shock&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was forced to heat style my hair since air drying it left it looking puffed and frizzy, sort of that electrocuted/damaged look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a few things and now I can let my hair air dry with minimal frizz (asides from the type I was born with, bleach or no):&lt;br /&gt;1) Coconut oil mask&lt;br /&gt;2) Redken Anti-Snap Leave-In Treatment, along with the spray type of the same line that I use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;3) Keratin treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these products, moisturizing shampoos/conditioners, and the keratin treatment, my hair air dries nicely and solely needs to be heat styled if I&#x27;m trying to go for a super smooth/straight look. I think that this product is a big part of what brought my hair back to a less damaged state. Which is pretty impressive given what I&#x27;ve put it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviews mentioning the bottle can shoot the product out in random directions if any of the product has dried in the nozzle. But that happens with a lot of different product packaging so it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this for all the amazing reviews. I don&#x27;t like it at all and will not buy again. Does not moisture. Squirts and is too watery!</li>
    <li> If you have unruley curly hair this is the stuff.. put this on first then sunsilk waves of envy cream/gel twist..works like a charm..its taken me years to find the right combo.. Excellent product...</li>
    <li> Every day I use this product. It is single handeadly the best hair care product I use. It helps eliminate frizz and breakage. Perfect</li>
    <li> made my hair more brittle and dry then it was , did not stop the breakage</li>
    <li> I read reviews a lot of good reviews about this product, however I also read the reviews listed about how the picture didn&#x27;t match up with the received product and that the LIGHT blue bottle received didn&#x27;t do as well as the dark blue bottle in the picture that you would get at a salon. I had never tried this product before so I can&#x27;t attest to the difference, but the  bottle I received was not the one in the advertised picture, and it did nothing good for my hair, it made it dry and pieces of my hair were hard and crunchy. I even used it twice to make sure. it kind of just laid on top of my hair. I would suggest buying this either from Redken or a salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing.  I put it on my damp hair after showering and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running a brush through it and ripping my hair.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last me a while.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and cannot be without it. I have very fine hair and it helps with the tangles and breakage.</li>
    <li> Great to put a little in your hair before you style it.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed. The smell was not very pleasant either. It smelled like old blueberries or something :( I also didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. The consistency is watery, so I was initially thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be very moisturizing but after my hair dried I could immediately notice that it was hydrated, less frizzy and the tangles were easier to brush out (And my hair stayed mostly detangled, even after a few days which is a feat in itself!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it only a few times and am already seeing results. I was freaking out because after dying my dark brunette hair blonde for the first time, I thought the terrible ends I had were only going to be fixed by being chopped off. MY hair seriously went from feeling like tough hay to commercial silliness. I&#x27;m very very excited, and relieved :) I didn&#x27;t want to chop off my long locks...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years. I love it</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out by the handful after I fried it with lots of bleach. I tried protein treatments, PH conditioners, the whole gambit. After only one use of this I ran a brush through my hair and maybe had a few strands break off. This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on anything else, just buy this and I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Best product for my hair. It keeps my hair very strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product, i decided to do an ombre hair style which dried out my ends terribly, felt like straw.  After a few weeks my end were soft and and healthy feeling again.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product for this, weak, or heat treated hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for hair that has gone through any treatments. I have my hair straightened at a salon every 9 months or so and this leave-in treatment in combination with the Redken Extreme shampoo/conditioner make sure my treated hair is soft and has no breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I just use one pump of the product in my towel dried hair and blow-dry/style as usual. It is very light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I have been using the Extreme line ever since it was recommended to me by my stylist several years ago, and the difference is absolutely night and day.  Like most women, I have my hair colored, I use a blow-dryer, and I also use a curling brush.  Lots of high heat, but you would never know it by the lush and healthy look and feel of my hair.  I also have very fine hair that is prone to breaking and damage -- in fact, I will say that I HAD that type of hair before I began using the Extreme products.  No more!  If they ever stop selling this line, I don&#x27;t know what on earth I will do.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks after my stylist reccommended it. I have very long, thick, brunette hair with terrible split ends and this eased about 90% of the splits and breakage within the first 2 uses. It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair which is a plus since it&#x27;s already heavy and long. It also makes my hair softer so when I brush through it, it&#x27;s much easier to handle. I gave it 4 stars for now because I want to see if it holds up long term.</li>
    <li> Ok I guess not to thrilled.</li>
    <li> This stuff has saved my hair! Breakage has been way down since I&#x27;ve started using this. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very helpful to my hair.</li>
    <li> therd time around ,,,  good stuff and the price is right</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Smells good too</li>
    <li> Really does help reduce breakage, I have relaxed/texlaxed hair use this every week and have noticed an improvement in my hair breakage</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, just on products that I absolutely love. My boss&#x27;s daughter who is a hair stylist told me to not spend money on hair treatments at the salon because they only last for a few days. This product has made a huge difference in my hair. It keeps it looking strong and healthy. I suggest everyone buys this amazing product!</li>
    <li> A perfect go-to for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this after the hair stylist used this in my hair before a blow dry. Love it. Bought my first bottle from Amazon and I stocked up on a few more. Lightweight and won&#x27;t leave hair greasy. Well worth the price. It lasts an extremely long time even if you use it every day. I mix it with Redken Satinwear 02 prepping blow-dry lotion.</li>
    <li> Unsure if I had received this product as having been diluted w/ water. It was extremely running and smelled like sweet roll pastry scent. I had bought this same product many years ago and it was extremely good conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for years.  Hair is much more manageable when using this product.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Only made my hair feel greasy and damaged, even over a four month period of trying it carefully.</li>
    <li> This is not authentic.  I have bought this exact product from salons before and I can say it is definitely not the same. It&#x27;s way more runny, smells a tad different, and did not set well on my hair as it had in the past. I is either watered down or altered. I only bought it here because it was much cheaper. If I could give 0 stars I would. Bite the bullet and pay the salon price or just find a cheap drug store hair repair. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was recently at a salon and bought a bottle because I have trouble with breakage and split ends. I like the smell, but was pretty disappointed with the performance of this product. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using.</li>
    <li> Not oily makes the hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner for anyone what has any type of damaged hair.  Within a couple of treatments hair is stronger and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I noticed my blonde hi-lights were beginning to become brittle. I darkened the blonde chunks and started using Redken Extreme Shampoo/condition and this Anti-snap while repairing the broken pieces. It&#x27;s a great combination!</li>
    <li> I have long thick healthy hair and a few years ago I fried it by coloring it at home.  I went to my hairdresser and told her to cut several inches off and she suggested I restore it back to healthy with Anti-snap.  I thought she was crazy but I tried it.  It really did work.  It took awhile but in a few months my hair looked great again.  It smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since stopped using it because I have a terrible static problem and I have to use a different leave-in product but I would highly recommend Anti-snap for anyone wanting super healthy, super shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Normally redken is a great quality product and works everytime but this didn&#x27;t work for me. I have thin hair with a lot of split ends. I read through all the reviews and thought this would be perfect but I have yet to see a difference and I have used it everyday for almost a month now. I even got a trim and quit using heat on my hair and it still didn&#x27;t work. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well to protect from heat and strengthen hair. I can notice my hair not breaking as frequently.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT.I have long hair and I was having problems with my hair breaking and i tried everything. This is the only product that worked and didnt make my hair greasy. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it. The consistency is total water, nothing smoothing,softening for the hair. I did several pumps because it&#x27;s messy and seeps through your fingers. I have been using it almost 3 weeks and my hair has literally never felt or looked worse! This is suppose to be a leave-in treatment that protects from heat and improves the hairs strength and it&#x27;s done the total opposite. I have naturally wavy hair and get regular highlights. I was hoping this would help with the bleach damage on my ends. The hair is falling out from the root, as well as breaking off. I&#x27;m mad I wasted my money and will be writing a letter to Redken. This stuff SUCKS!!! It&#x27;s creamy looking water. I want to cut my hair and start over, thanks for nothing Redken!</li>
    <li> They seem to have changed the formula over the last few years. I had a bottle I bought from the salon a few years ago and when I did a side by side comparison, this one felt watered down. It doesn&#x27;t have the thick serum feel to it anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a hair stylist working on my daughters coarse dry hair suggested it.  Amazon offers this product at a great price and free shipping which I love.  It has a very nice smell and her hair soaks it up on contact.  After using it for the past couple months, I can tell a difference in her hair without the excessive breakage.  We do not currently use the other Anti-Snap products offered through this line, but may try them in addition to this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She really likes it and I love the way it leaves her hair smelling. Sometimes I just burry my nose in her hair to get a good sniff - Yum!</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little longer than expected, but the product exceeds expectations, so the wait was well worth it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I am trying to grow my hair out and recently started using the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner at the recommendation of my hair dresser.  I like them so much that I bought this leave-in conditioner as well.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I put in on the middle to the ends of my hair just before bed.  I have been using it for about two weeks now and can definitely tell a difference.  My hair feels heavier and softer, and looks shinier.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> So far this is working fairly well, I am going to use it longer to see the long term effects. My hair was damaged at the ends because of lightening for an ombre look and I got this in attempt to protect the ends from breakage. It seems to sometimes leave the ends a little crusty, but I think it leaves a protective coat over the hair.</li>
    <li> Right before I bought this product, I had colored my hair and it was breaking easily. When ever I would blow dry it, I could see it breaking and falling out in tiny pieces on the counter. Now I apply this product and blow dry with out the brush and there isn&#x27;t any hair left over on the counter.</li>
    <li> I love this treatment. It works so well with my hair, and it always feels so moisturized and soft after I use it. What a difference! It&#x27;s a conditioning and a protein treatment all in one! LOVE!</li>
    <li> This product, along with the Extreme Strength Builder will be all that I need for the foreseeable future.  Thanks to my hair stylist for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> smells great, leaves blow dried hair feeling healthier&lt;br /&gt;expensive but a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;this bottle size will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, along with all the other Redken Extreme products - shampoo, conditioner.  If you work hard, work out (or both!) and shower more than once a day, the Extreme product series is a great choice for your hair.</li>
    <li> Agree with another user, smells like rancid lemons, not the same as the product I have bought in stores. Very disapointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 10 years and still love it! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Redken&#x27;s extreme line is perfect for the most dry and damaged hair due to heat and/or color treatments. This product really targets dry and split ends and nourishes them to be hydrated again. Within days, the ends of your hair will feel softer and smoother and look a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to put this on after you shower and before you put your regular leave in conditioner on. This can also help with detangling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will continue purchasing it</li>
    <li> I used this after my hair has been chemically treated quite a bit, in fear of my hair breaking off. I guess it worked, because my hair seems to be doing okay! The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but I cant complain.</li>
    <li> When I first pumped this serum out I almost flung it off my hand because it looked like someone had bottled jizz and decided that it&#x27;d be a great hair product. I put it in anyway since I paid $17 for it. You need like 3-4 pumps to cover the tips of your hair (I have shoulder length hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference. My hair&#x27;s pretty thick/ombre&#x27;d/dry and I don&#x27;t think this would&#x27;ve solved any huge issues. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, or maybe I got the wrong product. My bottle was light blue with dark blue splotches. Maybe it was jizz.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and decided to get a spiral perm. Wow it&#x27;s beautiful and I have no regrets but it had been so long since I had a perm that I forgot two big things. One is it makes your hair smell awful for a few weeks and two it really dries out your hair and makes it frizzy. I immediately went online and started researching and Redken Anti-snap had perfect reviews. I kept researching just to make sure I was buying the best product for my hair but felt confident that this was the one for me. I was amazed at how my hair soaked this up as if it were drinking it. I followed the directions and put it on while my hair was still quite damp. Once it had air dried it looked so much better and much healthier after one use and it smelled amazing. Thank you for such a great product:)</li>
    <li> This product is terrific; those times when I wash my hair and forget to use it, I can tell my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much sheen and just doesn&#x27;t feel as nice. This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was happy to find it on line for purchase.  It is great for fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
    <li> I wonder if I got a weird bottle but while this product makes my hair feel great, it smells way too sweet--like candy...</li>
    <li> I thought it would work better. I was hoping to be able to comb through my hair when it was wet and it&#x27;s still pretty difficult with this product.</li>
    <li> love the product keeps my hair from breaking, but the price is steep</li>
    <li> This is really the only product that helps put protein back into my hair - for some reason, a lot of those keratin enriched etc products don&#x27;t do it for me, but this one does!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I use this product because my hair is permed, colored and very dry. I was dubious because I tried many different products to eliminate the dryness without having my hair look greasy.  This Redken product is just wonderful  and leaves my hair silky, manageable and smooth. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product from a salon before but am on a budget now. My hair is very dry/damaged. So I thought I&#x27;d try buying it on here.  If anything it has made my hair more dry. My hair looks and feels terrible when it is in as well. I notice a huge difference in the smell and texture of the product I&#x27;m used to getting at the salon.</li>
    <li> My hair is super-fine and breaks off so easily. It&#x27;s blonde, so every little snapped-off, flyaway strand stands out. I saw this in my friend&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s bathroom and had to try it out because of the name alone. I could tell a difference in my hair right away. It looks much smoother and resists breaking now - not 100% break free, but much better. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. If you have fine hair, you know that&#x27;s a must!</li>
    <li> I have been using leave-in conditioners for some time now; I use it as base for my gel or any other hair cream. I have been using this one for a couple of days, it does help your hair stay hydrated; the reason for not giving it 5 stars is that is not a cream but more liquid; my only complain.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and silky and has a pleasant fruity scent.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple of times after reading some of the reviews.  My hair really likes this product.  I have thin, straight hair which loves to lay flat on my head and tangle impossibly after each shampoo. A previous reviewer suggested using the Anit-snap halfway down my hair to the ends.  It worked well and left a nice healthy shine.  Curls lasted.</li>
    <li> I have used Redken Anti-Snap Leave-in Treatment for about 10 years and I really think it helps to help the friz in your hair. I find that Amazon has the best price that I have found and I bought 2 so I want run out,</li>
    <li> Product smells good and seems to be working well so far, but it will take time to see a major difference.</li>
    <li> I completely fried my hair, and this helped so much.</li>
    <li> I know mines not great one like alot of people have said but every single time I have used this after my hair dries it leaves it crunchy as if you applied hair spray everyone s hair is different though.</li>
    <li> Great product as all of Redken&#x27;s produces. This has help me keep my hair undercontrol for all my chemo treatments as well as Redken&#x27;s new product with Oil in the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  It works wonders for damaged hair and finally brought my hair back to life.  BRAVO!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This makes your hair feel great and smell great.  It really helps with my fly aways and keeps my hair healthy and strong.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years alternating with Bed Heads Ego boost which is also something you should try!  My hair smells like I just left the salon and is very soft.</li>
    <li> In the past month alone. I have bleached and chemically treated my hair to obtain a silvery/platinum blonde. However, as many of you know, bleaching can cause your hair to become very stringy and basically snap off. After applying this to my hair, it no longer snapped! Just one use made a terrific difference! The only complaint about this product that I have is that I am not really too fond of the smell. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My hair seems much healthier.</li>
    <li> Works amazing with my bleached blonde hair, i put it in right after a shower and it also maintains my waves to look amazing</li>
    <li> Works really well, it leaves my hair super soft.... and i love the smell!</li>
    <li> You have to know how to use this. It&#x27;s protein based and my hair loooooves protein. It gets the job done but if you are to use it, make sure you use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner before hand to avoid that crunchy/hard feeling. I have almost no breakage with this stuff and I love it.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair more manageable and takes the coarseness out of my hair. I highly recemmend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Redken Anti-Snap on and off for years.  My stylist first recommended it, and suggested a using a little on the ends of my hair a few times a week.  I liked it - nice smell and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or greasy - but I was still experiencing breakage.  I tried a number of other products since then, without much success.  I went back to Anti-Snap and started using 5-6 pumps all over my hair, every time I washed it.  What a difference... my hair is smoother, more manageable, and healthier.  Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey and I&#x27;ll go through it faster now, it&#x27;s worth it because it works!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended Redken leave-in conditioner many years ago. I absolutely fell in love with it. I&#x27;ve used other leave-in conditioners but never any that made my hair as soft &amp; healthy as this product. I have long hair &amp; I want to keep it as soft and healthy as possible. It keeps my slightly wavy hair from frizzing, helps make it a lot more manageable, &amp; helps fight split ends &amp; damage that comes from my styling products (straighteners, curling irons, etc.). I get compliments on my hair all the time, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone. Also, trust me when I say it&#x27;s worth every penny, and a bottle lasts me a long time &amp; goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased this item after reading the reviews. I have been using it for a couple of months now and it really does make my hair feel healthier. I have less split ends now. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my thin hair down. The scent in very nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The BEST product for split ends bar none. I&#x27;ve used this after lightening damage and it helps every single time.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair treatment to keep hair from tangleing... I&#x27;ve tried everything and swear by this. It also leaves hair non greasy &amp; so soft. So worth a try!!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair item! It makes my curly and course hair looking softer and more manageable. I&#x27;ve used Friszz  Easse by John Freida and were happy with result. But Redken anti-snap expected my expectation. Whether you leave this with your damp or dry hair, it works both ways, softer and easy to shape your curls. Will order for more!</li>
    <li> Ok I am the biggest consumer when it comes to beauty products and have tried sooo many products. I have dry hair and color it, blow dry, etc. I purchased this product and my hair has been transformed! I hope it continues to do the same after a while of using it. It has been over a week now and I cannot stop feeling my hair!!</li>
    <li> This is not Salon-Quality, it&#x27;s a watered down version of the product. Bought this from seller Hayward Beauty. Got a full refund of my money.</li>
    <li> Very happy - comb goes through much more easily on my long hair</li>
    <li> I will stick with my Bio Silk.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice makes your hair soft and stronger</li>
    <li> My hair feels nice and soft. Much healthier losing less hair. Less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that provides easy to comb through hair, receptive to styling and protects from split ends or dry brittle hair. It has a pleasant smell and has an easy to use pump dispenser. Although nearing the bottom of the container you will need to remove the pump and tip the bottle up and pour into your hand to get the product out. I have used this for approximately  2 years and have gound that it has improved the condition of my hair that is colored and blow dried daily.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great on my baby fine hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. Smells nice and seems to be helping my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had waist length hair for six years and I have always dealt with tangles, breakage, and very little volume.  I try about five different leave-in products a year.  Most of them result in my hair looking greasy by the end of the day and I still deal with tangles.  This product keeps my hair looking freshly styled for two days without washing, with far less tangling! It also makes my hair incredibly soft, voluminous, shiny, and great smelling! I&#x27;m confident that I will never have to try another product again!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, it does a good job of preventing heat damage to hair. I find I am able to run the hair dryer over a section of hair 3 or 4 times with the hair dryer so close it touches the hair, no smoke or bad smell emanates from the hair. It also is extremely light weight, I have never felt like my hair was too heavy or oily after using this product. The smell is pleasant too. The only cons are that I have to use 4 pumps to feel like it has totally covered my head, this has lead me to use 30% of the bottle from December 26th to February 26th, and I wash my hair 4 times a week. Perhaps I could be more conservative and still get the same effects, but it is hard to tell how much hair is covered because the product is so light weight. .</li>
    <li> I tried it a few times hoping it would help with my hair loss and it really did not for me-&lt;br /&gt;I started using Lanza manuka honey conditioner and am finally seeing some results and only loosing about half what i was.</li>
    <li> Very good for the hair</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, straight hair with many split ends. I&#x27;ve been using this product practically every day for a little over half a year, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference. I still have many split ends. It could have prevented some and I just don&#x27;t know it though. I do like the smell, and it lasts awhile, but once it&#x27;s gone, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to bother buying it again unless I notice a change when I stop.</li>
    <li> makes my hair soft and shiny and well worth the price since I have naturally brittle hair and this stuff makes it come to life and grow long and thick! however it now has a different smell then it used to I havent used it in a while and just purchased, anyone else experience that? anyway, very happy to get this again all of redken products are amazingly awesome!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair and did some major damage to it and was afraid that I would not be able to save it. So, I did a lot of research before I decided to purchase Redken Extreme Anti-Snap, and had my hopes up that it would help end the breakage and I wouldn&#x27;t have to cut off all my hair. Although, I do think that it might have helped somewhat, it was not enough, I ended up cutting my long (mid-back) hair to my jaw line. I found that if you severely damage your hair or fry it, cutting off the damage, getting protein back in it, as well as, using a hair mask and deep conditioning is the way to go. I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend buying this product because it really didn&#x27;t do what it said it would or what others have claimed it does. Not impressed at all!</li>
    <li> If your hair is breaking and it is not from over amounts of added protein this will get the job done to stop the breakage. I would advise to lessen the usage once your hair stops breaking. I often have to stop using all together as it can have a reverse effect once the hair is better. Of course cutting your hair will always be the best solution for any type of damage but I know some people just have fine easily breakable hair. I use this after I&#x27;ve done something stupid to my hair. Works great. I don&#x27;t have the product in front of me so I can&#x27;t describe any scent but I can tell you I can smell stuff no one else smells and this does not have a lingering scent or I&#x27;d remember.</li>
    <li> Redken Extreme Anti-Snamp Leave-In Treatment does exactly what it said it will do. It prevents breakage. I have used this product for year and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a hair care professional. I love it!  It keeps my ends from breaking and splitting. She recommended using one pump every day after you get out of the shower! This is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love leave in conditioners and the stylist recommended this product.  I use a blow dryer and curling iron several times a week and I noticed a marked difference in how well my hair looked and felt after using this product.  A litte bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Was just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and was glad I could obtain it (with a lttle savings) through Amazon. I received this quite some time go, so I am surprised I am simply being asked to review it now. I&#x27;m not sure it saved me much, especially since the shipping brought up the cost, but I was glad to know that this service is available, and it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all... and it does have a kind of weird smell...&lt;br /&gt;I have some of the &amp;#34;All Soft&amp;#34; version and they&#x27;re just wonderful! Thought this would be better, but no. Really no.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, and saved my hair. Bleached my hair three times trying to get the black dye out of my hair, and after a month or so of using this, my hair felt totally repaired.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this product for 12 years and I love it. It makes your hair strong and shiny and I don&#x27;t have many split ends. Try it yourself and you&#x27;ll see. I used to have hair that snapped, split and frizzed really badly until my mom gave this to me. Use it daily, put it on after your shower and feel free to blow dry or let dry alone without crispiness or oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years! It truly does make my hair healthier and smoother (I bleach and tone my hair so it&#x27;s completely damaged). This came brand new and all wrapped up and is wonderful! If you use a blow-dryer or a flat iron, I definitely recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> the best hair product, it helped me to get my long hair back...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and have not found a product that matches this.  It leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, right on time.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff like other leave-ins</li>
    <li> This product has put the nutrients back in my hair, especially after one use I was amazed to see the difference. The hairstylist I had told me it shouldn&#x27;t be used every day because too much protein in hair is a bad thing but once a week in your hair would revitalize it over time and make your hair healthy again. I am extremely happy with this product and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but this bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same or the product has changed or my hair has changed.  I don&#x27;t know for sure which it is.  I always loved how it made my hair easy to comb out after a shower.  This bottle helps, but not like in the past.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Redken shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for color treated hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I have blonde processed hair, after the shower I put one to two pumps in my hair. It seems to make it easier to comb out and when combined with KERASTASE thermal product it blow drys wonderfully. No frizz. Soft. Shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair is softer and healthier and smells great! I recommend this product to anyone with fine hair for sure.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this product from my hairdresser but when searching Amazon for other products, I ran across the Redken Leave-in treatment.  I have hair which tends to frizz and this product helps keep my hair from frizzing and also leaves it soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I had very damaged hair from getting blonde highlights and a perm. I use Anti-Snap everyday after showering and my hair feels great and is healthy again!</li>
    <li> I can totally tell a difference when I use this on my hair to blow dry it, so much less breakage. Love it!</li>
    <li> So I use this every time I wash my hair, I think my hair is stronger I don&#x27;t see my hair breaking as much as it did before. I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> I am now 100% Redken Extreme products.  This Anti-Snap leave-in treatment is wonderful.  You don&#x27;t have to use much either.  Apply it to wet or completely dry hair.  I have rather long hair and I apply it to the bottom 2 inches of my hair every night when I go to bed as well as every single morning.  This is now a product I will not be without!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my girl along with the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner. It works amazingly well! It&#x27;s stopped her hair from falling out  almost from the first use. Leaves her hair very smooth, and the fragrance is delightful.</li>
    <li> The picture advertised made me think I was ordering the dark blue bottle. I received a light blue bottle and the ingredient list is slightly different. The item I received is not what I thought I was buying - as the picture advertised it. The product in the light blue bottle is not bad, it is just not what I expected. I can tell a difference at the end of the day as to how my hair feels. It is not as silky as the product in the dark blue bottle. I purchased the dark blue bottle in the picture from a salon.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  My hair is overprocessed and this makes it feel silky smooth.  I received the product super fast from the Seller.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Ive used this product everytime I was my hair for the past 2 years, its almost an addiction!  I recommend this to anyone who has thick hair that snaps easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in treatment I have ever used. It leaves my hair manageable, soft, and shiny. I would recommend this to anyone who has dry hair from hot tools.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I have very heat damaged hair and it was recommended by my hair stylist. It helps restore hair by putting protein back into the strand. It&#x27;s awesome. My hair drinks it up!</li>
    <li> This product not only works great but also smells great! It helped restore my hair and lived up to my expectations! I would definately buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great product ... used for myself and my kids.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize to use a small amount as this is a protein product. It gets the job done but eventually my hair is dry and brittle from the protein</li>
    <li> Love it tried  not using it and my hair was real fly away and unmanagable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it very much</li>
    <li> Lives up to the high Redken standard. This leaves my hair, shiny, thicker and smelling great.  Does not feel sticky or stiff. Easy to apply in the morning- just wet your hands,  add a few drops and run through hair. Great for damaged, dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and have never found a product that isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, EVER! Until now, been using for a few years but super spendy at salons. Up to $40. I apply to entire head and never ever greasy. You might feel like nothing is on but I assure you its there and feels wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t make hair comb easy, I suggest you comb hair before shower. This a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Funny, I just finished writing a review for Redken shampoo and conditioner.  I love this stuff. It smells fantastic but more importantly, it works. My hair was damaged from getting highlights and my stylist recommended this to me. My hair is so much healthier now. It doesn&#x27;t take too much either, just a small dab. I blow-dry my hair, flat iron it, then put this in. It really does repair the damage I do to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using thrs product off and on for the past 10 years.  Usually when I bleach I need to use this for a while to prevent breakage and that it does very well.  I also love the scent of this and it does linger softly.  All in all a wonderful product from Redken!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark blue bottle cause I&#x27;m really used to it and I love the product and I received the light blue bottle so I don&#x27;t know what results I&#x27;m going to get but I&#x27;m going to try it</li>
    <li> I tried so many leave-in treatment and come back for this one always!  I use it before drying my hair and it makes the hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt be without it.  I buy it for my granddaughter hair also.</li>
    <li> this stuff did miracles for me. it made my dead dry split end hair repair itself. i also felt like it kind of made my hair grow.i would recomend this to anyone who wants soft and smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and helps my hair keep the frizz away. So happy to have found it here!</li>
    <li> Smell so so good, and my hair become limp</li>
    <li> Horrible, didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. Also there were white clumps in my hair from this product. I recommend everyone to NOT buy this!!!</li>
    <li> Fixes damage perfectly</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! You have to put it in right after a shower on towel dried hair and comb it through. Then brush your hair a few times while it&#x27;s drying (or while blow drying) otherwise your hair will get stiff. I am caucasian with fine hair that I have had dyed and highlighted, which really dried it out. I find that this product makes my hair smoother and softer when it&#x27;s dry. It&#x27;s saved my hair!</li>
    <li> my damaged hair got back to normal after using it for about two weeks.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> smells nice worked well.</li>
    <li> My post-menopausal, highlighted and color-treated, fine, shoulder length hair was snapping all over the place.  I have been using this with the Redken Extreme Cat protein builder and I have noticed a very nice improvement.  All recommended by my stylist.</li>
    <li> I have used this treatment for years and it never fails to make my hair manageable and give it some body.  Lots of Redken products are just as good.</li>
    <li> This works great. I have naturally curly hair that I have to blow dry everyday. I use a lot of the product, and it helps with smoothness and frizziness. smells great and I have definitely noticed my hair becoming stronger!</li>
    <li> This product is remarkable!  My dry, brittle hair is much softer and I have noticed a lot less breakage.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years. I have hair that is thin and baby fine. It tends to get greasy fast, because of these factors. Most conditioners do not work for me. Believe me, I know, because I spent decades searching until my hair dresser turned me on to this product. This conditioner leaves my hair with lots of body and on days of low humidity instead of my hair being full of static electricity and floating around my head, it stays under control and this after using a blow dryer and curling iron. The product speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I wanted a quick transition.  I wanted my blonde hair back.  I was going from a damaged, brassy orange color  to bleach blonde.  I bleached my hair and ended up damaging it really bad.  I have never seen my hair fall out in clumps before. I was scared, sad and desperate for anything that would help.  I went on the internet searched best product for damaged hair.  This product had so many good reviews I just had to try it.  At that point I really didn&#x27;t care to spend money on anything.  This product really is a miracle worker! After one use my hair stop falling.  I still do have some flyaway but I rather that then have my hair coming out in clumps.  I never write reviews but this time I just had too.  Hope this can help someone as it did for me!</li>
    <li> for 20 years this is theeee best leave in conditioner ever. for after beach swimming and pool swimming and after any shampooing. it will ave your locks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Smells so clean and fresh and leaves your hair a soft silky healthy feel. I can&#x27;t live without my anti-snap leave in conditioner.</li>
