      <li>I also use the Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner, which is lovely.</li>
      <li>an 8 ounce bottle would be so much better.</li>
      <li>As an &amp;#34;after shampooing&amp;#34; conditioner, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The longer you leave the product on the better is seems to work.</li>
      <li>And you MUST make sure you&#x27;re massaging the conditioner in, not just putting it on and rinsing it off.</li>

      <li>I started out on this order to buy Wen conditioning shampoo after using a tester of it, but I love anything coconut</li>

      <li>I love  the smell and how it makes my curls look.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure there is some benefit in using this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>So I started looking for a cleansing conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank the way Wen does, and that worked better for me</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve searched for some magic shampoo, conditioner, or gel to help me form my curls without frizz head.</li>

      <li>My hair is so clean, bouncy, and it feels so light after I wash it... and the smell is lovely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. But I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it weekly which is how I&#x27;ve always done my co-washing. I have a cross between 3A and 3B Type hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I thought my hair felt really heavy and the curls wouldn&#x27;t hold like they always have. It also felt kind of greasy. I though I had possibly used it in correctly and waited until next wash day. The next week I had the same issue. I even used less so my hair felt dirty still and was now heavy and greasy. My next wash day I went back to my old routine which worked wonderful. My curls felt amazing again. I decided I&#x27;d give this cowash one more try. So for the third time I tried it and the same effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely not impressed. Will NEVER be buying this again. I will just stick to what I know and love.</li>
    <li> I really really love this cowash conditioner.  It has done my hair very good! I&#x27;m using a lot of products and taking Biotin to help my hair grow but this product has been my daily/weekly cleanser for my hair.  I brought mine from walgreens because it was a tad bit cheaper there but this and Organix products will always be a staple for me and my hair it has created a lovely sheen/shine to my hair that I am really liking!  Plus is smells great! A+</li>
    <li> Cleanses well without leaving my hair dry.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a jar of hair conditioner with a SMIDGEN of shampoo, period. This may be some sort of WAY OVERPRICED product posing as something spectacular. It&#x27;s a fad.  Imagine having a jar of conditioner with a tad of soap and &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; your hair with it. Almost no suds and as the shower rinses it out (partially) you can feel conditioner running down your neck and back . OF COURSE your hair gets &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; as you use this! You can&#x27;t Really rinse it out and it builds up resulting in…..FLAT HEAD. Not the shiny, silky hair on eighteen year olds you see on tv. I&#x27;m talking FLAT AND STRAIGHT. Therefore, if you want your hair to be flat then buy this. If you want NO curl, buy this. I would LOVE to read the chemical makeup of this versus a jar of moisturizer and I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;re nearly identical. Congrats to the WEN guy . He has half of America paying his Rolls Royce payments. I would give it less stars except it does make your hair super soft (as if you had run butter through your hair a few times never getting to really rinse it out. Oh-and it makes the floor of your shower slippery as if…it had been moisturized which can be a hazard. Gladly going back to shampoo with conditioner added. This is a CROCK.</li>
    <li> have puchased before at &#x27;sally beauty supply&#x27; locally. the perfect product. makes the most brittle hair repaired. sha;moo and conditioner all in one. my search for the perfect hair product is over. very good for processed hair. u cant goo wrond</li>
    <li> Excellent! So happy to have it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using cleansing conditioners for 7 years and I only feel the need to wash with shampoo about once a month.&lt;br /&gt;Having been with Wen for the first 5 years, I have tried several cleansing conditioners in the last 3 years just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of wavy frizzy hair and I am definitely not a fan of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this because it smells so delicious but as soon as I applied it I could tell it wasn&#x27;t the best cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not really workable in the shower because it makes my hair feel tight, if that makes any sense, and I can&#x27;t comb through it easily at all like you would with Wen, so I&#x27;ve had to use a conditioner afterwards every time. On the upside, my hair feels super clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best cleansing conditioner next to &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; as far as ingredients and performance that I&#x27;ve found is &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essence &amp; Pantene cleansing conditioners are the best &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; end cleansing conditioners IMHO.</li>
    <li> Decent product.  I don&#x27;t care for the packaging, it&#x27;s messy.  I seem to break out every time I use it.  Will use it up when I&#x27;m out of other products.</li>
    <li> This has ruined my hair.  If I could rate it lower than 1  I would.  I had the nicest prettiest, somewhat dry without straightening.  This made my hair break off.  My hair is a complete disaster.  I didn&#x27;t beleive it at first, so I kept trying it,  the second time it was drier, the third time, it felt like straw so much, it was disgusting, even after straightening.  I cant beleive this has almost 5 stars.  Horrible...</li>
    <li> I bought this  few weeks ago after  being frustrated with my  hair. It was  dry, over  colored,  and would not style any way  I wanted it to. The minute I  put this product on my hair  in the shower, I could feel the  healthy texture returning . It felt like my  hair did when I was a child before  I started coloring it and using all kinds of products. I am  amazed that it took the place of the shampoo AND the conditioner. &amp;#34;I rub it  in and rinse it out and my hair is perfect. I  use hot rollers and  it is still wonderfully soft feeling and  wavy. I am  Caucasian with dark blond hair .I had  itchy  coated feeling scalp before  and that  is gone too.It has a slight coconut smell when using it but not after my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Order came as expected and quickly. I have been using the co wash alternating with shampoo and seems to be working well. I have naturally curly dry hair and I have noticed my curls looking more defined and slightly less frizzy withou looking oily or weighed down. Will order again!</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is that it is extremely harsh and drying. The purpose of a cowash is to clear and condition the hair at once without stripping it so you don&#x27;t have to come in afterward with a detangling conditioner.  This is not that product, in my experience.  If you need a strong shampoo to clear a lot of product, you might consider this, but even then, i do not recommend using it with any frequency.  After using it both as a routine cleanser and to remove heavy product buildup, my natural hair was stripped and completely un-combable.  I am not clear why As I Am called this a co-wash this when their Cleansing Pudding is much more of a cowash than this.  I like the As I Am line, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good, pre-packaged co-wash, I would suggest the Pantene Cowash for natural hair.  Inexpensive and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be searching all over for a good moisturizing conditioner for my very thick, coarse 4c hair. This co-wash is perfect!! It cleans all the build-up from my hair without stripping it, so I get a nice  clean moisturized feel to it after I wash with it. The best part is it acts as a shampoo and conditioner so my wash day regime isn&#x27;t as long as it usually is</li>
    <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters with thick natural hair and the jar was just enough, for one co wash. The results were really good on one daughter and good on my other daughter. Both liked the smell and it did make detangling easier. I also used a leave in product to add to the detangling process. Overall I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good co-wash. It smells strong but the odor fades quickly. And you MUST make sure you&#x27;re massaging the conditioner in, not just putting it on and rinsing it off. Otherwise you are going to have some really oily hair.</li>
    <li> This works so well on my son&#x27;s curly hair. We finally found the right product for him.</li>
    <li> I started out on this order to buy Wen conditioning shampoo after using a tester of it, but I love anything coconut , so I decided to try this and compare the two.. The Wen was actually too heavy for my fine hair , but after using this , my hair actually appeared to have more volume, soft and silky, and smelled wonderfully of coconuts!</li>
    <li> This is a really great co-wash! I bought it a local Walgreens, and they were selling it for 50% off just trying to get rid of it. It&#x27;s the best invention I&#x27;ve owned since my million dollar smart phone. I was surprised at how clean my scalp was after the first wash, and how much moisture was still in my hair. The first time I used it was in San Diego, CA so there was more humidity than where I live now. Currently I live in the dessert of Las Vegas and it&#x27;s hard to retain moisture. I have to deep condition more often with 4a/b hair, but the results with this are similar. Very good product and worth while.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this product! Works great and shipped super fast</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile. I love  the smell and how it makes my curls look.</li>
    <li> good product right price</li>
    <li> Great product a little to expensive found this at walmart for a better price</li>
    <li> Loveeee this product. Cleans my (4C) hair and adds moisture, it also detangles and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this from this seller. The standard retail price for this is $7-8 dollars. As for the product it&#x27;s an excellent co wash. Conditioner washing does not work like shampoo because it has no detergent effect. For optimum results get your hair wet, massage this in, plop it on top of your head and let it sit for a while so the steam of the shower can help it soak in. You can&#x27;t just rinse it off immediately. Amazon seems to have an epidemic of shady resellers selling natural hair care products ,marked up to 2 or 3 times the retail price.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! I one of those annoying people who can&#x27;t handle scents especially perfumes. However the wash has a light scent clean scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. It feels fantastic in my hair, is really easy to use &amp; completely stink free :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a caucasian chick with long thick Czech curls I can never tame. For years I&#x27;ve searched for some magic shampoo, conditioner, or gel to help me form my curls without frizz head. So far no luck, but the cowash has given me reason to hope. Granted it&#x27;s not a magic potion to fix all my issues. I still have issues with detangling my hair, but it&#x27;s easier than with other products. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped raw, but it is clean and feels great. The longer you leave the product on the better is seems to work. So after I washed it out I put a dime size amount in my palm and then run it through my hair as a leave in product. After one use I&#x27;ve noticed less frizz  &amp; better formed curls. Keeping my fingers crossed that I&#x27;ve finally found the product to finally tame the mess on my head.</li>
    <li> I am getting use to it. Keeps the hear very soft. I can see changes in my hair.</li>
    <li> If you use Wen, this is more affordable. Great product at good price. Love how it gently cleanses my fragile hair and reduces breakage. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily. Smells clean. Good, clean, stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this cowosh. It leaves my hair soft and it does a great job of detangling. Now I need to find it in a larger size since I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference from using my regular INEXPENSIVE conditioner for my co-washes.  I just don&#x27;t see the point of buying expensive conditioner like this for co-washing, when you can get the same or BETTER effects from using your favorite, INexpensive, sulfate free conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturals INVENTED the term co-wash, it simply means &amp;#34;wash hair with conditioner&amp;#34;.  You don&#x27;t need a fancy label OR a fancy price to get the same effect.  The As I Am line is just an attempt to capitalize on the natural hair movement.  Don&#x27;t be a sucker.  Stick to natural homemade products that you can find on sites like curlynikki.com and watch bloggers like Hairscapades.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but I had just as good of success making my own cowash with regular cheap conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this 4-5 times a week on my TWA.  I have natural 3B/C/4A hair.  This is a very gentle cleanser.  The As I Am line comes through with superior moisturizing products.  My hair is extra soft after use.  This does not clean gel out of the hair very well, but I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> not my hair unravels as expected, I use it with another conditioner after I washed my hair</li>
    <li> I have long, very thick, wavy hair, about 40% gray (which I color with temp color to minimize damage) but hey, I&#x27;m pushing 60 so I&#x27;m not complaining about the gray! I have used wen in the past, and loved it...loving the whole concept of cleansing conditioner as opposed to shampoo. However...at close to $60 for 16 ounces, I would pretty much have to have my head examined if I justified that kind of money on haircare. For my money, the As I Am works every bit as well, and has a lovely feel (very silky) in the hair, and the fragrance is fantastic. I do notice that it has jumped up in price, at least here on Amazon. But...it is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone who has thick and/or coarse hair that tends to be frizzy or unruly, and hard to detangle when combing.</li>
    <li> My daughter will ONLY use this product on her hair.  Quality.  She says it takes some getting used to as it doesn&#x27;t bubble or &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; up.  Her advice is to start with an amount and experiment to see how much you need for your hair and scalp to FEEL clean.  She is very picky about hair care products.  As a biracial young woman she has had difficulty finding products that don&#x27;t leave the ends fried dry and her scalp still oily.  This product gets her gold seal of approval, and that is saying a lot!</li>
    <li> Great product and works very well for fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure this product out.  I&#x27;m new to the whole co washing gig. I&#x27;m sure there is some benefit in using this product.  Time will tell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/14/13 Update:  I allowed the co wash to remain on hair for 30 minutes. 15 minutes in, I sprayed the scalp with a mix of apple vinegar, aloe juice and water.  The co wash does moisturize and I was able to detangle while rinsing.  Good product here</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I am new to co-washing, but this conditioner smells good and makes my hair very soft.  I am an african-american female sporting a teeney weeney afro.  My hair is super curly/coily and perpetually dry.  This conditioner helps maintain moisture and enhances my curls.  I agree with another reviewer&#x27;s response about the packaging.  The company needs to consider putting the conditioner in a bottle instead of a jar.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this product for other naturals.</li>
    <li> LISTEN JUST TRY THIS, HAIR IS CLEAN WITHOUT DRYING IT OUT...THIS IS BETTER THAN SHAMPOO &amp; BUTTER CREAM DAILY MOIST.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used this product before. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I’ve been looking for an alternative to Wen and I think I found it. I love this stuff. It’s not as thick as Wen so you’ll have to use more and there’s no tingly feeling on your scalp. Even though you use more – at the price you can’t go wrong. My hair felt softer and shinier after using this. And the coconut smell is great. I also feel like I don’t need to wash my hair as often as I would with regular shampoo. I can normally wash my hair every 2 days (wash it on Friday and not wash again until Monday) – with Wen and this was just about the same, I might have been able to push it another day. And I have very oily hair.  I’ve been a diehard Wen girl for yearsss, (just bought 6 bottles last week) but it’s getting expensive and I hate the automatic shipments. With this Coconut Cowash I think I might not be a Wen girl anymore. After all my bottles are gone. (lol)</li>
    <li> I live by this stuff! LOL... I condition my hair with it... as well as co-wash and it leaves my hair soft and manageable when it come time for detangling!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product !!!! co-workers notice changeling my hair before u could really see it - highly recommended and super easy to use!!! forget about costly others out there !!! will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a Must Have Beauty Product!  I absolutely love this hair product -- it has a nice smell and makes my hair easier to manage keeping my hair tangle free after usage Great product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of long, pretty thick, wavy/curly, color treated hair. I was looking for something to bring it back to life, as my split, crinkled ends and overall dry hair was driving me crazy. So I tried Wen via QVC. Went through the entire bottle, and truly did not feel like it did anything for my hair. It felt exactly the same as when I shampooed and conditioned with Dove. When the bottle ran out and I went back to Dove, however, my hair was NOT feeling the shampoo! It made my hair feel like straw. Going back to shampoo was no longer something I wanted to do. So I started looking for a cleansing conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank the way Wen does, and that worked better for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading so many rave reviews, I tried As I Am. I am on my 2nd tub and going back for more! This stuff is incredible. Cleanses wonderfully, coming from someone whose scalp gets oily in 2 days flat, softens beautifully, and unlike Wen, I truly felt like the texture of my hair has vastly improved using this cowash. Even my mom and sister were shocked at how soft this cowash made my loose, wavy hair feel. My sister picked some up at her local store and after having bleached her hair, she said this is the only thing that has made her hair soft again in only 1-2 uses. Plus, I have dyed red hair, and this helps me retain my color so much longer than shampooing. My red doesn&#x27;t fade the way it does even with the low sulfate stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love coconut, you&#x27;ll love the way this smells! It smells to me like a rich vanilla coconut with a light hint of citrus. It&#x27;s wonderful! If Wen did nothing for you, or if it&#x27;s just not feasible from a budget perspective, try this! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for hair. Time savings. Love the purchase. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great product light clean better than Wen for my dry red hair without weighing it down and definitely a better price.</li>
    <li> works well and goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need more than a dollop. My hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I happend to hear about an option to using shampoo to wash my hear so I decided to try it.  It was a challenge to fine products in my local stores but Amazon came through as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!!!  It cleans my hear with no residue left behind as well as adds moisture to my hear.  It also smells workderful!!!!  I fully intend to keep using the As I Am product line!</li>
    <li> Still have my bottle this is the best product ever</li>
    <li> I purchased this specifically to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is biracial and her hair is ringlet curly on the ends, but more dry and frizzy by the roots.  This co-wash left her hair feeling very soft and silky, and I found I didn&#x27;t need to use as much product in it afterwards to keep her curls intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this is that it is not a super efficient cleanser.  My daughter is 4, and many days comes home with sand in her hair from playing outside.  After using this the first time, I found all of the sand was still in her hair.  I ended up having to wash it again with shampoo, which removed it all.  For removing product from the hair, this is great.  But for played-hard-all-day-am-now-grimy hair, have to use a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use this off and on, and right now, it is what I use after shampooing my hair with the Jason Biotin Shampoo. I also use the Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner, which is lovely. I had tried this, as simply a cowash, but was not happy with the results. As an &amp;#34;after shampooing&amp;#34; conditioner, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is no longer falling out, thanks to the Jason Biotin Shampoo, and the As I Am Coconut CoWash seems to be the perfect compliment for my hair, when I use shampoo. I had to try it, again, as I had stopped using it for awhile, as a cowash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 62, I have long, &amp;#34;dark brown with a few gray hairs&amp;#34;, hair. The As I Am Coconut CoWash is a great conditioner for me, and I would have to say it is on a par with the Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this and love it so much that I got both of my parents (late 70&#x27;s) to use it too.  To illustrate how versatile this is, I have a lot of very thick, somewhat fine hair... my Mom has mild alopecia and very thin, wispy hair... my Dad is balding but what&#x27;s left is regular/healthy.  All three of us think this is the greatest hair product ever.  My hair is so clean, bouncy, and it feels so light after I wash it... and the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little like a mild soap. In fact, if you use it in a jacuzzi tub, you&#x27;ll get a bubble bath out of it. But it rinses clean from hair and skin (and tub) and I think my hair looks healthier than when I was using regular shampoo. No dander, even during winter.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again.  I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years but wanted to try a cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Left my hair next day greasy, lifeless, and leeched almost all of my beautiful new hair color out within days.</li>
    <li> My new all-time favorite condition wash! I use it about every other or every two days. Makes detangling so easy, leaves my hair feeling clean and soft!</li>
    <li> I used Wen for about 3 years. Good product but pricey. I like this product better. Great price and makes my hair shiny but not greasy feeling. I am 57 and have fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has been damaged by several dyes in the past few months. This stuff has made my hair feel better than ever.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite cleaning cream simply because of the packaging. Its hard to scoop out of the container and get on my head before it falls on the shower floor. Otherwise it works great and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great to cleanse my hair,  but it is very loose and you will waste some product in the shower or sink basin. Smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I watched a youtube review and thought why not try it. I&#x27;m always looking for new products until I find one that I&#x27;d really stick to for a very long time. This is it! I was sold! I used this co wash in between shampooing and it left my hair feeling so incredibly soft! It&#x27;s so rich and creamy. This makes me want to say bye bye to my other natural hair brands but first I&#x27;ll have to check out the rest of the product line to see if they&#x27;re as fabulous as the coconut co wash. It definitely deserves 5 stars because it worked very well with my hair type. On another note, it&#x27;s cheaper at Walgreens for only 7.99!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and the leave in conditioner for months. I really love the results, really. I have color treated, curly hair that in the past few years has gotten curlier and frizzier. I highly recommend this product for those reasons. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is quite difficult to travel with the jars. My trip to Tahiti resulted in the co-wash oozing out of the jar. Fortunately I had it double wrapped though the piece of plastic wrap between the lid and the jar did to prevent the oozing. Imagine washing your hair with a piece of plastic covered in the co-wash. I sent an email to the company but never heard back from them. My suggestion was to create a travel safe bottle similar to the leave-in conditioner. an 8 ounce bottle would be so much better.</li>
    <li> I like this SO much.  :-)  I&#x27;m a white girl with long, very fine, brittle hair that I pamper.  I&#x27;ve used other cleansing conditioner-type products in the past but I think this is my favorite - after the first use.  It rinsed out easily and did not leave residue at all...no heaviness or greasiness.  And, best of all, I put my hair up the day after I used this...and it was full of beautiful curls that lasted (!) when I took it down. :-)  It&#x27;s great stuff and not terribly expensive for as much as you get and comparing it to other brands.</li>
    <li> Loved this product the first time I used it.  Im a new naturalista and this has helped with my dryness issues.  My hair feels so soft afterwards I would recommend this product hands down. Makes for easy detangling and my curls look revived!</li>
    <li> My hair has body, sheen and softness.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to add to my hair care that didn&#x27;t require a full wash.  This product is perfect and works well on my hair type (4-4a). I also couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so I was happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I love this product thank you for getting it here so fast</li>
    <li> This is a must have, Use it weekly. I love the smell.  The only down fall I hate about it is I wish it could be in s bottle instead of the container. I love how it leaves my hair refreshed after each wash. I buy this at Walmart and target and it $7.99 there.</li>
    <li> I use this product frequently between my clarifying washes. The cowash is great for wash and go styles. It&#x27;s perfect for great curl definition and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s weighted with products.</li>
    <li> I recently started to go natural and did the &#x27;Big Chop&#x27; a few months ago. Since then, I&#x27;ve been trying out many different products to see which ones work best for my color treated, curly hair texture. I&#x27;ve been using the As I Am Twist Cream and decided to look at other products within that brand. For a while, I&#x27;ve seen and heard of people doing co-washes with conditioner versus using shampoo. But, I always figured that conditioner alone could not do the job of a shampoo. I understand that there are some shampoos out there that strips the hair of moisture/oils, etc. For that reason, I have at least tried to purchase shampoos that are sulfate-free, such as Carol&#x27;s Daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the product info and reviews for this co-wash, then decided to give it a try. First thing I noticed was how smooth it felt on my hair. I could also feel that it was actually cleaning the buildup from my hair and scalp. The best part of this cowash is it doesn&#x27;t tangle. Combing out my hair with this product is amazing! It makes the process so much easier than other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not totally sold on co-washing and may use shampoo occasionally. But, this Coconut CoWash will be a staple for my natural hair care products.</li>
