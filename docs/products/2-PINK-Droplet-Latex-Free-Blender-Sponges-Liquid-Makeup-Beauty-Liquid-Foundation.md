      <li>I was uncertain as to whether or not I&#x27;d like the sponges, considering they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Beauty Blenders, but honestly ...</li>

      <li>I am even more thrilled that I decided to purchase 2 sets of this.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite makeup tool.</li>

      <li>Will buy more when needed</li>
      <li>I still dampen them they work ok</li>
      <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s absorbs more make up</li>
      <li>:).</li>
      <li>I for sure recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know how confident about my makeup I would feel using these sponges.</li>
      <li>Work fantastic!</li>
      <li>That offered significantly more coverage.</li>
      <li>they are ok.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t order it again for sure.</li>
      <li>So glad the purchase came with 2, just in case</li>
      <li>I love how they feel.</li>
      <li>Love putting my makeup on using these sponges.</li>
      <li>Quality is okay</li>
      <li>Just as good as the real ones!</li>
      <li>I bought a beauty blender first, which I loved, except for the price.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend spending your money on a better makeup sponge.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure they work just fine.</li>
      <li>not really the greatest.</li>
      <li>If you want better coverage, use a light hand.</li>
      <li>Really good and fast deliver 😇😇😇</li>
      <li>super easy!  </li>
      <li>One good thing about this is that it came super early which is nice</li>
      <li>&amp; i guess the application is okay, nothing special.</li>
      <li>And after I washed it the first time it was mishappened and kind of falling apart.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>But they are dense and don&#x27;t rub on the skin smoothly and comfortably.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap like the price even when I dampened it.</li>
      <li>They are small, they fit in the palm of your hand, but they are great!</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick and that was nice but the whole quality of these sucked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly I recommend just buying the Original beauty blender from e-bay, Sephora or the BeautyBlender website and just shell out the money.</li>
      <li>I love them, definitely will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too sure they&#x27;re sponges to be exact.</li>
      <li>Ok for a more natural look.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s good for reaching those smaller areas like underneath the eyes.</li>
      <li>These are so much better than the real techniques sponges.</li>
      <li>a bummer to have to take back my review for a product I initially loved.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not too sure it blended much.</li>
      <li>These little sponges are magical, especially for the price, and allow me to apply my foundation flawlessly.</li>
      <li>I bought it because it was cheap and has a few good reviews</li>
      <li>I use a pretty full coverage foundation &amp;</li>
      <li>The sponges feel great but smells a little funny.</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t even the right color.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s cheap and it works pretty much the way it should which would merit it about 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>but it was less than pleasant.</li>
      <li>Quick mention is you need to dampen it before using it which is exactly like the real beauty blender.</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t bleed and very reasonable price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this blender. I&#x27;ve never used a real Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t really compare it, but for the money, this one worked really well. Make sure you wet the blender before use. Hold it under running water and give it about 10 good squeezes so that it soaks up the water. Squeeze the water out and then squeeze into a towel just to get the excess water out. It needs to be slightly damp, not wet! All in all, it&#x27;s a great blender!</li>
    <li> Super pink like the picture, and super soft! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I really like the pointy cone shape of this makeup sponges. You can apply makeup or powder around your eye area and they stay on and blend nicely over the skin. Also I love the fashionable hot pink color. The color doesn&#x27;t bleed and very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I really liked this. It definitely took a little while to get to me but when I received them they were in great condition. At first they are a bit tough but after a while of using them they do become more soft and spongy. I will be repurchasing not soon though since it does come with 2. Great price for good products (:</li>
    <li> not recommended.  Not soft and absorbent.  Terrible for foundation blending and application.  too stiff.</li>
    <li> nothing like a beauty blender! This is heavier and very hard to use compared to other sponges I have used.</li>
    <li> Really good and fast deliver 😇😇😇</li>
    <li> Great!!!! The shipping was really fast and once I used them they worked flawlessly!!! Make sure you wet them before applying makeup. I will not be paying $15 for one damn Beauty Blender anymore, I will continue to order these. They are just as good.</li>
    <li> I bought these once and they worked pretty well - they looked as pictured, expanded when wet, and did an OK job of applying makeup. My second order had 2 hard peachy pink colored sponges that didn&#x27;t expand when wet. They were also about 50% smaller than the first ones I ordered. I&#x27;m going back to the beauty junkees ones.</li>
    <li> Not pink, white/yellow looking super small and stiff. Will never repurchase.</li>
    <li> These got to me a lot faster than I thought they would! :D Very good at applying foundation. So glad the purchase came with 2, just in case I lose one or something happens to one. Very cheap, good quality and I definitely think I&#x27;ll be buying them again. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Dupe for the pricier makeup blenders.</li>
    <li> Very soft and squishy</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the $10 $15 ones. I recommend .</li>
    <li> Just received these makeup blenders. Kinda disappointed. They were not true to color, but rather a yellowish tan color instead, They are very small and do not expand when wet. I guess it&#x27;s good for reaching those smaller areas like underneath the eyes. It&#x27;s firm which is alright &amp; i guess the application is okay, nothing special. It was $3 so you kinda get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> these are terrible! I bought a beauty blender first, which I loved, except for the price. SO, trying to save a few bucks, I ordered these. They&#x27;re about half of the size of the beauty blender, and twice as hard. Like so hard, they don&#x27;t blend at all. Yes, I wet them first. They feels very plastic-y and just plain cheap. And they&#x27;re peach colored, not pink, as if that makes any real difference. Just saying. I got what I paid for, going to re-order the real thing from Beauty Blender.</li>
    <li> They are way too hard, even after you damp them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right but I feel like it&#x27;s absorbs more make up then it blends. Even after I&#x27;ve dampened it. And after I washed it the first time it was mishappened and kind of falling apart. The color also ran while washing, but I don&#x27;t mind that.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I don&#x27;t really use it much. I find myself sticking with my brushes to blend.</li>
    <li> If you plan to use this dry, you will enjoy it. I wanted to use it damp therefore I did not. You will feel no change when adding water. It does not soften and it does not expand. Save you money and go for the Real Techniques version.</li>
    <li> So disappointed on them😭</li>
    <li> I was uncertain as to whether or not I&#x27;d like the sponges, considering they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Beauty Blenders, but honestly ... I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the two. These little sponges are magical, especially for the price, and allow me to apply my foundation flawlessly. I prefer the smaller size of these to the larger Beauty Blender brand sponge, because I think it helps me to apply foundation to the creases around my nose, and the area beneath my eyes, with more ease. The two sponges I received were purple, not pink, but that&#x27;s fine. Who cares about color? All I care about is whether or not they work, and these sponges definitely do!</li>
    <li> These were, unfortunately, nothing like the beauty blenders. They didn&#x27;t get any larger or &#x27;bouncy&#x27; like they should have when soaked in water. Also, when used wet they absorbed all of the foundation and applied little to no product onto the face.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> These are way too stiff I tried blending my foundation with this and it felt like someone was punching me! Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. I am even more thrilled that I decided to purchase 2 sets of this. The price is excellent. I have not used the Beauty Blender as yet so I am unable to compare this item with the Beauty Blender. But so far this item works really well when applying makeup. It gives an airbrush finish. It is easy to clean. I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Thanks for your honesty!</li>
    <li> Fell apart the first time I used them I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these beauty blenders you definitely get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Great for concealer! A but hard but overall very useful</li>
    <li> These work well according to my wife.  These grow when wet</li>
    <li> These took forever to arrive. They weren&#x27;t even the right color. Super small. Quality is okay I guess. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this in the mail only to be disappointed when I used it. It soaks up all my foundation &amp; leaves my skin wet. I use a pretty full coverage foundation &amp; when I use the beauty blender it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m putting on foundation. Not what I was expecting &amp; definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Way too rough on face</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Beauty Blender and a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Quick mention is you need to dampen it before using it which is exactly like the real beauty blender. It does not increase in size as it absorbs water. I like it because it&#x27;s cheap and it works pretty much the way it should which would merit it about 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had was the awful rubber smell it has which knocked it down to 3 stars. I didn&#x27;t really mind the smell when I was applying my makeup but then noticed my face makeup absorbed the rubber smell and I had to walk around smelling it all day!! I mean you get what you pay for with the cheapness. I&#x27;ll try to wash it with scented soap and hopefully the smell will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The scent never went away (I guess it&#x27;s just the material it&#x27;s made of) and while washing it I realized that the soap suds NEVER END. It&#x27;s almost impossible to completely get all the soap out of it and I end up just letting it dry with suds still coming out. I&#x27;ve tried to squeeze it all out but it takes so long I develop arm cramps later in the day. Even my boyfriend tried for me and complained haha. It&#x27;s very dense and not too soft or squishy. It&#x27;s a decent applicator for the price but I finally broke down and bought the real beauty blender which should arrive soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I recommend just buying the Original beauty blender from e-bay, Sephora or the BeautyBlender website and just shell out the money. Saves a lot of hassle. I purchased mine on e-bay for $13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is worth the price considering how much the competitors price the original product with only the small downside is the scent (which in all honesty is probably fixable by the consumer if needed and definitely fixable by the manufacturer)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all. The shipping was quick and that was nice but the whole quality of these sucked. I&#x27;m sorry. I even soaked them in water and they are just SO hard. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but I honestly would rather go buy the Real Techniques Blending Sponge for $7 rather then 2 bad quality ones for $3. Just my opinion. I would give this 0 Stars, but I had to select a star.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t how long you have to hold it underwater to actually get it to expand but mine didn&#x27;t do anything maybe an inch of growth. I&#x27;m a beauty advisor and freelancer of make up and I will stick to my $20.00 Beauty Blender. One good thing about this is that it came super early which is nice and that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m not gonna convince you to be a beauty blender at sephora but check it out, have them demonstrate on you how beautifully it works. Just my opinion. :).</li>
    <li> The sponges ended up being a disappointment. I thought they would expand once wet but they do not. One of them is really hard while the other is softer. Unfortunately a miss for me.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the real ones!</li>
    <li> These are horrible makeup sponges, they do not grow when wet and they are super hard.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of other reviews and because they are so cheap, but I love them!!! I&#x27;m actually placing an order for more. They are small, they fit in the palm of your hand, but they are great!</li>
    <li> Ok for a more natural look. Seems to absorb foundation. If you want better coverage, use a light hand. I ordered a similarly priced one from chop mall? That offered significantly more coverage. I would not order these again</li>
    <li> I love it! The application is really nice. Flawless! It allows me to reach the creases very well and evenly. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The sponges feel great but smells a little funny. Can&#x27;t really complain for this price. They mailed me the wrong color but quickly compensated. Good product</li>
    <li> So much smaller then I expected I was very disappointed.  The sponges looked a bit dirty they were also yellow not pink. Applying the makeup with these sponges I didn&#x27;t like at all! They do not blend your makeup well and finally the picture is false advertisement. If you want something like the beauty blender I DO NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> The small size of them doesn&#x27;t bother me as much because it can get into those hard to reach places. But the pale peach color is awful and they didn&#x27;t come with the plastic wrap around them which actually bothered me a lot...completely unprofessional. Definitely gonna have to wash these before I put them on my face. You should maybe consider changing the picture considering the fact that, that is not what you&#x27;re paying for..false advertisement is a no no.</li>
    <li> It was cheap like the price even when I dampened it.</li>
    <li> These work just as needed but they are really small. I expected them to be a bit bigger. But either way they get the job done.</li>
    <li> AWESOMENESS :) will buy them in the future any time. So much easier to apply make up.</li>
    <li> Waste of money;!!! They are super small and don&#x27;t do anything!!! Day not even pink!!!</li>
    <li> small but really good but they take in alot of product and thats the only down side ( yes i drench it in water and sqeeze all access water) will be buying again !</li>
    <li> they are smaller than my usual beauty blenders which makes it easier for under my eyes!</li>
    <li> as expected. thank you</li>
    <li> Work fantastic! Definitely great for the price. I for sure recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal worth buying... Will buy more when needed</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not worth it ! Very tiny and stiff 👎👎</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! This is my favorite makeup tool. Beautiful, smooth blending capability. Love it even more than my expensive beauty blender.</li>
    <li> These blender sponges work great. I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> These work amazing. After purchasing these I will never apply my foundation with a regular brush.</li>
    <li> Just got home and they were waiting for me. I love how they feel. Haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use them yet. But I&#x27;m sure they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 2 pink droplet sponges and I received these around the time frame they said they would arrive. Although they are purple and not pink, not that I care much about the color. They are terrible makeup sponges. I&#x27;m not too sure they&#x27;re sponges to be exact. They did not enlarge when I wet them. Although they did hold water, which is the job of a sponge really. They are a very hard &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; as well. Pressing the makeup onto my face wasn&#x27;t painful but it was less than pleasant. The sponge just didn&#x27;t give like you would expect when being pressed. I&#x27;m also not too sure it blended much. It may have gotten the job done but I don&#x27;t know how confident about my makeup I would feel using these sponges. Overall I would recommend not buying these and looking somewhere offline where you can feel the texture of the sponge for yourself. This purchase was just under $3 so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
    <li> They blend great. It&#x27;s really firm but that&#x27;s a positive for me. Only negative is it does not get bigger when wet it. I still dampen them they work ok</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the real techniques sponges. They are perfection! I am prob going to buy another set so I can go longer in between washes for my brush sets and my sponges. I love love love these. One sponge is softer and the other one is more firm so u get two great sponges for a really good price. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDATED REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these sponges and while the first set was amazing the second set was horrific! I am not sure what changed or what happened Because  The second set I got was harder than a rock (even when water was applied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were absolutely awful!&lt;br /&gt;Again I sincerely have no clue how the first time I purchased thes they were soft fluffy and bouncy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the next time I order a set&lt;br /&gt;I got sent beauty rocks the second time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL! SAVE YOUR MONEY! I no longer recommend. I am disappointed I had to re review this product so people can be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a bummer to have to take back my review for a product I initially loved. Someone messed with what used to be a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get you a better blender this one is not it</li>
    <li> First, they look nothing like the color that is displayed they are a very light pale pink color. Second, this things are so so small and they do NOT expand when wetting they remain the same size. I do not recommend this product if you&#x27;re wanting to apply foundation as it does not cover a lot of area and is very stiff. It would work just fine for under the eye for powder dry.</li>
    <li> Great just as pictured</li>
    <li> This little eggs (as my daughter calls them) are good and make applying my foundation, concealer, cream blush and even my  banana powder super easy!  They are not as soft as a beauty blender, BUT they get the job done! The price is the best thing!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever pay 20 bucks for ONE Beauty Blender!  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Texture was not similar to a beauty blender and does not work wet.</li>
    <li> These are closer in texture to a Beauty Blender but still not quote the real thing. They expand in size but don&#x27;t give that truly airbrushed look and feel. In a pinch though they aee great backups.</li>
    <li> They worked exactly like theyre supposed to and for a great price!</li>
    <li> They came two days after my wedding that I wanted to use them for although I ordered them over a month ago. They&#x27;re also incredibly tiny. They&#x27;re not pink but the color wasn&#x27;t that big a deal.</li>
    <li> One came like a rock, very very hard</li>
    <li> These are super hard and don&#x27;t absorb water at all. Not worth the $3. I threw them away.</li>
    <li> Extremely small, pale peach in color, don&#x27;t expand when wet/damp, and very hard. I was super disappointed, especially seeing as how a lot of people had good things to say. What the hell happened????</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars than would have. Is so hard even when it was run under water. It did get slightly larger once wet but as I said it was still very stiff and I couldn&#x27;t use it on my face. I bought it because it was cheap and has a few good reviews but I regret that purchase. I strongly recommend spending your money on a better makeup sponge.</li>
    <li> I got purple ones actually but that is fine with me.  Purple is my favorite color and I don&#x27;t care for pink.  But they are dense and don&#x27;t rub on the skin smoothly and comfortably.  My daughter has similar ones that are more airy and compressible which makes them work really well on blending jobs.&lt;br /&gt;I will use these purple ones to rest my forehead on when I fall asleep at my desk.</li>
    <li> amazing product!!!!  i am buying again!  so soft and cleans well with just soap and water!  great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Love putting my makeup on using these sponges.</li>
    <li> Ordered  the item on July 7th,  received on the 26th. I did expected the long shipping period since it came from overseas.  But the problem is the items were not described as they were color wise. I guess lots of other customers had the same problem. And the items are very hard compare to other product I bought before. Won&#x27;t order it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love them, definitely will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> These Items were what I ordered. After ordering I read the reviews, and there were a lot of bad ones. For some people it was that they didn&#x27;t wet the sponges to blend out their makeup, and others said the sponge fell apart or was tiny/hard, etc.. I can say this product is correctly advertised. It is a lot like the Beauty Blender, so similar in fact that I would never let one of my friends spend almost $20 on one, I&#x27;d tell them to go here!</li>
    <li> Awesome! The shipping was fast and they work so well. My makeup has never been so flawless!</li>
    <li> These work really well for how little they cost! I went to Claire&#x27;s and they had the same ones for 5 bucks a pop! I&#x27;m so glad I got these!</li>
    <li> yecht....not really the greatest. they are ok.</li>
