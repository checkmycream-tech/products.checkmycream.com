      <li>Fantastic fragance.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap</li>

      <li>I have read some reviews indicating that the cologne is not the original product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks to me i didn&#x27;t received the original product or the damaged or expired one.</li>
      <li>No alcohol smell when first applied like many.</li>
      <li>Comes in original packaging.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t worth even CENT !</li>
      <li>you want something more mature, that goes well with suit and tie or a very special dinner with your girl, try The one gentlemen.</li>
      <li>Price was good compared to those found at my local mall.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is sensational had smelled in brazil and is not the same.</li>

      <li>Good for the price fresh for regular use.</li>

      <li>purchased perfumes earlier from Amazon and was very very satisfied, may be got unlucky</li>
      <li>I enjoy this fragrance and find it much more alluring than Light Blue, which gets lots of D&amp;G sales in colognes.  </li>
      <li>Smells good all day long.  </li>
      <li>I own several different colognes and this is currently in my Top 3 favorite to wear.</li>
      <li>and my wife absolutely loves it, so how can I complain??!!</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use day or night.</li>
      <li>, you feel confident, masculine but not overloaded or overdone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so worth it</li>
      <li>The key to getting an original product is to make sure the product says &amp;#34;ships and sold by Amazon&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>He receives endless compliments, I should be more jealous :) .</li>
      <li>excellent long lasting scent not too strong not too soft very noticeable would recommend to any dolce n gabbana fan</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice smell, but it just doesn&#x27;t last or project very well.</li>
      <li>First tried the same in Macys and Ulta, I liked the perfume very much and lasted whole day.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>That said, I would highly recommend Sport for any man who wants a clean, cool and sweet, yet masculine fragrance for daytime or spring/summer use.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>the product itself is okay, the problem is that the webpage shows that this item is eligible for the prime 2-day shipping, however, it is totally misleading and the truth is that it took 6 days to deliver!</li>
      <li>If it says: &amp;#34; sold by Joe&#x27;s Fragrance and fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;, then it is possible that it may not be original!</li>
      <li>Its is light enough to 13 years to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Absolute rubbish.</li>
      <li>price is economic.</li>
      <li>A very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell without being overbearing and/or obnoxious.</li>
      <li>Fresh and powerful scents that make women heads turn and give you a second glimpse.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but it would be even nicer if it lasted longer, long enough to get compliments.</li>
      <li>Product does&#x27;t have genuine and long smell.</li>
      <li>This is a great addition to a fragrance collection, but it is not incredibly versatile.  </li>
      <li>This may be true if you buy from a third party seller.</li>
      <li>Only flaw is that fades away too quick.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for all occasions.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is an absolute fake and only last 10 minutes at best.</li>
      <li>Due to the light body of this fragrance, as I mentioned, I would recommend daytime use in the spring or summer.  </li>
      <li>Was testing the waters with new cologne and this one I did get a lot of complements on.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Light but last long and have a lingering scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> the product itself is okay, the problem is that the webpage shows that this item is eligible for the prime 2-day shipping, however, it is totally misleading and the truth is that it took 6 days to deliver! very disappointed!  and you can still see the prime eligibility of this item...such a lie</li>
    <li> The fragrance is excellent and stays on for a long time. Will recommend it to anyone who enjoys a long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> Fast shiping !!!!! Excellent</li>
    <li> Item as described and arrived before estimated delivery date. Bought this item for my dad and he loves it. Seems to last very long but is not too strong at the same time. Price was good compared to those found at my local mall. Would buy from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at Macys for about double the price on here... I used it all, but the NOTICEABLY scent would only last around 10-20 minutes. the second you go outside, its gone. Disappointed, I paid about 75 dollars for this. The scent is nice but it would be even nicer if it lasted longer, long enough to get compliments. 2 stars</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this sent! And the price for this product.... Two thumbs up! I was worried about it making it through the delivery processed unscathed, but all was well!</li>
    <li> I am extremely dissatisfied with this product. Shortly after it is sprayed the scent disappears completely. Might as well have been water in the bottle</li>
    <li> smells light but good when he works out or plays basketball.  Dolce is normally a go to cologne for the summer but cool to wear all year round.</li>
    <li> It smells so good.  I bought for my husband and he loved it.  He gets so many compliments. .. I recommend this product. .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I like It.&lt;br /&gt;The price is economic. I will recomend to my friends to buy&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot of</li>
    <li> excellent long lasting scent not too strong not too soft very noticeable would recommend to any dolce n gabbana fan</li>
    <li> I regret buying this scent.  I feel like it might be a fake.  I&#x27;ve never had a cologne where the scent was so weak. I couldn&#x27;t smell anything as I sprayed it on myself. It was like spraying myself with water myst.  I sprayed it on some paper and could barely smell it.  I got a resounding &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; when I asked my co-workers if they could smell it on me.  In a word - Worthless.</li>
    <li> Absolute rubbish. Product does&#x27;t have genuine and long smell. It doesn&#x27;t worth even CENT ! Do not buy. It is waste of money. Wasn&#x27;t expecting this quality from amazon.com !</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this for about a year and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Doesn&#x27;t have an overly strong scent, but the scent stays with him all day.  Smells good all day long.  No alcohol smell when first applied like many.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointing with this product, it smells alcohol only, perfume last only for minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I First tried the same in Macys and Ulta, I liked the perfume very much and lasted whole day.&lt;br /&gt;But the one which i got here, it&#x27;s not even smells 2% of which i tested and liked in store.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased perfumes earlier from Amazon and was very very satisfied, may be got unlucky this time.&lt;br /&gt;Looks to me i didn&#x27;t received the original product or the damaged or expired one.</li>
    <li> I am not much of a \\&quot;cologne guy\\&quot; but this stuff does the trick,  one (1) or two (2) sprays and you will be good to go, all day. A very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell without being overbearing and/or obnoxious. Highly recommended for all occasions. Great price here on Amazon, as well.</li>
    <li> this is a very light, fresh, with citrus hints, thats perfect for day use, you feel confident, masculine but not overloaded or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something more mature, that goes well with suit and tie or a very special dinner with your girl, try The one gentlemen.</li>
    <li> It smells so good so worth it I highly recommend  it is the best smelling cologne ice ever bought by it</li>
    <li> excellent, very goodexcellent, very good</li>
    <li> It is very nice day and night mens cologne.  Its is light enough to 13 years to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It longlasting roughfly 6 hours stays on you with original scent</li>
    <li> Save your money! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews even when dissatisfied; however this purchase left me no choice. This fragrance is an absolute fake and only last 10 minutes at best.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> This was a good price and quality purchase.  I love the scent and it was a great gift item.  Comes in original packaging.</li>
    <li> Interesting but not what the description of the scent entailed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice smell, but it just doesn&#x27;t last or project very well. it&#x27;s a nice fresh aquatic smell but there are much better options</li>
    <li> This is not a strong over powering cologne. Light but last long and have a lingering scent. For the price I got it for it was hard to turn it down. Dept. store sells for double the cost.</li>
    <li> Initially I didn&#x27;t like the D &amp; G the one sport because I felt the scent faded once I wore it. I was mistaken because the scent lingered in my clothes even after washing them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s goes well with casual clothes.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance and it was a third the price on Amazon then at Macy&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance on my husband! He receives endless compliments, I should be more jealous :) . It&#x27;s the perfect fresh, manly, sporty scent that I love. It lasts through the day, but not in a cloying way.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is lost very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell, really manly, perfect for those long hot days at work. Like Mike said &#x27;&#x27;Quality ingredients in a Quality cologne.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I own several different colognes and this is currently in my Top 3 favorite to wear. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and I love the way he smells when he wears it!! The bottle is nice and the smell is even better!</li>
    <li> I am very picky with any colognes/aftershaves I might wear and I would probably only wear &amp;#60;5% of what is sold today.  That said, I would highly recommend Sport for any man who wants a clean, cool and sweet, yet masculine fragrance for daytime or spring/summer use.  This is a great addition to a fragrance collection, but it is not incredibly versatile.  Due to the light body of this fragrance, as I mentioned, I would recommend daytime use in the spring or summer.  The soft, subtle candy-like sweet notes from this fragrance warrant use in the warmer months.  I enjoy this fragrance and find it much more alluring than Light Blue, which gets lots of D&amp;G sales in colognes.  Overall, a wonderful light-bodied, yet substantial (enough) fragrance that is quite approachable and invigorating for a gent with taste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fake, I spend my money with this they just sent  me the empty bottle.</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; he loves it. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, scent stays all day. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Was testing the waters with new cologne and this one I did get a lot of complements on.</li>
    <li> Love to use it during the sunny days.</li>
    <li> This smell is very clean. It&#x27;s the best scent from the Dolce and Gabbana brand, in my opinion. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Awesome price and size. This was the best deal found. Would recommend this product to anyone looking. Thank you for the deal</li>
    <li> Seems like a knock off product or stale fragrance being sold past its normal shelf life .Quite disappointing really .Not a bad scent.Simply vanishes after a short time. Wish I could get my money back .&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product !</li>
    <li> I like this scent on him better than his famed Prada cologne. It&#x27;s not too overpowering or too loud. I love it on him.</li>
    <li> Light and sexy. Good for anytime of the day. He liked it alot. I recommend it and would buy it again</li>
    <li> pure alcohol or fragrance does not last 25 minutes.The fragrance is sensational had smelled in brazil and is not the same.</li>
    <li> Hubby&#x27;s Christmas gift!  Perfect fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have read some reviews indicating that the cologne is not the original product. This may be true if you buy from a third party seller. The key to getting an original product is to make sure the product says &amp;#34;ships and sold by Amazon&amp;#34;. If it says: &amp;#34; sold by Joe&#x27;s Fragrance and fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;, then it is possible that it may not be original! Note: -I referred to Joe&#x27;s Fragrance as an illustration  only.</li>
    <li> Light and manly! I wear it everyday!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragance. Great for everyday use day or night. Fresh and powerful scents that make women heads turn and give you a second glimpse. Only flaw is that fades away too quick.</li>
    <li> Great price and great scent on this. I have gotten so many compliments on this and my wife absolutely loves it, so how can I complain??!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good product</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Macy&#x27;s thinking that Amazon&#x27;s stock was counterfeit due to a few reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t last long. Well, to my surprise, the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; indeed does not last long on you. It only smells nice on paper or at the beginning, but in less than an hour, the fragrance goes away. :( Has the potential, but it needs improvement. I would go with Chanel Allure Sport.</li>
    <li> Nice, fresh scent. Would recommend. However, the cologne doesn&#x27;t hold up that well. The scent fades rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Good for the price fresh for regular use. Moreover, it provides a sens  of elegance when ask for the brand.</li>
