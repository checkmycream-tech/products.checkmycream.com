<li> To start: I&#x27;m a Latin/Caucasian mixed girl with looser, type 3 curly hair (not kinky) living in a dry desert.</li>
<li> I have very dry hair, so I need the extra moisture this product provides.</li>
<li> I went natural 3 years and this has been one of few products that have helped my hair to grow and doesn&#x27;t affect my psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve struggled for months to get soft shiny hair that wasn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
<li> so it isn&#x27;t so dry.</li>
<li> For me (dry climate) the mineral oil is beneficial.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it on wet &amp; dry</li>
<li> I gave this to my granddaughter because she has very dry hair</li>
<li> But if you&#x27;re careful (and it takes a bit to figure it out), you can use it and it works well.</li>
<li> Not much of a fan..</li>
<li> it not only moisturizes but it gives it the look of moisture without over doing which I love because I hate having greasy hair its nasty feeling to me anyways it doesn&#x27;t overdo when it comes to moisturizing great stuff</li>
<li> and I use it on wet hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few different ways in the past (on DRY hair) but it has left my hair greasy.</li>
<li> In the older version of this product there contained no mineral oil (which is awful for african american hair), but in this new version they put in a load of mineral oil (second ingredient)!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I use this every other day after washing my hair and drying it off with a towel.</li>
<li> I have a very thick Afrolike natural hair</li>
<li> I have very thick natural Black hair.</li>
<li> This does not weigh down my curls</li>
<li> I have biracial hair and it smoothed it down-</li>
<li> I have medium thick curly hair which was a bit dry, which is why I started using this</li>
<li> my hair started feeling a little bit stronger.</li>
<li> The Cantu line is one of very few product lines that I can use due to having psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
<li> of course if you empty a gallon of oil on your head it will remove any frizz , !!!</li>
<li> I use it year round.</li>
<li> There are a few stores that still carry it</li>
<li> Not sure how she likes it.</li>
<li> and I have never experienced a product like this one.</li>
<li> It unfortunately, was not stopping effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product is way too oily, weighs hair down and leaves it looking greasy and nasty.</li>
<li> I know there are bad reviews</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, and it smells good!</li>
    <li> If you look on the bottle it says \\&quot;New\\&quot; at the top. In the older version of this product there contained no mineral oil (which is awful for african american hair), but in this new version they put in a load of mineral oil (second ingredient)! I wish I had known he ingredients for this before hand, because I never would have bought it if it contained mineral oil. I guess I won&#x27;t be buying any Cantu products ever again. I have it two starts for the smell and viscosity of the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot;. That&#x27;s at least two things that I liked about it.</li>
    <li> I love all of my Cantu products</li>
    <li> I would never recommend it to any one, it&#x27;s so oily , that when you apply it on your hair, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve not washed your hair for years, it says it&#x27;s anty-frizz ! of course if you empty a gallon of oil on your head it will remove any frizz , !!!</li>
    <li> Works well with my natural hair and keeps my hair shiny and smelling. Great</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I alternate this product in my hair care routine. A quarter size works for my entire head. I have very dry hair, so I need the extra moisture this product provides. I use it up to twice a week.</li>
    <li> To start: I&#x27;m a Latin/Caucasian mixed girl with looser, type 3 curly hair (not kinky) living in a dry desert. I use this product as a sealer after a leave-in conditioner and it&#x27;s helped keep my curls soft. Plus, when I \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; from hair gel I do not have to use any oil. For me (dry climate) the mineral oil is beneficial. I&#x27;ve used this product a few different ways in the past (on DRY hair) but it has left my hair greasy. Using it as I&#x27;ve described as resulted in soft, moisturized curls. It&#x27;s cheap, so give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have been looking hi and low for something that will actually moisturizer my scalp and strengthen my hair. Optimum just wasn&#x27;t working for me, so I switched to this instead, and the difference cantu made in my hair was unbelievable. My hair not only smelled great, but it was actually moisturized, my scalp also itched a hell of lot less, and I am pretty my hair started feeling a little bit stronger.</li>
    <li> This product is way too oily, weighs hair down and leaves it looking greasy and nasty. its too oily to be a DAILY moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this every other day after washing my hair and drying it off with a towel. I put a bit in the palm of my hand, and if it&#x27;s too much, I press my hands on a towel so it&#x27;s not too much. It IS greasy if you use too much and it will look like you don&#x27;t wash your hair. But if you&#x27;re careful (and it takes a bit to figure it out), you can use it and it works well. It keeps my hair moisturized and shiny between washes and really helps to define my curls. I have medium thick curly hair which was a bit dry, which is why I started using this and it&#x27;s worked well for me. But you have to be careful with how much you use.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and it not only moisturizes but it gives it the look of moisture without over doing which I love because I hate having greasy hair its nasty feeling to me anyways it doesn&#x27;t overdo when it comes to moisturizing great stuff give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff seriously. I have a very thick Afrolike natural hair and I thought I&#x27;d never find anything to help the dryness. I&#x27;ve struggled for months to get soft shiny hair that wasn&#x27;t stiff. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days and I&#x27;ve noticed a change already that&#x27;s why I went and got the Cantu Co Wash conditioner and the leave in repair conditioner. They&#x27;re all great. The daily moisturizer is a bit oily and greasy at times but if you have dry hair like mine my hair absorbed all of it. I spray my hair with water as soon as I get up and before bed and apply the moisturizer. I love this stuff so much.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter because she has very dry hair and she wears the braids and twists a great  deal of the time and she can use this to keep her hair moisturized.  Not sure how she likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturiser, you can put it on at any time during the day on your ends, it came in the post all the way to me from Australia. I have biracial hair and it smoothed it down- however it is flammable, make sure you don&#x27;t go near a camp fire with it on!</li>
    <li> I had dreads for over seven years and did not want to use gel on my hair.  The moisturizer kept my hair light and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been a naturalista since about 2009/2010 and I have never experienced a product like this one. It smells great and it allows my hair to feel silky and smooth. It brings out my hair&#x27;s natural curl pattern which I really didn&#x27;t know I could even get. I have been using it since summer time and haven&#x27;t stop using it since. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick natural Black hair. I used this product for two weeks and didn&#x27;t really like it. At the end of the day it left my hair felt dry not moisturized.</li>
    <li> Perfect oil for my extremely dry curly hair</li>
    <li> One of the best mosturizers for everyday.  This does not weigh down my curls and I use it on wet hair and it dries very nicely.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair nice and shiny. Great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I had this product for some time and just used it last night. It really left my hair moisturized, shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> perfect for people with thick hair who want to decrease volume.  Now i personally love volume and my daughter has the same hair, however, she&#x27;s three, so i use it to weigh down her hair when braiding/twisting :)</li>
    <li> Great product for my hair. I dye my hair, this product helps a lot so it isn&#x27;t so dry. I use it year round.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!! I&#x27;ve used it on wet &amp; dry (mostly wet) hair with great results. Bought it in store &amp; will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so soft and smooth! Great Product!</li>
    <li> Not much of a fan..but ok product</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  Will continue to be my primary moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I give this product 1 million stars!! I&#x27;ve been natural for almost two years and I love love this moisturizer!! I know there are bad reviews but if you are thinking of purchasing this you should! You&#x27;ve got to try it for yourself as I did! My hair is so soft! I put it on my hair every night! I first spray with a little water,apply the moisturizer and then apply coconut oil! I normally two strand twist and the next morning my hair is so soft! Order it! Trust me!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!!!!! Due to illness, my hair had become dry, brittle and was coming out by the come full.  My grand daughter suggested Cantu.  She is interested in  all things natural hair.  I had never heard of this product, was using another natural hair moisturizer.  It unfortunately, was not stopping effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIRST time I applied Cantu there was a noticeable difference in the texture, feel and the look of my hair.  My hair has grown at least seven (7) inches, the balding spot is almost gone, last but not least the fullness and soft texture of my hair is returning.</li>
    <li> Oil moisturizer for the hair.  It does a good job of softening the hair and making it more manageable.</li>
    <li> The Cantu line is one of very few product lines that I can use due to having psoriasis on my scalp. The Shea butter keeps my hair moisturized and soft. I went natural 3 years and this has been one of few products that have helped my hair to grow and doesn&#x27;t affect my psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy my products online since a lot of the stores in Seattle area have stopped selling this line and replaced it with the Shea Moisture line, which my psoriasis doesn&#x27;t like. There are a few stores that still carry it but it only one or two products from Cantu</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who wears her hair in a natural style. She loves it and it really does moisterize her hair. Cantu Shea Oil Moisterizer is a really good product and I&#x27;d definitely would purchase from this seller again.</li>
