<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this lotion. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love the lotion. It is gentle and great for my highly sensitive skin. My skin absorbs it quickly, with no greasy feeling or slippery skin after it is applied (even generously). The moisturizing effect lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, though. Several times I&#x27;ve had problems with the pumps on the bottles that were shipped: either I could not get them to open properly, or they opened during shipping and some of the lotion leaked into the packaging. This happened on a few occasions, not every time. It&#x27;s just something to watch for and the reason I did not give the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin as she has severe eczema and does not have all the potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> My wife found this product originally at a TJMAX store,  She loved the product but they had no more so we had to go searching. She loves it and gives to her sisters, mom, daughter and friends when they need it,,  Works well and soaks into the skin very quickly. Is not greasy and works well...</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the consistency and love the fact that it&#x27;s non-toxic and safe for the whole family. We use this as our baby lotion, too! Works great and lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I picked up one of the smaller bottles of this at Whole Foods yesterday because I didn&#x27;t want to use my organic scented hand creme all over my body.  My skin is not a fan of dry weather anymore as I get older and I live in a desert.  Bad combination.  I&#x27;ve also decided in the last few months that I will no longer be using things that have petroleum and parabens.  Alba does not use either one in this lotion.  The lotion soaked in quickly and even after the first use I could feel a difference.  24 hours after purchasing it the cracked spot on one of my knuckles is starting to heal and does not feel like sand paper.  I will without a doubt be getting the 32oz bottle.</li>
    <li> The product is a great moisturizer for the hands &amp; feet, but not for the body. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize the body at all. I&#x27;ve used an extra amount too &amp; that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
    <li> This may be good lotion, but I will not use it because I really disslike the scent.  I tried giving it to my mother, but she wont use it for the same reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years with great pleasure (even when it contained parabens) and am terribly dismayed that it has changed into yet another ho-hum product. The old one had glorious slip, perfect penetration and a delightful light scent for massaging clients. This new one has little slip at all, little penetration, and necessitates using twice the amount of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT reorder it again. Yet another perfect product bites the dust probably in the name of money. Frankly, I would pay more for the old, original product. Shame on Alba/Hain/Celestial Co. I will complain directly to them as well - have done so in the past as they changed/ruined another product that I&#x27;d enjoyed for years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand of lotion on my body...it&#x27;s a great product. This is a good value, as it has natural ingredients, and a silky smooth feel that hydrates my skin. There is no offensive odor. I also find it&#x27;s less expensive to buy through Amazon, than in the stores. This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It has a very nice fragrance, and it is not oily or greasy at all. It is also very moisturizing. I have already purchased 2 bottles and am about ready to purchase my third. (I ues it everyday after I shower).</li>
    <li> This product has a really bad smell. I got a headache with its strong smell. My kids first reaction to its smell was \\&quot;eeoo, yucky\\&quot;. Check out its smell in a store if you are planning to buy this product.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Absorbs well and helps dry skin. The scent is more neutral than anything else. Would be better if it were scented like cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion! It truly moisturizes deeply and is of high quality by a great company. Love the low price on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have never bought this before, or even used the brand but after reading most of the reviews decided to give it a try. Not impressed... It smelled alright (kind of manish though), but it was greasy and never absorbed. I gave it to a friend, and she didn&#x27;t care for it either... she gave it to her daughter, same result. I&#x27;m sad that I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> The lotions works wonderfully. My grandaughter has a skin condition. I would like to give a one star to Amazon shipping, although the container was in a plastic bag, a lot of the lotion leaked out because the cap was not secured and taped. It was quite messy with lotion leaking out.</li>
    <li> Alba is one of my favorite brands. I really like this moist lotion. It works better than many brands I have tried. I like the non scent and fresh scent. The ingredients are better quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used organic or mostly organic body lotion.  I have used Burts Bees Honey Milk lotion, Aveda&#x27;s body lotions, and many others but my friend in NY had Alba lotion and i&#x27;d never heard of it so of course used it while i was staying with her. I am totally converted.  There is something about this lotion that makes your skin almost tingly at first, but it absorbs quickly, makes skin feel smooth for over 24 hours, and smells light and doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfume smells. I was happy to find it at such a deal. I&#x27;ll be trying more alba products, as they are cheaper than aveda.</li>
    <li> This was not what I was lead to believe the product I wanted. I wanted the Original alba the one with the sweet almond oil in it. It is by far the better product. This ones leaves my skin feeling tacky and the scent is like something from a hospital...in other words nasty.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion by far and the scent is amazing!! I love it for myself and the rest of my family but the real miracle is that it has cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema which he has had for five years. We have tried everything including Aquaphor, hydrocorisone, etc. NOTHING has made his skin as soft and clear of scaly eczema like this product has. It is light and non-toxic and I think it has nourished his skin and maybe allowed it to finally \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; and produce its own natural oils or something. Anyway, we all love it. HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff and has a similar texture to Lubriderm.  I live in a dry climate and so this helps.  I like the fact it is unscented and so doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne.  It softens even alligator skin like mine and absorbs really well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy shine/film that cheaper lotions do.  Some really great ingredients in this, and even though it&#x27;s not 100% organic, still mostly natural.  Overall I&#x27;m impressed with Alba products as they&#x27;re not as pricey as some organic products that don&#x27;t deliver. Quality products at a decent price and not to \\&quot;foo-foo\\&quot; so even a  real man can use them.  My girlfriend nags me to use moisturizer and have to say my overall appearance has improved.  Hard to believe I was walking around like a lizard all these years. :)&lt;br /&gt;Like this stuff and won&#x27;t look any further..will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> While I am not sure if I have the new or old formula, I love this lotion (though it looks like the one pictured- maybe new formula?)!  Here is what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I use it morning and night- my skin is moisturized in between uses&lt;br /&gt;2. While I don&#x27;t have severely dry skin, typically I use lotion and then within a few hours my skin is dry and itchy again.  I do not have that problem with this lotion&lt;br /&gt;3. I use it during the summer- doesnt seem too heavy in the heat&lt;br /&gt;4. I use it in the winter- moisturizes enough even when my skin is dryer than normal&lt;br /&gt;5. While it&#x27;s a bit heavy when you first put it on- it absorbs extremely well.  This is the biggest positive for me, it doesnt leave a residue like other heavy duty lotions- which is actually a sign it isnt absorbing&lt;br /&gt;6. Fairly all natural and has few harmful chemicals in it.  It has a 5 rating on the goodguide.com for health and is low concern of harmful chemicals- major plus as I try to use all natural whenever possible!&lt;br /&gt;7.The scent is so mild you barely notice it when putting it on and once it is on you can&#x27;t smell anything.  The little scent that it does have, I really like!  I am pretty sensitive to scents and most of the time, even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lotions have a scent and it&#x27;s awful!  Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;8. Leaves my skin so soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is my favorite lotion, I can&#x27;t live without it.  If you have year-round dry skin, sensitive to scents, have sensitive skin and are looking for a lotion that is all natural/ organic- buy this lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking a while for a paraben-free, all natural lotion that moisturizes well and smells nice. This is the whole package! All of the other paraben-free lotions I have found do not do a good job at leaving your skin feeling moist and soft, but this one does! Love it!</li>
    <li> I switched over to Alba and I can say I am very satisfied.  The scent is light and gentle, not over-powering at all.  If you compare the scent to lotions like Olay Body Quench, Alba&#x27;s scent is actually a little underwhelming.  It is not too greasy for a lotion made for extreme dry skin, in fact I&#x27;d say the greasiness is a bit less than other \\&quot;maximum\\&quot; formula lotions like Lubriderm Advance Therapy.  In addition, Alba is all vegetarian, no parabens, and no animal testing - perfect for my peace of mind.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it is not too thick amd.very absorbent.  I also like that it has a neutral scent so that I can wear perfume with no worries.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite body lotion. I have year-round dry skin, and it is so hard to find a lotion that will moisturize my skin thoroughly without leaving \\&quot;build-up\\&quot;. The Very Emollient Body Lotion absorbs completely into my skin and moisturizes better than many other brands I have tried (Aveda, Lush, Bath &amp; Body Works etc...). The fact that it absorbs completely makes it perfect for use in the summer. It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t even have lotion on, just naturally healthy soft skin. I personally like the smell quite a bit. It smells like aloe vera and chamomile. It&#x27;s clean, light, and--as another reviewer mentioned--does not conflict with perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A Note to Buyers:&lt;br /&gt;While the price listed is the average price you will see this lotion being sold for, I have found it at many stores for less. Mostly at stores that specialize in organics. I&#x27;ve seen it being sold at Whole Foods for $15 (regular price, not sale). So, check your local co-op, or Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> Every winter my skin gets so dry and I battle red cracked skin on my hands and will get various rough patches on my body. My 3 year old daughter and 5 month old son have the same problem.  We&#x27;ve tried so many products such as Eucerin and coconut oil but nothing really worked.  Most would provide short term relief and were just too heavy.  However, after only several days of using this product I have seen a major improvement in all of our skin!  My infant son had a few rough patches on his upper arm and thigh.  After two days they are completely gone and he is back to silky smooth baby skin. I&#x27;ve been using on my hands every time I wash them and they are so much softer already.  The best part is that this product is lightweight and not greasy.  Unlike some of the other intensive lotions this one absorbs quickly and is easy to apply.  This is my new go to product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin so moisturized and soft.  I have never experienced a lotion like this.  Within 2 days of using it I saw and felt a huge difference in my skin.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy a different kind!</li>
    <li> I read the poor reviews for the new and improved formula, so I had low expectations. But I was desperate for an organic and natural alpha hydroxy lotion. I&#x27;ve been using Amlactin and Eucerin Plus to treat my dry skin after going to my dermatologist several years ago. I had alligator skin on my legs and these products originally helped peel the dry skin off so that I had nice smooth legs again.  But they smell terrible  and I&#x27;ve been trying to move away from petroleum products and other chemicals in my skin care. Over the years they have been less than effective and the scaly skin had come back this summer. So I was happily surprised when I tried alba because it actually smelled so much better than  Amlactin and Eucerin plus. Within a few days alba has begun to work wonders as the dead skin is peeling off, slowly revealing healthy rejuvenated skin. I wish I had tried to old product, because it sounded so great. But this one version works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product, great moisturizer and smells good not too strong. I&#x27;m hoping they have it in 1 gal.</li>
    <li> Because I am diabetic, I have very dry skin.  Finding a lotion that could keep my skin moisturized and feeling soft was a challenge until I found this lotion.  I put it on after my shower and don&#x27;t have to worry about dry, itchy skin for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion so much that I even bought two more bottles and had them sent to my mother and best friend. We are all Alba users for life now.</li>
    <li> Best lotion we&#x27;ve ever used and we live in a desert. The whole family uses it from newborn baby on up. Help clear up some serious dry patches on my 2 and 4 year old. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hands feeling very oily. It does otherwise work very well and the smell is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Despite all it&#x27;s &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; qualities i&#x27;ll probably seek an alternative the next time i need lotion, just because of the oily residue.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my skin. It is also somewhat greasy. It is going to take me a verrrry long time to use up this huge bottle.</li>
    <li> I had been using Alba Botanica very emollient body lotion for close to 25 years and loved it, in fact it was the only body lotion that I wanted to use because it made by skin silky soft, but now that they have IMPROVED the formula it&#x27;s not as good. I have stopped buying it, and will miss the old wonderful original formula!! The Shea Butter is not an IMPROVEMENT!! It feels pasty now.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, but my skin has been incredibly dry and I have not found that it relieves the itchiness that comes w my dry skin.</li>
    <li> this works so well as a body lotion, but it does very little to help my dry hands. i&#x27;m fairly sure that this product meets some pretty strict vegan/veg criteria for being cruelty-free, so i will just use a different lotion for my hands.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and hard water which was causing skin problems.  I tried this lotion to see if there really is a difference. This lotion is the best! It really absorbs into your skin, doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface as a protectant.  I had put off purchasing this product because it is a little pricey compared with the products you find at most stores.  However, I think it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Years ago, I used a Mill Creek lotion. They changed their formula and ruined it so I went looking for a new one. Eventually I found the Alba Botanica Extra Strength one and liked it. Better than the Mill Creek. I used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late last year I went in to buy my usual month&#x27;s supply from a local store (I have dry skin, and live in a dry area) and noticed the new bottle. Oh, my... what have they done? I bought one as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately noticed that it&#x27;s thicker. Well, I can deal with that; I use a little bit less. Overall, I think the new version works almost as well as the old version. No choice, though; I continued to use this new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day a few months later--March 2011 or thereabouts--I bought my usual supply, started using it, and noticed that it didn&#x27;t work at all. Very thin, no protection. Terrible. I called Alba Botanica&#x27;s 800 number, talked to a woman there and explained what the problem was. She had me check the date codes on the bottles and said she would check into it. She also sent coupons good for replacements. I waited a bit, then went and bought a new sample with the coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this one was a return to the decent new lotion. It works. I&#x27;d prefer the old version, but this works well enough. I&#x27;ve had no skin problems with it so it&#x27;s not clogging pores or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the reviewers who don&#x27;t like the new version, I&#x27;d suggest trying it again because there clearly were some production problems in the early months of manufacturing this. On the other hand, if you find a lotion you like better, please leave a comment here so I can try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, July 29:&lt;br /&gt;This product continues to be variable; I bought some a month ago and it is considerably less thick than the previous. It&#x27;s better than the bottle I got early this year, but not as good as the 2010 lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sent an Email to Alba about this, but received no response. I&#x27;ll be sampling new lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 2012 March 21:&lt;br /&gt;This product has become more consistent, and is still my favored lotion. I&#x27;ve tried some others and keep coming back to this. At this point it seems to be nearly as good as the 2009 version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alba Botanica sent me a letter explaining the changes they&#x27;d made, which I thought was a very courteous move. The changes were pitched as making the product more environmentally friendly, and better for one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, it&#x27;s the best lotion I know of. I&#x27;ve changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.ns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 2012 March 21:&lt;br /&gt;This product has become more consistent, and is still my favored lotion.

    <li> Non greasy, and over time really good for the kind. I have very dry skin and have seen very good results.</li>
    <li> Love this product! A nice thick lotion that absorbs easily into my skin. Its the only product I have tried that works year round to keep my eczema prone skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I buy it in bulk and use nothing else. I use it on my son after his baths. It is gentle yet very moisturizing. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Non greasy feel!  Amazing healing for super dry skin. My husband and I are both chefs and have dry, cracked knuckles frequently. This lotion heals it quickly without that burning, stinging feeling that most lotions provide. This is the only lotion we use on ourselves and our 2 1/2 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! After struggling with chapped, cracked hands for years, I decided it was from the hand creams I was using. Once I stopped them and started using this, my hands have healed and are doing great. Love the fragrance of this, too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle :)</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Cruelty free and no toxic chemicals. My skin is really dry and this is the only lotion that resolved my chronic itchy dry skin immediately. Delivery was fast!! Nice fragrance as well. very pretty smell.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is very silky and goes on easy.  It does not leave your skin with a film like some lotions for dry skin do.  It hydrates very well.  I read others&#x27; reviews about the consistency - my was well mixed and did not feel sandy.  I hope the next one will be from the same batch.</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION IS AWESOME IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A STRONG SCENT AND THE LOTION MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL LIKE YOU WE&#x27;RE IN HEAVEN! I LOVED THIS LOTION I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE! IF YOU BUY IT YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion during my pregnancy and it kept my skin super smooth. Not thick and goopy just very rich. The scent is not strong and my husband didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; when he used it either.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for very dry skin and gently for those with allergies and sensitive skin</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever!&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my cracked bleeding hands and they were restored with in a couple of days ! This is an awesome product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love Alba body lotion. Have used it for years. So far, it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is super dry and it really helps keep it from looking scaly and ashy.</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion about a year ago and love it!  I have really dry skin year-round and this formula is thick and creamy without being greasy.  I find it absorbs pretty quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for your lotion to dry.  I only have to use it once a day and it keeps my skin moisturized for about 24 hours.  Amazon&#x27;s price is about $4 cheaper than what I pay at the natural foods store.</li>
    <li> I really was excited to get this product.  But I must be honest.. it burns on any open skin or if my skin is too dry.. so bad that I have to wash it off.  I will use the rest of it.. but I may not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My go to lotion. I LOVE this product. Smooth &amp; creamy, not too heavy or too light. And the scent is nice &amp; mild.</li>
    <li> I love this product but both times I have ordered two big containers, one of them has come either broken or opened and have spilled both times I&#x27;ve ordered and received items.</li>
    <li> I love the product, the lotion is very good, but this is the second one that I received and it too is broken. The first one was so broken that the lotion was all over the package. The second one, the top is broken but operable. I am really bothered mostly that the packaging on the outside isn&#x27;t mauled or smashed so they shipped it this way to me.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a little thicker than the &amp;#34;non-maximum&amp;#34; version, but I love them both for different uses. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective lotion I have tried, bar none. I tried it on my face one night as my night cream was not handy. My face felt great &amp; I began using it morning and night &amp; my skins appearance improved (&amp; it was already really good). It is not at all greasy. I apply religiously after very shower head to toe. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Use it daily.  Has a nice light fresh smell and I do not like fragrances!  Everyone always comments on how well I smell and this is the only thing on me with a scent.</li>
    <li> A massage therapist/esthetician introduced me to this lotion.  She began stocking this for clients rather than a more expensive Dermalogica Body lotion.  It absorbs quickly even though it comes out of the container in thick blobs.  You don&#x27;t need much to do the trick.  Moisturizers and doesn&#x27;t build up or clog pores.  It&#x27;s got mild hydroxyl acid effects and kind of rebuilds and rejuvenates the skin.  It does good things for rashes and it&#x27;s very replenishing for my face after a lot of sun and wind...even better than my face creams.  I often press on a small amount of this on my face, and later apply my usual face day or night cream.  This lotion could be the only face cream you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that several times my purchase of this lotion comes with a pump that doesn&#x27;t work.  Save a good one in case you have the same problem with future purchases.  It also seems some batches are a bit thicker than others...not as consistent as years ago when I first started using this.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, this product, living in Arizona I need deep moisture, but hate feeling of so many others, smooth,, plump skin all over. People who I have gifted with have only been amazed at its ability to rehydrate the driest skin.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this lotion did not agree with my skin. I was super allergic, sadly. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many body lotions over the years. I tend to get bored using the same stuff with the same smells.&lt;br /&gt;But I always come back to this product. Just hydrates like nothing else without being greasy. I&#x27;m sixty-one and it keeps my skin supple where other shea butter cremes and such just end up drying it out in no time. Also love Alba sunscreens for the body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for a few years and I always find that it works really well.  The only drawback for me is that it has a sort of gardenia smell that is not my favorite.  I prefer to switch up smells and this one is a bit boring to use all the time.  I do use it more in winter when it is super dry here.  Overall, a nice product that does what it  says it does.</li>
    <li> May 8  2014.  Ms. LeeJai Cook, Roaring Springs TEXAS USA.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is very good.  It is exceptionally good for dry skin.  My only complaint is that the lotion is SO THICK  that I have to squeeze a little into a small container in order to use it.  Is it possible that the lotion is so thick because it sat on the shelf too long and thus became old and thick?&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will not buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> This body lotion has really hydrated my dry skin and it has a very light fragrance which is what I like in a body lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion! I love the fact that you can get such a big bottle at once, and also not have to pay a lot for it! My skin is always really dry, so I like to apply it right after I get out of the shower. It has a really nice scent that is not overpowering, especially I am a little allergic to fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s really thick and moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t make your skin &#x27;white&#x27; when applying which is a pet peeve of mine, I&#x27;m pale enough as it is, I don&#x27;t need my lotion making it worse! ;)&lt;br /&gt;I love that is doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals so I can feel free to moisture all day long with this lotion. It&#x27;s got a great light scent too, very faint but clean and pretty. But it&#x27;s still light enough that I can pair it with any of my scented oils if I want to add a little drop of musk or Amber to it, mix it in in my hands then put it on my body and not have to wear perfume or anything too overwhelming. super lotion! :)</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this from Whole Foods. I love this lotion - you can use it on your face and entire body.&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn your eyes.</li>
    <li> Get away from the petroleum based crap from Vaseline brand and other manufacturers. This is plant based and will not kill you.  Really nice. Maybe more expensive that that Vaseline crap, but aren&#x27;t you worth it? Buy this. The Maximum Dry Skin Formula has a very nice scent that smells great on my supermodelgirlfriend...</li>
    <li> This is a great brand of lotion, it is very difficult to find a lotion without all the chemicals and un-natural products that actually hydrates your skin. The scent of the lotion is very low key and is hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> I like it but prefer the feel of the Eucerin repair for dry skin better.  My skin is so dry that it flakes a lot. The Alba Botanica absorvs faster, but my skin prefers the other one</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable so I decided to give this a try.  It goes on easily and does a good job on my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have a medical condition that leaves my legs very dry and they easily break down, I have lived with this all of my life and spent years trying to find  lotion that actually works. Well I found it! This lotion does wonders for my skin and the price is amazing Thank you do much.</li>
    <li> amazingly hydrating; even moist appearing skin several hrs later!</li>
    <li> I loved the old Alba lotion, especially the scent.  While the lotion itself is okay, so much of the pleasure of using Alba was the almond scent.  I honestly don&#x27;t think I like the product enough in its new form to continue buying it.  I am extremely disappointed with Alba for this seemingly needless alteration of their original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALBA: PLEASE say this is just some jerk move like New Coke, and that you will bring old Alba very emollient lotion back soon.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t HAVE this item, they sent something else, and when i called to change it to the picture shown, they said it was not available. very annoying waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;the actual item pictured is 5 star. i rate amazons way of doing business one, if that.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lotion. It has a lovely, addictive smell, it&#x27;s vegetarian and not tested animals (VERY important to me), it&#x27;s paraben free (paraben being a cancer-causing chemical), and the alpha hydroxy acids work wonders for keratosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this lotion in the last month, and the bottle says \\&quot;New Improved Hydration\\&quot; in the upper left. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this lotion at my brother&#x27;s house. I really loved the way it felt and smelled so I decided to order a bottle for myself and one for my mom since she loved the lotion as well. When I received my order, I noticed right away that it smelled different. I checked my mom&#x27;s bottle and it too smelled different. It smells kind of old, stale. The only other way to describe it is like medicine. I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save program, but I&#x27;m thinking of canceling. I love the lotion, but I&#x27;m not too thrilled about the new scent. Before I cancel, I&#x27;m contacting Alba Botanica to see if this is normal. Maybe I just got bottles from a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Just as my headline says, I do like this lotion but it does have a flowery smell like gardenia or tuberose so my hubby and son won&#x27;t use it. I would have preferred a more unisex scent (citrus or lavender).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a body lotion I&#x27;ll stay with. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes for hours. I feel that it absorbs great and I love the viscosity. It isn&#x27;t too thin and not thick enough to feel like liquefied petroleum jelly. Only downside is the odor, which reminds me of the old Jergen&#x27;s gone a little off. I&#x27;ll order it again and again, but with a different scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion and not always easy to find in a store so it was perfect to find it on amazon prime to order.  It works great for dry skin for once a day use. And the scent is mild and pleasant.  Highly recommend this item.  Remember you get what you pay for and this is worth the price.  Thanks amazon for offering this item.</li>
    <li> Dimethicone is a major ingredient not explained in Description before buying. It states that it is all &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a lot of plastic. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great smell great lotion. Looking to replace my discontinued vaseline renewal. Hope this ones a winner... But time will tell. Like the scent, not as strong as  vaseline renewal but almost the same fragrance, which I love. Huge bottle.  Softens, exfoliates, rubs in good, does leave that lotiony residue I love  to make you feel moisturized  for a couple hours.  Love and need an aha lotion, and  its great it not testedd on animals and its more natural than any of my other lotions.... So  even better</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these 32oz bottles back in June and fell in love. The original formula (Blue &amp; Purple lettering) has a wonderful light floral fragrance, spreads easily and absorbs into the skin in seconds, non-greasy, and a little went a long way. The two bottles lasted about a good 5 solid months. I picked up a new bottle at Target, instead of ordering it through Amazon and what I got was the new formula (Green &amp; Blue lettering) and it&#x27;s just not the same :(. New formula smells more like the emollient and less of the floral fragrance, feels thick, slightly greasy and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily. You also seem to need a lot more lotion to moisturize. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the new formula and wish they had just stuck with the original. If it aint broke why fix it? It gets one star off for that. If you can find the original formula (Blue &amp; Purple lettering) I&#x27;d highly recommend it, can&#x27;t say the same for the new formula.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I use this religiously and always get compliments from my men!</li>
    <li> This is best lotion I have ever used. I tell everyone I know about it. I like that it a small goes along way. This size bottle can last me almost a year. It also does not wash off the first time you wash wash your hands. This lotion leaves your skin soft and not at all greasy. A family member that has a type of skin cancer uses this lotion to keep his skin moist and supple. It helps keeps his skin from cracking and bleeding. I recommend this lotion to everyone. Amazon has the best price for this product.</li>
    <li> I am VERY pleased with my purchase. This lotion is great and really helps with that dry skin in the winter. I also love that there are no harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> ...an old lady.  Sorry to say it, and no offense to old ladies, but it has that weird rosy gardenia smell that just kinda smells like you&#x27;re trying to cover up another smell.  Anybody know what I&#x27;m talking about?  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find it really unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion but it didn&#x27;t arrive a full bottle??  I just got this?!</li>
    <li> I first bought this on sale to try for my daughter who has eczema. It&#x27;s works so well for her and is so emollient that I ordered a second bottle. Love it. ❤️</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00143UYJE Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Maximum Dry Skin Formula, 32-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;I just received this product and it works amazingly. It goes on kinda thin at first but once you work it in it gets thicker. I have eczema really bad on my hands and other lotions were not working without me using my steroids. But we will see if i have to use less of my steroids with this! As for the smell, it smells like regular non scented lotion to me. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is that other customers had with the smell but it does not smell horrible at all. I love it, will be ordering more once I run out.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive, suffering from eczema most of my life and forced to use products like Aquaphora, Eucerin, &amp; CeraVe...all of which are great products that help resolve my eczema issues but full of parabens and other additives that I don&#x27;t want absorbed into my body. I found Alba Bontanica, free of parabens &amp; very moisturizing. I like this product so much, my young daughters use it too!</li>
    <li> Best lotion we have used in our household.  Very light and leaves skin so soft.</li>
    <li> swimming kills the skin and I no longer have to worry about that. My skin looks great!  Thank you Alba Botanical. The smell is very light and the lotion is extremely long lasting and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great Staple for Dry Skin!</li>
    <li> Thick and creamy but amazingly doesn&#x27;t have that heavy, greasy feeling after applied. I&#x27;m now on my second container and love it. Not highly scented like a lot of body lotions and really works on dry skin. I will be purchasing again in the near future!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find an organic product good enough to satisfy my extremely dry skin. The only other lotion which worked for me my Nivea extreme dry skin and I had almost given up on finding a natural, cruelty-free option for it till I tried this one. I&#x27;m now a very satisfied alba-botanica convert and I just placed my third order now! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great line of products!  The lotions absorbs very well.  I just wish they have flavors like the soaps.  My bf doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite lotion. It works well in the winter and is still light enough for summer months. I also have thyroid disease and one of my symptoms was dry skin. Until my medication was on the right dosage, this was the only lotion that kept my skin moisturized. A little can go a long way, it&#x27;s non-greasy, and it&#x27;s got a light fresh powdery scent so it won&#x27;t overpower. I started using it over a year ago and it&#x27;s been a staple ever since!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the original formula so this is purely for the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;About my skin. I am a dark skinned east Indian with eczema. I have thick skin and shave my arms and legs once a day so it gets extra dry. I take 1-3 showers a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I had been using either aveenos extra dry or eczema formulas. I&#x27;d been using aveeno for almost 15 years. And I love it. Good consistency, spreads easy, abosrbs well, and I don&#x27;t have to reapply an hour later. That&#x27;s my basic criteria. The problem with aveen is it&#x27;s gets expensive. The largest bottle you can find in most drug stores for the dry skin formula is 18 oz which cost 10-12 and for the eczema  7.3oz which cost 7-9. It&#x27;s got a thinner consistency so you do use more and lasts about a month per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have switched had I not been using alba&#x27;s face cream already and didn&#x27;t love it. I decided to go for the 32oz not expecting too much. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and think it&#x27;s great almost as good as aveeno. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell (I prefer unscented) and the consistency is a bit thick for my liking. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the consistency is a bit thick I usually use it when my skin is a little bit more than damp to make it more spreadable. It still has a bit of a layer when you rub it in but it absorbs completely within a minute or two. I don&#x27;t have to reapply for 16 hours which is fantastic. And it leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing. I&#x27;ve had no reappearance of eczema that I usually get when trying a new lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost wise it&#x27;s also much better. It&#x27;s been about 2 months and I&#x27;ve used a little more than half the 32pz bottle. So compared to aveeno its 4.25 vs 9.50. Which is half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably stick with this unless rite aid has an amazing sale on aveeno.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion.  So many of the lotions make me itch, but so far this one does ok!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good body lotion for a while without parabens and etc. and I bought my first bottle of this stuff on clearance at Walgreens. It is very moisturizing and the smell isn&#x27;t terrible. It&#x27;s also fairly priced. Good enough for me!!</li>
    <li> Read about body wash that is paired with this lotion. Both I have found to be great fit my overly sensitive dry skin. A new must have. I bought my first last summer at Whole Food and fell in love with it when going out in Sun and pools that dried out my skin. So when winter came I put it on the shelf for about a month or so and boy did I notice that my skin responded very bad. So now I know that this will be my year around must have. Body wash does not dry out my skin and works well together for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. It makes my skin feel smooth and not dry at all</li>
    <li> Love it! Has been great, no itching, no burning. Gentle on skin, went out &amp; bought the soap too since the lotion works so well</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Tends to keep my skin soft with less drying.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to be THE best lotion out there--I tried many others to see if I could get a better deal somewhere, but always came back to Alba. My skin has always been dry and sensitive, but Alba would make things bearable, even in the winter months, and even when I lived in the Southwest US. It felt like a shield from the elements. I used all three kinds--maximum, scented and unscented. Back in the day (1990s?), my family bought it in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed something amiss when I bought a bottle of maximum the last time--a grainy consistency, and didn&#x27;t soak in as well. I came to Amazon to research lotion brands, and it turns out everyone has confirmed what I had thought--it&#x27;s different now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve lost another lifelong customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I bought \\&quot;Everyone Lotion.\\&quot; Not bad, in my opinion. If you&#x27;re feeling displaced, you can give them a look-see...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years and find it to be an excellent product for my very dry skin.  The lotion is easily absorbed and does not contain a lot of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion.  There not a lotion out there with a better feel to it than this one.  And the smell is subtle but nice.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have had issues with very dry skin, for the past 2 yrs, during the winter months.  It is working well for me.  I love the botannical scent, it is so fresh and clean, not over powering.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin, it is not too much and I plan on using thru the whole year.</li>
    <li> This cream is a great body cream with no bad ingredients, a great fragrance, and perfect for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> these lotion contains AHA. So it works great to slough off dead skin cells and help prevent ingrown hairs. It feels silky smooth too. It doesnt have all of the nasty petroleum ingredients like so many other lotions. the smell is also nice</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It is my daily lotion and I use it even on my face. It&#x27;s not oily at all and very weightless while rich in moisture. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love, love this lotion. I&#x27;ve looked almost everywhere for a body lotion with AHA that isn&#x27;t too greasy and helps get rid of the red marks from blemishes or rashes and even lightens freckles a bit. Great value here and convenient delivery.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, very effective</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best moisturizers out there. I use this religiously when the weather gets cold and dry - it really helps.  I buy the big bottle as it is a very good value compared to buying smaller bottles at retail locations.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Alba has gone the way of many companies...they changed something that worked great into something else...and it looks like for cost reasons.  The new formula is tacky...not as effective.....looking into it, right off of Alba&#x27;s website, here is the real ingredient list of the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; skin lotion - Amazon needs to update their listing, it is no longer accurate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil(1), Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract(1), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract(1), Allantoin, Ascorbic Acid, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lecithin, Polysorbate 60, Potassium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol(1), Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool Fragrance (Parfum). (1)Certified Organic Ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More chemicals and gone are the first ingredients of certified organic infusions......my long time trust in this company has been somewhat irreparably damaged.</li>
    <li> Thank God!  Something that moisturizes my super dry, itchy, sensitive skin without causing any of the usual sensitive skin reactions that other moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for treating rough, dry skin! I live in the High Rockies, and this is the only thing that keeps my skin from looking and feeling dry, cracked, and itchy during our long winters. For very dry skin, this is a must!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, but it&#x27;s pretty minimal and well worth it. I live in Colorado and winters are so dry and brutal. This keeps my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> My skin craves this stuff in the winter.  I like the mild scent but more importantly it is a very rich body creme</li>
    <li> i was most disappointed withow the package got to me&lt;br /&gt;it was not padded enough so all the pumps were broken, they leaked in the box and oh what a mess.  i was not able to get a replacement however i got a refund.&lt;br /&gt;somewhat scared to re-order if the packaging is no different</li>
    <li> This lotion is fast-absorbing and non-greasy, but it is not &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; and won&#x27;t last all day. It also has a strange, plastic-y smell. It&#x27;s not awful, just odd. Overall, this lotion is no better than a discount drugstore brand and not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This lotion works wonderful for dry skin.  I am an older person and my skin is very delicate. My skin was so dry, I could wear black slacks and when i removed them, my skin flaked on the inside of them. I started using this lotion and my arms and legs have such a wonderful texture and they look moist and young again.  My clothes also do not have flakes on them. My arms were also dry and flaky looking, almost embarrassing. Now thanks to this lotion, I feel great and can wear anything . I might mention I also have a lot of allergies. I use this lotion with confidence and it deserves a five star rating.</li>
    <li> I found this lotion to be, like other people have mentioned, having a tendency to sting- just a bit, when first applied, pretty much anywhere on the body.  But the sensation doesn&#x27;t last long, and, I found that this IS the lotion that I prefer to use after showering and shaving, and that I absolutely don&#x27;t mind the sting, for just a moment, and just slightly, because I really like the way that this lotion absorbs and distributes itselt along the skin, whether the skin is wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product right on the faces of my younger, school aged kids, and two of my kids have given my feedback that it stings, but they too, say, &amp;#34;Oh, nevermind--its already going away&amp;#34;, and the third child doesn&#x27;t notice anything but a wet feeling and asks if it will blend in quick, which of course, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my feedback includes that applying this lotion to the skin really makes a difference when comparing it to other products when it comes to how it rubs off/doesn&#x27;t rub off when sweating, either in the warm weather or when at the gym, and when you go to take a shower it is also noticable that this lotion has actually soaked into and been utilized by your skin, and has not been sitting on top of your skin dried on.  It makes a healing difference to me seeing this first hand.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I reccommend this lotion to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is in a pump bottle! Thank you Alba.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a while and love it, so I have nothing bad to say regarding the product itself. It is very moisturizing and sensitive, and lacks all the yucky things they put in products these days (parabens..sulfates...) But, unfortunately when it arrived the cap part was open and it had leaked in the package and the nozzle part won&#x27;t pop up properly. Alas!</li>
    <li> This is a good lesson for me in buying body products in a brick and mortar store. I&#x27;ve never used Alba Very Emollient Body Lotion before, but it&#x27;s been recommended to me as having a great texture and result. I selected this particular product from among the others on Amazon for reasons I now wish I knew. really wish I had realized that by calling this product &amp;#34;Botanica&amp;#34; they didn&#x27;t mean simply that it was a natural product line - but were perhaps inferring that it smells strongly, so strongly, of flowers. To me it smells like jasmine - but whatever it is, I really can&#x27;t stand it, and my husband can&#x27;t use this either. Nowhere else in the written description on Amazon, or on the packaging, does it state that this product is scented. Except in the ingredient list where it says it includes the extracts of some floral essences. I would return this if I could, but since I&#x27;ve opened it and used it I feel like I can&#x27;t. Texturally it seems nice enough - but I will go to the store and smell the bottle next time. I&#x27;ll try to find some acquaintance to pawn this off on, someone I don&#x27;t see very often and won&#x27;t have to smell.</li>
    <li> I really, REALLY love this stuff.  I have unfortunately developed eczema and have been trying every lotion there is under the sun.  My old favorite was once Gold Bond Ultimate, but I have found that to be too heavy / sticky and it would even sometimes make me itch more.  It was also very important to me to find a product that does not test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this in my local Stop &amp; Shop and I am so pleased.  The lotion is light, yet continues to keep you soft and moisturized all day without being filmy, heavy or greasy.  The scent is pleasant, and after this is on, you don&#x27;t smell anything at all.  I apply this in the morning after I shower and late in the evening, my skin feels so soft- softer than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been plagued with eczema and had the worst dry itchy patches on my back no matter what I did.  This lotion actually works and makes them so much softer and no longer red with bumps.  I am less itchy after applying this.  I actually got itchier right after applying heavy lotion- my skin would freak out at that too.  Not this stuff.  This actually soaks into your skin instead of a greasy, gooey layer sitting on top of the dry patch.  What an improvement I noticed overall in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that this stuff works so well without adding harsh chemicals or testing on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am normally extremely breakout-prone and have been able to use this on my face with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read a few other reviews about people unhappy with the new formula...  I am not sure if I bought the new or old, my purchase is very recent mid July 2012, so I am thinking I have the new.  I have no problem with the scent and find the formuula fantastic.</li>
    <li> this is the only lotion I have found which actually helps my skin. it is hard to find in a store.</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural lotions and this is the best one. Alba sells other lotions, but they do not work as good as this one. If you have dry skin, then this maximum formula works great! Now if you have eczema or some other more sever skin condition, I would not recommend this product for that. My son with really bad eczema has used this and like most lotions this does nothing for skin conditions like that.</li>
    <li> The original formula has been changed and contains a number of potentially harmful chemicals my wife did not wish to apply to her body.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a reflection on the seller from whom I made the purchase. They responded to my complaint in a professional manner and not only returned what I paid for the product but also refunded my return postage.</li>
    <li> The lotion feels good on the skin. Very silky, smooth and not greasy. Unfortunately, the perfume in the lotion is a bit strong for me and causes itchiness.  Gave it to my friend and ordered the unscented Very Emollient formula.</li>
    <li> Please for a more natural style lotion.  Initially a little sticky but after hrs skin feels soft.  Seems firmer. Smells nice, subtle.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when I first pumped some lotion as it appeared very oily to the eye, but it&#x27;s not oily at all and that was my main concern with any lotion.  Plus it does a excellent job with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> this skin cream is the best &amp; I have tryed what I thought was the best &amp; priced cheaply</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION IT KEEPS MY USUALLY DRY SKIN QUENCHED. I ALSO USE THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH VASELINE AS MY MIRACLE CRACKED HEEL REMEDY IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM.</li>
    <li> I love it, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But it&#x27;s no better than a bottle of St. Ives, which is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have extremely dry skin and have not found a natural/organic lotion that has ever measured up to what I need till now. This one is so creamy but not so thick that it is not spreadable. It leaves my skin feeling really nice and soft especially if I exfoliate first. This is my 2nd bottle and I plan to keep using this kind from now on.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly, the next day actually. My issue with it is that the bottle one one-third empty. At first I thought it might because it needed to settle, but after I left it alone for a bit, it show there to be only 2-thirds in the bottle. I have bought this product before for it&#x27;s quantity and 32 oz size, since I had 1 ounce sandalwood oil, 1/2 ounce white musk, and 10 drops cedar to it, and use it as a hair and face morning rub before I head out and take on the day. It usually lasts me the year, but with the extra 10 ounces left out, that cuts a few months from the product. What a let down, now I have to go to the store and see what I can find there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for too many years to remember.Even though I do try this and that lotions,I always have this one on hand because it is very moisturizing. Not greasy at all and very light. I have healed tattoos with it as well.Works great.Definatly not for face though.Something in it gives me zits but I do use it on my neck and everywhere else no problem...Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Though the smell is a little odd, it makes up for it by being super creamy and soothing to dry, irritated skin! Definitely glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for many years. It really moisturizes my dry skin leaving it soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and you can&#x27;t beat the price here on line.</li>
    <li> works great on those little bumps I get on the back of my arms and my legs.</li>
    <li> The lotion is OK did not like the smell to much better to work with moisturizing the skin.  Would I recommend this product yes non-scented.</li>
    <li> I use as a body lotion after showing and have for years. I did a lot of searching before I found this and I&#x27;ve stayed with this product since I found it.</li>
    <li> I have severe psoriasis, especially in the colder dryer months.  I use this lotion 1x or 2x per and do not have flare ups.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno daily moisturizer for about 20 years (great product!) however I wanted to try something new, all natural and possibly more effective. So far I love this! I have dry skin and have to moisturize every single day. Literally. I stay moisturized for the whole day and sometimes I even use it on my face. A little goes a long way and its a great price for what you get! This will probably by my go to daily lotion for a long time.</li>
    <li> Best overall body lotion I have tried.  I use the VERY Emollient.  Living in the cold north west demands the best skin moisturizer!</li>
    <li> works well to keep me moisturized but no spf</li>
    <li> I have dry skin.  The type where you drag your nail across your skin and it leaves scratchy, dry patches.  I use a very thin film of this after bathing or washing my hands.  After first it you think it may be heavy, but it quickly sinks into your skin and leaves a soft, dewy sheen.  My dry cuticles in the Winter weather instantly respond to this lotion.  The pleasent fragrance reminds me of the end of a Summer day at the beach.  Very nice.  I&#x27;ve used many other more expensive formulas I&#x27;ve bought and received as part of a gift set, but this lotion really does it for me.  I&#x27;ll always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great and it&#x27;s a reasonable price!  Only moisturizer that will keep up with MN winter dry skin by only using it once a day!</li>
    <li> one of the 3 bottles opened while shipping and made a HUGE mess and I loss 1/3 of the product.  I complained with not even a response.</li>
    <li> I really like this body lotion because it is very creamy and smooth when I put it on my skin. I like that it is unscented as it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that looks scaly. This lotion really helps it stay looking and feeling hydrated for days, without feeling heavy or greasy or slimy. It has a slight scent. A great deal on amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
    <li> It finally dawned on me that I have been rubbing chemicals all over my body for years, so I looked for something natural. I have been using this for about 5 months now and I love it. It gives me moisture all day and I have pretty dry skin. I will continue to use this for sure!</li>
    <li> After misordering, the second order (left), while the correct name on the bottle (dry skin formula) the formula/ingredients has changed.  My original (right) was purchased from a health food coopt and was a much lighter version that absorbed so much quicker and worked amazingly.  It was the only stuff that I found i could use from head to little toe without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Wonderful body lotion, it smells very nice and has no chemicals.  I am now on my 4th bottle of this lotion.</li>
    <li> The best lotion that I have found for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin since I was a kid and most moisturizers don&#x27;t work or feel to heavy on the skin. This one is super moisturizing and feels clean and light on your skin. Scent is light and pretty.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I have very dry skin - (old skin..i&#x27;m 93) and it leaves my skin soft and moist!</li>
    <li> and is not refreshing at all.  I think the product may be past expiration.  I love this lotion but not this one -</li>
    <li> this I consider to be a great buy and a great product.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy again.bought for economy reasons due to it&#x27;s larger size</li>
    <li> Alba Botanica Natural Very Emollient Body Lotion is not the same product it was. The formula is watery and not nearly as rich as the product I received previously. Was the formula changed to cut costs? It lasts about one half as long because of the cheapened consistency of the lotion and is not nearly as effective in moisturizing dry skin. Is the original product still available ?</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. One pump goes a long way and my lets and arms feel so soft afterwards, not greasy. The scent is very light.</li>
</ol>
