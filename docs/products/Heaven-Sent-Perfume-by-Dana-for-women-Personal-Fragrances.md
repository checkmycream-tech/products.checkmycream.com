      <li>Do not buy if you liked Heaven Sent.</li>

      <li>I know she&#x27;ll be thrilled on her birthday.</li>
      <li>She wore this fragrance in high school and was very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to be able to find on Amazon - Thank you :)</li>
      <li>and she is kind enough to wear it a lot so everyone is happy!</li>
      <li>This is the original scent that many women have known and loved for years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, Heaven Sent EdP is very light and close-wearing.</li>
      <li>It smells good, just not as good as I remembered it from high school.</li>
      <li>Glad I took the chance and ordered it.</li>
      <li>SO AT AGE 60....and fighting cancer HOW wonderful to finally find.....</li>
      <li>wore it in college and still love it</li>
      <li>Amazon did have it and many selections also.  </li>
      <li>Lovely Fragrance.</li>
      <li>Satisfactory by my standards! :)</li>
      <li>It is a product that I have used for many years</li>
      <li>Wish I had purchased more of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic, my wife was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Mom said it was her favorite perfume she used to wear and hadn&#x27;t been able to find it since.</li>
      <li>My favorite</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this again and will reorder over and over..</li>
      <li>My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife because I love the smell</li>
      <li>my favorite</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!!!  </li>
      <li>You would think that if there are so many looking for the original scents, the Manufacturer would see there is a demand and dive in and make them once more.</li>
      <li>Not the original by Helena Rubinstein, but I like it better.</li>
      <li>I received this product very quickly.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly!  </li>
      <li>I now have Grand Daughters and remember the youthful light hearted scents that were nice for a young girl to wear.</li>
      <li>Light and feminine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Same great smell as when we were dating 47 years ago.</li>
      <li>If you love this perfume or have problems finding your favorite scent, try Amazon, you&#x27;ll be surprised at the availability!!</li>
      <li>However, it is in-step with today&#x27;s rose trends yet patchy &amp; mossy for those with classic tastes.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product thinking that it was the original Heaven Sent</li>
      <li>After some research I found that the original was made by Helena Reubenstein.</li>
      <li>you remember and want the original scent from say the 60s and 70s, this is not it.</li>
      <li>She said it smelled stronger than the original</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as spicy smelling as the original</li>
      <li>The original is not from Dana.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, smells exactly as I remembered.  </li>
      <li>smelling lovely and not suffocating my partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why I love it so much!</li>
      <li>This is the closest I have come to finding the scent of the original perfume.  </li>
      <li>I guess I am lucky that I don&#x27;t know what the original Heaven Sent smells like.</li>
      <li>My daughter wanted this parfum - had it when she was younger and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I love it that much.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true.  </li>
      <li>This is the only perfume I use, it is light and flowery, I have used it for more years than I can remember,and I still  love it</li>
      <li>I gave it to her as a Christmas gift, Even though it has been remade she loves it as much as the original!</li>
      <li>Heaven Sent is a cheap substitute for modern L&#x27;Heure Bleue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Brought me back to my youth and was pleasantly surprised it was still around.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to know I can order it whenever I run low.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this perfume.  Great service from the company regarding delivery.</li>
    <li> took longer than I thought to be delivered, but exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My grandma loves this perfume, and Amazon has consistently been the best place to find it for her. This is the original scent that many women have known and loved for years. I&#x27;m grateful to be able to find this here--it&#x27;s a quality perfume at a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really smell like I remember it but it&#x27;s still a soft perfume appropriate for young girl.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law.  I try to get her a bottle every year.  Her husband who is deceased would get her this every Christmas.  I know she misses him very much.</li>
    <li> On me, Heaven Sent is a predominately citrus &amp; rose scent that is buttressed by patchouli and oakmoss. This is not a virginal fragrance for little girls! I guess I am lucky that I don&#x27;t know what the original Heaven Sent smells like. This version from 2001 is gorgeous on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, Heaven Sent EdP is very light and close-wearing. However, it is in-step with today&#x27;s rose trends yet patchy &amp; mossy for those with classic tastes. In a stronger formula, I think fumies would be gaga for this one, and it strikes me that it would be edgy enough to come from JHAG and classic enough to come from Gres. However, in this weak formula, it is still a wonderful bedtime scent, or possibly one to wear when working in close quarters with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it and will wear it for restful, dreamy nighttimes ... smelling lovely and not suffocating my partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - The original is not from Dana. This is not supposed to smell like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSS - Heaven Sent is a cheap substitute for modern L&#x27;Heure Bleue.</li>
    <li> I received this product very quickly. I was very impressed with the scent of the perfume. My mother wore it when I was a child and I loved the way she smelled. I gave it to her as a Christmas gift, Even though it has been remade she loves it as much as the original! GREAT BUY, For Heaven Sent fans!</li>
    <li> like this and would buy it again</li>
    <li> Was happy to order this product for my mother for Christmas, since it is no longer available in stores in my area however, not happy about the $25 shipping charge on a $8 bottle of perfume</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I use, it is light and flowery, I have used it for more years than I can remember,and I still  love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germaine Rosenquist</li>
    <li> Came promptly and the scent was exactly as I remembered it.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Wore this when I was a girl.The perfume is the same.But the sprayer was broke.Using it anyway.The best I can.I was disappointed!</li>
    <li> An old time favorite.</li>
    <li> This version of Heaven Scent is kind of weak. The scent is reminiscent of the old perfume, but not as pretty or potent. I like it and will use it, but I probably will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Heaven Sent is a wonderful perfume that is not at all overpowering. I use to wear it when I was a teenager &amp; that has been 45 years ago!!! I can&#x27;t tell you the expensive and non-expensive perfumes that I&#x27;ve had to take back or give away because they were too overpowering....My husband took one whiff and said &amp;#34;love it!&amp;#34;...That was enough for me!!!! I&#x27;ve had it on for two hours now &amp; have had no adverse reaction to it. YAY!!! I am so glad I found this again and will reorder over and over..It arrived really fast too. Good deal!!!</li>
    <li> Light and feminine fragrance.  I wore it to physical therapy as well as out for the evening.  It was never over powering.  The physical therapist wanted to know what I had on--I guess that speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> It is a product that I have used for many years so I expected it to be \\&quot;Heavenly\\&quot; and it is.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately we will never have the same scent as the original when it was first put out. the smell is a bit similar but very weak. that&#x27;s the problem with companies buying out each other. i would never purchase this product again. whachagonnado?</li>
    <li> HEAVEN SENT has gone through its share of reformulations over the years.  I&#x27;m not familiar with the original, but this current reformulation is a soft, pleasant, powdery floral with a hint of spiciness.  (NOTE:  Avoid an older reformulation in a flatter bottle with a large, flat, semi-circular cap and light blue &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34;. That one smells like overly strong, generic baby powder.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an older brand of perfume but also brings back  good memories of old. I have liked this fragerance for many!!!! yearas. The company also sent a variety of samples that were very nice and am still using them.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED HEAVEN SENT PERFUME  SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD AND AM CURRENTLY 64.  IN THE LAST 2 YEARS I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE QUALITY OF THE PERFUME HAS GONE WAY DOWN HILL.  WHERE AS BEFORE A COUPLE OF SQUIRTS WOULD SMELL GOOD ALL DAY, I NOW HAVE TO SPRAY IT ON REALLY HEAVY TO HAVE IT LAST 10 MINUTES.  I AM APPALLED AT HOW MUCH THEY NOW WATER IT DOWN AND WILL NOT BE ORDERING HEAVEN SENT ANYMORTE</li>
    <li> My sister loved it. It was a Christmas gift. She wore this fragrance in high school and was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It smells good, just not as good as I remembered it from high school.</li>
    <li> Every where you look for this they want well over $25 and the price you had it for was awesome. It still smells exactly like when I wore it in high school. I&#x27;m tickled with it and wear it all the time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Already loved the scent!</li>
    <li> Been looking for &amp;#34;Heaven Scent Perfume&amp;#34; for years!  Everytime I was in a new store or away, I&#x27;d try, but to no avail.  Then I thought, &amp;#34;Ah, Amazon&amp;#34; - maybe they&#x27;d have it.  It was worth a try.  Amazon did have it and many selections also.  I love the perfume and love Amazon for carrying these very hard to find items.  If you love this perfume or have problems finding your favorite scent, try Amazon, you&#x27;ll be surprised at the availability!!</li>
    <li> My mom loved this as a mother&#x27;s day gift.  She said it smelled stronger than the original but they don&#x27;t make this anymore so anywhere you can get it is great by me. They don&#x27;t sell it in stores so thank you Amazon ;)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell anything like the original. I threw it out. Would not recommend to anyone. Do not buy if you liked Heaven Sent.</li>
    <li> Its just what I remember!  My favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found it!  Also love that it comes in lotion!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m wearing it right now after i got it for a gift for my mom. she always talked about how she used to always wear this in her high school days and wondered if it was ever being sold. well, i surprised her and she said it brought her back to her nostalgia goggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was just like she remembered, a subtle scent that really smells clean. now, you&#x27;re probably wondering why i am wearing it now if it was a gift for her. she insisted that i try it on to convince me to buy it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the issue is that i personally find it to smell like the old fashion talcum powders, you know, the kind your parents would put on with a giant puff? that was just me? well then... either way! it smells like that to me. not that it smells bad, mind you. another good comparison is that it smells like a newborn baby. not like literally straight from the vaginal canal, mind you, but like when moms decided to perfume them up and use baby products on them. they always have this delicate scent of soft perfume that really cements that &#x27;feel good&#x27; feeling in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not my favorite but if it makes my mom happy then i&#x27;m all for it.</li>
    <li> When this lovely, youthful perfume was first marketed, my father, a family practice physician, had an account at a local drugstore, where I was looking for suitably youthful, yet feminine fragrances to give to my high school chums for Christmas. The moment that I tested it, I had to buy a bottle for each of them as well as for myself. Now it is in a far different bottle, but I still have it among the light, day fragrances that I enjoy, even as a MUCH older &amp;#34;girl.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This fragrance is soft and almost has a baby powder scent to it.  Maybe that&#x27;s why I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Worst sent or scent ever...migraine material!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when I received it because the box came damaged.  I can&#x27;t rate the product as I was giving it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife because I love the smell and she is kind enough to wear it a lot so everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance off and on for years. Since it is now difficult to find in store I have ordered from a variety of places: sometimes finding that the scent seemed less potent and faded quickly.  I was very pleased to find that this order was Heaven Sent as I remembered it from years ago.  I can still smell the fragrance at the end of the day.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, smells exactly as I remembered.  Wish I had purchased more of the lotion.  Would recommmend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume so she loved it!</li>
    <li> I remember the original &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; scent very well and this isn&#x27;t it.  This is heavy and musky and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;If you remember and want the original scent from say the 60s and 70s, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Some fragrances still smell good.  This is one of them.  Not a pricey item, back then, but it has stood the test of time!  Keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> This is the closest I have come to finding the scent of the original perfume.  Some people said it faded fast but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true.  It isn&#x27;t quite as spicy smelling as the original but it&#x27;s darn close.  Glad I took the chance and ordered it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my Dad to give to my Mom for her birthday. (Dad&#x27;s not very tech saavy) The item arrived right on time. Mom said it was her favorite perfume she used to wear and hadn&#x27;t been able to find it since. I know she&#x27;ll be thrilled on her birthday. :-D</li>
    <li> My wife has preferred this fragrance since her early teens.  Same great smell as when we were dating 47 years ago.</li>
    <li> Lovely Fragrance. It is Heaven sent. Just Heavenly, not too much fragrance, just right.</li>
    <li> this is a memory from 40 years ago when I was a teenager and all my friends were wearing heaven sent. when I received it in the mail I was thrilled that it was the exact same sent from my high school teenage years. now I am going to purchase two for gifts for my best friends in high school!</li>
    <li> My Mom used to wear this scent and put some on our handkerchiefs before we went to church.  Brought back nice memories.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Fast shipping.  Well packed.  This is a Christmas gift for my grand-daughter, so we haven&#x27;t opened it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife used to use the same product when she was a teen-ager, she really likes this perfume.</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell anything like the old stuff..sorry</li>
    <li> My favorite of all time!</li>
    <li> Very good just like the one I already had. I&#x27;ve been using this product since high school</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this parfum - had it when she was younger and loved it.  I was thrilled to be able to find on Amazon - Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent forever, Hadn&#x27;t been able to find it for at least 20 years. I got it yesterday and it is exactly what I remembered, absolutely perfect.  Now that I know I can get it; I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, my wife was thrilled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like using Baby powder as a fragrance.  If you like smelling like a baby&#x27;s bottom, this is the scent for you.</li>
    <li> wore it in college and still love it</li>
    <li> This was my sister&#x27;s signature scent in high school, and I thought of it when I wanted a light floral scent for everyday.  I was very disappointed when I received it as it now has a musky overtone that ruins it for me. I am EXTREMELY allergic to musk, not to mention I don&#x27;t care for the smell, so I don&#x27;t care if it DOES make the colgne last longer - I can&#x27;t wear it.  Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I read all the reviews on this product being the same scent I wore as a teenager.  I don&#x27;t understand how people think it is the same scent.  It&#x27;s not at all the same.  The scent from the 70s was Heaven Scent.  The only similarity is the blue box and the bottle.  After some research I found that the original was made by Helena Reubenstein.</li>
    <li> What I have noticed is back in the 70&#x27;a and 80&#x27;s there were awesome scents we would wear and buy often. Then life happens and we move on. I now have Grand Daughters and remember the youthful light hearted scents that were nice for a young girl to wear. I have looked up at  least four and I am saddened by the reviews of how much the scents have changed. You would think that if there are so many looking for the original scents, the Manufacturer would see there is a demand and dive in and make them once more. They saying History repeats itself. Pay attention Perfume Companies, there are young girls who look for nice light scents and don&#x27;t need to smell like and wild child or Older Woman.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking that it was the original Heaven Sent but in a new box, boy was I fooled!  It had a similiar sent and it didn&#x27;t last long, I would have to spray within an hour just to smell it again.  Not what I expected!  Although it comes close something is  a little off with the sent.  Not sure if I would purchase this product again, I was highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> !Love this perfume and Body Lotion set! You have to get this! If youn have never tried it... it is a must have!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly!  Item was as promised!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE!!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Prompt delivery. Soft scent. It&#x27;s just heavenly. Thanks! 😉</li>
    <li> Nice to find this perfume I remembered as a teenager. It still smells wonderful as ever.</li>
    <li> This did not smell the way I remember.  It almost smelled like a knock off.</li>
    <li> My wife had used this product for many years till she could no longer get it, but once again the internet has made it possible to find the impossible! &amp; she couldn&#x27;t be happier, that goes for me also as I always like the Fragrance.</li>
    <li> Prefect moms so happy. See smells great again. At 87 you  made her day.  See feels like she did when she was in her 40&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Brenda</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent since I was fifteen years old (my Mom bought it for my birthday). It has been my &amp;#34;Everyday Cologne&amp;#34;....light, crisp...gentle floral undertones. Saved my expensive Favorite &amp;#34;Lauren&amp;#34; for weekends and special occasions. I used to be able to buy Heaven Sent at local drugstores....then it was totally unavailable....they discontinued making it and released  a musky (YUCK) cologne under the same name for younger, new customers. Then finally Dana by Coty began making the original scent BUT, is very hard to find. I am so thankful to Amazon and their co-companies to provide this....my children say YOU smell like YOU again. KUDO&#x27;s to Coty, Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s supplier! It might seem such a little thing...but, getting me through cancer treatments (the nurses spritz under my arms and on pillow after treatment....and gentles me into sleep ). SO AT AGE 60....and fighting cancer HOW wonderful to finally find.....SOME TIMES THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE MEAN THE MOST!!!!! Blessings, Lauren</li>
    <li> Takes me back to my babyhood. Not the original by Helena Rubinstein, but I like it better.</li>
    <li> Have used this scent for years. Love it for casual daily  use.</li>
    <li> Great scent and not overpowering. If you have a woman in your life this is a good scent for her to try.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my mother. Heaven scent is one of her favorite scents and after trying about 8 different stores I looked online, I should have done that first.. I found it here for a good price! I selected standard shipping because I knew she would&#x27;t mind if it was a day or two late, and since it was in transit over the holiday, it still made it to my door in about a week. Satisfactory by my standards! :)</li>
    <li> This is the product my Mother uses and wanted, so if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother for her 50th birthday. one of her family members gave it to her as a gift when she was younger and wanted to smell the scent again. From what she said it smells nothing like what it use to. It has this old smell, something like the smell of a nursing home. It&#x27;s not feminine like the vox described.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed considering how much it meant to her but lesson learned. I was never a fan of buying perfume over the Internet but I knew how much she wanted this. If you are looking for the stuff that was made years ago, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> It,s got a fresh powder smell, and its not to over bearing. I like it, but it is one that I wont wear everyday!!</li>
    <li> The original perfume was blue. this is yellow. The fragrance is not the same and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> It gets noticed. People ask me &amp;#34;What smells so good&amp;#34;. I have been looking for 8 years to find it again. I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend.  She has been wearing it for years and it seems to be rather hard to find, at least locally, so I ordered one for her.  She still loves it and is happy, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect service EVERY TIME!!!!  Thank you so much!!!!  But, FYI: do note that I did not receive the pictured product, mine came in the tall glass bottles..same great product, just not as pictured.</li>
