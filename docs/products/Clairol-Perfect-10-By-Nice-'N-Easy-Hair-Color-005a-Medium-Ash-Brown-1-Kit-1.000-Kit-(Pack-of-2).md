      <li>The color is also great.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s a good idea to crack a window to let out the fumes.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and amazingly shiny when I use Perfect 10.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased at the result.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Perfect 10 for several years and find it&#x27;s very good.  </li>

      <li>I had used this product before and liked the color.  </li>
      <li>10 minutes to perfect color... looks natural...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product, true color, ten minutes of your time, wonderful results.  </li>
      <li>Medium Ash brown was a wonderful tone, looks very natural and original, my hair felt shinny and beautiful, and I loved to be done super fast.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair coloring product remains the cheapest one on the market - Revlon Colorsilk.</li>
      <li>: - )</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t take the pain after just a couple more minutes, and I had to race to the tub to rinse out my hair.  </li>
      <li>There were so many favorable reviews</li>
      <li>cause it can&#x27;t look any more brassy.....</li>
      <li>I love the ease of use of this product and how well-conditioned it leaves my hair.</li>
      <li>ANYTHING THAT IS EASY AND FAST AND WORKS IS GREAT IN MY BOOK.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is really just about a 9 1/2 because nothing is perfect; but this product is the best by far of any I have used and it only took 10 minutes of my time.</li>
      <li>I do like the smell of the post-color conditioner and love how smooth &amp; silky my hair looks after coloring.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to use.</li>
      <li>My hair is actually in better shape after coloring with Perfect 10, which is remarkable given the fact that other products have left it like straw.</li>
      <li>I use medium ash brown and light ash brown depending on the time of year.</li>
      <li>Easy and quick.  </li>
      <li>quick and easy</li>
      <li>I dyed my hair with Medium Ash Brown, first of all, it was more like Light Brown.</li>
      <li>Now having difficulty finding it in local stores, so was delighted to see it offered online.</li>
      <li>that &#x27;s my favorite color, and I love the fact it takes only 10 minutes to do it,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; this by far works the best for me.</li>
      <li>applied the color, ten minutes later rinsed out, used the beautiful conditioner and when I looked in the mirror</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and find it very easy to apply, good color coverage, and not too expensive when compared to salon prices.  </li>
      <li>I love that it only takes 10 minutes of processing time.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick and natural hair color at home.</li>
      <li>I always find they get in the way and makes the whole application process take much longer than it should.</li>
      <li>AND it made my hair very strawberry toned.</li>
      <li>and it holds its color very well</li>
      <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it because I used to be able to find it in all the local stores, but now I can only get it online.</li>
      <li>This product is an exact match for my (now) departing natural color.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase this brand again, and I recommend it very much!</li>
      <li>It truly is a cool ash brown that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a reddish tint like other products often do.</li>
      <li>I bought more and the second time my hair came out VERY DARK BROWN.  </li>
      <li>I buy the Medium Ash Brown color because I don&#x27;t want red or auburn undertones, and it really is a straight brown.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the hair &amp; lasts approx.</li>
      <li>I like this pleasant color, no grey hair is left behind, fast - only 15&#x27;</li>
      <li>True ash color, yes some slight red undertones, but I like the soft color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Foolishly I used it a second time and after a couple of days, I had open sores on my scalp and face and my scalp itched intensely.  </li>
      <li>I WAS GOING FROM AUBURN TO MY NATURAL COLOR AND IT WORKED WITH ONLY ONE APPLICATION.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how well it covers gray, and the color stays true for at least 7 or 8 washings with shampoo for colored hair.</li>
      <li>I just put on the gloves, mix &amp; shake, and apply to my roots/greys first and work my way down my head.</li>
      <li>I have determined that blonde is just not for me and opted to go back to a brown closer to my natural color.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally the color on the box, and this covers gray well and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried Clairol&#x27;s Ten, my scalp burned and itched for a few days.  </li>

<li> My hair was not as dark, and there is NO ash tone to it.</li>
<li> I was looking for something in the medium to dark brown but not too dark.  </li>

<li> I have been coloring my hair for over a year now, but never really pleased with the results.  </li>
<li> Poor customer service from Clairol.  </li>
<li> but I was really doubtful of the 10 minute</li>

    <li> I love the ease of use of this product and how well-conditioned it leaves my hair. My hair is actually in better shape after coloring with Perfect 10, which is remarkable given the fact that other products have left it like straw. I have curly hair, and it can dry out quickly if I use the wrong products. My hair is smooth and amazingly shiny when I use Perfect 10. The color is also great. It truly is a cool ash brown that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a reddish tint like other products often do. My hair is naturally the color on the box, and this covers gray well and lasts a long time. I usually go about 6 weeks between colorings. I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it because I used to be able to find it in all the local stores, but now I can only get it online.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for over 20 years and have used possibly every product on the market with no problems- until now.  Within a minute of putting this product on my hair, my scalp started burning.  I couldn&#x27;t take the pain after just a couple more minutes, and I had to race to the tub to rinse out my hair.  This was NOT an allergic reaction.  This was a chemical burning.  It singed my hair - especially my bangs.  It&#x27;s now over 2 months later, and I am still growing out the damaged parts.  I have had hot, scalding coffee accidentally spilled on my head before, and that pain was nowhere near as painful as the burning from this hair coloring product.  My favorite hair coloring product remains the cheapest one on the market - Revlon Colorsilk.</li>
    <li> I recently had a horrible highlighting job that left me with yellow hair instead of my requested blonde. I have determined that blonde is just not for me and opted to go back to a brown closer to my natural color. This color covered all the screw ups of the professional job and left my hair extremely silky after the conditioner. You can&#x27;t beat the 10 minute waiting either, I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this products and can avoid costly trips to the salon. Maybe I can even splurge on a more expensive cut!!</li>
    <li> I had used this product before and liked the color.  I bought more and the second time my hair came out VERY DARK BROWN.  NEVER KNOW WHAT COLOR YOUR GOING TO GET WITH THIS PRODUCT.  I called company and was told I could go to salon to fix (at my own cost of $150.00) and offered a $9.00 coupon.  Like I would ever try it again.  Poor customer service from Clairol.  DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well it covers gray, and the color stays true for at least 7 or 8 washings with shampoo for colored hair. It is also easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and find it very easy to apply, good color coverage, and not too expensive when compared to salon prices.  I have noticed my hair drying, though, because of it.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for 30 years with Clairol products.  The first time I tried Clairol&#x27;s Ten, my scalp burned and itched for a few days.  Foolishly I used it a second time and after a couple of days, I had open sores on my scalp and face and my scalp itched intensely.  Also my eyes were swollen and itchy for weeks.  I can now no longer use any permanent hair color dyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I loved Clairol Perfect 10! Medium Ash brown was a wonderful tone, looks very natural and original, my hair felt shinny and beautiful, and I loved to be done super fast. I will definitely purchase this brand again, and I recommend it very much! : - )</li>
    <li> ANYTHING THAT IS EASY AND FAST AND WORKS IS GREAT IN MY BOOK. I WAS GOING FROM AUBURN TO MY NATURAL COLOR AND IT WORKED WITH ONLY ONE APPLICATION.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  10 minutes to perfect color... looks natural... Would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick and natural hair color at home.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something in the medium to dark brown but not too dark.  this works for me!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair with Medium Ash Brown, first of all, it was more like Light Brown. AND it made my hair very strawberry toned. The hair pictured is not how you will get it. My hair was not as dark, and there is NO ash tone to it. Won&#x27;t be using again. By the way, I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair for a few years so my hair was virgin! This box raped my hair. I&#x27;m waiting two weeks and then using a different color and brand to fix this strawberry disaster!</li>
    <li> that &#x27;s my favorite color, and I love the fact it takes only 10 minutes to do it, quick and easy</li>
    <li> This product is an exact match for my (now) departing natural color.  It&#x27;s not harsh on the hair &amp; lasts approx. 5 weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; this by far works the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and it holds its color very well and I it doesn&#x27;t give my hair an orange brassy tint that a lot of other products do. I use medium ash brown and light ash brown depending on the time of year.</li>
    <li> I buy the Medium Ash Brown color because I don&#x27;t want red or auburn undertones, and it really is a straight brown. I love that it only takes 10 minutes of processing time. I was skeptical of this at first, but followed the directions and was surprised at how well it covered my hair, including my greys. The color does not seem to fade over time as I&#x27;ve noticed with some others. Of course the greys grow back in over a couple of weeks, so then roots have to be redone, but the greys that were already covered do not appear that the color is fading from them. I can&#x27;t comment on the use of the comb thing that&#x27;s included since I never use those. I always find they get in the way and makes the whole application process take much longer than it should. I just put on the gloves, mix &amp; shake, and apply to my roots/greys first and work my way down my head. 10 minutes later, rinse and condition, and you&#x27;re all done. It smells like any other hair color, so it&#x27;s a good idea to crack a window to let out the fumes. I do like the smell of the post-color conditioner and love how smooth &amp; silky my hair looks after coloring.</li>
    <li> I like this pleasant color, no grey hair is left behind, fast - only 15&#x27; and I can wash it off. Hair doesn&#x27;t loose color after washing. I use it for almost 5 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Perfect 10 for several years and find it&#x27;s very good.  Easy and quick.  Color lasts.  Now having difficulty finding it in local stores, so was delighted to see it offered online.</li>
    <li> Just used this morning after deciding nothing could be worse than my faded gold red orange tones I was looking at in the mirror.  There were so many favorable reviews but I was really doubtful of the 10 minute claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time being short I figured nothing to lose cause it can&#x27;t look any more brassy.....applied the color, ten minutes later rinsed out, used the beautiful conditioner and when I looked in the mirror I was very pleased at the result.  True ash color, yes some slight red undertones, but I like the soft color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, true color, ten minutes of your time, wonderful results.  I have been coloring my hair for over a year now, but never really pleased with the results.  Also, have about 50% grey and they are gone.  The formula is not very drippy, but a thick cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really just about a 9 1/2 because nothing is perfect; but this product is the best by far of any I have used and it only took 10 minutes of my time.</li>
