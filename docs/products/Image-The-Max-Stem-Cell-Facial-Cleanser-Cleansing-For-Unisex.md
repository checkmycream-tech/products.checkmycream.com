    <li> This is such a great cleanser. I stumbled upon it when I went to visit my mom and forgot to bring face wash. She let me use this Image cleanser, and I was amazed by how clean my face felt. I immediately went home and purchased it. I will say that it does make my face a little red, so I use it at night for a deep cleanse before bed, and then use a more mild cleanser in the morning. I would highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
