      <li>It feels so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>always always right.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny amount for each use, so it&#x27;s a great product for its price.</li>
      <li>I will be using Perefect Whip until I can afford the higher end Shiseido products.</li>
      <li>At the first time when i get it i thought it was used</li>
      <li>it works very well!</li>

      <li>Big fan of Shiseido products and this one does not let me down, goes on smooth and easy to take off.</li>

      <li>(St Ives, Biore, Neutragena) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face is literally getting smoother and brighter by the day, even my old brownish acne scars are disappearing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying a foam net to stretch it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I will recommend to watch a video, this product isn&#x27;t like normal western products, you don&#x27;t just slap it on your face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was not what I thought I was buying, very harsh burnt my face.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser. I used them when I went to Japan, and then kept using them. Great for the oily face.</li>
    <li> This is truly perfect. It clears up my blemishes with every use. I highly recommend buying a foam net to stretch it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this isn&#x27;t just for Asian skin: I&#x27;m African American.</li>
    <li> always always right. tip: use a bubble maker with this foam. you would never use other products</li>
    <li> Super whippy facial foam. You will love it as you lather the cleanser. You only need a tiny amount for each use, so it&#x27;s a great product for its price.</li>
    <li> perfect it helps me remove acne</li>
    <li> Good. I use this  two years ago, happy to buy it again</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff. Good price.</li>
    <li> great facial cleanser.  it is very thick and therefore you do not need to use a lot.  Being so thick it almost has the consistency of elmers glue, therefore you can only use a pea size amount when using it with a clarisonic or you will ruin the clarisonic brush way before the expiration date of the brush</li>
    <li> Not my favorite from the Shiseido line. Since I don&#x27;t read Japanese, I was unable to determine what ingredients were inside the face wash. Whatever was in it, stung like crazy! It made my face break out even worse. It was not right for my skin.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected</li>
    <li> At first your skin feels clean and clear but after awhile it builds up on your skin. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product. I have switched to Derm. E</li>
    <li> At the first time when i get it i thought it was used one.&lt;br /&gt;Was leaked front of tubes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Equal to or better than then facial wash you buy at the cosmetic counter of Shishedo but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy and thorough in its cleansing.  Very pleased with purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It gets my face super clean without leaving it feeling tight.  I have tried numerous cleansers over the years for my combination skin that sometimes breaks out (I am mid-forties now) and this is my favorite thus far....at a price that won&#x27;t break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small downside is that it has a very slight chemical order, more in the background of the overall fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Shiseido facial cleansing brush but have found that it foams up great with just your hands or a washcloth.  No need for the puff thing you see on the Youtube videos.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap and good. I&#x27;m lazy. So sometimes, I use it to clean my makeup. it turns out that this can clean most of my makeup on my face except eyes.</li>
    <li> Good best-seller japanise product. Quality more than price. One tube lasts for 3 months, very concentrated. I love all Shiseido products. Will buy again. Domo arigato.</li>
    <li> If you apply the product properly (use only a small amount, lather, gently rub in circles on skin) it works very well! I have eastern asian skin and products that I&#x27;ve tried before (St Ives, Biore, Neutragena) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might sting a little the first few times you use it, but it makes my skin feel clean. Not too sure how it is as an anti-acne product.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this via Amazon because it is so expensive in the states. However I did buy like 4 of them for $11 USD when I went to Asia. Perfect whip is amazing! Every time I wash my face I use a very little amount of it because there&#x27;s just so much foam from a little squeeze. This leaves my face soft and clean at the same time. It also gets rid of the red blemish that I have.</li>
    <li> After few years keep trying other facial wash products, I returned to this product again. It can make lots of bubbles easily, deep clean your face,and absolutely fresh! Japanese products definitely know Asian skin type very well.</li>
    <li> Compared to the more expensive Shiseido facial cleansers, Perfect Whip is indeed perfect! It foams nicely, the lather smells fresh and it cleans off my makeup thoroughly. Only a little is needed, so one tube will last months! I will be using Perefect Whip until I can afford the higher end Shiseido products.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of form or milky facial cleanser.  For whatever reasons, I don&#x27;t feel it cleans your face as this &amp;#34;Perfect Whip&amp;#34; facial wash.  You don&#x27;t even need to use alot.  Just a dime size and it whips out a good amount on your face.  The best part of this is that it leaves your face CLEAN.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have always have horrible breakouts and many problems with other products. I have used them all, Biore, Neutrogena, Oxy, St. Ives, Clean and clear, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Garnier, you get what I&#x27;m saying etc. I thought to myself, after all these years and all those products, why is it always the same? Why is there no change? I also wondered, of all the people in the world, who are known for their excellent skin care routines and young faces into old age, of course Asia, specifically Japan popped into my mind. So I did my research and it payed off. This product is the must have to balance the face, it is perfect. I will recommend to watch a video, this product isn&#x27;t like normal western products, you don&#x27;t just slap it on your face. I have switched from harsh wipes, and products that contain oxybenzone, and alcohol and those rough plastic beads to rice water and rice masques, charcoal and seaweed, foaming exfoliators, and safflower oil and cleansing oils, and I have not broken out since. My face is literally getting smoother and brighter by the day, even my old brownish acne scars are disappearing. I can recommend this product 100 percent, I invite you Amazonians to do your homework on your skincare routine, and invest in something that is top of the line for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great Product and fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> A little bit of pain to create enough bubbles to call it a foam, but definately worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;but It felt different compare to the one i was using before (exactly the same product)&lt;br /&gt;One i was using previously made much thicker foam with smaller amount, this one makes bit smoother and not too thick.</li>
    <li> My face feels really clean after using this in the shower!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of additives which is nice as I have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It helps me to remove my facial oil after a long day of work. Very refreshing after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Big fan of Shiseido products and this one does not let me down, goes on smooth and easy to take off. I use it twice daily in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it lathers really well. My face never felt so clean and it seems like It has somewhat helped me with my blackheads on my nose. But I have changed all my skincare routine recently so... I am not sure. Anyways, I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I thought its from Japan but it is China</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so clean and fresh, it feels really good. Glad I got it on a good deal! Also shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. The face wash foams up great, very mild, a little goes a long way and from what I as far as I can tell, there aren&#x27;t any parabens or sulfates in it. It takes off my makeup with little to no effort. My face is a teensy bit dry, but it&#x27;s nothing little regular moisturizering can&#x27;t take care of. i would purchase this again with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> Most foamy foam cleanser ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two years and it&#x27;s the same with the ones I bought in Asia.</li>
    <li> man.. this stuff is so THICK and CREAMY.... and it left my face like SQUEAKY clean which i dont really like.. as if i washed my face with ivory soap. i felt so TIGHT. like a face drum. blegh... i use it to wash my body cus i dont want to waste it.. it does foam alot if ur into that sorta thing.</li>
    <li> It will take off any amount of makeup with ease even my eyeliner that can be a pain and is great for my sensitve skin.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using perfect whip for about 6 months now and it normally had a clean, light smell. This batch smells totally different but &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; the same. Not sure I&#x27;ll order from this seller through prime again for this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this cleanser.  I checked out on YouTube how people are using it. I didn&#x27;t get one of the sudsy mesh things that some people are using, but on the Shiseido Japanese commercials it shows you how its done.  Waiting to get the foam that you want takes a bit of work and time.  I wish it would work up a bit faster, but the result is a truly clean face, without make up and it doesn&#x27;t feel like any residue is left behind.  Also, there isn&#x27;t any noticeable scent to it which is also a plus.  i am very much enjoying this cleanser, and very glad I got the pack of 2.</li>
    <li> This is my go to daily cleanser.  I typically get iit from my Asian grocery store, but they were sold out.  I would recommend this product for all skin types and tones.</li>
    <li> When i went to Japan, i saw it~!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need to Wash perfect Whip. i find it from amazon~!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it~!!! very good~^_^</li>
    <li> it ia very nice. it is easy to use. i relly like this product~~~and the delivery is very fast.thank you so much.</li>
    <li> It is good product. But it take me a long time to get it.</li>
    <li> the facial wash is very gentle yet still cleans the oil. I (works best with bubble net) Recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> The price I got was the lowest so far. And the foam is always so soft as a Japanese product.</li>
    <li> great cleasing milk。lots of foams. help cleaning my face thoroughly</li>
    <li> No need to explain how good it is.</li>
    <li> Best face washing foam for this price. I&#x27;m using this for over 6 years. Love it.</li>
    <li> my always feel dry after using it</li>
    <li> Best facewash! I have used many high end brands - Shiseido, Chanel, La Prairie - but this one is my favourite.</li>
    <li> Great item. It would be even more perfect if a bubble net is sold with it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! You only need a pea sized amount to wash your face and neck. It feels so soft and smooth! My skin could not be happier. Throughout my adolescence I used proactive because of my acne, but my dry skin suffered a lot. This stuff is so much betterbin!</li>
    <li> This face cream does a great job cleaning my skin while not drying it out. It is my face cleanser of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> good quality for than money. it&#x27;s worth it. My wife was happy to get this facial wash for such a low price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I use it every day and it lasts forever.</li>
