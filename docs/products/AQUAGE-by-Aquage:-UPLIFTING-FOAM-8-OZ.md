<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Okay - first love me say I love this brand in general. I use the thickening gel and love it. This however, just made my hair look like a big greasy factory. Will stick with the gel by this company.</li>
    <li> i have thin hair and no time to tease or &amp;#34;blow dry lift&amp;#34; my hair, this stuff is to the point an makes my hair feel like silk. the only vice is in the application/applicator tip. it could be a bit smaller for better precision, but this crap is well worth your money either way:)</li>
    <li> I use this alot and it always pulls through. it&#x27;s light and gives hair volume. i just put it at the roots and blow-dry !</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thin &amp; it gives it a pretty good boost! I use it along with the Play Powder Root Lifter! Pretty good combo</li>
    <li> Top nozzle fell off immediately.  Will make using the spray hard since it will not stay on properly.  Disappointed for $20 something dollars to have to futz with it each time I use it</li>
    <li> Aquage Uplifting foam is a great product.  I started using it a number of years ago, and I can&#x27;t find any other product that makes my extremely straight hair look as full as it does when I use this product.  Aquage makes my hair easy to style, and that&#x27;s important to me.  I was so happy to find this product on Amazon, because it isn&#x27;t typically sold in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Best volumizing product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I have a lot of long and straight hair that can easily be weighed down so finding a volumizer that works is next to impossible, but this stuff seems to do the trick!  I love it.  It does leave a bit of a greasy texture at first, but you have to really get your hair dryer to the spot you sprayed at the roots and kind of shake it out while you dry.  It will lose that texture once it&#x27;s dry.  Works great, I will always buy this now.</li>
    <li> I had read rave reviews about aquage in a number of places on the internet, and was excited to try it.  I have fine, thin hair that is a little bit below my shoulders and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that will help it keep it&#x27;s shape. I tried Aquage the first day by squirting it into the roots of my hair and finishing blowing dry. I was seriously underwhelmed! Not only, did it not volumize or \\&quot;uplift\\&quot; it made my hair feel dirty and rough. I used it 3 more time, because I hate jump to conclusions after one or two uses, but I haven&#x27;t changed my initial opinion. I have found drugstore brands (pantene volumizing mousse, bed head, etc) that work better than this for less than half the price! Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Used for two years and really like the lift.  I apply and then dry my hair upside down and finish with the &amp;#34;Cook shot&amp;#34; air - works nicely.</li>
    <li> One of the best volumizers I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried most all of the popular brands.  Gives lift without feeling heavy / sticky. Very lightweight.  Love this product! :)</li>
    <li> So disappointed! I really don&#x27;t see that much lift at my roots and its leaves my roots very &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;. I have to put extra heat on my roots to get them to dry and im not using that much product. I am so bummed because I was really looking forward to this.</li>
    <li> Heard about this on The Small Things Blog. It&#x27;s a great texturizer.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product, as I have very lifeless, dull hair.  This product made my hair feel very sticky and oily.  I used it twice then disposed of the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Lifts hair at the roots, but leaves a weird texture. I HAVE to wash my hair the next day if I use this product. For the price it was fine, but I probably won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Aquage products.  It has dont amazing things for my unruly hair.   I have thin hair and it has made it much more stylable!!  Thanks.!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I was hesitant to use it because most volumizers make my super thin hair really greasy, but I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there! Gives as much volume as my mattifying powder, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product per recommendation from a stylist.  I like it! I purchased it from Kay Beauty on Amazon.com. It arrived poorly wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope which caused product to leak out.  Also, the lid was cracked.  After multiple emails with Kay Beauty, they were very apologetic and replaced the defective product with a new bottle.  This time it arrived in a sturdy box, snuggled in huge bubble wrap!!! Thank you, Kay Beauty.  As for the product itself, I do like it.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything magical, of course.  I get the same volume in my fine hair from products at the drugstore. So, bottom line, if you want to spend the money, get it. Otherwise, drugstore products work just as good (for me anyway).</li>
    <li> This product leaves a great result, with an amazing smell.  My favorite aspects of Aquage uplifting foam is that it smells great, and is minimally sticky.  Obviously, volumizers need to be sticky so the hair can stay in its lifted position, but this stuff isn&#x27;t caked or like glue.  Blowdrying isn&#x27;t difficult with this in, and styling is done with ease.  Sadly, it&#x27;s rather expensive.. and definitely go to a salon to buy this for a better price.  Yes, it is difficult to find this product since only certain salons have it, but make the hunt.  It generally will only cost $20 in a salon, with no shipping.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Gives natural volume without getting greasy or leaving residue. Great product for every hairstyle!! It doesn&#x27;t wear off or disappear either. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a day and was able to revamp my style because I had already applied this product the AM before. I never need to reapply or build on product.</li>
    <li> I love this foam .Is excelled for my thin hair .</li>
    <li> If you need lift for your hair, this is the product to get.  I love the way it makes my hair look fuller with lots of body.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Does help adding volume to the hair just be careful not to use too much or your hair will have a lot of residue.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years! If you are looking for something to add volume to your hair, this is the stuff! I&#x27;ve used others, redken guts is good but not near as good as the Aquage!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use product in my hair everyday, but when I do I only use this. Great lift. Not too stiff. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This gave my curly hair lots of volume &amp; really defined my curls.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used correctly, this stuff works great!  You put a strip at your scalp every inch or so then work in and comb through.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing! I get so much volume more than with any other product and it does not leave a gross feeling or discolor my hair like other volumizing products tend to do. I do not think that as a customer I should have to wait an additional 5 days to have my order shipped out. This was in tiny print and I did not even notice. Also when I purchased the price was around $16, within a week the price went up to ver $28? I will be purchasing from a local salon and not be ripped off from this company and pay $17 rather than $28 plus shipping!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, not quite as much lift as I was hoping for. It gives your hair texture though so it&#x27;s easier to work with.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel yucky and didn&#x27;t really give me much volume at all.  Will be going back to my favorite root boost product-Frederic Fakkai.  Expensive, but worth it and one bottle lasts me a long time!</li>
    <li> This works great as a root lifter.  I spray it on my fingertips and apply it to my roots.  This helps lift my fine hair.</li>
    <li> After applying this foam to my damp hair, it leaves my hair more manageable and less dry.  My hair does not become sticky or stiff.  My hair is still soft and looks fuller.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best I have used and have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I took the bottle out of the box and when I opened up the clear cap, the nozzle came flying off.  It wasn&#x27;t attached at all and although I was able to balance the nozzle on the pump to make the foam come out, I expect a little better than that for $22!  It&#x27;s broken and I haven&#x27;t even used it once.</li>
    <li> Amazing how well it works!  My fine, thin hair is full!  I&#x27;ve used lots of product over the years but this beats them all as far as volume is concerned!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a root pump and beyond - it works wonders on my fine hair, and lasts more than one day if you don&#x27;t get to wash your hair the next day - great with styling and shine.  Great quality product.  I used to use Big Sexy Hair root pump (which I liked very much) but I like Aquage even more!</li>
    <li> love love love this product. I saw a stylist using this on a blog and I had to try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Adds alot of volume to your hair without feeling like your hair has alot of product in it.  Only need to use a little for my super fine hair, so it has lasted alot longer than other hair products.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best ever. I have been using it for the past 4 years. Love it!</li>
    <li> This hair product is great gives you lots of volume and hair that is easy to manipulate. Not sticky like other volumizing products.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair that is on the thin side of thickness. I&#x27;ve tried SO many volumizing products - up until this, my favorite was Aveda&#x27;s Phomollient. However, after my first time using Aquage, I. Am. Hooked. Massaging some into my bangs was - I swear - the FIRST time they were perfect just after blow drying and stayed perfect ALL day. The volume stayed in my hair after sleeping and my hair was so flexible and able to be styled great even the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble finding a volumizer you like, give this a whirl. It certainly worked for me!</li>
    <li> Great product for limp hair. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product. It gives great volume without the hair feeling greasy. Only downside is that it&#x27;s not sold i Denmark so I have to order from the US.</li>
    <li> Defining gel is better.  I was disappointed in this product because it did not give me the lift and volume I was looking for.  Aquage defining gel does.  I would recommend the gel over this foam.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I&#x27;ve never had such great lift in my hair before.  And it stays all day with a light misting of hairspray.  And the added bonus that it&#x27;s not sticky or stiff.  Instead it makes my hair soft and moveable.  But shop around.  I found it for $13 at a local salon and didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping either.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to see that I got a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; bottle that had more than 8oz in it. Great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great for adding volume to my thick heavy hair. I have tried a lot of products for volume and none work like Aquage. I love this stuff and won&#x27;t be without it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my fine hair and roots. I also didn&#x27;t like how it sprays. Directions say to spray directly onto head but it goes every where like a fire extinguisher. I had to spray on my hands then rub into roots.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It really works, lasts the next day not shampooing.</li>
    <li> Adds good volume to fine hair.</li>
    <li> This gives my fine hair more body than other products I have used.  No sticky residue.  I wil buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product does the best for natural curly hair. I love the product!! Can help hair in high humidity areas.</li>
    <li> Love this product, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely  manner.  The product is okay for uplifiting but not worth $18 dollars.  I have a similar product that I paid $4 for the can and it does just as well. I probably won&#x27;t order again due to the cost.</li>
    <li> This definitely makes a difference in my limp, lifeless hair. It makes styling easier, especially teasing, but I just can&#x27;t quite call it the perfect product. I&#x27;ll keeping buying it until I find such a product though.</li>
    <li> Great product that does what it says.  My stylist recommended Aquage, and now I use it every day!  My hair wouldn&#x27;t style as nicely without it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I can get the body and keep the natural shine of my hair, without the build up</li>
    <li> Works great! Good root lift for even second day hair styling.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but like this the best!</li>
    <li> Thank you. Great product. Great product love using this to increase volume in my hair. I would like to see the price a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It does not give any volume. I cannot tell any difference in the volume of my hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair styling foam.  It smells great and it gives great control and volume to my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my sticky at all.  This is the best product ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s a mousse but with a spray nozzle. I can tell my hair looks and feels more full when I use this stuff. I put it in on my damp hair and then blow dry. Compared to volumizing gel I&#x27;ve tried I noticed with this foam my hair isn&#x27;t as sticky and compared to volumizing/texturizing powder I get more volume with this product. I am totally buying this again.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I have fine, super straight hair, and this is the only volumizing product to give my hair lift without being super heavy/crunchy once it dries.  The spray nozzle is perfect for getting to the scalp to lift hair from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the best method of use for my hair:  Towel dry hair after washing and separate hair into sections after combing through (I usually have about 6 parts [ear to ear] along the front to my crown and 3 part down the back from crown down.  Apply two &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; of foam into each part, then use your hands to rub the product into the hair at the scalp, working the product out to about midshaft.  Blow dry hair upside down then flatiron/curl as desired.  If you don&#x27;t see enough lift at the scalp, make sure you add at least two &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; of foam into each part; I haven&#x27;t seen any negative effects of using too much, only if I do not use enough.  Also, I recommend applying product to damp/wet hair as it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; and moves through the hair easier.</li>
    <li> The volume his product provides is worth 5 stars.  However, I have very fine hair and it leaves my hair feeling like there is &#x27;something&#x27; in it....almost crunchy feeling.  But if you can get past the feeling, you&#x27;ll love the volume!  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I had seen a video in which someone bragged on this product extravagantly.  It is okay, has good hold, but I am convinced it really dries out my hair.  It is difficult to get it all out when I shampoo, and since I color my hair, I don&#x27;t want to use a shampoo that strips products.  I like it okay, but I certainly don&#x27;t think I will bother to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Love using it.  I saw a tutorial using it and it does everything that was promised</li>
    <li> Another product I love and had to order online.  If you are looking for volume...give this a try.  Cyndi at Walking in Grace and Beauty blog recommended it on her blog.  I&#x27;m so thankful she did...because I need it and it works great!</li>
    <li> Not for me. My hair is so thin and baby fine. Don&#x27;t know if I will ever find a good hair thickener! Anyone out there have any suggestions?</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I bought it because of the youtuber Kate from the Small Things Blog. She&#x27;s got volume like crazy and this is really the key. I tried her techniques without this for months and had minimal success. Bought this and things changed!! I get great hold and lift. Watch her videos if you are looking for a reason to buy this!</li>
    <li> I love Aquage! I have very fine straight hair it gives me lift, without weighing it down or feeling sticky..great product!</li>
    <li> The product is okay.... i think i could get the same results from something not as pricey, the dispenser on top was also broken upon arrival, I&#x27;ve tried to snap it back on, but as soon as I start using the product it pops off again.</li>
    <li> And I wanted to know what the heck she was using on her hair to make it so shiny and stay in place. This after of course Moroccan Oil....I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Took about a week and a half to get here but it did get here before est delivered date. This is the first time I tried this product and I love it. It gives me the perfect amount of lift ... I did learn though if I use too much it makes my hair sticky. But besides that, 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> this is a great foam. This stuff really works, with no heavy residue/ weigh down. For a short cut that wants volume, WOW! I love this product.</li>
    <li> I expected more from it than other products I&#x27;ve tried...no different.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t look any further for an uplifting hair product!  This is it!  Smells wonderful, does not leave my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, I can barely feel the product in my hair at all!  A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last quite a while!  I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; but nothing I&#x27;ve tried can come close to Aquage!  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine hair that needs control and volume.  I do feel like my hair has increased static however, but my hair is full of volume and stays all day.  Rinses clean during shampooing/no residue.</li>
    <li> excellent as always - great control but gentle</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Aquage uplifting foam. It provides great volume to my fine hair. This is my new fave.</li>
    <li> I have very fine baby soft hair and this gives it a lot of volume!  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Tried this product from my sister and I love it.  Very light but works!!  I&#x27;ve used other mousse and when it&#x27;s hot outside or I&#x27;m swetting my scalp feels terrible and itchy.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that, feels like I don&#x27;t have anything on my hair. The comb goes smoothly through my hair and it gives me height on top which is what I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any salons where I live so I ordered it on Amazon and it came promptly.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST. I have the flattest hair, and this is the greatest product I have ever used to get volume.</li>
    <li> I ordered the aquage uplifting foam from \\&quot;Your Best Hair Day\\&quot; and was disappointed to open up the two packages and find both bottles dirty, dented, and potentially used. The bottles did not look brand new by any means. It is unfortunate, but I have learned my lesson. I would not recommend ordering hair products from this particular shipper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the lift with this that everyone talks about. Not something I NEED in my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> With the small nozzle you can place the foam exactly where you want it.  At the roots!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s bc I have thicker hair, but I saw no volume whatsoever with this product. This weighs it down more than anything. Grocery store brand products work better than this</li>
    <li> The product gave me a little volume, but nothing impressive. Not worth the price is my opinion. A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> As someone with fine, thin, hair, I&#x27;m, always willing to try new products that promise volume.  Aquage definetely lives up to that promise!  Be sure to shake the cannister vigorously to get some power behind the spray so that you can target the foam to your roots, and then rub into your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the cannister itself sometimes loses it&#x27;s spray strength. You want a somewhat forceful spray in order to target the foam to your roots, but after repeated use, the mechanism loses that sprays weakens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought an Aquage product before but I had heard excellent reviews. This is the best uplifting foam I&#x27;ve ever used and it really gives my heard that extra bounce. Now I can really tell how flat my hair is when I don&#x27;t use it! A+++</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; it is difficult to find!! Amazon had it... !!! &amp; I love it!!! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy &amp; holds with a blow out .. Without weighing my hair down!!&lt;br /&gt;Thx!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the rave reviews about how much crazy volume this gives to the hair.  However after using I found that it isn&#x27;t any better than any other product that I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not bad...just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype and isn&#x27;t worth buying again.  I&#x27;m giving two stars for the product.  The seller was great, super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was perfect exactly what I ordered except the bottle was pink instead of green.. Still works great I think!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  People keep commenting on how full my hair looks!</li>
    <li> I REALLY love this product! I have very straight and fine hair that has a tendency to be flat mid-day. This product is great because it provides the roots with a &#x27;stiffness&#x27; that makes them hold thier volume all day!! I love that my hair (with a bit of added hair spray) now maintains the same look that I styled in the morning! :) Highly recommend for those who just need a little lift!</li>
    <li> I know I will love this as I&#x27;ve used before....I just have to give feedback as I ordered the night of Oct.1 and it is here Oct.4th!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it and I&#x27;ve never found a product that worked as well as Aquage Uplifting Foam.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair tons of body, and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling crunchy or sticky. I finally found the product I have been searching for all these years!  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and course. So I don&#x27;t use it all over my hair. My hair gets very flat on top of my head at the part, so I use it to get some lift. It definitely helps this problem. My stylist has been using it on my hair for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years.  It is a good product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product really does help to give me some volume and texture in my hair - my hair usually lays pretty flat to my head without any product. It does feel like there is product in your hair when you use it though, which doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I put it in on damp hair and blow dry my hair upside down. So far I have really enjoyed using this product. I don&#x27;t use it every day because I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair all the time but will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I have flat lifeless hair and have tried so many products.  Aquage gives my hair life and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff nor grimy. I definetely recommend this to anyone that needs a boost.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that successfully gives my hair body.  My favorite product</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product and I absolutely love it.  It actually works.  Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing - fresh scent, leaves an invisible root boost in your hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands or hair!  I&#x27;ve got to give a shout out to the seller as well...I was told the item would most likely arrive after Christmas, but I received it over the weekend!  Super fast shipping and very appreciated!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it states it is supposed to!  I have fine hair. I use just a little of this at the roots on damp hair, just before drying. A little goes a long way!  Hard to comb thru wet hair when drying if you use a lot. Start with small amounts at roots and work your way to the amount you need the next time if not enough.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on a hair tutorial and thought I would try it.  I have very fine, thin hair.  This really does pump up the volume.  Make sure you spray the roots and follow the directions.  You will have to wash your hair after using it because of the build up.  I can sometimes go 2 days without washing, but not when using this product, that&#x27;s why it is not 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it lasts a long time!  I bought this a while ago and haven&#x27;t even used half the can (about 60 days?).  So price is worth it!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Not sure if I could live without it.  Perfect for fine, thin, colored or fragile hair.  You just put it on the roots to give lift and after you blow dry it, it gives your hair lift all dlay.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This product adds volume to thin and fine hair and you look like you have alot of hair when finished styling.</li>
    <li> This has to the best lifting foam ever!! You dont need hairspray to tease!! I highly recommend this product to anyone needing some lift and volume!!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a blog that I follow. She uses this and I thought . . . why not?!?! I LOVE IT!! I wash my hair every other day and use it after every wash. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have super flat hair, but using this product gives lasting volume! I&#x27;m usually too lazy to use it for everyday purposes(I can&#x27;t be bothered to blowdry my hair), but when I have a special event or want my hair to look especially nice, I give it a go. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the summer yet, so I can&#x27;t say if it will hold in the humidity, but I suspect it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Really helps with volume! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best for volume! Squirt at roots at the crown of your head and rub into damp hair thoroughly. Blow dry with round brush. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have Asian pin straight oily hair with bob hair style. I blow dry my hair everyday for volume. with this product, it cuts to my hair dry time to half! the only cons is that it makes the hair to get dirt faster.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. All day volume at the roots, a little texture, but natural looking and feeling hair. No stiffness, a great styling aid. Recommended by TheSmallThings blog, she has a video on how to apply this product, very helpful.</li>
    <li> This product was just OK. I honestly didn&#x27;t see a difference in volume from just blowing my hair dry upside down. It did however add texture which aided in backcombing/teasing but not by much. I bought this on the advice of a professional hairdresser but I&#x27;&#x27;m not sure if it will be a recurring product in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested by a stylist.  I am very disappointed in the lift.  I have other products that work better.  I will not use this again, nor will I recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I use this in the front and top of my hair to give a lift and it works. My hairdresser says she sells more of this product than anything else. It is great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, limp hair and this did add some volume, but I do not feel I have add the success that most people have had with it. I am still using thou and do like produc in comparison to others like it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which I wear in an inverted bob. I purchased this hoping for added volume particularly at the roots. It does give a small amount of oomph, but nothing I can&#x27;t do with hairspray. So if you want to pay the amount for a bit more volume without the stiffness of hairspray then I would say it&#x27;s a fair purchase.</li>
    <li> Saw this on someone&#x27;s blog so I thought I would try it. Works great! I love it. Gives good height for roots. Would recommend. Although it leaves your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product for years! My hair is fine/thin and this is the only root lifter I&#x27;ve found that works and does not weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> Watched video on Pinterest...product is great!!  Easy to use and hair still feels great!  I will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> Works incredablly well. I just don&#x27;t like the heavy (I definitely have something in my hair) feeling. I don&#x27;t use it daily, only on bei occasions for that reason.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great on my fine, thin hair. It works when I scrunch it and let it dry wavy, or when I blow it out straight. It gives me the volume and hold that I need, and the look that I want.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it is lifeless this product gave me the volume I was looking for and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is a game changer. I have very fine hair that is usually very flat. This product really helped to give me volume and keep it all day. I&#x27;d suggest it to all my friends who need more volume in their hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second can of Aquage Uplifing Foam.  I just take my little finger and make a long part around the front and top of my head about every 2\\&quot; and spray the foam on the part.  Then I just press it in and kind of pull it though the rest of my hair.  Dry hair upside down and then use a flat iron.  Easy Peasy and pretty fast too.  I got the smaller can to take on trips.</li>
    <li> I love the volume this gives.  The only downside is that if you use just a little too much it makes your hair look super greasy, and I have dry hair.  Works especially good if you put it in damp hair at the roots and blow dry it.  Oomf baby!</li>
    <li> i used super hold hairspray to lift my roots before so i gave this a try.  i seen it on a blog and it works.  its not stiff and it does give lift.  still have to use a little spray though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the $4 volumizing foam I bought at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this does the trick. It keeps my hair from sticking my head and gives me some lift. I even use it occasionally if I want to wear my hair wavy....I put some in my hand like mousse and scrunch my hair. Works perfectly without being crunchy. This will probably be a product staple for me!</li>
    <li> Aquage hair foam is THE first product I&#x27;ve used like this that works without being too stiff. I really love how much body Aquage gives my hair after it&#x27;s dried!!</li>
    <li> I have really thin, naturally curly hair and this is the BEST product I have found. It does not weight my hair down.</li>
    <li> i saw this stuff on an online hair blog so i decided to order it. its a great product and i am happy with it everytime i use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I want to have volume but I also want to be able to have touchable hair.  This product gives my hair a lift and I can still run my fingers through it easily.  I spent twice as much on a Bumble and Bumble product that made my hair sticky to the point of not being able to pull a brush through my hair while blow drying.  It is also durable.  My volume lasts all day.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This lightweight, product is my favorite to use for blowdrying hair, yet adding body.  I love the fact that it is not heavy, or sticky.  You have no idea it is in the hair, yet when styling, it adds body, flexibility and easy to create a nice style effortlessly.  I have tried many products but this one remains my favorite.  This would probably be best for short, or medium length hair, and ideal for  haircuts with layers and fine, thin hair. It really gives a boost. And, although costly, it works, and lasts a while since not much is needed to do the job.  It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I found this product from watching tutorials on &amp;#34;The Small Things Blog&amp;#34; and I have to say, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> I used to love this hair product but recently it doesn&#x27;t seem to give my hair enough body. I need to change my product</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me by an online beautician who posts great tutorials and she said it was her favorite.  I would never switch to anything else.  It works on curly or straight styles, is weightless and provides great body and control.  Boosts curls as well.</li>
    <li> Use this almost every day for just the right about of lift and volume. It&#x27;s light weight so you don&#x27;t feel like you have any product in your hair and it does a great job of lifting at the roots!</li>
    <li> Recently moved to Denver.  Took a long time to find a product that would give me the lift and hold in this climate. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this styling foam for about 10 days now. It does help add volume to my very straight hair. The only improvement I would like is that it could be easier to apply to roots of hair. A large amount comes out when you push down on the spray head. I run a comb and then my hands thru my head to try to distribute the foam evenly but I always end up with a lot mor in some places than others. I does have a pleasant fragrance and it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> great product.. does not flake, lifts hair and gives it volume.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great if you want bigger fuller hair. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it. My friend has very thin hair and I used it on her and it really helped to give we a fuller look. Plus it doesn&#x27;t make ur hair feel oily. It just gives it more texture. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product was talked about on one of my favorite blogs.  The woman who writes the blog is a hairstylist and does hair style videos and tutorials.  She frequently talks about the products she uses and one of her tutorials was about adding volume to your hair, especially if it is Fine to Medium hair, (which I have) using Aquage Uplifting Foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been trying to find Aquage products in stores and salons nearby (the South Jersey/Philadelphia area) and the places were either really far away or really expensive, so I looked on Amazon.  Not only was the product affordable on Amazon, the package shipped and arrived in 3 days, when I had opted for the 7-10 day delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for about a month now and it is extremely easy to use.  You spray the foam directly on your roots, work it through your hair with your fingers or a comb.  Then, style/blow dry your hair as usual.  It gives amazing lift and body to your hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or overly sticky.  It is perfect if you want to tease your hair and give it lift around the crown of your head.  I also noticed that it helps me hold me style all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect root lifter!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great texture for volume on my fine hair!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting. I was worried about it at first bc I received this during the winter and I was in our mailbox for quite awhile.  It did not effect it&#x27;s performance</li>
    <li> Foam spray is great! I like the volume it gives but you can put in too much leaving your hair sticky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now. I wanted to make sure that I really got to know it before I gave a review. First off I have med length med thickness hair and this bottle is lasting a long time. I use it about 4x a week. It does make my hair have super volume in it if I blow dry upside down. BUT it falls out easy. My hair can be teased up perfectly and by the end of the day my hair is flat. This is normal for uplifting products but the reviews I read about this I expected more hold. The smell is awesome, and the smell lasts in your hair until you wash it out. It is a good &amp;#34;working product&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s perfect to put in your clean hair to help &amp;#34;dirty it up&amp;#34; to work a style into your hair. However you have to use the perfect amount. Too little and you get no results. Too much and your hair has a weird texture at the roots and is super oily the next morning. With that being said, I do have to wash my hair daily with this product. Will I order it again? Maybe. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to go above and beyond any other root lifters I&#x27;ve used. Honestly I&#x27;d prob buy it all the time if I could walk into a store and get it. Because it is like most root lifters and I love the smell, but since I have to go outta the way to order it.... I just don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll bother with it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this product, and I really like it!  I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s super straight and fine.  Aquage gives me alot of volume with some texture, without weighing my hair down.  I usually have a problem with products weighing down my hair or making it oily, Aquage does not do either!!  Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Sassy styling foam.....</li>
    <li> AWESOME for roots! It really does make a difference especially when you blow dry and style. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars was because when I recieved the product the part of the product that distributes the product keeps falling off and only stays on when im pushing down on the applicator. Other then that i love it</li>
    <li> I really like this product quite a bit.  Being older, my hair is thinning a little and this product gives it volume and the height that I really like.  I use it on my wet hair and perk it up during the week on dry hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I FIRST USED THIS PRODUCT THE DAY MY DAUGHTER GOT MARRIED, THE WONDERFUL HAIR/MAKEUP ARTIST PUT IT IN MY HAIR. MY HAIR LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND KEPT IT&#x27;S HEIGHT ALL DAY AND NIGHT. I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT!!! THANK-YOU AQUAGE!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and purchased it multple times. I have fairly thick, long hair, and just a little bit goes a long ways. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product does the trick for my fine hair.  It gives lots of volume, but does not make it stiff or hard to manage.  I definitely recommend this product and will reorder when I start to run out.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a major difference between this product and the big hair one I&#x27;ve previously used besides I had to order it and couldn&#x27;t buy it local to me. I like the product and it smells good, but nothing really stood out as opposed to other products similar to this root lifter.</li>
    <li> If you just want your hair to stay in place...I mean not budge, then this is your product.  But my husband would recoil each time he touched my hair when I used this.  It left my very fine hair with a weird, &amp;#34;baby-doll hair&amp;#34; texture.  It also ended up causing more breakage.  Its just not a natural feel at all.  You just have to decide what you want.  If soft volume is your wish, forget this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aquage Uplifting Foam for about a year now.  This product provides volume without being sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have never found a product I like that give volume and AQUAGE does the trick. It does not make your hair feel gross. It does take longer to dry your hair with the product in it but if you brush through your hair it helps. When I am curling my hair it is great (no brush needed). Just love everything about this!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, limp hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl. The first time I used this spray I said out loud &amp;#34;so THIS is how I get textured hair!&amp;#34; Suddenly I can tease it, curl it, and it holds body and shape. It has even allowed me to skip a wash or two by lifting my roots away from my scalp. Goodbye flat, oily locks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Great root lifter. A little goes a long way - the bottle lasts for months, even with daily use. Great product!</li>
    <li> I usually wash my hair every other day- but when I spray a few lines of this into my roots, it easily lasts 3 days with looking gross. I&#x27;m a busy Mom and this is an excellent product for volume and root-lift, plus battles any oily roots.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this lasts all day.  Use on wet hair and then blow dry with round brush.  Very easy to use.  Worth the price because I don&#x27;t have to use very much at one time</li>
    <li> This uplifing foam gives me the volume I need at my roots to give me just enough lift.  I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist and is everything she said it would be.</li>
    <li> Excellent volumizer. A little goes a long way. Do not over use or it will make your hair sift. A small amount in a few spots and its perfect</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have very fine hair and it has a tendency to look greasy when I use anything it in, but Aquage actually has the opposite effect and my hair still feels like hair, not sticky or gunky. I also really enjoy the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many volumizing products and this is the best.  Tons of volume that lasts until you wash your hair again.  I have a lot of fine hair that has a natural curl- this product makes my hair look thicker and full.</li>
    <li> Just take a look at the number of good reviews.  It&#x27;s obvious you need to go ahead and just try it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used!  Just ordered another one for a friend!  I have thin, fine hair and it truly changed my &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;!  People asked me if I had just been to get my hair done!  Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and thin and this product gives it a lot of bulk with just a smidgeon on your finger</li>
    <li> I watched a hair tutorial online and this product was being used.&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of it before but thought I would give it a try and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did! I have a hard time getting my hair to hold a curl and&lt;br /&gt;have body and this product provides me with both! I definately&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gives Great Lift!  I have heavy, thick hair and it works wonders.  I have recommended to severeal people since I started using it.</li>
    <li> It really does give my fine thin hair a lift. Doesn&#x27;t seem to help hold it in place and still need to back comb it some but its hanging limp any more.</li>
    <li> Received on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very good product, delivery and order.</li>
    <li> I had heard that this was wonderful for lift at the root and I agree it does work.  I have highlighted medium-length hair and I spray it all over my roots.  Makes styling easy.  The nozzle is small to direct the product in a thin stream right at the roots.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m 25 weeks pregnant and everytime i&#x27;m pregnant my hair falls really flat and it seems impossible to get a lift at the roots and this stuff works wonders!!! i love it and will definitely be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> Like the smell but the whole having to apply it at the roots is just extra work so will probably switch to another mousse in the long run.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve come across. I have no idea how to survive with out it! I have terribly fine hair. It&#x27;s thin and doesn&#x27;t do anything but lay flat and lifeless.  This dramatically boosts my volume and maneuverability. It helps hold a style and curl.  My only complaint is that it is really difficult to get a round brush through while blow drying. It&#x27;s super sticky, but it does the trick!</li>
    <li> Love this amazing hair product!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for my fine, thin hair!&lt;br /&gt;I would like a travel size though for traveling!</li>
