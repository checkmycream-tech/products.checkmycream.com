      <li>I love this product...</li>

      <li>Love this leave in balm makes my hair feel really soft and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and smell so good.</li>
      <li>One of my new favorite hair products!  </li>
      <li>Product lasts a long time and is great for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Sweet.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and mellow and makes hair feel soft.  </li>
      <li>apply the balm, do a quick comb through, pick it out a bit</li>
      <li>Re-activates the curl on dry hair application - smells great - makes hair soft!!!</li>
      <li>5 little squirts in my hand-rub together &amp; apply onto hair...Smells great &amp; keeps my hair nice &amp; soft &amp; ready for me to apply foam or mouse....</li>
      <li>Their shampoo, conditioner, leave in treatments are all worth it for color treated hair and I will repurchase.</li>
      <li>and this allows me to run a comb through it right after washing it .</li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I use Wella Brilliance after showering and have seen a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s strength, growth, and manageability since first use about 1 year ago.</li>
      <li>it did help my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t weighed down AT ALL (which is great since most leave in products will weigh my hair down if I&#x27;m not cautious).</li>
      <li>The price was very good-packaged well &amp; arrived right on time....</li>
      <li>but it really seems like with hair products...</li>
      <li>My boyfriend calls this the &amp;#34;luxurizers.&amp;#34; I have very processed blonde hair that can get straw like pretty quick.</li>
      <li>Most of the time when using this I don&#x27;t use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have fine long color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>She was able to comb, blow dry and brush my hair using only this.</li>
      <li>This makes it easy to comb through and does not weigh down your hair or make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
      <li>And wow, a world of difference it makes!</li>
      <li>Background on my hair: I have normal, fine color treated hair, after a lengthy process of coloring my hair from black to green, my hair was through so much</li>
      <li>A little does go a long way, and I DO NOT use it on my roots, my hair is insanely soft, shiny, and easy to manage!&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lord knows how many products (seriously, my bathroom has at least 5 different shampoo/conditioner/mask SETS that didn&#x27;t do SQUAT!)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

<li> The only negative is I go through this expensive stuff pretty fast.</li>
<li> It has been very dry and tangles like a mofo, esp when wet.</li>
<li> My hair was feeling a bit like wet yarn before, no matter what I tried.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Just like other balms i used to purchase from the market.</li>
<li> I can tell a difference when I switch to other products or quit using this one.</li>
<li> I have thin hair that has been colored a lot and cannot live without this after showering to help comb my hair.  </li>
<li> She used a little in my damp hair post shampooing.</li>
<li> I am obsessed with the smell if this product.</li>
<li> It was not so bad, however i wont buy it again</li>

    <li> Used as a detangler, it works beautifully as does not add oiliness or moisture.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I have fine long color treated hair. It has been very dry and tangles like a mofo, esp when wet. This spray is awesome at getting out the tangles and making my hair feel soft and healthy. It also adds a lot of shine. My hair was feeling a bit like wet yarn before, no matter what I tried. This spray is the only leave-in that made a difference. After one use, my hair felt healthy again. The only negative is I go through this expensive stuff pretty fast. I wish it came in a bigger bottle or was a bit cheaper...but it really seems like with hair products...you get what you pay for. None of the cheaper drug store versions worked like this!</li>
    <li> One of my new favorite hair products!  It smells good (like all Wella products), but it is the perfect leave-in balm for my hair.  It protects my hair and doesn&#x27;t allow for frizziness.  Sweet.</li>
    <li> Excellent product would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great product :) I have very long hair and this allows me to run a comb through it right after washing it .</li>
    <li> all girls u should try these one!soft hair!good one to try and never give up on this! yep love it!</li>
    <li> I started using this in January, and I love how it makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s so soft! Most of the time when using this I don&#x27;t use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the balm, do a quick comb through, pick it out a bit (I have curly hair) and then I let it air dry.

    <li> It&#x27;s nice but I prefer LuxeOil.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the smell if this product. Their shampoo, conditioner, leave in treatments are all worth it for color treated hair and I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in balm makes my hair feel really soft and smells amazing.</li>

    <li> Background on my hair: I have normal, fine color treated hair, after a lengthy process of coloring my hair from black to green, my hair was through so much abuse.&lt;br /&gt;Two color remover sessions, numerous bleaching, and normal blown drying means my hair is really dry and hard to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lord knows how many products (seriously, my bathroom has at least 5 different shampoo/conditioner/mask SETS that didn&#x27;t do SQUAT!)&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to touch up my roots (more bleaching, which made me nervous), my hair dresser recommended this. She used a little in my damp hair post shampooing. And wow, a world of difference it makes! She was able to comb, blow dry and brush my hair using only this. My hair isn&#x27;t weighed down AT ALL (which is great since most leave in products will weigh my hair down if I&#x27;m not cautious). A little does go a long way, and I DO NOT use it on my roots, my hair is insanely soft, shiny, and easy to manage!&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I would have to put regular conditioner in my hair, pin it up, and rinse it out five minutes later. I did not get the shampoo or regular conditioner in this series, but I did get the hair mask to try (which I haven&#x27;t done yet). I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the rest of the products in this series. This stuff alone is a life saver! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good hair balm, very easy to use in a rush,  it did help my hair soft and smooth. Like it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected - same as the regular stores</li>
    <li> Smells nice and mellow and makes hair feel soft.  Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair - I have thin hair that has been colored a lot and cannot live without this after showering to help comb my hair.  Dries nice and shiny, doesn&#x27;t leave build-up - LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Just like other balms i used to purchase from the market. It added nothing to my hair styling. It was not so bad, however i wont buy it again</li>
    <li> I have fine/fragile, somewhat curly hair that is still in tangles after conditioner; my hair also does not grow well. I use Wella Brilliance after showering and have seen a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s strength, growth, and manageability since first use about 1 year ago.</li>
    <li> This product works so well for untameable hair!!!!!Thank you! The conditioner is leave in and it is something I hope I can always get my hands on...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend calls this the &amp;#34;luxurizers.&amp;#34; I have very processed blonde hair that can get straw like pretty quick. This is the only after shower product I need to use (after the same shampoo and conditioner).</li>
    <li> Smells so good and helps with the tangled damaged ends of my bleached hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Makes my hair so soft and smell so good.</li>
    <li> Perfect product if you have fine course hair.</li>
    <li> Product lasts a long time and is great for color treated hair. I can tell a difference when I switch to other products or quit using this one. I keep coming back to it every time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  A little bit goes a long way.  I have super thick hair that hangs down to my waist with unruly curls.  I can run my hand thru my hair after spraying it in my hands and running it thru my hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> BEST product EVER for my 3 year olds&#x27; curly hair! Re-activates the curl on dry hair application - smells great - makes hair soft!!! I have used it for a leav in conditioner on  my hair - it is a very nice product! I bought 3 bottles - its the only t hing that works on my daughters&#x27; hair!!!</li>
    <li> Love Wella products!!!</li>
