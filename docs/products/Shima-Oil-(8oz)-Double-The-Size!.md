      <li>I really love the fact that this product is being sold in an 8oz.</li>
      <li>I watched many Shima videos on YouTube before purchasing her oil.</li>
      <li>I think this product is better suited for strait relaxed hair.  </li>
      <li>and im able to use</li>
      <li>I brought me a Brush :)</li>
      <li>I also mix Shima oil with my Wen product and get a wonderful deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a lot more hair growth as well.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many complements on how silky my hair looks that I&#x27;ll never use another product again.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I love all of her line.</li>
      <li>Shima is kind and genuine, and I trust what she says.</li>
      <li>It helped greatly during my transition to my natural texture (3C- wavy).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice, light scent, and absorbs quickly into the hair and skin so your hands do not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is strong, shiny and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair super shiny and it is very light on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It does work nicely for a hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>She has the beautiful hair to back up her products.</li>
      <li>I also use it as part of my daughter&#x27;s scalp oil mixed with castor oil and its great.</li>
      <li>Nice product, thanks.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>It makes me feel good to know that I&#x27;m putting an healthy product into my hair and scalp on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>It partnered with her hair growth tips are invaluable for growing long beautiful hair.   </li>
      <li>The oil smells very good too and don&#x27;t weight down the hair.</li>
      <li>When I comb it it is less hair in the comb very good for the ends as well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel an automatic fabulous result of softness, but again this is my very first use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good oil,  very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really confident that I will see some real changes by Summer, with your oil and by using the protective styling techniques.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient to have a bottle that&#x27;s this size because that means that you can use it twice a day and not have to worry about using it up so fast.</li>
      <li>It sits on top of my hair and I have to really work to get it all rubbed in.  </li>
      <li>i keep my hair braided underneath extensions and my hair is natural, kind of a kinky curl or coil texture.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s quite nice on my hair.</li>
      <li>You definitely have a good thing here.</li>
      <li>So... Lets get to the point: so far, the scent is nice and mild.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with it that I got my older sister to try it</li>
      <li>It did not aid in the process of getting the tangles out since it made my hair stick together more than moisturize it while helping separate, like a normal oil or lotion</li>
      <li>but since i&#x27;ve been using Shima Oil it is SO much manageable and easy to comb through.  </li>
      <li>She is more knowledgeable than most hair stylists ( I know because I have been on this earth a long time and have traveled extensively,and have SEEN IT ALL.</li>
      <li>I could tell the difference in my hair the first time I used it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to any one who is trying to repair their damaged hair and who wants to grow their hair as well.  I have been using Shima Oil for about 2 years and it has dramatically changed the feel, the look and length of my hair.  This is the most wonderful product I have ever used.  Using it daily, as recommended, and protecting the hair ends is necessary to achieve the results you want.  I have achieved beautiful hair, thanks to this product.  I have had relaxed hair and loved the look and feel of my hair.  It helped greatly during my transition to my natural texture (3C- wavy).  I did not loose length at all.  In fact I gained it!  Whether I wear it straight or curly, Shima Oil is used every day.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, the smell is really nice and from just looking at it in the hand it looks exactly like water. But what i really love about it is the feel it has on the hair. It is very lightweight and does not sit on the hair. That&#x27;s what I hate the most about some products. They sit on the hair and weigh it down. Not so with this. It also leaves the hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> I love the Shima hair oil! The hair oil and non-greasy and smells great! I could tell the difference in my hair the first time I used it! I also purchased the shampoo and the hair line cream. These are also great products. The shampoo has strengthened my hair. I have a lot less shedding and my hair has grown longer.     Thank you Shima for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have used SHIMA OIL and Love It. I put it all over my head and then I put my hair back up in my protective style. I have been trying to get the thickness back in my head and by using tips from SHIMA my hair is coming a long way I have BSL.I am also perming my hair way less I used to do it every 6 weeks now I am stretching it out and trying to only do it twice a year. Thank You Shima :)</li>
    <li> Well I just started using so I&#x27;m waiting to see how well it works then I can give my stars&lt;br /&gt;When I see a difference then I can rate correctly.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many great things about the shima oil and i went on to purchased it. Omg i am so glad i did because my hair used to be so dry, but now when i used the shima oil it became so soft and shiny. And also what makes shima oil so good is that it&#x27;s not oily compared to the others...My bottle finish so quick in few weeks because i had brought the smallest size which is the 4 oz. Seeing how well my hair reacts to the oild i decided to buy the 8oz and now i am using it before going to bed. I takes lots of note when shima said that protective hairstyles helps with the oil to have long healthy hair. Ladies, She is not lying about it. I have seing so many growth and i am so happy with her oils, the creme, dvd&#x27;s and so forth. Thank you Shima.</li>
    <li> Hi. I came across Shima hair oil when I decided I wanted to grow my hair back. I know better than to feed into the so called \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair growth shams, but because Shima&#x27;s hair is long, I decided to give it a try. I purchased and recieved the oil about a week ago. Today is the first time I&#x27;m trying this oil and I will give another review in about 3-4weeks(to be fair). So... Lets get to the point: so far, the scent is nice and mild.It is very oily, so I suggest you dont put too much or oil about, maybe 3 or 4 parts of your scalp. I don&#x27;t feel an automatic fabulous result of softness, but again this is my very first use. You be the judge or wait until my next review in a few weeks. Catch you guys in the next review. Toodles!</li>
    <li> I was reviewing a biotin supplement when I ran across an ad for Shima.  I researched and saw before and after pics on youtube and the official website.  I said I would try it out and give it a shot because I want to grow my hair thicker and longer.  My hair currently is a little past arm pit length.  I bleached it back in September so I&#x27;m trying to restore it back to it&#x27;s luster.  I don&#x27;t wear a relaxer because my hair is naturally wavy and I want the option of wearing straight or wavy.  I needed an oil or moisturizer because blonde is a very drying color.  So I purchased the Shima oil and just started using it.  It makes my hair super shiny and it is very light on my hair.  I used the shampoo as well as the leave in conditioner and hairline cream.  I have to say that I love all of her line. The shampoo made my hair feel silky.  The leave in conditioner made my hair easier to comb and the hairline cream works good for buns and pony tails without drying your hair out like gel.  I&#x27;m going to use the shima oil and protective styling and check back in, in a few months.  I want to see how long I can grow my hair and how this product works in the process.  I also have a split-ender so I can clip my own ends without taking any of the length off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that everyone should try Shima hair products and the protective styling.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  After one use, I can truly see a difference.  My blonde looks nourished and healthy.  So I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and do a review in a few more months just to see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Just got my shipment of Shima oil, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I poured it into a spray bottle, sprayed it on and put on my silk scarf and went to sleep. The next morning, I could feel that my new growth felt AMAZINGLY soft!!! It felt soft and fluffy (I&#x27;m natural, and my hair SUCKS up moisture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write another review after I&#x27;ve been using for say a month. But I really noticed an immediate difference. The second day (I tend to OVER use stuff) I mixed it with a moisturizer that I&#x27;m trying to get rid of. The moisturizer doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair, but with the Shima oil, my hair felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I washed my hair, and put the shima oil on. I&#x27;ve got my silk scarf on right now, so I&#x27;m anxious to see how my hair feels in the morning. I get the sense that this not something you have to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, light scent, and absorbs quickly into the hair and skin so your hands do not feel greasy. I&#x27;m digging it so far.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my hair wigs weaves extensions my sister mom friends i love it, i even resale it to my customers :) best oil ever</li>
    <li> Shima oil did for me what it says it does. My hair is strong, shiny and manageable.  I love it! I plan on buying a few more bottles so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair and my 2 girls hair and I have seen such a difference in our hair.  The fragrance is good and not overwhemling and when you apply it to your hair it doesn&#x27;t just leave your hair looking super greasy.  I also can tell a diference in the length of my girls hair already!! When I comb it it is less hair in the comb very good for the ends as well.  I had been looking up Shima products for a while and wanted to order and looked on Amazon and here it was, so i couldn&#x27;t resist giving it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  My oldest hair is so tangly but since i&#x27;ve been using Shima Oil it is SO much manageable and easy to comb through.  I apply twice a day morning and night, and small drops go a long way so don&#x27;t over do it.  OH! and delivery was fast very pleased!!</li>
    <li> When i first found out about this oil i had my doubts so i decided to go on and buy it. My hair is the worse. It was very dry,damage,breaking not only at the ends but also the top part i had lost hair,even when i comb my hair cause i was never able to use a brush,so i never brought 1 my hair was comming out in Clumps. Yes Locks of Clumps. So when i got my Shima oil i sat right in front of my p.c and watched her video and went step by step as she explan it and this was in Nov 2010. I&#x27;ve been a regular buyer and i love telling my family and friends cause they give me the highest compliments about my hair. My hair im soo happy,soo proud and i must say this Thankyou Shima from the bottom of my Heart I brought me a Brush :) and im able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shima&#x27;s Oil made a big difference in my hair It stays soft, shiny, manageable and most of all I got that Booty-tip Length which my hair was a little pass bra strap when i started. I tossed away all my hair grease,gels,pressing irons. I don&#x27;t need it No more. I have all I need and thats My Shima Oil, My Shima Shampoo, and im waiting on my Scarf and trust me I don&#x27;t leave home with out my Shima Products. I love to fly so i went out and got lil-bottles to add my Shima Oil,Shampoo in so it won&#x27;t be no hassle getting on the Plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thankyou Shima for ur wonderful products and Videos, This is a Blessing!!!</li>
    <li> The oil makes the hair so soft.  I like to apply it on wet hair and dry hair.  It&#x27;s also very good for natural and relaxed hair. I&#x27;ve been using the Shima Oil for a while now and I always get the same results.</li>
    <li> well the story goes like this i have quite a few hair products i,m trying out at one time so this one is on hold for a couple of months.my hair is ill right now.&amp; i,m trying to nurse it back to health,but i have use the shima oil a few times &amp; i can tell u this it makes the hair smooth &amp; soft thats for sure.so i,m gonna hang on to this one,untill my wig recovers from its illness.then i,ll update on it.</li>
    <li> I started using Shima oil and hair creme line about one and a half weeks ago. I have gotten so many complements on how silky my hair looks that I&#x27;ll never use another product again. After I relax my hair I usually can&#x27;t use oil in my hair because my hair will look stringy but not with this oil. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the shampoo yet but I cant wait to see how it works for me if the oil is giving me this amazing results.[[ASIN:B004EMKRE4 Shima Oil (8oz) Double The Size!]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched some of Shima&#x27;s videos and decided to purchase the oil. I thought what do I have to lose. I love the oil!! I noticed a difference the same day I used it. I was so pleased with it that I got my older sister to try it and she&#x27;s hooked. I had to order a bottle for her. It really leaves the hair soft, moisturized and manageable.  I have noticed that I have very little hair loss when I comb my hair.   Thanks Shima.  A new \\&quot;Shima Girl\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It makes me feel good to know that I&#x27;m putting an healthy product into my hair and scalp on a daily basis. My goal is to obtain long healthy tresses just like Shima. I would highly recommend this product product. If your looking for healthy hair and soft subtle hair that will grow then this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I love the Shima oil! This oil is all natural and keeps my hair moisturized throughout the day. I apply it once in the morning and once at night. I&#x27;ve had this routine for about a month and my hair has been the healthiest it has ever been!! Shima hair works great on natural hair and I will be purchasing more products! Go ShimaHair!</li>
    <li> Shima hair oil is really awesome.   It partnered with her hair growth tips are invaluable for growing long beautiful hair.   The oil is non greasy and keeps the hair moisturized and shiny.  It is light enough to use every single day and I do use it everyday.      Great oil, if you want long, beautiful, shiny hair get this oil.  It&#x27;s Amazing.</li>
    <li> Been using  since April no hair growth. Love  the  shine it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this oil because of the reviews.  It&#x27;s a good oil,  very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Actually, this oil seems to penetrate.  What concerned me was my scalp itched like crazy.  I checked the ingredients, it&#x27;s the soybean oil; which is either first or second on the list.  Shima says not to use on the scalp, but I wrap at night so there&#x27;s no guarantee I won&#x27;t as I brush my wrap around.  So unless your scalp is soybean sensitive, I would recommend this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil these last two months and it has improved the health of my hair. This oil is very good to help retaining hair length and to moisturize the hair. I have less hair breakage. The oil smells very good too and don&#x27;t weight down the hair.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way just a few drops goes along way I use it to lock my moisturizer in my hair I&#x27;ve had it for a while I started with the smaller bottle I liked it so much I bought this bigger bottle it has all the essential oils I need</li>
    <li> Lightweight, smells nice, and moisturizing without weighting down your hair. A little bit goes a long way so the bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> Adding to my previous review found below - This product did not live up to the price. Did nothing for my hair...Don&#x27;t waste your precious money folks .......&lt;br /&gt;I received this unbelievably fast - huge + in my book. I&#x27;m transitioning from a Wave Nuveau perm to natural. Have been for over 1.5yrs. The product is very light and not too over-overbearingly fragrant (just right). I&#x27;m going to use this product as recommend on the label and in 6mths - 1yrs time I&#x27;ll see how things look at that point. I watched Shima&#x27;s video and others videos who used this product. So far, it&#x27;s quite nice on my hair. I&#x27;ll be back to review again in 6mths time.</li>
    <li> I just got it yesterday and it made my hair sooooo soft, im done with my old oils,shima is my new hair oil i will use for the rest of my life .....thanks shima</li>
    <li> I just transitioned to natural hair and although I had expectations of this making my hair instantly soft--I don&#x27;t think I really noticed a difference from other oils I have. I think this would work great on flat ironed hair, but I just didn&#x27;t see it on my freshly washed and dried natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side it does smell great, and really doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel to it. Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference my hair, I have full thick hair there was no difference in growth, I usually make my own oil mixtures from difference natural oils. Not sure about it maybe it did work and I just can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> I watched many Shima videos on YouTube before purchasing her oil. i keep my hair braided underneath extensions and my hair is natural, kind of a kinky curl or coil texture. Before using her oil when taking my hair down it was very unmanageable and extremely tangled, as natural kinky is. I would use Shima oil on my scalp every two weeks, by oiling my scalp adding a nozzle to the bottle to put the oil in between my braids. The results, my hair has grown tremendously and extremely fast. In the past two years, I have almost reached my hair goal, which is to have waist length hair. One side is there but the other side is so close but I&#x27;m going to give a few more months and I will be there.</li>
    <li> This hair oil smells good, and it does not leave the hair greasy. I have not seen any length as described, but it does leave my hair looking shinier and healthier.</li>
    <li> Awful product! Smells like cooking oil grease in your hair and very very very greasy. A mess to live with if you have long hair. Very heavy and stinks!</li>
    <li> My hair has been very dry lately. I have relaxed hair, and since my last relaxer nothing can provide enough moisture. Shima oil was something I bought a few months ago. Even within the first  month of using it, people at work noticed my hair growth. However, I am a product  junkie, so I stopped using it for a while. Nothing was working, until I remembered that I had a bottle of Shima&#x60;s miracle oil in the cabinet. I pulled it out just yesterday, and today my hair has not looked this good in months. It finally looks moisturized. Shima I will never forget you again! Just one word of advice! When some big company comes along trying to pick up your product, please don&#x27;t change your formula like everyone else does. You definitely have a good thing here. This product will definitely become a classic to go down in the history books.</li>
    <li> Nice product, thanks.</li>
    <li> I think this oil is very thin which is good for us fine haired gals.  However, it does not penetrate at all.  I don&#x27;t mean the hair shaft I mean it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well.  It sits on top of my hair and I have to really work to get it all rubbed in.  I think this product is better suited for strait relaxed hair.  I only use it when I&#x27;m  wearing a straight hair style and use it sparingly.  It does work nicely for a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Hi Shima!     Just received my FIRST bottle of your 80z Oil and i&#x27;m really impressed by the quality of the oil and how it soaks into my hair really well (FRAGRANCE SPOT ON TOO!!).  All the other oils on the market just seem to sit on the hair and make it greasy and weigh it down. I used regular Castor Oil on my hair for the first time whilst waiting for my Shima oil to arrive.  The castor oil I found to be very heavy and greasy.  This is much better for my hair!!!. I am living and breathing your words on protective styleing at present. I even dust trimmed my ends myself which was something I would ALWAYS leave to the professionals.     I just want to say a HUGE!!! thank you all the way from the U.K for helping us women out there in the world who struggle with Afro textured hair and making the process ALOT easier. I&#x27;m really confident that I will see some real changes by Summer, with your oil and by using the protective styling techniques.    If your from the U.K, Amazon.com dosen&#x27;t appear to send this product to the U.K.  Go to Shima&#x27;s web page and order direct from her. It was a pretty quick service (I waited a week for it to be sent to London).    kind Regards    Nicx1</li>
    <li> I have been following Shima for 2 years on YouTube. When I started viewing her show, I was very depressed because my hair grew very long and then in one salon visit, an enormous amount of hair broke off. I stayed in bed for 2 weeks and cried almost every day. At that moment, I decided to go on a mission to TAKE CARE OF MY OWN HAIR AND NOT GO TO SALONS. I was obsessed. I watched every YouTube video I could find on hair care and hair growth. When I found Shima&#x27;s channel, I felt like I found nirvana. She is more knowledgeable than most hair stylists ( I know because I have been on this earth a long time and have traveled extensively,and have SEEN IT ALL. Hence, my name on YouTube...earth2air2water). I listen to her advice and follow her instructions and now my hair is the longest it has ever been in my life. I cannot believe how long and healthy it is.  Everyone around me thinks my hair is a weave or a wig ! I have to dig into my hair to show them my scalp.  Shima is kind and genuine, and I trust what she says. The proof is in the pudding. She is the real deal ! She has the beautiful hair to back up her products. I cannot wait to purchase her oil.</li>
    <li> I really love the fact that this product is being sold in an 8oz. bottle. It&#x27;s much more convenient to have a bottle that&#x27;s this size because that means that you can use it twice a day and not have to worry about using it up so fast. I use it once in the morning and once at night before I go to bed. My hair is so soft and much more stronger than before I used it. I have noticed a lot more hair growth as well. This is one of the best hair growth oils that I&#x27;ve ever used. Thank you Shima for creating such a much needed product for our African American hair!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many oil treatments some good but nothing like this one. I&#x27;m a believer and I&#x27;m hooked!!! From the firt application I felt a difference in my hair and I have been now using it for a week and I can&#x27;t believe how soft and manageable my hair is. If your thinking about trying it, please do!!! I&#x27;m going to now try the shampoo and conditioner DVD combo! Thank you Shima!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with my natural hair for about 6 months now after hiding under weaves for about 2 years. I have been a big product junkie the whole time so when I saw the reviews for this I thought this product would be perfect for a fellow natural haired gal. The picture of a women with such a long mane self prompting her product I felt confident in the results. I was a little disappointed when I tried to use it as a moisturizer for my styling. I usually wet my hair, de-tangle and braid sections before bed. Well I put this stuff on my hair while wet to assist with de-tangling and it kind of made my hair sticky. It did not aid in the process of getting the tangles out since it made my hair stick together more than moisturize it while helping separate, like a normal oil or lotion would. So to say I have found use for this product would be a lie so I&#x27;m happy I bought the small portion. Not saying this is a bad product but not useful to me. Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I was using it wrong though!</li>
    <li> Very light oil and its working my hair I use it every night. Very lightly. On wash days I use it as a 15 minute treatment too</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  This oil is good.  It made my hair soft and manageable, and it eliminated dryness, but pure coconut oil does the same thing for half the price and it is all natural.  I don&#x27;t know what is in Shima Oil.</li>
    <li> .I must say now I am a shima girl ! It really works. It will grow your hair. Wonderful product I now have my sister using it too</li>
    <li> This product definitely gives shine, moisture, and I have seen growth results. I recommend this product to anyone who is trying to bring life back to their dull/dry and overly-processed hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shima Oil for a year. It&#x27;s one of the few oils that I like for my hair. It&#x27;s light and pleasant smelling. It can be used on wet hair even though instructions say use on dry hair. My hair has grown 7in. in 10 months. I also mix Shima oil with my Wen product and get a wonderful deep conditioner. If your hair is dry and/or breaking off give Shima a try!</li>
    <li> I really have not used it long enough for the price I wil lnot get it again. At least at this time that is how I feel.</li>
    <li> This oil does seem to make my hair very soft but I cannot say that I have seen any growth yet. I will keep using it, I am only about half way through the bottle.</li>
    <li> was as if i put water in my hair. it made it dry and created dandruff. recommended oil but didn&#x27;t recommend cream to family.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have continued to use this product but I had an allergic reaction from this product.</li>
    <li> this rip off. your better off mixing your own oils. please don&#x27;t buy. if u have&lt;br /&gt;money to waste, then go ahead. for those who want to save, don&#x27;t purchase!</li>
    <li> Primarily, I never got used to the smell of the oil but also felt that it wasn&#x27;t doing the job it&#x27;s described to do for my type 3c/4a/b hair. Gave it a chance over 3 months and yes, it kept my hair shiny but soon enough wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
    <li> i dont think it makes your hair grow fast. I cant use this product every day it makes my hair soo oily and put sores in my hair.. so i only use it for a leave in conditioner every 2 weeks. i would not buy this product again though..</li>
    <li> I came across this product through amazon recommendations and was intrigued. I had alopecia caused by the psoriasis on my scalp as a result I lost my hair 5 times in 4 years. Now my doctor has me on Humaira so it corrected the psoriasis and the resulting alopecia. So I have been growing my hair back for the past two years; My hair is natural and I press and flat iron it to straighten it when I wear it straight; but it hit the shoulder length plateau and wouldn&#x27;t get healthy length beyond that. I started using this product about a year ago and the length and fullness that I had in my youth has now been recaptured. Shima oil is lightweight non-greasy can be used every day. (Personally I use it twice a day) and it has a light fresh sent. I highly recommend this product; It truly works. I figure once I hit the mid-back below the bra line level, I&#x27;ll be content and maybe I will put my friends and family one to my \\&quot;Shima\\&quot; secret as for you out in amazon land get this product it works.</li>
    <li> This product is great it adds shine and moisture to your hair and doesn&#x27;t add any weight to your hair this oil is light and amazing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really make a difference in my hair. And was too expensive for the price I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Ok I like Shima oil smells nice light-weight and I DO SEE NEW  but I think I can have the same  thing if I use castor oil  but I may by from time to time . But i cant have it on my face cuz it broke out my forehead.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to seal my hair after I moisturize my hair and its great. I also use it as part of my daughter&#x27;s scalp oil mixed with castor oil and its great.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if the product works but the packaging was terrible. It spilled.</li>
