      <li>I will be happy to give my best answer.</li>
      <li>brilliant service, brilliant product</li>
      <li>My skin feels good and looks great!</li>
      <li>Lol...  </li>
      <li>also like the attractive</li>
      <li>/&gt;Check out the environmental working group website if you want to look up any ingredients of products - it is a great resource.</li>
      <li>lol.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>This cream has a pleasant texture and is soothing to the face when applied.</li>
      <li>Reviewing this product I can say that this lotion feels like it is doing something and smells pleasant to put on.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t that sound like just the perfect thing to rub into your skin??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was expecting to have the skin on my face and neck look and feel healthier, and was delighted with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>good quality.</li>
      <li>Keeping your skin hydrated, though, is a good start, and this one seems to do the job without the greasiness.  </li>
      <li>Now that I have tried it, I&#x27;m especially happy that I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
      <li>The cream is very nice, I will say the scent is pleasant and by no means overpowering...very light.  </li>
      <li>and I hope this will be published because as i see it the review is as fair or more so than some of the others I read.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Very nice product.</li>
      <li>I can just honestly say that my skin looks brighter and rosier..</li>
      <li>It feels good for the most part and takes away the &#x27;puffiness and &#x27;drooping&#x27; look a bit&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Maybe the hefty list price--hitting almost the hundred-dollar mark--wants you to believe it&#x27;s going to work some miracles, but this is a long-shot from any kind of miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
      <li>The texture of this cream is nice.  </li>
      <li>This face cream has a nice \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it and moisturizes well</li>
      <li>For example - I had to laugh when I read the comment from the person who has to \\&quot;put her/his fingers in the jar to get out the cream and how this introduces bacteria into the product\\&quot;!!!  </li>
      <li>The first time I put it on, it does feel very good on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great for guys, as there is NO perfume that I can detect, and is VERY easy to apply, even under the eye area.</li>
      <li>It would also be good for those who can&#x27;t tolerate anything greasy - this is not at all greasy - it leaves skin feeling clean - no greasy or oily feeling on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The texture is very smooth and creamy and does not burn or tingle, it appears to work well as a moisturizer (that is a plus).  </li>
      <li>It feels good going on and disappears quickly into the skin.  </li>
      <li>although mostly just my forehead and around my eyes).  </li>
      <li>I like to use moisturizers under my makeup because they help my makeup go on better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they must use oil in their cars...</li>
      <li>Like I said, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any magic solution to aging.  </li>
      <li>Friends asked me what I was using - said I looked healthy and my complexion glowed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The areas also felt tingly for a bit, hopefully signaling to me that they were doing something magical.  </li>
      <li>I think this cream is just okay</li>
      <li>or that makes my skin feel and look better while using it.</li>
      <li>The product states many benefits that \\&quot;should\\&quot; be seen with continued use for 12 weeks, maybe I did not give this product the time it requires.  </li>
      <li>I could go on and on with this ingredient list, but I&#x27;ll just do one more:</li>
      <li>I hope my nose doesn&#x27;t wrinkle up like a prune! :-)  </li>
      <li>I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, and it makes my skin feel softer, but otherwise I think there are much better options out there.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to search for the fountain of youth and hope it comes before I get too many wrinkles.</li>
      <li>when I was 20 and with continued use hopefully it will prevent more damage.  </li>
      <li>This is ok.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>and he has a lot more wrinkles than me.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These products are interesting.</li>
      <li>and I like that product much better.  </li>
      <li>Hydroxatone is best known for infomercials and home shopping presentations, and is at the upper end, cost</li>
      <li>have used it for many years; works well.</li>
      <li>I like these products I find them to not be much better than drug store moisturizers I have used.</li>
      <li>It seems to be doing a better job on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;An excellent fragrance-free, non-irritating, facial moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Ok okay...</li>
      <li>The most plentiful ingredient in this cream is water so you can tell instantly it won&#x27;t be as potent as you&#x27;re hoping.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no greasiness to the cream at all, just skin that appears very clean and</li>
      <li>I think my mostly wrinkle free face at 42 can be solely attributed to genetics.  </li>
      <li>But it sure better be doing a LOT more than those creams to be worth the pricey price.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say that it might not do some good over much time, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be any noticeable immediate changes, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be.  </li>
      <li>Good luck all and thanks for reading this review.  </li>
      <li>Makeup is easily applied over cream.</li>
      <li>It spreads easily on your face.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with how quickly it was absorbed by my skin leaving it feeling nicely hydrated throughout the day without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cream is easy to apply, not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about 8 weeks and do not feel I can report any changes with my skin texture, fine lines or wrinkles, radiance etc.  </li>
      <li>It was non-oily and went on easy and lightly.</li>
      <li>so I would think that an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; cream would help get rid of fine wrinkles.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t have a huge wrinkle problem yet, just the start of a wrinkle problem.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think my face would be a huge challenge for a cream that cost what this cream does per ounce.  </li>
      <li>I was in NO WAY asked to write this review or given any free products to do so.  </li>
      <li>It feels light on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have found that Hydroxatone is very happy to take products back and my return money was VERY prompt.  </li>
      <li>why on earth would this be a significant ingredient in  an anti-wrinkle cream that is supposed to be hydrating?</li>
      <li>and then your hands will be clean</li>
      <li>I had  special  </li>
      <li>particular cream, though, went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t greasy like most creams.  </li>
      <li>I have wrinkles on my forehead, and fine lines around my eyes when I smile or laugh.  </li>
      <li>I TRY my very best to live as GREEN as possible and it is easy to become critical of those who aren&#x27;t perfect if we somehow think we are.  </li>
      <li>Lol...wash your hands first , better yet wash your face first</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using alpha-hydroxy products for several years and have been very pleased with the way they make my skin look and feel</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable paying higher prices for cream that I don&#x27;t feel is working</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how much it works!!</li>
      <li>Does not do much for fine crow feet type lines at all.</li>
      <li>Also, this is really isn&#x27;t relevant to the product but the container it comes in is a modern day masterpiece of plastic molding meets elegance.  </li>
      <li>Avon sells creams for a fraction of the cost that do a far better job at firming the skin and reducing wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s get straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not advocating &#x27;perfume&#x27; or anything similar as the ne plus ultra of fragrant smells however, loitions--good ones--typically do not smell good.</li>
      <li>I rarely have bags under my eyes, but I did yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My core concern is the price, it would be nice to see a larger size, or price adjustment of some sort.</li>
      <li>and it dries pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I use it right before bed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my own fault, like another product I selected the same day, I didn&#x27;t look up the ingredients first and instead trusted the product</li>
      <li>the cream is massaged in, you feel your face tighten ever so slightly; leaving a fresh clean feeling that looks healthy!</li>
      <li>My feeling is that paying more than $20 for this is paying too much if you are actually looking to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just received the product and I am not satisfied. This like a left over and sealed again by scotch tape with Hydoxatone level in it, Previously I order this product not from Amazon and product is in good condition.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this for my wife (44 years old).  Here&#x27;s what she has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;An excellent fragrance-free, non-irritating, facial moisturizer.  Would definitely order again.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The texture of this cream is nice.  It spreads easily on your face.  I use it in the mornings under my makeup.  The one complaint I have is it does not leave your face smooth.  You can hardly tell it&#x27;s on.  I like to use moisturizers under my makeup because they help my makeup go on better.  This does not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product along with the night moisturizer as well.  I have noticed my wrinkles seem to be a little less pronounced.  I&#x27;m not sure which product has helped the most.  But, together there has been improvement.  Nothing major but an improvement.  I&#x27;ve used it about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like these products I find them to not be much better than drug store moisturizers I have used.</li>
    <li> I have used this entire product, morning and evening...and I am disappointed to say I have seen no difference in...well, anything.  I have used this for about 8 weeks and do not feel I can report any changes with my skin texture, fine lines or wrinkles, radiance etc.  The cream is very nice, I will say the scent is pleasant and by no means overpowering...very light.  The texture is very smooth and creamy and does not burn or tingle, it appears to work well as a moisturizer (that is a plus).  But to report on some miraculous changes in my skins appearance, I don&#x27;t see anything.  Maybe if this is used for years you may or may not get the wrinkles you would have gotten without its use?!  However, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable paying higher prices for cream that I don&#x27;t feel is working or that makes my skin feel and look better while using it. The product states many benefits that \\&quot;should\\&quot; be seen with continued use for 12 weeks, maybe I did not give this product the time it requires.  Also, the product says that \\&quot;with a twice-daily regimen you will not only see the wrinkles reduce but see your skin tone become more radiant day after day\\&quot;...this to me says I should have saw \\&quot;something\\&quot; change.</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant texture and is soothing to the face when applied. It also leaves the skin glowing and with a feeling of elasticity. Makeup is easily applied over cream. This is a skin product that will prove its quality over time, but I&#x27;m optimistic about daily use in a regular makeup routine. Matching a product to a particular skin type is always unpredictable, but so far, this product has proven a wise choice. Long term benefits may be another bonus from long term use of this product. Luan Gaines/2013.</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex did a good job of smoothing out fine lines and \\&quot;happy\\&quot; wrinkles around my mouth as well as brightening my complexion. I was pleased with how quickly it was absorbed by my skin leaving it feeling nicely hydrated throughout the day without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my skin looking less dull and brighter after using it for several days. Areas of my face that are prone to excessive dryness and flaking are now smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I used this product diligently as directed.  It goes on nicely and has a pleasant fragrance, but otherwise was no better than far less expensive products that I have used. After seeing the advertisements for this product on television, I was very anxious to try it.  Now that I have tried it, I&#x27;m especially happy that I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
    <li> This product goes on very well and leaves the skin with a soft and smooth feel.  A little cream goes quite a long way which is important from a value perspective.  I can&#x27;t testify as to if this product is actually effective in getting rid of wrinkles but it leaves the face with a tingly feeling and slightly refreshed.  There is no real fragrance which is also nice.  Also, this is really isn&#x27;t relevant to the product but the container it comes in is a modern day masterpiece of plastic molding meets elegance.  Its literally the Apple Ipod of face cream containers.</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex [[ASIN:B004UQPCGM Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex]] is a very light cream with very little scent which I&#x27;ve found nice for day and night use. There is no burn at all, which I though I might expect since it does have some acids in it and it&#x27;s an anti-wrinkle cream, but I&#x27;ve found no discomfort what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to massage in a light coating of the cream over face, neck, and decolotte avoiding very near the eyes - which I fully understand because I did use it above my eyes one night and then used eye drops - big mistake - the cream burned my eyes so I didn&#x27;t repeat that mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Once the cream is massaged in, you feel your face tighten ever so slightly; leaving a fresh clean feeling that looks healthy! Friends asked me what I was using - said I looked healthy and my complexion glowed. There&#x27;s no greasiness to the cream at all, just skin that appears very clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex is a great everyday day and night cream, and I&#x27;d recommend it to others who&#x27;d be interested in trying it. Especially those who want a cream which has very little if any scent because there is no scent or a barely imperceptible scent to the Hydroxatone. It would also be good for those who can&#x27;t tolerate anything greasy - this is not at all greasy - it leaves skin feeling clean - no greasy or oily feeling on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product very much because it was light, had little smell, and didn&#x27;t cause any breakout. I&#x27;d recommend it to those who would normally spend $70+ for a cream. I&#x27;m not one who would do so unless I saw a significant difference in wrinkles, and although I saw some improvement over time in the color of my complexion, I saw no real difference in the wrinkles to my 50 year old skin. I will continue to search for the fountain of youth and hope it comes before I get too many wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using alpha-hydroxy products for several years and have been very pleased with the way they make my skin look and feel so I thought I&#x27;d give this alternative a try. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. It absorbs quickly with very little stinging (I have very sensitive skin so that&#x27;s a consideration for me) and I definitely notice an improvement in the elasticity and texture of my skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to provide quite enough moisture for my dry winter skin so I usually let it absorb and then apply a layer of my usual moisturizer over it. I was starting to form little crow&#x27;s feet, and after regular use I am pretty sure their appearance is significantly reduced, which is really pleasing... if it&#x27;s any testimonial, I had a much younger literally gasp and scream \\&quot;no WAY!\\&quot; last week when she asked how old I am, and I told her... she said she&#x27;d assumed I was ten years younger. Nice!</li>
    <li> Although the container is a pretty vibrant blue one to display on the front shelf in the medicine cabinet, Hydroxatone&#x27;s Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex is one to park way in the back on the shelf. To me, this was just another super wrinkle fix product that did not live up to the manufacturer&#x27;s exaggerated claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I like the consistency, the subtle, almost sweet aroma of the cream, but did it help my skin&#x27;s overall appearance, reduce wrinkles, and firm up the aging skin? No way.  Maybe the hefty list price--hitting almost the hundred-dollar mark--wants you to believe it&#x27;s going to work some miracles, but this is a long-shot from any kind of miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it seems to moisturize well. Maybe the cream does optimize collagen, as the manufacturer claims, but for that price? No, thanks. Avon sells creams for a fraction of the cost that do a far better job at firming the skin and reducing wrinkles. Come to think of it, instead of sitting on a back shelf in the medicine cabinet, this cream should sit permanently--in the dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an anti-wrinkle cream, this is not it. I&#x27;ve started developing wrinkles recently, especially in the forehead area and by my eyes so I would think that an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; cream would help get rid of fine wrinkles. The first time I put it on, it does feel very good on my skin. It was non-oily and went on easy and lightly. It did help in moisturizing my face and at first, I thought I saw some improvement. However, as I continued to use this, it seem to be worse and worse. Instead of making the problem better, I think I still have quite a bit, if not more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had my husband try some and he has a lot more wrinkles than me. However, I didn&#x27;t see any changes in using this product. You&#x27;re also instructed to put this on twice during the day and during the night. I don&#x27;t always have time to apply this during the day so I just do it once at night. However, my thought is if this is really suppose to be intensive and so expensive, then once should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any changes with this cream and if you want a really expensive moisturizer then you can get this.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting to see a change. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and am wondering when I will see a change. Even a slight one.</li>
    <li> I received the Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream from Amazon Vine. The Packaging is nice--a blue plastic jar with silver top--but it makes it look like you get more cream than you actually do. The cream is easy to apply, not sticky at all. My wrinkles did not disappear. I have no idea if it will prevent wrinkles but it works well as a moisturizer. That being said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than cheaper creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past. The price seems very high for what it does.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I&#x27;ve seen it advertised on TV quite a bit, so I had high expectations based on those advertisements. I applied this once every day until I used it all up, and I saw absolutely no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t like the way it felt when applied, or the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend [[ASIN:B00008ZPG9 Olay Regenerist Cream]] instead.</li>
    <li> Summary&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. I don&#x27;t use any other creams since I began to purchase the hydroxatone line.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydroxatone products for about 8 years and I can&#x27;t tell you how much it works!! I always get comments that I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.....and I&#x27;m 49!!! I highly recommend this Intensive cream for in between the regular AM/PM wrinkle cream...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the few wrinkles on my 50 year old skin to disappear but I was expecting to have the skin on my face and neck look and feel healthier, and was delighted with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the attractive container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can afford it, I will keep on using daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself, I can&#x27;t imagine you will be unhappy with the result.</li>
    <li> I am 42 years old and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. Ok okay...I have one worry wrinkle on my forehead which was barely noticeable before and I have noticed no difference in that wrinkle. I call him \\&quot;Wink\\&quot;.  One must embrace aging, but I never could embrace it wholeheartedly with my dull drab complexion.  My skin was starting to look grayish.  (I am Caucasian...so this was bad!)  It just looked dull and blah.  I noticed that I was applying more color to my face and still...midway through the day my skin just looked flat and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex  has given my skin LIFE.  I know this sounds insane...but my skin looks plump and younger and has a pink tone to it now. I wash my face every evening after work and apply this product to it and let it fully soak into my skin each evening before I lay down on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback for me...breaking out on my nose.  So...I stopped using it on my nose. I hope my nose doesn&#x27;t wrinkle up like a prune! :-)  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to Wink though.  I can just honestly say that my skin looks brighter and rosier..there&#x27;s a natural pink glow to my cheeks now.  And no it&#x27;s not a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, even this is no miracle in a jar.  I think my mostly wrinkle free face at 42 can be solely attributed to genetics.  If you have a question about the product that no one has answered, ask...I will be happy to give my best answer.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, eventually you get to an age where no cream on the planet is going to get rid of those wrinkles but I&#x27;ve been using this cream for awhile and I am seeing some improvement.  I&#x27;m 53 and have deep wrinkles between my eyes and around my mouth.  The lines between my eyes have shown the most improvement while the ones around my lips the least.  Frankly,  I&#x27;m surprised that the cream has had any effect at all on the wrinkles around my mouth because I&#x27;ve tried every cream and serum I could afford on those and, before now, I&#x27;d never seen any improvement at all.  Granted the improvement is slight but, outside of a facelift, it&#x27;s probably as good as it&#x27;s going to get.  I think I should start saving for my next jar now (it is a little pricey-after all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream can sting a little when applied, has a thick consistancy which quickly melts into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a fragrance.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any rashes or signs of sensitivity.</li>
    <li> brilliant service, brilliant product</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because of I actually found a lot of humor in some of the reviews regarding Hydroxatone Intensive Cream.  I have not started this product but did order it even after reading all of these reviews.  WHY?  Well because I have been using other Hydroxatone products for the past 6-8 weeks and for the first time that I can remember I got a comment on how rested I looked and how my skin was glowing and that was from someone who never really comments much on how I look.  I found many of the reviews of the Intensive Cream really not based on the product itself.  For example - I had to laugh when I read the comment from the person who has to \\&quot;put her/his fingers in the jar to get out the cream and how this introduces bacteria into the product\\&quot;!!!  Lol...wash your hands first , better yet wash your face first and then your hands will be clean and if you are not comfortable with that get one of those little spatulas for a few cents or the end of a plastic spoon or a QTip to reach into the jar.  Oh but you might have to use your hands to rub it on your face. Applying face cream is not a sterile technique - take it from an RN of 20+ years of service.  Well you can always use rubber gloves...&lt;br /&gt;Then..I just read one that the person complained that there was \\&quot;not enough in the jar\\&quot;.  Well it does say just how much you are buying for example 0.5oz, 1 oz etc.  Did you really expect to open it up and find 16 oz somehow squished into that little jar?&lt;br /&gt;Then there was someone who went into a BIG - VERY BIG scientific approach.  I don&#x27;t even know where to start with that one.  Many personal care products have water as a first ingredient which was a complaint of that person.  He/she questioned the purity of the product.  I have not seen ANY claims from Hydroxatone that their products are Organic in any fashion.  Most of us fighting these deep wrinkles - I believe - are willing to use a non-organic product and know that is what we have chosen.  I would also bereal curious about this persons life style and would like to know if they drive a car or walk to work to protect the enviroment.  Do they have carpet with nasty chemicals in their home or have they used other chemicals on their hardwood floors.  Is their privacy fence treated to prevent rotting or bug infestations.  How do they take care of their lawns?  Chemicals to keep weeds out?  Do they use a whole house water filtration system to filter all the chlorine and other chemicals out of all the water that comes into their home?  Hey don&#x27;t get me wrong here.  I TRY my very best to live as GREEN as possible and it is easy to become critical of those who aren&#x27;t perfect if we somehow think we are.  I&#x27;m sure they must use oil in their cars...where does that come from?  Anyway you get my drift on that one.&lt;br /&gt;THEN there were those who complained that the JAR WAS TO BIG!!!!  It sort of faked em out - you know what i mean?  Made em think that WHOLE  container would be full of cream until they opened it up and were ever so disappointed to find - once again - that all that was in there was the one ounce just as advertised.  How can a person use half a jar in just three days?  This is NOT a body cream nor is it for your pet elephant.  lol.....&lt;br /&gt;As far as the prices that a lot of people complained about...I have found that Hydroxatone is very happy to take products back and my return money was VERY prompt.  I have also gotten some wonderful deals from them and some promo products.  NO...I was in NO WAY asked to write this review or given any free products to do so.  I sort of wonder if this will even be published because I am taking an alternative approach here about Hydroxatone products as well as questioning lower ratings for some of the things I mentioned above.  Also I am not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;Oh before I forget.  I am 58 years old.  The lines around my mouth are deep.  Guess I should have quit smiling while I was ahead.  Lol...  I also have deep lines between my eyes.  I guess I am like everyone else hoping for something that will really work.  Who really thinks that a product will take away all of our years of smiling, crying, stress. sunbathing, night life  etc etc in 2 weeks???  I saw one review that the lady was upset over this so that also brought into question what are we eating...foods with all sorts of pesticides, smoking, not sleeping well, alcohol - how frequently???  Do we exercise?  ALL of those things as well as hormones and heredity have an effect on how we look.&lt;br /&gt;So I am giving Hydroxatone Intensive Cream a 5 star rating even though I have not yet started it and I hope this will be published because as i see it the review is as fair or more so than some of the others I read.  The cream  will be in the mail this week and I look forward to starting the Hydroxatone Intensive Cream.  Why a 5 star?  Because I have seen visible results after several weeks of using Hydroxatone Facial wash, toner, AM/PM cream, Intensive under eye cream and deep wrinkle serum and I know my skin will never look like it did when I was 20 and with continued use hopefully it will prevent more damage.  I love the Hydroxatone  BB cream with 40 spf and it is the first foundation type of product that I have ever been able to use since all the others make my lines look worse than they even are.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately NO product is going to do all it claims....that is just life and business.  Once again this is the best I have used and I hope this review might be helpful to someone else as well as help people think about what they are saying when they review a product.  It is really sad to know that reviews can now be bought and sold.  Just because you have to put your fingers in the jar is not a reason - in my book - to give a product a 3 star rating or what ever it was that they gave the product.  Perhaps some people just look at the stars and don&#x27;t take time to read the reviews and really think about why a product mayhave 3 stars or whatever.  I can&#x27;t see myself switching for at least a year.  I think that is giving the product time to really work to it&#x27;s fullest potential.  Good luck all and thanks for reading this review.  Hope you found both some humor and some truth in it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and so my first concern with creams is whether or not they will make my skin greasy. This cream is thick and heavy; but not greasy. It glided on my skin without making my skin feel nasty. It actually made my skin rather soft and silky. It also made my skin feel tighter (particularly under my eyes). As for wrinkles, I only have a few fine lines and this did not make them disappear. Whether or not it prevents new lines is anyone&#x27;s guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue with this product is that it is extremely over-priced even at the Amazon discount price. The container is small and it is bulky plastic. When you open it up, you realize that the container holds about half of what it looks like it holds. My container was also only about half full. With me putting this on my face and neck twice a day, it will only last a month or two at most. I feel like I get the same benefits from a Retinol cream at a much better price. I personally like [[ASIN:B0067H6KW2 Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum, 1 Ounce]] which is currently less than $15 on Amazon. I would never buy any Hydroxatone products at their current prices.</li>
    <li> Finally, a wrinkle complex that works! I can tell a difference in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using this product! It goes on nice and smooth and is not greasy at all. It feels light on my skin. I use it right before bed and it dries pretty quickly. My skin feels good and looks great!</li>
    <li> For nearly $100 per ounce, I really expected small miracles from this product. I don&#x27;t really have a ton of wrinkles or anything at this point, but do have some fine lines near and around my eyes. I decided I would use this every day (once in the morning and once at night)on those areas to see if there would be any noticeable difference. While it has not been quite a month yet, I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever. The cream is super concentrated and feels nice on the skin, and it does seem to absorb pretty quickly, but I just don&#x27;t see how anyone would pay such a price for a cream that probably works only just as well as something like Eucerin. I think as Americans we often think that if something is expensive enough that it MUST work. That is a failed logic and this product proves it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying it is not a quality product. I believe it is; but it is not worth $100. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have just realized the price has gone down to $70+. My feeling is that paying more than $20 for this is paying too much if you are actually looking to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines...</li>
    <li> Makes my skin wonderful , love this product !!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my own fault, like another product I selected the same day, I didn&#x27;t look up the ingredients first and instead trusted the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived, I read the ingredients and I knew I&#x27;d made a big mistake...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has Cyclotetrasiloxane as it&#x27;s 4th ingredient. (Ingredients are listed from most to least, top to bottom of the list, this means the stuff at the top is what it&#x27;s mostly made of and as you go down there is less and less of whatever is listed) The environmental working group (EWG), a non-profit that investigates the toxicity of chemicals used in cosmetics and other consumer products, says that Cyclotetrasiloxane  causes: \\&quot;Endocrine disruption, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Persistence and bioaccumulation\\&quot;. The 5th ingredient is Cetearyl Alcohol, alcohol is not hydrating, it&#x27;s drying - why on earth would this be a significant ingredient in  an anti-wrinkle cream that is supposed to be hydrating? I could go on and on with this ingredient list, but I&#x27;ll just do one more: Butylene Glycol - causes: Irritation (skin, eyes, lungs) - wow! Doesn&#x27;t that sound like just the perfect thing to rub into your skin??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the environmental working group website if you want to look up any ingredients of products - it is a great resource. Just remember to do it before you buy something, which is what I should have done before ordering this.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I&#x27;ve been applying it on my forehead area to see if I could smooth out some of the little wrinkles there.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference.  Maybe my skin is a little bit smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels a little greasy after I apply this.  It doesn&#x27;t glide on my skin as well as some of the other Hydroxatone products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using [[ASIN:B0038T184W Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex, Sensitive]] and I like that product much better.  It seems to be doing a better job on my skin.</li>
    <li> have used it for many years; works well.</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone is best known for infomercials and home shopping presentations, and is at the upper end, cost wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While nothing lasts forever, I do note that this particular formula has good enough almost instant results, but nothing long-term if you forget to apply it (fair enough, it is a COSMETIC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for guys, as there is NO perfume that I can detect, and is VERY easy to apply, even under the eye area. I found the most dramatic results with forehead lines and the \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; - really outstanding, as a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the jar, but it is typical package for high-end, luxe  cosmetics.  A VERY little bit goes a LONG way, and as with ANY good wrinkle reduction product, you do NOT need to \\&quot;slather\\&quot; it on-- if you do, you will not care for the result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be terrific for a pre-photo-shoot, or business meeting, when you need that extra edge. I like it better than I thought I would.  My core concern is the price, it would be nice to see a larger size, or price adjustment of some sort. Might be hard to afford, as the months go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does work well, and one only needs little bit to get noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex comes in a one ounce blue plastic jar with silver top that looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  The directions say to massage a thin layer over your face and neck after cleansing.  I gave this product several weeks to do its magic, and used it religiously and properly. Unfortunately, it did no more than any cheap cream would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is light and has nice, slightly fruity scent.  It feels good going on and disappears quickly into the skin.  It just didn&#x27;t do a thing for my wrinkles.  I have wrinkles on my forehead, and fine lines around my eyes when I smile or laugh.  I had  special  photos  taken yesterday, and I put an extra dab of this cream on my face the night before, and actually woke up with puffy eyes that looked horrendous.  I rarely have bags under my eyes, but I did yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pictures were taken and I was horrified and embarrassed by my wrinkled face as the photographer and I looked over the pictures together.  Of course, she will edit those wrinkles out of the pictures, but I can&#x27;t edit the wrinkles off of my face.  I wish.  And I don&#x27;t have a huge wrinkle problem yet, just the start of a wrinkle problem.  I have never been a sun worshiper and have never smoked.  I don&#x27;t think my face would be a huge challenge for a cream that cost what this cream does per ounce.  But it did nothing.  The proof is in my portraits.  I&#x27;m seriously considering surgery now.</li>
    <li> This face cream has a nice \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it and moisturizes well but I cannot see a difference in wrinkles.  I think this cream is just okay and is high priced for what it claims to do</li>
    <li> Is there truly anything that can turn back time?  (Other than [[ASIN:B000WOQZ8U Cher]], of course.)  I&#x27;ve been using Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex both day and night for about a month now.  Have I noticed any difference?  Not really.  That&#x27;s not to say that it might not do some good over much time, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be any noticeable immediate changes, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be.  We get older, we get wrinkles, case closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular cream, though, went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t greasy like most creams.  It immediately absorbed into the skin and felt dry to the touch, so I felt comfortable applying it to my entire face (although mostly just my forehead and around my eyes).  Usually I&#x27;m afraid to apply any creams to my face (other than my eyes) because the greasiness makes me break out.  This one didn&#x27;t, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The areas also felt tingly for a bit, hopefully signaling to me that they were doing something magical.  Are they?  Hard to tell.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any magic solution to aging.  Keeping your skin hydrated, though, is a good start, and this one seems to do the job without the greasiness.  Is it better than creams that are priced 10 times less?  Again, it&#x27;s hard to tell.  But it sure better be doing a LOT more than those creams to be worth the pricey price.</li>
    <li> The most plentiful ingredient in this cream is water so you can tell instantly it won&#x27;t be as potent as you&#x27;re hoping. I faithfully used it and spread it on my face morning &amp; night for over four weeks and while it moisturized nicely and smelled pleasant it merely gave my makeup something to cling to and helped my skin look less dry. It didn&#x27;t lessen the overall depth of my wrinkles and it may help prevent future wrinkles since my skin was protected from drying out. I could never justify the price per use and would stick with my usual drugstore brand over this jar of glorified face cream.</li>
    <li> So as the title implies, I&#x27;m not sure how much this stuff is helping.  Sometimes I think I notice a difference, but at other times, I think it&#x27;s just in my head.  But really, I don&#x27;t think that I can recommend it to potential buyers, just because it&#x27;s so expensive (for my budget at least), and the results are minor at best.  I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, and it makes my skin feel softer, but otherwise I think there are much better options out there.  Unfortunately, most of those are even more expensive!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not advocating &#x27;perfume&#x27; or anything similar as the ne plus ultra of fragrant smells however, loitions--good ones--typically do not smell good. This particular one--the Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream--is not bad, and actually a little above pleasant. In general, this is a big issue for me as I would turn away from a product that I had to almost plug up my nose to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporting no major or minor side-effects using this cream, you will notice it doing something to your skin upon application. The face definitely feels tight after rubbing on your skin, and it seems to breath cool air all around you--liken to menthol. It feels good for the most part and takes away the &#x27;puffiness and &#x27;drooping&#x27; look a bit&#x27;. Nothing adverse was produced anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: ?/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I want to tell you one way or the other, I saw no improvement really in the wrinkles either good or bad. Note that I have not gotten through the entire bottle yet, so that may have something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are interesting. They include some herbals ointments or medication or chemicals. Who knows what works really? It is mostly subjective and up to you whether you think you look better or worse because of it. Reviewing this product I can say that this lotion feels like it is doing something and smells pleasant to put on. If the ingredients are something you are after--applying this face spread will not be a bad experience for you.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the amazon vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a round blue container and looks to be&lt;br /&gt;of good quality. However, this is not a real anti wrinkle&lt;br /&gt;cream. It does make my skin softer and some what brighter.&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles are still there very visible. Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;and absorbs quickly but at the same time it leaves behind&lt;br /&gt;sort of a sticky film. I follow the regime every night for&lt;br /&gt;weeks without any out of this world results.</li>
    <li> Does not do much for fine crow feet type lines at all. That being said it does work very well as a moisturizer. Does have small firming properties but thats about it on the line / wrinkle front. Need some moisture pumped in, this is it. Need some wrinkles zapped, keep looking.</li>
</ol>
