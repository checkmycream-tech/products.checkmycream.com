      <li>The kit doesn&#x27;t come with the thermal sleeve (which would have been nice to note, as it&#x27;s called out in the manual), but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from waxing.  </li>
      <li>Super good quality, good price.</li>

      <li>To be able to use the kit you need a thermo sleeve which you have to buy separately as it is not included in the kit</li>
      <li>I waited for some time to review this product as I wanted to be sure about the outcome.</li>
      <li>good product and useful.</li>
      <li>I am sure gonna buy it again.</li>
      <li>and I would hope that any  company who sells this product will provide better feedback for the customers who have had issues.</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>

      <li>I was also able to do bikini wax by myself for the first time ever!</li>
      <li>It is really Clean and Easy.</li>
      <li>it works good so far.</li>
      <li>if you heat it up accurately (about 30 -45 mins) at full heat , the process will be smooth for you.</li>
      <li>It was very easy and fast to do by myself.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply wax the same direction of the hair growth and remove the opposite direction for best results.  </li>
      <li>Also, wish it came with cleaning supplies to clean rollers.</li>
      <li>I HAVE ORDERED THIS SAME SYSTEM 3 TIMES AND HAVE LOVED IT OVER THE YEARS</li>
      <li>I love this so much</li>
      <li>It would warm up for 10 mins and then shut down of its own..</li>
      <li>this is a great tool, but there definitely isn&#x27;t any sort of intuitive function that made this a positive usage experience for us.</li>
      <li>, the easy wax not work they don&#x27;t keep hot</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, AFTER BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER</li>
      <li>Great kit, the thermal sleeve is likely helpful as the wax cools quickly but love it overall!</li>
      <li>great, same quality from high end salon</li>
      <li>My favorite thing I have bought on Amazon so far!</li>
      <li>This is totally worth it.</li>

      <li>Yes this review for clean easy professional</li>
      <li>nice small easy and clean just as it says.</li>
      <li>Its so easy to use and no mess at all.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good system and works well enough to get you through those times when you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the spa or need a quick fix.</li>
      <li>stopped working after first use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s to hot to even touch</li>
      <li>I have been  waxing my arms,  legs and underarms for over 5 years with hot wax</li>
      <li>I am not knocking the product as a whole because I feel in the right persons hands</li>
      <li>Thing I like is its easy to apply mess free</li>
      <li>With the easy to follow DVD and multiple tips</li>

      <li>And NO MESS!!!  </li>
      <li>Many places outside use the same waxing kit and charge so high for it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m struggling to get this product to work as well as the spa, but I guess that&#x27;s just how hard it is to wax your own legs.</li>
      <li>for example if your hair grows to the left pull to the right.</li>
      <li>i had to get a New one and put this one on the side</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very surprised.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and the lid prevents curious little hands from getting burnt.</li>
      <li>Satin Smooth offers a range of other waxes for this system.</li>
      <li>for those that said they had gotten an rash when they used the product try using a sensitive formula instead</li>
      <li>I have seen this product in action and it does work like It&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
      <li>Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>This is a professional product, not home waxing system.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it quality of a product</li>
    <li> Good product easy to use.</li>
    <li> The wax heated very well, application was easy, results were great.  My only complaint is that the instructions stated to put the wax canister into the thermal sleeve after removing it from the heating unit. My kit did include a thermal sleeve.  I used a beer cozy.</li>
    <li> Works great. In less than 10 mins the wax bottles are ready to go. It is easy to clean and the lid prevents curious little hands from getting burnt. It&#x27;s a real money saver. Wish I would&#x27;ve bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have never seen anything worse than this. Very hard to get off body. It should be called glue, not wax.</li>
    <li> I love the multiple settings from low to high and this unit heats quickly.  I also like the number individual roll on waxers that it holds including the extra storage in the back that are also heated simultaneously.</li>
    <li> terrible product. stopped working after first use. The wax does not stay hot enough after each application you need to put it back on warmer and wait. Don&#x27;t Buy! you can not return.</li>
    <li> Works great just like the salon</li>
    <li> actually a good product would buy again if I had to</li>
    <li> PLEASE BE FOREWARNED! I used this wax on my \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and I had to go to the doctor and was diagnosed with chemical burns. the system is an absolute dream though. Satin Smooth offers a range of other waxes for this system. i recommend the cream wax, its pink. the wax heating system is fully adjustable. i recommend setting to no higher than medium setting at first. GREAT GREAT GREAT SYSTEM! CRAPY WAX THAT IT COMES WITH! BUY OTHER WAX CARTRIDGES!</li>
    <li> I HAVE CONTACTED THIS COMPANY OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!! THIS IS THE 3RD WAX SYSTEM I HAVE ORDERED FROM THEM. I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THIS TIME, THE WARMER NEVER WARMED UP AND IT TURNED MY WAS INTO COMPLETE GOO!!! NO KIDDING!!! I HAVE ORDERED THIS SAME SYSTEM 3 TIMES AND HAVE LOVED IT OVER THE YEARS BUT THIS WARMER WAS JUST A DEFECTIVE WARMER. HOWEVER, AFTER BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER I AM ASTONISHED THAT THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO CONTACT ME BACK TO GET ME A REPLACEMENT WARMER. I AM SURPRISED AND DISPLEASED!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. This set has all the set ups that a professional salon has. With the easy to follow DVD and multiple tips this is a no brainer.... totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Machine didn&#x27;t work. Returned it for a refund. Mad as hell couldn&#x27;t make money using it during the holidays</li>
    <li> Awesome product and the seller sent it fast</li>
    <li> I waited for some time to review this product as I wanted to be sure about the outcome. I super duper love it. Its so easy to use and no mess at all. I heated it for 30-40 mins while I was busy doing othet things and its was perfect to use, no mess. I get waxing done every 3 weeks so this way i am saving alot of bucks. I am sure gonna buy it again. M planning to gift this to my sisters.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aunt. She&#x27;s likes the kit. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll be using the DVD though. The kit came with everything she needed</li>
    <li> I love this so much I have nothing to complain about just wish I got a wax remover with it instead of two restore creams</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get this product but the first time I used it all the roller heads melted in the machine and it wasn&#x27;t even on high :( the only one that didn&#x27;t was the small eyebrow one and even on low it&#x27;s to hot to even touch</li>
    <li> The heating machine did not worked. Tried at least 10 times and the same thing happened again and again. It would warm up for 10 mins and then shut down of its own..&lt;br /&gt;Worst purchase ever..</li>
    <li> I love this item! It is so easy to use and works wonderfully! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this product several times.  Two for salons I worked at and one for another salon.  I will be purchasing this for myself very soon.  I read some of the reviews that mentioned they had issues and I&#x27;m very surprised.  They must be doing something wrong.  I will say if you wax the wrong direction of the hair there will be issues.  Be sure to apply wax the same direction of the hair growth and remove the opposite direction for best results.  Do your research and you will not be disappointed.  This is a professional product, not home waxing system.  If you use it at home, do the long stretch and research how to use it correctly if no CD is in the package.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem returning a product that didn&#x27;t work and I would hope that any  company who sells this product will provide better feedback for the customers who have had issues.</li>
    <li> Yes this review for clean easy professional this is great product</li>
    <li> Excelent product. It also comes with a instructive CD. I got more than expected. Its really easy to use and save you a lot of money on product.</li>
    <li> great, same quality from high end salon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for first timers but wish it came with a sleeve to hold the waxing tool. Also, wish it came with cleaning supplies to clean rollers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My mom is 100% happy. All items is in the box and look very nice and clear as say.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional waxer nor do I claim to be. I really have no idea how to use this thing properly because 1. I am a guy who just doesn&#x27;t understand how to wax and 2. My gf was having trouble using the warming machine as it kept making the wax either too hot or it would cool down too fast that we couldn&#x27;t get it to apply properly. I am not knocking the product as a whole because I feel in the right persons hands this is a great tool, but there definitely isn&#x27;t any sort of intuitive function that made this a positive usage experience for us.</li>
    <li> It doesn t heat enough so it&#x27; is not posible to work and as I live in another countr when I wanted to return it esa Late</li>
    <li> love this product.  Heats up nicely and it a good bargain.</li>
    <li> good product and useful.</li>
    <li> It was a great kit, not really worth the amount of money spent. If you&#x27;re a beginner, DO NOT buy this kit. I made that mistake. It was terrible and painful and didn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;d rather shave for the rest of my life and just stick to getting my eyebrows waxed.</li>
    <li> if you heat it up accurately (about 30 -45 mins) at full heat , the process will be smooth for you. If the wax is not heated well...it is going to be super tough ! i like the warmer.......it works good so far. Now i am buying refills as i finished all of them..so far so good :)</li>
    <li> This waxing system is awesome. It is the same that is used at the beauty salon and it pays for itself in just 1 use!&lt;br /&gt;I am saying good-bye to the beauty salon for good!</li>
    <li> Kept tripping the electricity and stopped working after using it twice.</li>
    <li> Easy 2 do wax wid this kit</li>
    <li> got it. nice small easy and clean just as it says. the little cartridges and rollers for fingers toes and hands or narrow areas! is just that the ones in school are so much bigger you need time to get used to it. like anything else. can&#x27;t wait to get some other wax refills</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m struggling to get this product to work as well as the spa, but I guess that&#x27;s just how hard it is to wax your own legs. Overall, it&#x27;s a good system and works well enough to get you through those times when you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the spa or need a quick fix.</li>
    <li> The item was received missing a key inventory item and is unusable until the item can be obtained.</li>
    <li> The product worked fine then just quite heating. I&#x27;ve had this product before and they do last at least 3-4 yrs. This machine, 1 month. I would try another of the same.</li>
    <li> This was worth every penny I spent on this wax kit! It was very easy and fast to do by myself. I have been  waxing my arms,  legs and underarms for over 5 years with hot wax and I used to apply it with wooden stick. This wax kit takes less than half the time it took before.  I was also able to do bikini wax by myself for the first time ever! Must buy product of you only wax and do not prefer other methods.</li>
    <li> I am working with this waxing  machine for a bout 14 years , and I change it every 2-3 years . I have a hair salon , this us the best waxing , I can do very quick and clean with the best result.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing I have bought on Amazon so far! Eliminates the mess and hassle of waxing just be careful with the heating which can get a bit too hot I usually pre-heat on a higher setting then put it towards the middle or lower middle before applying. Depends on area you are waxing as well. If I am waxing the brow/facial area I let it stand on the table for about a minute before applying directly on my face. I have saved so much money with this product as me and my teen daughter use this. Also I bought the even thinner small wax head for my eyebrow area I will try to add pictures soon. Absolutely love this wax system!</li>
    <li> Very great product. This is totally worth it. I couldn&#x27;t stop waxing everything. Save yourself some money and enjoy your on spa experience!</li>
    <li> Great starter kit, has everything I need to get started.</li>
    <li> I buy two , when I receive it I  try it work but next day I come to salon I work this customer , the easy wax not work they don&#x27;t keep hot I tod I turn off but it not it on , that why I retune back , I hope they can sent me a new one better .</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition, works as described.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well i am still trying to retune it and the seller is not contacting me back i had to get a New one and put this one on the side couldn&#x27;t not used it</li>
    <li> Once u apply it get hard very fast making it hard to remove.  Thing I like is its easy to apply mess free</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good it meets all the expectation</li>
    <li> Easiest waxing solutions we have tried so far. Works great. No strips required.&lt;br /&gt;Have only tried the microwave strip one before. Many places outside use the same waxing kit and charge so high for it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! easy to use,fast shipping! Everything I expected and more. I definitely recommend this kit for those who wax at home!</li>
    <li> It is really Clean and Easy.</li>
    <li> Great kit, the thermal sleeve is likely helpful as the wax cools quickly but love it overall!</li>
    <li> Awesome product , has been over a year still in great condition and works as a brand new..</li>
    <li> Super good quality, good price.</li>
    <li> To be able to use the kit you need a thermo sleeve which you have to buy separately as it is not included in the kit</li>
    <li> I recently went to an expo with my cosmetology school and they had this product on the trade floor. I have seen this product in action and it does work like It&#x27;s suppose to. the thing about waxing that you should remember is when waxing alway pull the strip the opposite way your hair grows. for example if your hair grows to the left pull to the right. and if you miss a few hairs don&#x27;t rewax the area b/c that&#x27;s usually where the rashes and burns come from other than you either being sensitive to the regular formula or it being too hot. but use tweezers to remove the hair that remained but tweeze those in the same direction as the hair grows,it will come out easier and less painful to tweeze. for those that said they had gotten an rash when they used the product try using a sensitive formula instead b/c you may have had a reaction to the regular formula. I hope this helps any of those that had a bad experience with this and encourage you to try it again. I myself plan on buying this product in the very near future.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts since the product was so different from what I was used to, but I was in the market for a new system and my skin care specialist suggested I check this one out. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.  It was SO easy!  The kit doesn&#x27;t come with the thermal sleeve (which would have been nice to note, as it&#x27;s called out in the manual), but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from waxing.  I was amazed at how fast the waxing activity is and how little wax is actually used. And NO MESS!!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this product (I already have)!</li>
