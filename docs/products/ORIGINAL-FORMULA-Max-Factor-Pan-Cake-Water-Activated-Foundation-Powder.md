<li> Other colors of pancake were their normal price but</li>
<li> The long lasting coverage foundations today dont come close to this.</li>
<li> Apply to your face (I put it on my neck &amp; upper chest too) and blend with your fingers for as much or as little coverage</li>
<li> Other colors of the same make-up were posted much less.    </li>
<li> I just run a make-up puff/sponge (a dense sponge doesn&#x27;t work as well) under cold water, squeeze out almost all the water, then swirl the dampened sponge over the pancake until it&#x27;s lightly coated.</li>
<li> Any other product like it?</li>
<li> USE IT WET!</li>
<li> However, I must say that the product arrived with no cover seal, no packaging other than the package the product itself is in with a screw on cover.  </li>
<li> Scars, acne, dark circles and let me tell you it goes on lightcoverage but a heavy coverage.</li>
<li> /&gt;Unfortunately it has to be ordered because it is not available in the USA.</li>
<li> Have order a few times and will again.</li>
<li> When I discovered I could buy it here a few years ago, it was a hallelujah moment for me!</li>
<li> but I am not sure I will buy from [...]</li>
<li> It is expensive, but it is all I can use on my face due to the water application.  </li>
<li> also noticed that the quality was not good have like beading in the make-up</li>
<li> Actually alittle disappointed with this item - have used it forever</li>
<li> I am sad that it has become next to impossible to find since max factor went out of business.</li>
<li> They made my combination skin break out, look horribly streaky &amp; greasy.</li>
<li> It was a miserable month or so for me using oil-based foundations.</li>
<li> Now, I will never pay this outrageous price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My Mother (89) uses this stuff and said she couldn&#x27;t find it.  TA DA, Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation, good coverage, long lasting, great finish.  It is tricky to apply but worth the effort, remember to use a damp sponge or brush.  Does not clog pores, provides a flawless, long lasting finish.  However, I must say that the product arrived with no cover seal, no packaging other than the package the product itself is in with a screw on cover.  Makes me wonder if the package is sanitary.  I will buy this again but I am not sure I will buy from [...]</li>
    <li> Wife uses nothing else, that&#x27;s why I had to come to Amazon to get it, could not find in local store. Have order a few times and will again. Good price, just what the wife wants, and that&#x27;s what she gets!</li>
    <li> I purchsed this item thinking it would be a good foundation for a full coverage makeup. I would not recommend this product for purchase. The makeup looks way to noticable which is what I try &amp; avoid. You are better off buying a better store brand for full coverage.</li>
    <li> The product has a dryer texture than it used to, but the finish is similar. Water activation means when it dries you never have an oily or shiny look. When I was young it was just enough. Now I&#x27;m old and love how it does not cake up in wrinkles or look overdone.</li>
    <li> I picked this stuff up on a whime and let me tell you... I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! Yes it is heavey and yes it dose take a bit of work to get it soomthed out but it&#x27;s totaly worth it. It covers so effectivly and really gives you that flawless skin we are all serching for. I am super pale and have huge pores so I was worried about the color but nat 2 works great! Deff worth a try!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for two years. Not expensive but great for oily skin. However, it is hard to get an even look when put on this foundation, therefore a good sponge is really necessary.</li>
    <li> I love this make up and have been using this make up for 29 years. I am sad that it has become next to impossible to find since max factor went out of business. I heard that you can still get it overseas, but that&#x27;s not confirmed...and if it&#x27;s true, then it will be more expensive. I can only hope that someone has bought the formula and will continue to produce it somewhere along the line. my suggestion is buy this makeup, but don&#x27;t become too attached to it!</li>
    <li> Ordered for a friend who believes this is the only make up she can use.  Product received quickly and was what it was supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Max Factor make-up for years.  .a light coating brings lots of compliments just to cover uneven skin tones. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of others but they are just not the same...</li>
    <li> The product was just what I wanted BUT the price was increased so much I will never purchase anything again.  Other colors of pancake were their normal price but the Max Factor Natural #2 was a total of $21.49 for just one pack of the make-up.  Previously I had purchased 4 packs for only seven (7) dollars more. Other colors of the same make-up were posted much less.    NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE TAKEN IN LIKE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Actually alittle disappointed with this item - have used it forever and now I have to purcahse it on line instead of a local store.  also noticed that the quality was not good have like beading in the make-up - could these be seconds and if so the purchase price was 3x  what I paid in the stores</li>
    <li> I have always used this product, paying about $7:00 in stores.  Now, I will never pay this outrageous price.  I&#x27;ll have to find an alternative product.</li>
    <li> I plan to place another order for this makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, love the water activated makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has to be ordered because it is not available in the USA.</li>
    <li> as it used to be years ago. I was looking for more coverage..this is very drying and sheer. It does not dissolve well with water. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> A Great product, but your price is too high.  Any other product like it?</li>
    <li> Its here. Im excited. Hope its the right color for freckles. Cant wait to try out asap</li>
    <li> It has been years since I have been able to purchase this foundation and let me tellyou that ITS THE BEST! The long lasting coverage foundations today dont come close to this. This is the best there is. BUY IT! Buy as many as you can. This covers flawlessly. Scars, acne, dark circles and let me tell you it goes on lightcoverage but a heavy coverage. Its the best. USE IT WET! Wet sponge, and pat the product and then lightly smooth. Its easy. It is amazing and you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> Requested as a gift provided to a person who could not find it. The requester loves the item they have used it for years.</li>
    <li> did not like quality of product</li>
    <li> I have worn this makeup for 40 years and can&#x27;t buy in the drug store anymore. I found it on Amazon.  It is expensive, but it is all I can use on my face due to the water application.  So glad I can buy at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 37 years! The only time I&#x27;ve tried any other is when it was first taken off the shelves &amp; no longer sold in US stores. It was a miserable month or so for me using oil-based foundations. They made my combination skin break out, look horribly streaky &amp; greasy. When I discovered I could buy it here a few years ago, it was a hallelujah moment for me! It&#x27;s water-based, gives you a beautiful, even coverage and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I just run a make-up puff/sponge (a dense sponge doesn&#x27;t work as well) under cold water, squeeze out almost all the water, then swirl the dampened sponge over the pancake until it&#x27;s lightly coated. Apply to your face (I put it on my neck &amp; upper chest too) and blend with your fingers for as much or as little coverage you desire. I even put it on my eyelids for the perfect eyeshadow base. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it, I promise. :)</li>
