      <li>Usually I love nice and easy but this really makes me never want to try it again.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this color of Nice n Easy but have had more problems finding it at the local store.  </li>
      <li>Cannot say enough about how happy</li>
      <li>I have a darker shade of blonde, but it is an attractive shade.  </li>
      <li>I bought Clairol Nice n Easy, 106 medium ash blonde after reading a review&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, leaves my hair much softer than salon colors with ammonia and peroxide</li>
      <li>I started with a whole box to color my hair (started as a greying light brown,</li>
      <li>there and the color is making my own light brown hair - with ash touch and slightly lighter.</li>
      <li>trips to the salon and embarked on a long, stressful, funny journey to dye my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>first try was to go all over blond.  </li>
      <li>left it on my hair for 45 min, then shampooed it out and its now a gorgeous ash toned med shade blonde.</li>
      <li>so I got her nice and easy natural medium ash blonde to help reduce the red, the ash is suppose to help.  </li>
      <li>I am about at the point that I pretty much don&#x27;t need to travel to Walmart or Sams anymore.  </li>
      <li>The chemical odor was so strong we had to move outside because the air became unbreathable while the application was in her hair.</li>
      <li>I have now used box 2 at a 3 week interval after the first box produced no results and sure enough the second box did nothing either.  </li>
      <li>I googled \\&quot;how to correct orange hair\\&quot; and found a video from a very knowledgeable young lady who said to try a purple shampoo, and, if that fails, buy Nice and Easy # 106.  </li>
      <li>A few more things to note.  </li>
      <li>During the application and the entire day following application, my wife&#x27;s eyes, skin, and scalp burned strongly.</li>
      <li>I like it because is the less green of the ashes hues and also has a good coverage and does not damage my hair so much.</li>
      <li>All 3 had many questions (expected) but no real suggestions were offered.</li>
      <li>The transition from highlights to this product was smooth and unnoticed at work.</li>
      <li>wow I. like.</li>
      <li>My hair looks natural, not dyed, and</li>
      <li>I feel compelled to write this as my old sweats and bathroom rugs are in the washing</li>
      <li>completely covered all varying shades going on, and left my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Have gone to a stylist my entire life for coloring (53- years old).  </li>
      <li>started with dark brown roots with left over highlights, both high lights and low lights, and very brittle</li>

    <li> Have been using this brand for 32 yrs.  Love it.</li>
    <li> good nice awesome like it wow I. like. it.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to wight too many words??&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so hard...</li>
    <li> I love nice&#x27;n easy excellent product. I bought three boxes two of them had been opened which I was not happy with at all. Love nice&#x27;n easy product though.</li>
    <li> I like this product, there is a perfect balsam (!) there and the color is making my own light brown hair - with ash touch and slightly lighter. I have to say, that seller firstly send me a wrong color, but they correct this mistake  by sending a correct color,immediately, without any refunds for them. recommending.</li>

    <li> If I could give this product a zero I would.  My mom had medium blonde hair and sometimes it pulls red so I got her nice and easy natural medium ash blonde to help reduce the red, the ash is suppose to help.  Unfortunately it turned out super red with pink tint.  I would suggest you to stay away and try another product.  Usually I love nice and easy but this really makes me never want to try it again.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, dry hair.  Have gone to a stylist my entire life for coloring (53- years old).  I decided I was done with the $200.00 a month trips to the salon and embarked on a long, stressful, funny journey to dye my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I started with dark brown roots with left over highlights, both high lights and low lights, and very brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;My first try was to go all over blond.  My roots became orange, the rest of my hair almost white.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to a darker shade, and my hair became bozo the clown red.  I went to Sally&#x27;s and the \\&quot;expert\\&quot; there&lt;br /&gt;talked me into yet another color, which was supposed to even everything out.  Horrible!  I now had&lt;br /&gt;bozo red WITH lemon yellow roots.  After researching on the web, I learned I needed an ash tone&lt;br /&gt;color, so here we go again.  I bought Clairol Nice n Easy, 106 medium ash blonde after reading a review&lt;br /&gt;in Better Houskeeping.  They gave it their seal of approval, and rated it #1.&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot believe the results!  This is the best hair color I have ever had in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;It completely covered all varying shades going on, and left my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post a picture.  My hair looks natural, not dyed, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I did vary from their instructions though. This is what I did.  I put the color on my roots and gently&lt;br /&gt;rubbed it onto my entire scalp, leaving the ends.  I left that on for 20 minutes.  I then added the&lt;br /&gt;rest of the color to my ends, and entire head, and left the entire thing on for an additional 45- minutes.&lt;br /&gt;While on the color looked almost black so I expected my hair to be darker. But, It is a perfect champagne&lt;br /&gt;color all over.  Roots to tips.  It is \\&quot;shimmery\\&quot; like it has subtle high lights in it. Cannot say enough about how happy I am.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to leave the color on for a bit over an hour because I had read so many reviews that people said&lt;br /&gt;they thought they should have left it on longer.  A few more things to note.  The dye is easy to apply and did not drip.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves that came in the box were of great quality, and allowed me to easily take them off and put them back on. (applied the colr twice, once to roots, then all over).  The conditioner is wonderful, and like other posters I wish Clairol would offer the conditioner as an item to buy in its own.  My hair matches the color on the box.  This dye covered very dark roots, blond high lights, darker low lights, orange and reddish mess.  The condition of my hair is 100 percent better.  Before dyeing I was almost going to have it cut all off it was in such bad shape.  Kudo&#x27;s to Clairol!note.

    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I was very happy to discover that Amazon sold it.  I am about at the point that I pretty much don&#x27;t need to travel to Walmart or Sams anymore.  Which is just with me!</li>
    <li> So easy to purchase using my Prime, always have color on hand.</li>
    <li> I think this is dark for medium ash blonde.  However, it covers the fine silver hairs around my face and lasts about four weeks which is way longer than the lighter colors of any brand.  And, I like that it works in 25 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, while I have the solution on my head it itches terribly.  I have to have a Qtip or something so that I can scratch that itch.  I don&#x27;t think that I could stand it on my head more than 25 to 30 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have any red spots or rashes once I wash it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> (Purchased locally since in a hurry) Afer 20+ yrs of mostly predictable results from home coloring and yrs of relying on Amazon reviewsof others- I feel compelled to write this as my old sweats and bathroom rugs are in the washing machine.&lt;br /&gt;  1. It just STINKS, really smells bad. I had to leave the room for the strand test because...&lt;br /&gt;  2. Eyes burned and watered so much!&lt;br /&gt;  3. I was not impressed with grey coverage AFTER 45MIN TEST STRAND compared to other brands I have used. NOT WORTH THE STINK&lt;br /&gt;  4. I had a Question re:color choice for grey roots and brassy ends.  The heavy accents of the helpline workers (asked for a second, then a supervisor) All 3 had many questions (expected) but no real suggestions were offered. Anything and everything I brought up was agreed to. Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;  5. Nostalgia. I felt like I was a kid again, knowing &amp;#34;my Mom was in the basement again coloring her hair.&amp;#34; Yep, my room was the attic&lt;br /&gt;  bedroom... Lingered then too. THAT WAS 45 YRS AGO!!!!</li>
    <li> nice batch.  colour was good.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake (not a mistake now) of bleaching my hair at home.  The color didn&#x27;t lift enough, and I was left with that horrible orangy/yellow shade.  I was so distressed because I had to go to work and was mortified at being seen with that hideous hair color.  I googled \\&quot;how to correct orange hair\\&quot; and found a video from a very knowledgeable young lady who said to try a purple shampoo, and, if that fails, buy Nice and Easy # 106.  I wanted a permanent solution, so I skipped the shampoo and got the 106.  What a transformation!  The green tint in the base color cancelled my orangy/yellow completely.  I have a darker shade of blonde, but it is an attractive shade.  I don&#x27;t think it could look better if I had gone to a stylist from the start.</li>
    <li> I have now used box 2 at a 3 week interval after the first box produced no results and sure enough the second box did nothing either.  I have purchased this product in stores and know what results to expect.  For some reason the product is defective.  I will be throwing the third box in the trash can and will never again order hair color online.</li>
    <li> my hair was brownish black and i wanted to go blonde. so i even went to a salon, asked for blonde, and of course my hair turned out orange. well yellow w/ dark orange streaks. so... i bought the med ash blonde dye. left it on my hair for 45 min, then shampooed it out and its now a gorgeous ash toned med shade blonde. basically its now what i had wanted initially. so ya, the box did better than the salon.</li>
