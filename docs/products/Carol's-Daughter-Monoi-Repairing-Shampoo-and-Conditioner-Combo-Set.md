      <li>i am glad that i try it</li>
      <li>It might work better on softer hair.</li>
      <li>So I bought more Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
      <li>Have to write a follow up after more usage.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I shampoo then apply the conditioner and clip my hair on top of my head while I bathe, then I rinse the conditioner after about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I must say I am so glad I tried.</li>
      <li>I get the most hair compliments when I use any Carols daughter hair product.</li>
      <li>That said, I&#x27;ve mostly been using L&#x27;Oreal or Tressame.  </li>
      <li>I love this dual combination.  </li>
      <li>Will have more business with this dealer.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Our hair is healthy, looking and feeling to the scalp.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healthy scalp treatment as well.</li>
      <li>more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>I bought this before from HSN and it was more money, so I ordered from Amazon because of better price.</li>
      <li>Great product that leaves the hair feeling fresh, clean and light.</li>
      <li>The love demos, and the Monoi serum was free.</li>
      <li>Great for natural hair and doesn&#x27;t strip the hair.  </li>
      <li>My Hubby swears by the Monoi serum that was a free gift for his beard.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this line, my hair has been damage free.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t come out smoothly (or at all)</li>
      <li>So far so good....</li>
      <li>I have fine curly Caucasian hair that is prone to oiliness and has mild heat and color damage on the bottom six inches.</li>
      <li>and I eventually just unscrewed the whole top off every time I&#x27;d use it.</li>
      <li>my hair is very short, so I am waiting to see if it grows at a good rate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Carol&#x27;s Daughter products but i&#x27;ve never actually tried their shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I love this product; it makes my hair soft and easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>the shampoo is very cleansing for something that&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
      <li>I sure expected allot more from this product.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how soft my hair is now, and it&#x27;s color treated.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a twist top with a small hole in the center which is not the best design.  </li>
      <li>It feels great while using it, but I found that the conditioning was not better than using mayonnaise.</li>
      <li>i have to condition all the way up to my roots to add a little moisture back, but it is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>This is a great product for African American hair.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t justify the higher price point for both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>this is my first hair hair product and will never use anything else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sulfate-free cleansing conditioners to wash my hair for years, NoPoo and Wen being my go-to products to maintain soft, smooth curls.</li>
      <li>Even though they try to show different types - they still have one of those show the most.</li>
      <li>also really dislike the packaging!</li>
      <li>After the first two weeks of use, my hair started to look &amp; feel so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>With the Tui shampoo and conditioner I was able to just wash my hair and let it dry without much combing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the combo set!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t go back to cheap shampoo again.</li>
      <li>so I was very hopeful that it would work for me.</li>
      <li>And of course the scent is very pleasant!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t go curly and struggle with going straight.</li>
      <li>but I have been told it is a very gd product.</li>
      <li>My hair has really grown.</li>
      <li>but you really should try for yourself.</li>
      <li>Not for every type and style, you really might want to buy a sample and see if it works for you.</li>
      <li>I flat iron it to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product but very expensive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are quite pricey, I think it&#x27;s worth spending the extra dough.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>I became interested in this line after I tried the deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling soft and it looks way more healthier!MUST GET HANDS DOWN.</li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised to realize I could easily shampoo every other day instead of daily also.</li>
      <li>i feel my hair get stronger and soft</li>
      <li>Not heavy, nor greasy.</li>
      <li>It leave my hair soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>it moisturizes and makes my hair soft and thicker.</li>
      <li>Love her products for thick and curly color treated hair.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think I will buy again as the results weren&#x27;t earth-shatteringly different for my fine, slightly wavy, colored hair</li>
      <li>New growth in a short period of time.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth the buy if you want a quality product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of comments for this product as well as saw it advertised in numerous magazines so I was very hopeful that it would work for me. I have washed my hair with Carole&#x27;s daughter numerous times and my hair has been very dry. I even tried leaving the conditioner on longer than required and had the same results. So unfortunately I will have to try something else, it just did not work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a lot of different in my hair in the bottles were really hard to use</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the product would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I think since I had heard all of these great reviews that I was expecting something more than sore bought.  Maybe there is. Just have not seen it.  The bottles are small for the price and the ingredients are comparable to store bought.  Have to write a follow up after more usage.</li>
    <li> this product stripped my hair and made it too dry</li>
    <li> Definitely will buy it again, I can see and feel the difference. My hair is much softer and happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This combo smells insanely good and always leaves my hair feeling and looking clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Although Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are quite pricey, I think it&#x27;s worth spending the extra dough.</li>

    <li> I love this dual combination.  It leave my hair soft and silky.  This is a great product for African American hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, over processed hair. This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft. I tried to go back to cheaper shampoo, but my hair felt like straw after one use. So I bought more Carol&#x27;s Daughter. I won&#x27;t go back to cheap shampoo again. You get what you pay for with this product. Thankfully, a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> My hair has really grown. New growth in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner! My hair has never felt healthier! Before using this I was someone with very curly hair and without a ton of product it was always frizzy mess. Since using this shampoo and conditioner not only is my hair easier to manage but my curls are back and I don&#x27;t even use product anymore!</li>
    <li> carol&#x27;s daughter has changed my life for the better! i&#x27;ve been using the monoi shampoo, conditioner and mask for only 2 weeks and it has drastically made a difference. i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how soft my hair is now, and it&#x27;s color treated. the shampoo is very cleansing for something that&#x27;s sulfate free so if you have a dry scalp you may want to avoid. i have to condition all the way up to my roots to add a little moisture back, but it is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> So far so good....my hair is very short, so I am waiting to see if it grows at a good rate. I am confident it will be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Wonderful product but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Not impressed...&lt;br /&gt;Does not feel like it moisturizes my hair, shampoo makes my hair feel dried out, and the conditioner makes my hair feel gross. :(</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair that tends to be dry and frizzy.  I flat iron it to smooth it out.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this line, my hair has been damage free.  I became interested in this line after I tried the deep conditioner.  I highly recommend this for dry, frizzy, color treated hair.  My hair is also easier to flat iron and the results stay longer.  Great scent too.</li>
    <li> Got this product because I was taking down braids. Wanted to give my hair the best nourishment I could. Will not lie, got it on HSN. The love demos, and the Monoi serum was free. My entire family uses this, men and women. My Hubby swears by the Monoi serum that was a free gift for his beard. Not a strand we have lost. Smells great, feels great. Not heavy, nor greasy. Herroducts are awesome I ise several skin products and this is my first hair hair product and will never use anything else. No breakage, not a strand. Our hair is healthy, looking and feeling to the scalp. This is not just hair treatment it&#x27;s healthy scalp treatment as well. I would say try it. I have already purchased more so I don&#x27;t run out. I have 4 men using in, and one using it on his thick beard. And two women. I am mostly in aw with my Hubby&#x27;s beard. No more brittle breakage after 1 use.</li>
    <li> I received this combo for my birthday in August 2014 and I keep restocking these two items. I love it. I get the most hair compliments when I use any Carols daughter hair product. Just be extra careful not to get any in your eyes cause it burns.</li>
    <li> Good product i like it i feel my hair get stronger and soft i am glad that i try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a women of color.  After the first two weeks of use, my hair started to look &amp; feel so much healthier.  I refuse to use any other brands from this point on!  I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair care products.  I highly recommend the combo set!</li>
    <li> I sure expected allot more from this product. I was sadly disapointed and will not recomand this to anyone. It left my long thin hair dull and drap. I tryed curling my hair but it wouldn&#x60;t hold. I had hotel shampoo work better.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it makes my hair soft and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product. Great for natural hair and doesn&#x27;t strip the hair.  My product was delivered timely!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product.  I find it make my hair harder to manage.  I prefer the Crème of Nature product line for my coarse hair type.</li>
    <li> Its an ok product thw shampoo completly stripped my hair from color moisture and luster i would use maybe once a month. But i love the conditioner. I give that 5 stars</li>
    <li> A little pricey but worth the buy if you want a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly Caucasian hair that is prone to oiliness and has mild heat and color damage on the bottom six inches. I&#x27;ve been using sulfate-free cleansing conditioners to wash my hair for years, NoPoo and Wen being my go-to products to maintain soft, smooth curls. I decided to try the Monoi shampoo and conditioner out of curiosity and to change things up. This may work for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. While applying the shampoo, my hair acquired the dreaded hay-like texture that is normally only caused by harsh drugstore shampoos. The conditioner softened my hair somewhat while I was applying it, but the smoothing effect was lost once I rinsed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this may work for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I do not recommend this product if you need extra smoothing/conditioning for frizz-prone hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Carol&#x27;s Daughter products but i&#x27;ve never actually tried their shampoo and conditioner and I must say I love this product! I have to say this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. It left my hair feeling soft and it looks way more healthier!MUST GET HANDS DOWN.</li>
    <li> Love her products for thick and curly color treated hair. My split ends have decreased</li>
    <li> The smell of both were great but I don&#x27;t think I will buy again as the results weren&#x27;t earth-shatteringly different for my fine, slightly wavy, colored hair so I can&#x27;t justify the higher price point for both the shampoo and conditioner.  Bottles were difficult to get product out as another reviewer said.</li>
    <li> It feels great while using it, but I found that the conditioning was not better than using mayonnaise. It might work better on softer hair.</li>
    <li> You only need to use a small amount of shampoo and conditioner for desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to realize I could easily shampoo every other day instead of daily also.</li>
    <li> I bought this before from HSN and it was more money, so I ordered from Amazon because of better price. The product smells great and it keeps my hair from breaking,I notice I have fuller hair since I started using this product. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow it just keeps hair from breaking and falling out it moisturizes and makes my hair soft and thicker.</li>
    <li> I know there are very mixed reviews for this product here but you really should try for yourself. Also see what type of hair people have. My are very thin and frizzy. I can&#x27;t go curly and struggle with going straight. For my hair type this product works. It does reduce the amount of hair left on my brush. And when I brush my hair after using this product - it tangles less and process is easier.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works for thin frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;- Makes it easier to brush&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner strengthens the hair&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for every type and style, you really might want to buy a sample and see if it works for you. Might be reacting to ingredients in the shampoo or conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- Not for curling effect. I think the product is meant to heal and straighten your hair&lt;br /&gt;- Price tag is a little high for an average consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say you always should be cautiously optimistic. What is great for some - might not work for everyone. Look at the models they use in various commercials. Even though they try to show different types - they still have one of those show the most. See if this type is yours or not.</li>
    <li> I love  love love this shampoo and conditioner, I have fine hair and it gives me shine and body like nothing else!</li>
    <li> Great product that leaves the hair feeling fresh, clean and light.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality shampoo and condition, great for moisturizing and restoring.  Have a very nice fragrance, a day after I wash and style my hair people still ask me about the scent.  Expensive for regular use, I use it for damage treatment and they use the Vanilla/Black Cherry for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this product will still be cruelty-free post Loreal purchase.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have thick Asian hair, about underarm length which I&#x27;ve been highlighting for about ten years now so you can imagine the damage it creates.  My hair is almost straight with a slight bend at the ends.  That said, I&#x27;ve mostly been using L&#x27;Oreal or Tressame.  I&#x27;m just tired of having dried crispy hair so when I saw a great deal on a three pc. set of this brand on TV I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give it a fair chance, I used the shampoo and conditioner four times.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent but I love smell of it!  It&#x27;s not over powering or perfumy.  Anyway, I shampoo then apply the conditioner and clip my hair on top of my head while I bathe, then I rinse the conditioner after about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  I have noticed that there&#x27;s 25-30% less hair in the drain.  My hair looks smoother and feel softer as well.  And of course the scent is very pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The packaging as well as the color of the shampoo and condition are so similar that it can be difficult to tell which is which, especially if you have older eyes.  Also, it has a twist top with a small hole in the center which is not the best design.  The conditioner can be somewhat difficult to squeeze out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like both the shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;d repurchase but only at a similar price I paid (about $12 each) as this 3 pc. set included body wash which is also heavenly.</li>
    <li> Actually, this was a gift but I have been told it is a very gd product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are good quality. But I&#x27;m not happy with the delivery system.  Twist the lid to open, but need to squeeze hard to deliver the product.</li>
    <li> It may be the change in my hair texture (ombre ends) but I feel like this did a worse job at moisturizing my hair compared to the Tui line. With the Tui shampoo and conditioner I was able to just wash my hair and let it dry without much combing. With the Monoi, I can&#x27;t do that--my hair gets hopelessly tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really dislike the packaging! The conditioner doesn&#x27;t come out smoothly (or at all) and I eventually just unscrewed the whole top off every time I&#x27;d use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. I have used the same brand for years, S-Factor, a friend recommended this and I must say I am so glad I tried. I have long thick hair and this works wonders for me.</li>
