<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great used to a lways use Caruso the price is off charts now.  Glad revlon made the same thing for half the orice...</li>
    <li> I set my hair once, after washing, style/curls/body stays for 3-4 days without resetting.  Love this setter.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!! Love them &amp; every time I use these I get compliments on how full my hair is &amp; how much body it has.  I only leave them in for seconds (I don&#x27;t want too much curl, just body).  Used to use another brand (Caruso, I think)? Anyway, I priced these at Walmart &amp; Sally&#x27;s but Amazon was a much better price for the same product with free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Item shipped fast and arrived in great condition.  I just can not get the curls to stay in my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or not. The item is great I think it&#x27;s me or my hair</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this arrived. Was going to a party so I wanted to try it out. First thing I burned myself twice on the steam/ water. Ok, so I need to be more careful. I had read the reviews and ordered different clips so I felt confident this would work and not damage my hair. I put in the rollers, gave them time to dry  (I thought) and had virtually no curl and damp hair. Since I have to work five days a week, I hardly have time to spend hours each morning doing my hair. But I decided to give it another shot. Even hit them with the blow dryer. Still wet. Had to finish with the curling iron. In fact, when I returned home a couple of hours later, the inside of the clips that came with the unit (that I didn&#x27;t use on my hair but only to heat the rollers) were still wet, and I live in the desert!  Item returned.</li>
    <li> It did not heat up well and did nothing as far as putting any curls in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works really fast.  Doesn&#x27;t damage hair or crimp hair like pins.</li>
    <li> I know I have had these a while but wanted to test the waters so to speak.  I would like you to know that I have enjoyed this product and that it has been a real money/time saver for me.  NO MORE PERMS!!  The curl holds longer than I expected.  &amp;#60;~Pls note that different hair types will react differently.  My hair is fine and curls usually lose their strength as the day wears on but, this has done very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;A Very Satisfied Customer,&lt;br /&gt;Julie Clay</li>
    <li> I literally use this all the time. after a cows if I want a straightened look i&#x27;ll put these in even use them with my clip ins. perfect alternative to heat damage.</li>
    <li> This works with my Caruso Molecular hair curlers, thus becoming a great replacement at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Caruso set that was 14 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that I like to put in a ponytail and have&lt;br /&gt;long bouncy curls hang down. I used a curling iron for 2 months, and&lt;br /&gt;was shocked to see the amount of damage it did in that short of time.&lt;br /&gt;This is just as fast, I put in the curlers, do my makeup, take out the&lt;br /&gt;curlers, and I&#x27;m done. Curls last all day, with no damage to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use any type of iron on my hair again!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> works great, love steam rollers</li>
    <li> The Ionic Steam Setter works for me. Happy with the product. It was what I expected to be. Small enough to keep out and not be in the way.</li>
    <li> Works great if you want curls for a couple hours! Even with heavy duty product they fell flat after 2 hours. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had a Caruso machine for many years, but it was rather old and finally quit. When I looked to replace it I found this steamer for a much cheaper price. I took a gamble and I&#x27;m glad I did. It works great, heats up fast, and is quiet.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, and so I leave them on for a hour or so, but curl does not stay more than one hour...</li>
    <li> Loved this item only one problem, the rollers are way TO BIG if the were small, medium, to large, they would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I switch with a friend of mine as she has long hair and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It was suppose to have a tab to hold the roller. Obviously it was broken off or these are sub-standardly made and the factory left them off. I&#x27;ve tried balancing the roller on top of the steam but it makes the roller too wet and will cause your hair to remain wet. Bad purchase!</li>
    <li> The curler box was taped.  The bag inside wasn&#x27;t fastened, and I discovered a hair on one of the curlers I examined. I&#x27;m picky about getting other people&#x27;s returns- especially when it comes to something that goes in my hair.  Now I have to wash all the curlers before I use them- not happy about that fact.</li>
    <li> I was an avid Caruso user. I still like them. But this one is just as good and it cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> . . . I had a set similar to this one, way back in the day. The carulo steam set. I no longer have it, and missed throwing a few curls in my hair now n again &#x3D;] I love the ionic option too. I never use heat accessories, such as, curling irons, straighteners etc. Because I don&#x27;t want to damage my already fine/dry hair. This makes your hair very soft, n very shiny! I was happy to not spend a lot of money too. . . since I only use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> Bought the Carruso Curler years ago.  Still had the steamer and was in need of curlers.  Bought this unit which game with a good amount of curlers and steaming unit for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these steam setters. This is my 3rd one but I tried this brand. I thought since it was less expensive I&#x27;d give it a try. It does a great job and it&#x27;s fast. The steam comes out within a minute or so and the curls last all day long. I do have naturally wavy hair, but it&#x27;s not curly so these do an awesome job. For hard to curl, you&#x27;d want to leave them in longer. I leave them in for about 10 minutes and they make great curls. They also come in large and medium sizes so they are perfect for me. I don&#x27;t have those tiny curlers I don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I have long, frizzy hair and this product does not work. I wish I could return it, but I do not know how.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t generate as much steam as my Caruso did, and when I take the rollers out, I have to dry my hair because it&#x27;s still , so, in general, it was a good choice.damp. But the price is much more reasonable, and the curls last for 2-3 days</li>
    <li> I returned these because even though the foam around the core make the curler bigger, the core itself is not and therefore, you get small, tight curls instead of large, soft curls.  They did heat up quick however, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This unit failed after just a few uses. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;d try a different brand, like Caruso.</li>
    <li> My unit was brand new, and steamed up rollers quickly. My hair is straight and fine - I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for years, but the curl never lasted very long.  I was hopeful that this would create lasting curls.  At first it&#x27;s difficult to get into the rhythm of steaming one roller at a time, but after a while it&#x27;s pretty easy.  However, my hair would still be slightly damp and limp after removing the rollers, no matter how briefly I steamed them.  I did find that if I put in my regular hot rollers after removing these, I would have a lasting curl, but who wants to go to the trouble of curling hair twice?  Just not for me - I prefer regular electric rollers, but unfortunately the brands with flocked rollers don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough for a lasting curl, and the ones with unflocked rollers don&#x27;t come with large enough sizes for my needs.</li>
    <li> Very time consuming. I wish there were more of the smaller rollers. I have a hard time keeping a curl, I usually stick with the wands and was looking for a less harsh method. I liked the curl from these rollers but it was very time consuming.</li>
    <li> I have used the steam setters for over 30 years, my hair is long (down to my waist), thick and very healthy and I color my hair and have for all of the 30 years and I roll my hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the greatest way to curl hair.  No dry heat to damage and make hair brittle, only a moist heat to curl and add shine.  You choose just how curly you want your hair.  If you just want more body with a light curl just roll all of your hair and then start removing the rollers starting with the first one you put in immediately let the hair cool before combing.  If you want beautiful curls roll your hair and leave in until the rollers cool (about the time it takes to apply your makeup).  For the people who say they had a wet mess - it&#x27;s because they left the curler on the steamer too long.  You just let the steam get the curler hot nothing more, if it&#x27;s wet you left in on the steamer too long.&lt;br /&gt;I place the curler on the steamer - part hair for the roller and roll hair - that quickly no waiting.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;I bought two so I always have a backup.  Only draw back is that they are not like hot rollers that last years or a lifetime.  With regular use these will last about 6 to 12 months. But at Revlon&#x27;s price worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I bought distilled water for this steam hair setter. I use it maybe 8 times...and it stopped steaming!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I will NOT purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Similar to one I owned years ago, this setter smoothes and softens my hair and completely gets rid of frizz.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s hair is chemically treated, so we needed a safer option than the regular hot sticks.  These are great; the big rollers straighten while the smaller rollers add nice bouncy curls.  They also seem to condition her hair at the same time.  They&#x27;re super easy to use and take only 10 minutes to put in with maybe only a 15 minute set time.  I only ordered these over the Curuso brand because I read that these have a satin covering which is gentler on the hair.  The ones we got did not come with  the satin covered rollers that other reviewers received, but they&#x27;re still gentle enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who sees these are impressed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but it wasn&#x27;t the pink foam rollers that I used as a kid in the 70&#x27;s! Yes, there may be steam in the rollers, but you still get that ridiculous ugly curl that you got when you you used the pink foam rollers. Only difference...you get a nasty curl in 15 minutes instead of having to wear the curlers overnight. Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when these arrived in the mail yesterday that I decided to try them out last night. They did not work. I would put one in my hair and as I prepared the next one the first one would roll right out of my hair. I spent over an hour just trying to keep them in my hair before I said forget it. Also the sizes were off the large and jumbo are labeled large/jumbo and use the same size lid even tho they are obviously completely different sizes and the lids do not fit both of them. I guess I should have went with the Caruso after all. I would also like to add that amazon has been wonderful they got back to me right away about the problem.</li>
    <li> I got two of these because they are hard to find elsewhere.  I needed the smaller rollers so I ordered two to have enough.  The larger ones would be good if you had long hair which I don&#x27;t but if I ever do I will have plenty!</li>
    <li> Have only used it once, but it worked great. The clicking was annoying and I wish it had smaller rollers. I would have bought the Caruso if it came in the purple or pink color. Just can&#x27;t do the red, so this was a good option for me. Now 2017 and the steamer is still working great! I love it. Used to the clicking now. Very happy with my purchase. Just make sure you never put regular water in the tray as it will never work the same.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for another set that was stolen while visiting Montreal. Works as well as the Caruso.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for more of these steam rollers for a while these were a great bargin!</li>
    <li> I opted for this steam-setter because I refused to pay $50 for a Caruso set and because I am on a mission to prove that you can have beautiful hair using drug-store products. This steam setter works great! It is easy to use and the rollers are quite comfortable. I let them stay in for about 15-20 minutes and have curls that last at least two days. My only issue with this product is the annoying clicking sound it makes on the ionic setting and the fact that the rollers only come in large and small, it would be nice to have a medium size option, but it is no big. Great product for the price. Recommended over the Caruso set for those of us who are spend-conscious.</li>
    <li> Have been using this type of curlers for years. Definitely keeps the curl in longer than other methods. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Durable &amp; works well. My family knocks it on the floor a lot &amp; it&#x27;s never broken. I was impressed by how many rollers came with the setter for the price. Nothing better than a wet/steam set. The curls last.</li>
    <li> This is so quick and easy and easy on your hair too.</li>
    <li> This little steam setter is compact, heats quickly, and makes gorgeous  curls in my longish hair. I like everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;The unit heats up before I even have my hair combed and divided. Each roller heats very quickly. I roll my hair and by the time I put on makeup and get dressed I can remove the rollers...flip my hair upside down and have a jumble of natural looking curls falling around my shoulders.</li>
    <li> just not worth the $, same as regular hot rollers, I only used them once, now their just taking up space</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I didn&#x27;t know much about steam rollers, but now that I do, I will definetly be using them much more than direct heat! My hair is fragile from processed relaxers so using flat irons and hand held blow dryers on hot were really making the situation worse. I very much like the shine you get from these curlers. And the time is cut in half on getting nice tight or loose curls, which is great when time is an issue.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  I have used this type of setter for many many years.  Nothing better!</li>
    <li> This is quick and easy to use, it is the second one that I have bought, just love it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to use to curl my hair and remembered I had Caruso curlers a few years back.  I looked at those on Amazon and then came across these rollers.  They were slightly less expensive and got pretty good reviews, so I thought I would try them.  They came lightning fast (1 day!), but I opened the box tonight and was disappointed to see the box inside that has the rollers in it was taped shut and the bag inside that box was ripped open.  Needless to say, they are going back.  I ordered this same item tonight that will be fulfilled by Amazon (The damaged one was Amazing Deals Online).  Keeping my fingers crossed.  Will find out Friday if it looks good.</li>
    <li> My daughter wasn&#x27;t sure about these when I bought them for her, but she loves them and they work great. Her hair is super long with a bit of natural curl that tends to go frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If done correctly, these work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I have to say is that our box didn&#x27;t come with instructions. My daughter found some videos to watch on Youtube about how to use them so it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This steamer came with more larger rollers than small.  I found a new hairdo because of that and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!</li>
    <li> I read about 50 reviews on this product and tried several different lengths of time to keep the curlers on the steaming base and in my hair but it did not curl my hair.  I have very fine hair.  Some people with fine hair had luck with it.  It would be a great product for those whom it works for.  Most reviews loved it but I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky ones it worked for.  It is worth a try because, if it works on your hair, it would be a great product.  My biggest disappointment was the instructions.  There were instructions on how to put water in and set it up but not instructions on how to curl your hair, how long to leave the curlers on the base and in your hair.  I relied on other reviews for this.  It&#x27;s worth a try but be sure you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package I thought there had been an error. The product box was all scuffed, dented, and scraped and looked about a hundred years old. This couldn&#x27;t be a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; unit. It was, however, sealed and the items inside looked new. I took out the hair-setter, filled it with distilled water (to the fill line), and plugged it in. No steam. I could feel it getting hot on the top, but no steam. I waited ten minutes and then unplugged it. I didn&#x27;t want to start a fire since the top of the unit had gotten quite hot. I had owned a similar setter before, and the steam usually started within a couple minutes. I examined the setter and discovered that the plug hole in the bottom (where the water can enter the unit) was completely sealed with the glue (used I guess to glue in the rubber gasket around the hole). The setter would never produce steam if water could not enter the unit. I then went out to my garage and used a small drill bit and hand drilled out the glue. I plugged it in again and it now works perfectly, producing a nice stream of steam in less than two minutes. So how many stars should I give this item? I gave it a generous three since if I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; it myself it would have been sent back as a defective unit, but now it does seem to work.</li>
    <li> Like these curlers.  I had to read the directions a few times before I got it.  But, my curls are very soft.  I have to admit that I have naturally wavy hair so this just enhances my waves into curls.</li>
    <li> Works great especially if you leave in for a while.</li>
    <li> Have been using steam rollers for years.  My hair is on the thin side, poker straight, plus I color it, so it&#x27;s not in good shape.  But the body these rollers give my hair is amazing.  I just learned that I should have been cleaning them once a month or so with white vinegar to prolong the life.  I bought a new one to replace the one that quit working (after 3 years).  Then I cleaned the old one and it&#x27;s back operating again.  Love it.  Now I have a back up.</li>
    <li> It worked fine, mechanically. The tick-tick-tick when it did it&#x27;s ionization ended up too loud for me to use while my roommate was asleep. But my hair didn&#x27;t hold a curl any better with it than it does with a curling iron, and a curling iron is a lot less futzy. My hair is stick straight and very fine, so nothing works well, even a perm (which I have in my hair and still cannot get a curl to hold). So, nothing wrong with the thing, makes generous curls and the curlers with this thing start with a &#x27;medium&#x27; which is generous size and go up from there and there are a BUNCH of them. Far more than I ever used. YMMV, of course.</li>
    <li> I have used steam setters for many many years.  My first one from the &#x27;90s required a dash of salt to generate the steam. I loved the look it gave my fine thin hair. Years later I cut off all my hair and didn&#x27;t use them. While packing for a cross country move I threw them out because I thought I would never use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well now my hair is long again and being unruly. I almost forgot about steam rollers until I ran across them here on Amazon. It is nice to see that salt is not required now. So I bought this set. When I received them I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that all the curlers are the same color. It was somewhat difficult to tell the difference between the large and jumbo size since they both use the same size clip and large/jumbo is imprinted on the rollers and clips.  A paint marker helped with that. I painted a little dot on both ends of the large rollers to tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other disappointing part was not receiving  any roller comb clips with this set. I remember using them with my old set as it was the only way to make sure the ends of my hair wrapped smoothly around the curler. A simple google search found me the comb clips I needed. Hurrah! I ordered them yesterday and tracking says they will be here tomorrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the steam setter and would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have been asked where I got the roller comb clips. Since they are sold on another website, not Amazon, I cannot post a direct link. Google \\&quot;caruso roller comb\\&quot; and you will find it.</li>
    <li> very useful  and Quick</li>
    <li> thought i&#x27;d try this instead of the pricier one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It makes a clicky noise when first plugged in, but they put a card in the box warning that it is normal for it to do that.  Easy and fast.</li>
    <li> It works, however it was not new as stated and did not come with a package seal or any instructions. I had to sanitize the rolls and scour the web to finally use it. Not worth the purchase if it isn&#x27;t new, doesn&#x27;t have instructions and still costs full price. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd steam setter I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. They barely lasted a year because I didn&#x27;t use distilled water as instructed. My first steamer, a Caruso steamer, died a miserable death choking on all of the sediment created by mineral deposits in the undistilled water. The second steamer, a Revlon steamer, died of the same fate even though I added white vinegar to the water thinking that that would prevent the corrosion from mineral deposits, NOT. Lesson learned - if you want your steamer to last, use distilled water as instructed!</li>
    <li> Love these rollers.  Great for quick curl if you use them with duckbill clips instead of the covers they come with.  But when they are used with the covers, they work very well on hard to curl hair.  So much better for your hair than hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this little unit.  Love the amount of sizes of curlers.  It is the easier thing to use and truly gives and keeps a great curl in my hair!!</li>
    <li> Great Product. I use it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Price is good. Shipped quickly. Heats up fast. Curls hold pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loud clicking sound when it&#x27;s on the Ionic setting. Per the instruction it&#x27;s working as designed in that mode.</li>
    <li> Product as described, brand new. I really like the steam setter. I have very fine hair and work great on it.</li>
    <li> Love this item works great on my fine hair</li>
    <li> Easy and quick to use. I bought the Conair Hot Roller Super Clips on Amazon to go along with this Ionic Steam Hair Setter as the comb clips are much easier to use than the covers that come with the Steam Setter and don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair. I am pleased with the results that I am getting using this hair setter and comb clips. I also like the fact that warm steam does not damage my hair. I already color my hair so I need to take extra good care of it. I opted to buy the Revlon instead of the Caruso because the Revlon costs about half as much and I trust the Revlon brand. I went with an Ionic Steam setter because I read that it produces more steam for a deeper set.</li>
    <li> Was set and ready to go out of the box. Easy storage and clean up. Heats fast. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> THE UNIT IS GREAT.  WORKS VERY WELL AND IS KIND TO THE HAIR.  THE ROLLERS, HOWEVER ARE VERY MUCH OVERSIZED.  THE SMALL SHOULD BE MEDIUM, THE MEDIUM SHOULD BE LARGE,ETC.  I HAD TO PURCHASE CARUSO ROLLERS IN ORDER TO USE THE UNIT.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT VERY FEW HEADS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE VERY MANY ROLLERS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY ARE OVER-SIZED.  JUST OFFER SOME SMALLER ROLLERS AND YOU WILL HAVE A 5 STAR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and a bit cheaper then the other major Caruso brand. I have long hair, and love how the steam rollers make pretty waves in my hair. Revlon&#x27;s version seems nice and does the trick- however it does appear that the Caruso brand seems to get a wee bit more hot (meaning the steam). I figured the savings itself is worth trying out- as so far it works the way I wanted it too. I have long hair (it goes way down my back) so it can be hard to find good products that actually work- this one does and comes with nice fat rollers to boot. So far it has been a good buy.</li>
    <li> It didnt curl my hair as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larysa</li>
    <li> I had used one of these for many years and finally wore it out.  I have looked for another for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I accidently found it here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s also small and travels really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just like the one I had years ago.  I have baby fine hair and it&#x27;s easy to get it too hot with curling irons and such and end up with frizzy ends.  That will not happen with this one.  It only take a about 20 seconds to heat up and start producing steam.  The roller fits on top of the setter for a few seconds.  By the time your hair is parted for the section of hair the curler will go in, the curler is ready.  You roll your hair and go to the next section.  By the time you are finished, you can take all the rollers out and give it about 10 seconds to cool, shake your head and brush into your style.  It also makes your hair shine!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it will not dry out or burn your hair.  It&#x27;s also good for over processed hair to get some body back in it.</li>
    <li> I have only used them twice so far so I am still trying to figure out the best way to do it since this is my first time with steam rollers, but I do like them.  The rollers heat up very quickly so it is easy to remove one, stick the next one on, and put the first one in your hair while the next is heating up.  The only thing I wish is that I could find more of just the rollers.  I have thick hair and need more than 8 of one size.  So far I have only tried the large and they do a decent job of putting a bit of curl in.  The jumbo are too big for my own personal preference and my hair length currently.</li>
    <li> So complicated and slow I threw it away in total frustration!</li>
    <li> This is the first hair curler set that actually curled my hair and I have owned a lot over the years.</li>
    <li> Love these steam rollers! I have switched to baking soda shampoo and apple cider vinegar rinse and the stem rollers add volume and shine. I have very fine hair that does not hold curl long. With the ionic steam I have curl and bounce. I have gotten lots of compliments on how pretty my hair is. Best of all, there is no damage to the hair. The hot iron was destroying my hair. I am very happy with this product. It works very well. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the large rollers they curl nicely. This package is great! I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this, my old one lasted a long time but finally gave out. Was so glad to get another one. Works great because I have long, straight hair, and this is one of the only things that will put body in it and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Should have saved my money. The curls are half hazard and last about 10 minutes. I have super fine hair, but my daughter has wavy hair that curls easily. Didn&#x27;t work for her either.</li>
    <li> I am a black girl, with long, medium textured hair.  After much research, I thought this product would work well with my \\&quot;no-heat\\&quot; styling desires. However, i found that the steam made my hair too wet, and as a result, my curls came out frizzy and messy.  Also, each roller must be \\&quot;steamed\\&quot; individually, making the entire process longer than I expected.  Overall, it is a good way to provide some curls without using traditional heat, but I didn&#x27;t particularly like the moisture that remained in my hair after usage.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll always have to wait... with these, you wait after you roll your hair for the rollers and hair to dry and set.  With a traditional set you have to wait for them to heat up.  After adding the more open clips, they work okay.</li>
    <li> If you used hot roller this product is quite different.  My hair is beautiful and not over processed by heat.  Love it</li>
    <li> This steamer is great. The ionic clicking noise is rather annoying but the overall product is what I expected.  Pros: steam allows for curls to stay longer and ionic helps reduce the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It soes not get as &amp;#34;steamy hot&amp;#34; as my old Caruso Setter did so it takes a bit longer to warm the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up and a recommendation for sure!</li>
    <li> It is a great product very happy</li>
    <li> Great steam hair setter, works just as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
