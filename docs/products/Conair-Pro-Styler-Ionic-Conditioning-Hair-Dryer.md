<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the multiple settings. Warm/low is gentle and leaves my rather delicate hair very soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this Conair when my old one finally blew.  After 10 year mind you.  I have short hair but need something with a couple heat and blow settings.  This does the trick.  There are two speed settings and three heat.  That gives you enough combinations to do the trick.  Takes me only 5 minutes to dry and style my hair.  It also has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button which is easy to reach.  The hook on the handle makes it easy to hang if you need to.</li>
    <li> Lots of power, works great, hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry after using.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  I really like the medium heat setting</li>
    <li> Works as well as more expensive products of similar type.</li>
    <li> Fast dry would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Loved it :-) Very nice hair dryer and does what is expected.</li>
    <li> Good power, effective...hate the size.</li>
    <li> Very light, fries my hair quickly. Like the cool button.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is pretty good for the price. I previously had a conair ceramic hair dryer with a retractable cord. It did a good job, but was heavy, and ultimately it was the retractable cord that caused the dryer to stop working. The Conair 256P is nice and light. I have curly hair and do not dry it completely, so I put the heat on the warm setting and the blower on high and it works great for me. It doesn&#x27;t come with a diffuser, but I don&#x27;t use one. It does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow. My son uses the dryer as well and likes it. The only complaint I would have is that it is noisy. Basically, it&#x27;s light and does a great job and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Pro:  lightweight, good power, less frizzies&lt;br /&gt;Con:  have to unplug nightlight in bathroom to accommodate the large GFC plug of dryer</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a hairdryer could make that much difference in the feel of my hair - this one doesn&#x27;t leave my ends frizzy or dry, and it&#x27;s nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to buy this dryer. It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry long hair in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Looked at various brands on Amazon, went with this one due to the good reviews. Works great and drys hair in a flash.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this lightweight hair dryer.  Says its easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works very well but the cord seams a little short.</li>
    <li> I admit, I was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did!  I have noticed that if I use a&lt;br /&gt;Higher speed than is recommended for my hair type, it doesn&#x27;t make as much of a change but if I follow the proper instructions, my hair is soft&lt;br /&gt;And shiny and the results are incredible!</li>
    <li> Light and dries quickly, but I&#x27;m not sure its really ionic. It frizzes a lot more than a previous ion blow dryer I had that cost alot more.</li>
    <li> I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair!</li>
    <li> Works well and has multiple heat settings and speeds.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2T6OZMUC6Y4JK]]DISCLAIMER: I like Amazon not just for buying products but for the reviews. Before I make a purchase I like to look at what people think, not just go head and make a purchase. I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
    <li> Such a great hair dryer that I had to buy another one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have found in a while. It is light weight, dries my thick, curly hair quickly, and it does a good job of not causing frizz.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this a few times a week and says it works wonderfully. It is not unduly harsh on her hair, not too noisy, and does what it should.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get to hot drys my hair nicely. No frizz</li>
    <li> Weakest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s only good for drying my toddler&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s not as strong as our old one. Takes so long to dry my hair now.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does not get very hot. On high heat it blows warm/cool on the low blow setting. Even on the high heat and high blow setting it is only warm.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this than my 10 year old Panteen hair dryer. No reduction in frizz. I bought this on amazon but I saw this exact hairdryer at dollar general for $15.  It is ok. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to believe this is an Ionic conditioning hair dryer. It made my hair dry &amp; frizzy. Nowhere on the dryer itself does it say it&#x27;s an ionic dryer which made me think the listing is incorrect.</li>
    <li> works great and price is even better</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer. Works well. Lots of adjustments. Still working after ?? a year or so?</li>
    <li> A great addition to my hair styling toolbox!  Dries my hair in about 7 minutes.  Love the different settings and the extra part for directing the air to go where you want it.</li>
    <li> Great prpduct for the price</li>
    <li> Take&#x27;s forever to dry my hair. Which is median length. But I like, that it has a cold setting. And you don&#x27;t have to hold a button, down. Which I really like. All, and all, for what I paid for it, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great hair dryer. Dries my hair very fast without the frizzy-ness that comes usually with that!</li>
    <li> Quietiest Hair dryer that we&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very powerful, drys quickly and efficiently.  Love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Works without problem. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> great dryer and delivered in just three days</li>
    <li> The reviews were great so I gave it a try.  To my amazement, it really does dry my long hair much faster than my other dryer.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  It is very powerful but I&#x27;m not sure that it blows any harder than my 1750.  It does do a fantastic job drying.  Additionally, for some reason, my hair stays fluffier - even after sleeping.  Lastly, all my previous dryers left a lot of my hair frazzled!  This dryer seems to leave my hair much smoother with lots of body.  I don&#x27;t have the dire need to use a straighter or curler every day to make it look normal!  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Perfect blow dryer!! Has power and the price is good:)</li>
    <li> Works great!  Lots of power and dries my hair quickly.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Great feature at a great price</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as I want it to.</li>
    <li> Fine. Just the wire not long enough.</li>
    <li> Over all great product! It&#x27;s stylish, light weight, easy to use and hold. Very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer. You have all the functions like hot and cool, high and low. The black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol. All in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price!</li>
    <li> Works fine, price is right.</li>
    <li> very good and i love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Just tried it out, but so far so good. Great quality. Arrived on time. Love the Conair name. Thank you Amazon and Conair!</li>
    <li> Much quieter than my old hairdryer. Works great, love the option for &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; settings. Wish it collapsed so it fit in my drawer better but otherwise its great for the price .My sister is a hairdresser and she buys cheap hair dryers, says its not worth the money to buy expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Love it dry so fast , not very good with freez but for the price is good.</li>
    <li> I really like the hair dryer. The cool switch is great. In other hair dryer I had to hold down the cold button. Does its Job.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer.  I’d been using the same one for years and it seemed like it was too hot and I felt like it was burning my scalp.  Somehow this dryer doesn’t seem that hot, but dries my hair faster than the other one did.  I think it actually dries twice as fast and I don’t feel like I’m damaging my hair (or scalp) like I was with the older one.  The price was right too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> fast shipping-just as shown.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, my wife loved it but it eventually broke.</li>
    <li> Super hot and really nice to use.  Serves its purpose, what more could I ask!?</li>
    <li> The cord on this is very short so in order to blow dry my hair sitting down, I had to attach an extension cord. Other than that, it works very good.</li>
    <li> is holding up well, i enjoy that the warm is enough to dry thick hair</li>
    <li> Very powerful and holds up well</li>
    <li> Item seems satisfactory, haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Liked price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a little more blow to it. Still gets the job done, though.</li>
    <li> Solidly built hair dryer - diffuser stays on and doesn&#x27;t pop off on a moment&#x27;s notice as did a Revlon drier I used to have but which fell apart in less than a year... (am returing to Bed Bath Beyond) nice built in hook for hanging, plenty powerful, not too noisy, price was OK. All in all, works better than a towell and/or shaking the head a lot to remove water!  haha</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I like about this model:&lt;br /&gt;1. Dries your hair FAST without getting so hot it feels like it&#x27;s frying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can set the switch to the \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; setting - you don&#x27;t have to hold a button in.&lt;br /&gt;3. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> When I first pulled it out of the box I was surprised to find that mine at least had a sparkly finish but I decided to try it before passing any judgments on how the product works. I&#x27;m happy I did. The dryer has 6 settings each tailored to a different hair type, which is great. In addition to that handy perk, it also has instant cool for setting styles. My hair is always very soft and pretty after using the dryer. Glad to say that I love it!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful and does s great and quick job of drying my hair after a shower. The price was right and it was shipped quickly by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! Great power and lots of heat/ cool settings to choose from!.</li>
    <li> Good product, but cord is short.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it to, but that&#x27;s just a personaly thing. Definitely gets hot enough for your hair.</li>
    <li> Decent heat temperature and air flows.  A good hair dryer for the price.  Lighter weight than the last silver model I had.  That one lasted for nearly 10 years with every other daily use.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace an older Conair 1875.  The GFCI plug on this unit failed after 45 days of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will look for a dryer with a UL safety listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk.</li>
    <li> nice and light weight-- makes it easy to use. since using this my hair has been smoother and more shiny.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this dryer, wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the right one for me.. yet after I received it, I love it..  its just what I wanted. it does the job..</li>
    <li> This is a basic hairdryer I like it gets the job done dries my hair . Then I style it however I want to , flat iron or curling iron</li>
    <li> Looks great, works great, cord isn&#x27;t too short (a pet peeve), and I love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days. I can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since I can change up the settings the moment it&#x27;s a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction. Really liking the product so far. For me, Conair has always delivered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I had imagined but the weight is okay and it works quick. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair texture or look but it works well otherwise. And mine didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser as some reviews mention.</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
    <li> I have had Conair dryers before and loved them and have had $100-$200 ones and I would pick the Conair every time. I saw some people say it was not as powerful as they would have liked and I don&#x27;t know if they were using a leaf blower to dry their hair or what (LOL) but this blow dryer is fantastic. I have long thick hair and I love the 3 speed/3 drying temps and it dried it very fast with plenty of power, Also like the facts that it is lightweight, easy to handle and has the removable lint option. I would give it a 10 out of 10. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it ;)</li>
    <li> Two buttons means you can control the fan speed and temperature -independently- which is a very good thing.  This is a good hair dryer, better than the discount store cheapies--but it is a good price, and good quality too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Has been exactly what I wanted without any problems.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this thing! It is the replacement for one that died... has more power, shiny, and nice. Does the job. What can I say?</li>
    <li> Strong blow ; great design ; it has a bit of a weight to it but its great ! ;; i got no diffuser but i got a concentrator attachment</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I like that it dries my hair super-fast and it is super-light to hold.  The curved handle makes it easy to hold.  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Works fine--- couldn&#x27;t be better</li>
    <li> Being a guy I never saw a need for a hair dryer, but recently I found it gives me a ton of volume (Duh). This is a great buy and the attachment works wonders during styling. Not to mention, if you are a hairy guy, it makes the drying process of the rest of your body a lot easier!</li>
    <li> I have had three of these over the years. Ionizing dryer keeps the frizz out of your hair. Cool setting is nice in addition to the two settings for hot, blasting and normal. Great hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!! Very comfortable to use, controls in the right spot and dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! VERY happy!!! And it has sparkles... :D</li>
    <li> Best dryer i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than expected, but it works well. Dries hair quickly and good for the price. Good for portability I suppose.</li>
    <li> Great product and affordable price. I have long hair and it&#x27;s just what I need to dry my hair without taking too long. Love it already! The silver part is shiny :) it&#x27;s also very light, but looks high quality.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Liked the look of it, but it had hardly any power, the blower is very weak. Returned and exchanged for a different Conair that is the same model as I owned previously.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Love the sparkle and makes my hair fuller.</li>
    <li> Was as expected... AWESOME. Girlfriend will not stop raving about its heat control and power. I highly recommend it to anyone in need.</li>
    <li> A solid hairdryer.  Not high-end, but perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect &amp; light weight.</li>
    <li> This is a great little hair dryer!  It&#x27;s powerful and warms up really fast.  I had to relearn to dry my hair after retiring my other hair dryer - I&#x27;m done so much more quickly now!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great hair dryer for the price.  It&#x27;s lightweight, stylish &amp; works well.  And it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on Amazon than in any store.  It may not have fancy extras like a retractable cord or super power speed, but you get what you pay for, and for this price point you get a great basic hair dryer :)</li>
    <li> Great but a little on the loud side</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my blow dryer. It&#x27;s not crazy hot to the point of burning my head but it still dries my locks;  all 3.5 feet of it.</li>
    <li> Blown away George,  BLOWN away!</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to be 1875 watts, but it sure doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as my last Revlon one. Wish I had just bought that.</li>
    <li> It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality.</li>
    <li> Quit heating after 60 days,</li>
    <li> Love the three temp settings - cool, warm and hot.</li>
    <li> I have this hair dryer for about 3 yrs and works great and it is a great price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;m currently using it in the bath tub right now. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with people saying not to use it near water, because I&#x27;m getting the same amount of power I usually get. Oh, well, I guess people aren&#x27;t too smart these days...</li>
    <li> After a few weeks the fan power is week and you can smell burning hair though the filter is clean.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Do not waste your money.  Worked for less than a month of only once a week usage.  Tried to return but it was a few days over the 30 days.  Would give less than one star but not available.</li>
    <li> LOVE CONAIR PRODUCTS and recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had it in me to buy an expensive blow dryer, so I&#x27;m no expert on dryers. But I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one. Very powerful and  you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as you would expect with a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Good dryer for the money</li>
    <li> Powerful and light weight. What more could you ask for in a lower priced dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was rated in the top 10 non-professional dryer. It works great!</li>
    <li> I like the temperature settings of cool, warm and hot but would like this dryer more if the flow of air were stronger when set on high.  It seems to take longer for my hair to dry with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I needed new hair dryers for upstairs and downstairs bathrooms and didn&#x27;t want to pay too much. I don&#x27;t do a lot of styling, mostly just wash and dry, so I didn&#x27;t need a lot of attachments. This one suited me perfectly. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My old dryer was a Conair and worked well for years. I hope this one lasts as long.&lt;br /&gt;To anyone looking for a nice simple hair dryer, reasonably priced, I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer and a great price.  Very powerful....the second Conair dryer I&#x27;ve had; the previous one lasted at least 20 years!</li>
    <li> Less heat and more blow would be better</li>
    <li> Got tho on super sale. Love it! Cuts my drying time in half</li>
    <li> Longer than I thought it was from the picture.  Actual dimensions are needed.</li>
    <li> My daughters used to fight over who would use the hair dryer first but now, I bought one for each of them and they say that its been good to them.</li>
    <li> I blowdry my hair at least 3 times a week and I was using a really, really old, cheap, bulky one to get the job done. This dryer gets the job done a lot better! It&#x27;s smaller, lighter, more ergonomic if you will, and dries my long, thick hair (not always a good thing!) reasonably quick! Great purchase, as long as it lasts as long as my old ones did :)</li>
    <li> Love it and the sparkly finish on it!</li>
    <li> I like it.  I needed a new dyer. this one is not too noisy.  It has different speeds and temps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a good buy and a good dryer -- glad I got it</li>
    <li> Nice weight and power!</li>
    <li> Recently bought this blow dryer. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does the job for a great price :)</li>
    <li> I have had this blow drier for 4 years now and it still works great! It dries my hair quickly, has multiple temperature settings, and is small enough to easily store. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. Just ordered it yesterday and used it this morning. Lightweight and bought it to replace my old Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer.</li>
    <li> This gives one choice of heat and power. It is fast and nice</li>
    <li> Great power, light weight, just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Nothing new about this hair dryer, but it works as it should.</li>
    <li> Good price and great product. I like the attachable thing (whatever you call it) so I can target my hair better.</li>
    <li> Works good for me, no problems and I use it damn near everyday</li>
    <li> Excellent product！Excellent seller！Thanks！</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in no time, a really great investment! love it!</li>
    <li> Everything about this hairdryer seems nice, except for the power. It is so weak. I do have thick hair but have another Conair that is much more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I would have returned this, but was able to swap with a friend who has thin hair.</li>
    <li> cool speed is perfect for my hair.  no frizz or dryness</li>
    <li> I found everything goes well except the plug. Why the left and right is opposite and I have to put the plug upside down for charging!!! Another flaw is the big noise.</li>
    <li> Light weight and powerful!  I like the look of this hair dryer and it performs quite well.  Love the cool shot to lock in style!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what i used to say. Now I&#x27;m the most metro ever. Whatever, it drys my dumb haircut good. Plus it&#x27;s small: that&#x27;s what she said.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s reconditioned.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer does not have much power. My current blow dryer was dying out so I bought this one to replace it but it is no better than my 5 year old blow dryer. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It stopped working today after working wonderfully for a few months :(</li>
    <li> Works awesome, no problems so far.</li>
    <li> FOR THE MONEY ITS FINE…KIND OF SMALL. POWERFULL. DESIGN AND COLOR ARE GREAT.CORD IS SHORT TOO…DONT BE FAR FROM OUT-LET</li>
    <li> Great buy for a long lasting hair dryer with cool shot. This one didn&#x27;t have the retractable cord like our previous one but will give you lasting service.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for buying a new one is simple  the switch broke after 8 years of daily use.</li>
    <li> Loved this compact hair dryer.  I keep it in my gym bag.  Nice quality and air blows great, like options.  Best deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Multiple settings, light, and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for about six months. It dries, it&#x27;s strong, but I keep smelling a slight burn scent and I feel like it&#x27;s just about ready to bite the dust. I don&#x27;t really even blow dry my hair that often. Also, it claims to be &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but my hair is totally frizzy after using it, so it seems like just a buzz word on this product. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll be shopping for a more quality product.</li>
    <li> Works great and dries my hair really fast! I have long, medium-thickness hair and this does the trick. Love the different heat settings and how it doesn&#x27;t just have a cool button, but an actual cool setting. Only thing is I wish this came with a diffuse attachment...</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased (still using the first one which I purchased at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond).  I like its features so much that I bought this second one as a back-up in case the first one quits, but it&#x27;s still going strong at about five years old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It&#x27;s fine, it works (so far, we&#x27;ll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I&#x27;ve used, my hair isn&#x27;t softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it.</li>
    <li> The only thing i&#x27;d say about this product is that i wish the cord was a little longer, otherwise its ok.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer  I bought as a gift but nearly kept for myself!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and with separate controls for cool, warm, hot for both low and high, this is a good product. Doesn&#x27;t quite have the velocity of some previous Conairs we have had, but we are pleased.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this dryer! Dries fast and is easier on the hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to correct some misinformation that has been posted in other reviews.  This blow dryer has two speeds and off not three speeds as some have reported.  It does have three heat settings so you don&#x27;t have to hold in the button to get the cool setting. This is a big advantage for me over other dryers that only have two heat settings. It has good blowing power without being too noisy.  I have been using this dryer for over a year and have not had any problems with it.  There is a removable filter that is easy to take off and clean.</li>
    <li> Cord is way to short.</li>
    <li> Hi! Love this hair dryer but if you put it on high it get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> So far, an excellent hair dryer. Not too noisy. Good controls. The handle is well contoured. My only nit is that the little plastic attachment that directs the stream of warm or hot air pops off a little too easily.</li>
    <li> Plugged it in, dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord is a little short, if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand, but the dryer itself is good for what it does, not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself, but effective in drying my thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
    <li> Light weight with great power.&lt;br /&gt;It has great heat and I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;to friends and family! Thank you conair!</li>
    <li> This dryer may work well in the United States...but the instructions say that it CANNOT BE USED WITH AN ELECTRICAL ADAPTOR FOR EUROPE. So if you are planning to take it on a trip outside of the USA this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this item, My first one is still working great bought the second one so I have one that I can take with me and if I lose it I will still have one, Words great.</li>
    <li> It works. It&#x27;s hotter than all heck and burns your scalp if you use it on high. If you don&#x27;t you may as well be using any old cheap dryer. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase when it dies.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! I love the multiple heat and strength settings. The dryer itself is aesthetically pleasing, with a nice sparkly finish and is not too heavy. It takes a long time to dry my hair, so I appreciate the weight of it!</li>
    <li> Do not get hot enough and a little smaller than what I thought.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Just enough power to blow dry my hair fast.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped; the speeds and temperature control are sufficient. Still takes a while to dry my long hair, so this is not as impressive as some. Still, for the price, it&#x27;s fine. The true test will be how long it lasts before breaking...</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer by conair. My last one was a conair. It lasted many years.</li>
    <li> Works very well, especially for the price.  I love how strong it is and how it smoothes my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> Lightweight, powerful dryer.  Much nicer than my old one.</li>
    <li> Cheap and works great. Doesn&#x27;t tend to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my hair either.</li>
    <li> Bought this for limited use to seal windows, having never purchased one before. It worked great.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected..</li>
    <li> Dries hair in no time at all!  Great price great product.  Lightweight and fairly quiet.  I am hoping that this drier lasts many years, as did my last Conair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Cuts dry time in half when compared to other dryers.  Purchased my own and when my daughter borrowed it she loved it so I ordered another for her as a gift.  Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This dryer has alot of power,,different heating settings,,,i was just use to one! Well worth the money,,i have looked around and this is cheaper and a better product! Well worth buying</li>
    <li> Works great, light weight, easy to handle.  Just what I was looking for..</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use.  I&#x27;m really glad I chose this dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful hair dryer! Haven&#x27;t really noticed it making my hair softer but it has a lot of settings and works great!</li>
    <li> looks exactly as in photo. light weight and works like a charm. would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, this dryer dries my hair fast and there is no frizz! I just wish the cord was a little longer.</li>
    <li> Works great! I use it every day for a year and have had no problems with it. It looks nice too! There are sparkles in the black section of the blow dryer which is always fun :) There is also a vent in the back that opens to clean out the dust or hair that gets sucked in. For the money it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Much quieter than my old dryer, more settings, and performs well.  I have no regrets on purchasing this model.  Moderate price and good performance.</li>
    <li> my hair looks so dry after i use it. i am very disappointed. i would of returned it but i lost the return slip!</li>
    <li> The Conair Ionic 1875 Turbo Hair Styler/Dryer is Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair is lightweight but has the power to move a good volume of air. It looks pretty in black and chrome. It has a large enough handle so that it is comfortable to hold. It has two setting switches. One switch for high or low air volume. One switch for cool, warm, or hot temperature. It also has a cool shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Conair is that the switches are a little hard to change while holding it. I have to set the dryer down to change the settings. I could switch back and forth between high and low heat with my old Conair, but I just keep my new Conair on medium heat. That works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the Conair Ionic 1875 Turbo. It dries my hair fast and leaves it shiny and without static. Also, the price is very low compared to similar hair dryers at stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price! If your looking for a good but cheap in price blow dryer, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a very good price</li>
    <li> light weight, not too loud, dries well.</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight and seems to be durable.  My wife has enjoyed her use of this product.  The optional concentrator attachment has also been a key feature to this great hair dryer.  My wife wanted an inexpensive hair dryer that would hold up for the long haul.  This hair dryer seems to be the match for her.</li>
    <li> Powerful, light and comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> dries fast with out too much wind power. I am a hairdresser, and used all kinds of dryers... expensive, fancy, ceramic, This is my fave- i will even buy another one, just in case.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking blow dryer and performs great too! It is a replacement for another Conair that I bought about 10 years ago.....I highly recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive Ionic Blow dryer!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works as promised.  I have owned the same model before and purchased a second one for my spare bathroom.  I like the settings this dryer offers - High Medium and Low speed with Hot Warm or Cool settings. This dryer is smaller than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve had before so it is easy to travel with and is still powerful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that heavy and it&#x27;s sturdy.I like that it does not result in frizzy hair at all. I have thick hair, but it dries out in no time.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer. I first got to try this in a hotel in New York. I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair. I knew I had to get one when I got home! It dries your hair nicely without cooking your head! My old dryer got so hot it was uncomfortable. Not this one. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Great price too!</li>
    <li> This dryer works well. I think the temps are perfect for my hair (very fine). My spouse thinks it&#x27;s not quite hot enough (thick hair). I love the different fan settings on inner handle. The cool button does not change the fan speed, only the temp. I have had this for a few months now, and it really does a nice job.</li>
    <li> I am perfectly satisfied with this blow-dryer. Although it is fairly small, it is quite powerful and dries my hair in no time.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Man, let me tell ya, this thing really blows; and I mean that in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one, it will blow you away..lol</li>
    <li> It works well for me.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE LOOKING PRODUCT ITS COMPACT BUT YET GETS THE JOB DONE QUICKLY AND QUIETLY EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT DIDN&#x27;T WOKE WAKE UP MY MAN FROM  HIS SLEEP AT THIS PRICE YOU WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO GRAB ONE AND COMING FROM NE... WELL LETS JUST SAY....I KNOW MY SHIT,,,I&#x27;M PURCHASING SEVERAL MORE TO HOLD AS Xmas GIFTS FOR MY LOVERS SIDE OF THE FAMILY WHO GOD KNOWS, THEY CAN USE A GOOD BLOW OUT (PUN INTENDED)&lt;br /&gt;0, NOT TO MENTION A MAKE OVER, WARDROBE COUNSELING AND.o WELL I DIGRESS BUT U ALL GET MY POINT...HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS YOU OUT... SEE U ALL AT STALLS....BYE BYE NOW..MiCHAEL.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Cuts her drying time by 15+ min (so I like it too :-). )</li>
    <li> This dryer was perfect blow speed for my long fine hair.  High blow was drying and so was low.  Low allowed styling unlike my other (conair 1875 which missed class on what does High versus Low mean)..  Great selections for any speed/heat you want.  On this one,  I give kudos to however designed the switches - probably a woman.  This is light-weight and had everything I wanted Except ---&amp;#62; it did not appear to be truly ionic for me.  My hair looked terrible.  The box and inside pamphlet states ionic, but the dryer did nothing for my hair.  It was a limp flyaway mess.  Disappointed as the rest of it was great.  This may work for you and I would recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fine hair.  I use a round brush to put a little body in it and while this dryer dried it just fine, I couldn&#x27;t get the little curl that I like at the ends.  My hair just kept going straight. I bought the Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer a week later and even thought both have the same wattage, loved the other one.  This one will go into the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> A bit larger size  than expected , but usable . good heat, levers work, delivered fast.. not used much but workable. A bit smaller size would have been  better</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, so great for long uses.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t really like it. Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Works fine though.</li>
    <li> I replaced this because I thought my 10 year old dryer wasn&#x27;t putting out the heat like it should. It was an 1875 watt also. This is a little more ergonomically friendly, but no more powerful than my old. I do not notice an increase in shine as claimed for the Ionic aspect. If you need a dryer, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box i was surprised by how nice it was. It has 3 different levels and the directions even recomend whates better for your hair type. Their is no problem with it its just i thought it would give off more heat. My hair is thick and it took longer than expected for it to dry. I am just gonna use it till it breaks i guess.</li>
    <li> conair always makes good products</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. It&#x27;s light and dries my&lt;br /&gt;Hair super fast.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter says she absolutely loves the dryer. It was a Christmas gift for her. She loves the fact that it does not frizz her hair. The heat is just right. Loves the controls and she would buy it again. She was quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. A great Mothers Day present</li>
    <li> Very happy so far, I haven&#x27;t owned this very long but it seems to work very well, it has a lot of settings so I can always find what I need for my hair.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer is decent for the price .</li>
    <li> Great service, very nice blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a new hair dryer in many years and I just love this one.  It&#x27;s light enough for me to handle and yet strong enough to do the job.  Thank you, Conair.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer. It does blow HARD on the high setting, which is exactly what I wanted. I also love the hot, medium and cold settings. You can set it there and go on your way - unlike other hairdryers where you have to hold down a &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; button to get the cold air. I try to use the medium setting as much as possible to limit the heat damage to my hair. The only thing that would make this hairdryer better is a retractable cord! :-D</li>
    <li> I spent a very long time waiting for the right deal on an ionic hair dryer and this was the first time in at least 6 months that I saw what I was looking for with an appealing price tag. I took the plunge and bought it and have been VERY happy with the results. My hair turns out very smooth and is even shiny after I use it. The clip on accessory is amazing for focusing the air stream and definitely helps with minimizing frizz. It is also very pretty. :)</li>
    <li> Works great and looks good too. I am not disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I only use conair blow dryers. This one is smaller than my last one (which was 5+ years old). The barrel is shorter making it easier to pack for a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
    <li> Good quality and nice looking</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer for many reasons - it&#x27;s quiet, can dry my hair quickly and produces great results. It&#x27;s also pretty light weight.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer for the price! I&#x27;ve owned Hot Tools and other Conair dryers in the past, and so far this one has been the best. I bought this one to replace my older model Conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use. I really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting, rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast (although it still has that button as an option). It&#x27;s not as quiet as my last dryer, but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static. My hair actually looks more shiny/silky after using this one than it did with the older model.</li>
    <li> Just your average dryer. Didn&#x27;t notice any special difference with the ionic next to my old coil dryer. Works well.  Like all the different settings. Nice weight. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> it does a good job in a short amount of time and that it exactly why i bought this.  good dryer</li>
    <li> Girlfriend likes it. However, doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as the previous version</li>
    <li> It came with a diffuser tip and I really liked that. It&#x27;s a little louder than my other dryer, but I think it works better. I have dropped it a few times and it is still perfectly fine, even after hitting the counter hard.</li>
    <li> It does a fine job drying hair.  The warm setting is a little hotter than I like, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  It&#x27;s also more on the noisy side as far as hair dryers go.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Ergonomics is perfect. It has a dust filter that you can remove and clean out. The plug has a breaker switch. The main power switch is in the handle. This dryer can be used in a salon setting.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. I can really tell the difference from my 10 year old dryer .</li>
    <li> compact size, quiet and quick dry</li>
    <li> Works as intended. No problems. This is replacing another just like it that we had and it lasted 7+ years. Can&#x27;t ask for much more for a blow dryer in this price range.</li>
    <li> Love this!  it really does have a great cool setting!</li>
    <li> Very nice dryer for the money.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> the wind is strong enough. Hot also is not burning the hand.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, great temp choices. I have fine hair and using this dryer leaves my hair soft and manageable. Within a few moments, I have my style and am out the door.</li>
    <li> I took it out of the package and plugged it in. It was way too loud, so I returned it without ever using it.</li>
    <li> Works well but you need a lot of space to store it.  It&#x27;s like a giant robotic arm.</li>
    <li> good quality and compact enough...strong air flow on lowest setting</li>
    <li> 3 stars - it&#x27;s ok. I feel like this hair dryer is a little lacking in both heat and strength, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much. I generally let me hair air dry or only use it for my bangs, so it does the job. If you&#x27;re a serious blow dryer, go for something else, Personally, I&#x27;ll go for a different model next time, but in the meantime, I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is really powerful. I love it. I get my hair dried in half the time. I used to have a portable blowdryer that had half the power. What a difference a good blowdryer makes to a readying process! This thing is saving me time.</li>
    <li> Plenty of heat  and small in stature but does the job</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer--cool, warm and hot settings, plus a cool button.  I liked the sparkly finish.  My only complaint is that it is kind of big and hard to store. Fairly priced.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. Its ionic which is the best type of blow dryer for your hair and it really does make hair smoother and softer. It very stylish looking and easy to hold. It works great every time I use it and only takes about 40 minutes to dry my hair. The heat flow is very strong and I also like the cool shot as well. It very chilly. lol</li>
    <li> Dries very well, takes less time to dry my hair than with other hair dryers I&#x27;ve tried. (This review is from my wife, the one using the dryer.)</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer. It has hot/cool/warm options as well as high/low. It does the job, and it&#x27;s kind of sparkly. I am pleased.</li>
