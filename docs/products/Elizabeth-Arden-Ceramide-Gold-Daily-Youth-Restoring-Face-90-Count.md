      <li>I already have tried these before from Macy&#x27;s, but the price on these were so much better.  </li>
      <li>Phenomenal price.</li>
      <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
      <li>Because this is a gret product which I have used for years and the price was great highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>so when  that is taken into consideration it is a pretty good deal.  </li>
      <li>I love the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules and I think it&#x27;s a really great product but the quality of what I received was far below par.</li>
      <li>Putting makeup over it is easy and and makes the blending easy.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first thinking too good to be true.</li>
      <li>So on the Elizabeth Arden website, I filled out a contact form to ask, and I received an automated reply from their website, but it never answered my question.</li>
      <li>This product make your face feel as smooth as silk.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>the light silky serum that glides over the face and absorbs so quickly.</li>
      <li>Because it is a serum, it works its magic with a nice moisturizer following your application of the capsule.</li>
      <li>Have been using Ceramide for years and am delighted with the results, especially around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>is a pricey product (to me anyway) and beats the full department store price.</li>
      <li>But it is true.</li>
      <li>This arrived before it was due and great job on the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I have combination acne prone (mild) skin.</li>
      <li>Vichy and Elizabeth Arden are my two loves even though this is the first EA product I tried!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I always loved the feel of this moisturizer over any other.  </li>
      <li>At first it seemed too oily, but within about four minutes, the silky oil had been absorbed.</li>
      <li>Found this is extremely effective for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I have also had several people notice that my face looks softer and more</li>
      <li>would highly recommend these!!</li>
      <li>and my face is so soft, wrinkle free, it really works.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product…it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Product came in one large vial instead of the 3.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what we used to pay high retail for.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules were helping until I took a break from using them.  </li>
      <li>I use another treatment product on top of it after it sinks in.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really get anywhere.</li>
      <li>They arrived as in the picture in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>The ceramide gold was just as I expected and was just like to one I have paid much more for at department stores.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I looked up Ceramide on Wikipedia to find out more, but it stopped short of saying where those cells are actually coming from to make the ceramide.</li>
      <li>I love this, I live in Florida and even if I get a little to much sun on my face this stops my face from peeling,</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for any skin over 40+.</li>
      <li>Great product but lousy packing.</li>
      <li>I feel like they really are youth restoring as far as plumping my skin.  </li>
      <li>Everyday, I wake up to better skin than the day before.</li>
      <li>After using the capsules for about a week I was surprised that the results I normally see were nonexistent.</li>
      <li>But I also found out that cells from fetal tissue have been used in certain beauty products, so I wanted to know if I had inadvertantly been doing the same all this time.</li>
      <li>It feels like a super-silky, hybrid olive oil that leaves my skin feeling soft, silky and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on oily and it is soaked up in minutes; your faces feels soft and the appearance of wrinkles goes away; I am 60 years old, and a lot of&lt;br /&gt;people</li>
      <li>Just the right amount in every little capsule for the face and neck.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I always loved the feel of this moisturizer over any other.  It feels like a super-silky, hybrid olive oil that leaves my skin feeling soft, silky and moisturized.  I am ready to review it now because I had a wake-up call when I missed a few days of using it!  Even though I continued exfoliating twice a week, I had dry, flakey skin around my nose and other areas of my face!  I didn&#x27;t realize how much Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules were helping until I took a break from using them.  I highly recommend this product…it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  Will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Ceramide is great for hydration purpose. I am in late 20&#x27;s and started to notice that my skin needs extra moisture since I have dry skin especially in winter. This works great.</li>
    <li> Great product but lousy packing. I wish they would change it. Is the most impractical packing.</li>
    <li> I love these capsules.  I have been using them for a number of years and am very pleased with the way my skin looks.  They arrived as in the picture in a very timely manner. This was a very good value.</li>
    <li> Product came in one large vial instead of the 3. Was very nice to have condensed to that container, it&#x27;s much more stable when it&#x27;s upright!</li>
    <li> My wife likes these but the price just went up a lot since this order</li>
    <li> This product make your face feel as smooth as silk.  Putting makeup over it is easy and and makes the blending easy.</li>
    <li> These little capsules have enough product to cover your face, neck and chest area.  You&#x27;ll think it is going to make your skin oily but it sinks in to a totally dry finish.  Your skin will drink it up.  I feel like they really are youth restoring as far as plumping my skin.  I use another treatment product on top of it after it sinks in.  Buying on Amazon is the only way to go for this is a pricey product (to me anyway) and beats the full department store price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years, and it is one of the best products I every used on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on oily and it is soaked up in minutes; your faces feels soft and the appearance of wrinkles goes away; I am 60 years old, and a lot of&lt;br /&gt;people ask me what I use on my face.</li>
    <li> I already have tried these before from Macy&#x27;s, but the price on these were so much better.  I would definitely purchase these on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I use this as night cream and I like it.</li>
    <li> very good addition to the eye capsules.  You need to be diligent and use them both 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> This arrived before it was due and great job on the packaging.  I really like this product and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Because this is a gret product which I have used for years and the price was great highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love these capsules..... use them all the time.... the price is great! I will be buying them constantly......</li>
    <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden products for years and have been very pleased with them. But I also found out that cells from fetal tissue have been used in certain beauty products, so I wanted to know if I had inadvertantly been doing the same all this time. I tried to look up where Elizabeth Arden actually gets their ingredients from to make ceramide and I didn&#x27;t really get anywhere. I looked up Ceramide on Wikipedia to find out more, but it stopped short of saying where those cells are actually coming from to make the ceramide. So on the Elizabeth Arden website, I filled out a contact form to ask, and I received an automated reply from their website, but it never answered my question. I have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> The ceramide gold was just as I expected and was just like to one I have paid much more for at department stores. They were delivered on time and I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Found this is extremely effective for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love the light silky serum that glides over the face and absorbs so quickly.</li>
    <li> Will forever be unable to live without again!! Compliments immediately. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> very good price that in the stores</li>
    <li> REALLY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, TYVM!</li>
    <li> Buyer should understand that this is not a moisturizer and you should use one on top of this for the best results.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for any skin over 40+. Because you get one dose, so to speak, in every capsule, there is no need to worry about excess over indulgence. Because it is a serum, it works its magic with a nice moisturizer following your application of the capsule. Morning and evening rituals are ideal if your budget allows, and will you ever see a difference! There is a reason that my mother has flawless skin with no trace of even a hint of a wrinkle; this alone is that reason. This stuff works!!</li>
    <li> No impact on my skin. Did seem to actually dry out my skin a bit. Not worth the money. I have combination acne prone (mild) skin.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with the quality of the product from this vendor. After using the capsules for about a week I was surprised that the results I normally see were nonexistent. I love the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules and I think it&#x27;s a really great product but the quality of what I received was far below par. I should have known considering the price was so low.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20 years and can absolutley say that this is the best product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am over 60 and my face is so soft, wrinkle free, it really works.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount in every little capsule for the face and neck.  At first it seemed too oily, but within about four minutes, the silky oil had been absorbed. I have been using this for about four months and like the way my skin feels and looks. Recommended product!</li>
    <li> I have been using EA products for over 15 years, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. My dermatologist, says Ceramide is the best thing for your skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I&#x27;m set for a while.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years...keep getting them...says enough!</li>
    <li> I love this, I live in Florida and even if I get a little to much sun on my face this stops my face from peeling,</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!  I have been using these since December, and I can definitely tell a difference in my skin!  I have also had several people notice that my face looks softer and more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> Love the product, received it on time!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now.  It&#x27;s easy, there&#x27;s no fuss and your skin is smooth and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Perfect! We recieved it before the delivery date. It is exactly what we used to pay high retail for. Not anymore! I was hesitant at first thinking too good to be true. But it is true. I will be re-ordering until they sell out. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> My skin has never been better. Everyday, I wake up to better skin than the day before. I attribute it to this! I am a self-proclaimed skincare junkie so I have tried a LOT of skincare products...  Vichy and Elizabeth Arden are my two loves even though this is the first EA product I tried!</li>
    <li> The Ceramide capsules are a bit pricey.  However, I get three uses from one capsule so when  that is taken into consideration it is a pretty good deal.  Have been using Ceramide for years and am delighted with the results, especially around the eyes.  Have very dry skin around the mouth and this helps the condition.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my mom, and she do loves it!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal price. This is a great product</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden Ceramide capsules are a must have product for me.My skin looks radiant and youthful and I dont need a Foundation primer when I use this.The package came sealed and in perfect condition.This product retails for 92 dollers.What a value at under 50.</li>
    <li> Good product, timely delivery.</li>
