      <li>Hubby is a super picky toothbrush person and he loved his as well.</li>
      <li>He told me that electric toothbrushes work much better at cleaning my gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>But... it really has been doing a great job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, I love that the kit has two brushes and two refills for each brush.  </li>
      <li>The vibration isn&#x27;t too forceful but much more massaging and soothing.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes 2 brushes to a pack with 2 replacement heads for each brush.</li>
      <li>We are moving and I won&#x27;t be able to plug the toothbrush into an outlet in the bathroom to keep it charged.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of using it and the cleanliness that follows.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression that these were more sonic than battery , but I as mistaken .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than the electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>She has reservations about not being able to control the output speed.</li>
      <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>So I told her “Don’t Worry Baby”, you “Mike Love” it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We appsolutly love them.</li>
      <li>Nor do I see a way to purchase more heads.  </li>
      <li>I am able to brush up close to my gums without them hurting.</li>
      <li>They are very strong, by bf thinks too strong</li>
      <li>High quality, great price.</li>
      <li>If you are on your own you&#x27;ve got a cool 3 years of brushing here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>Handle is super ergonomic and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
      <li>Love the feeling of really clean teeth.</li>
      <li>The on/off is easy to find and use without having to look at it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the feeling of really clean teeth.</li>
      <li>So far so good with our daughters enjoying the use and the effectiveness of the brush.</li>
      <li>The brush heads are strong, but not painful,(so</li>
      <li>They worked fine and were easy to grip and use.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and is perfect for my wife as she has lost strength in her hands due to a stroke.</li>
      <li>I reviewed these in the past but my review seems to have disappeared so I am adding another one to make sure people know what a great set it is!  </li>
      <li>Plus this set came with two toothbrushes, plus an extra set of brush heads, making it a great bargain.</li>
      <li>, I can buy the toothbrushes again without breaking the bank if there are no replacements available.  </li>
      <li>That may sound as if it should, “Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll” the teeth out of your mouth.</li>
      <li>Great price, fast delivery, and seems to be working very well.</li>
      <li>teeth feel really clean.</li>
      <li>The wave shaped bristles get in there and clean my teeth thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Our daughters were thrilled to open this package and go try them out - as a parent who can ask for more than not having to remind your kids to brush.  </li>
      <li>But the gentle, pleasant humming actually gives you cleaner teeth by eliminating more plaque and helping to loosen tartar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are very strong even safe for children to use which is a big plus.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, “Be True to Your School”.  </li>
      <li>What good is brushing your teeth if your tongue simply spreads it around again?</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I purchased this one at a promotional price that I finally found one I loved.</li>
      <li>The bristles are also nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best ever</li>
      <li>And my teeth feels fresh and super clean after using.</li>
      <li>Extra heads make this a really affordable and great deal.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I wanted and needed!  </li>
      <li>and I think I actually spend more time brushing my teeth when I use it!</li>
      <li>After using it for a few months, I still works great like the day I got it.</li>
      <li>The vibration is nice on the very tip of the bristles so brushing fairly light is the key.  </li>
      <li>These old teeth and gums are appreciative of the gentle vibration.</li>
      <li>If you replace your brush heads at the recommended 6 month rate, this is 18 months worth of use in one package for a couple or two kids-</li>
      <li>It vibrates so quickly and softly, I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was really getting my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>I can see a whiter and brighter smile as I continue to use it.</li>
      <li>gift the pink one to my good friend, “Barbara Ann”, for her opinion.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s really nice that it comes with extra pieces.  </li>
      <li>“Wouldn’t it Be Nice” to have a simple battery operated unit?</li>
      <li>It really is a gentle clean.</li>
      <li>both agree the clean feeling seems improved unlike the “Cotton Fields” of other popular manual Oral toothbrushes, like “Sloop John B”.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light yet powerful, your teeth definitely feel clean when done.</li>
      <li>The on and off button are located near where my thumb is placed, making them easy to access and use.</li>
      <li>This stimulus package also helps for healthy gums, but that is no excuse to forget flossing.  </li>
      <li>I have been using electric brushes for so many years that I could never go back to manual brushing, and I will continue to use my brush from this set while traveling.</li>
      <li>They were here on the exact day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These brushes are excellent. The brush heads are strong, but not painful,(so I would rate them a true medium) and the toothbrush delivers the same type of power I have experienced with expensive, rechargeable types. This is an excellent deal for the price and comes with a replacement head for each brush. I have been using electric brushes for so many years that I could never go back to manual brushing, and I will continue to use my brush from this set while traveling. I am excited to have a less bulky option to my plug-and-brush type. Excellent deal! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a battery powered electric toothbrush to replace my rechargeable Oral-B  electric toothbrush. We are moving and I won&#x27;t be able to plug the toothbrush into an outlet in the bathroom to keep it charged. What a disappointment! I was used to the rotating head on my rechargeable toothbrush that was so effective. This one jonly vibrated, and the vibration was so strong that it actually hurt my hand. I returned  it immediately and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used a variety of electric toothbrushes over the yrs. &amp; this on is the best of all.  Love the feel of using it and the cleanliness that follows.</li>
    <li> Amazing toothbrush!!!! It came with two, so my husband and I both got one. We appsolutly love them. They were here on the exact day the estimated shipment day said it would be, which is always a plus. Anyways I use this toothbrush everyday &amp; definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s light yet powerful, your teeth definitely feel clean when done. And it&#x27;s really nice that it comes with extra pieces.  I love that I get a pink one &amp; my husband gets a blue one :)</li>
    <li> Do yourself and your teeth a favor and get these toothbrushes.  Seriously the best ever and I have worked in dental offices for years.  They fit comfortably in your mouth and get your teeth and gums clean which is the best feeling!!</li>
    <li> Came in the time indicated and I think I actually spend more time brushing my teeth when I use it! It&#x27;s much better than the electric toothbrush I had because I can put this one in the drawer when not in use, so it doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space and it gives the same amount of motion.</li>
    <li> Nice little toothbrush.  Very powerful, cleans well and is not too big.  My dentist recommended an small toothbrush so I can clean each tooth individually as, it is recommended. This does the Job perfectly (could be a bit smaller if I take the full dentist recommendation, but for me its perfect).&lt;br /&gt;It brings replacements head, so it should last at least as long as I have replacements heads, I don&#x27;t mind if I can find or not more replacements, because of the price, I can buy the toothbrushes again without breaking the bank if there are no replacements available.  I would definitely recommend this brushes.</li>
    <li> My first career of 18 years was in the dental field working in both the front and back office with the dentist. Sonic care toothbrushes have always been &amp;#34;the gold standard&amp;#34; when we&#x27;d recommend what kind of toothbrush to buy, however, we were also very aware that they were so expensive that most people could not afford them. When I saw this product and the price point, I had to admit I was skeptical of how good it might be. I had to use it several times before I could even rate it for a review. First off, let me tell you - it feels different than any other toothbrush. I&#x27;m used to the battery operated spin brushes, but this one was lighter and quieter than those. It vibrates so quickly and softly, I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was really getting my teeth clean. But... it really has been doing a great job. I can see a whiter and brighter smile as I continue to use it. It really is a gentle clean. I love that it comes 2 brushes to a pack with 2 replacement heads for each brush. It&#x27;s like getting 6 toothbrushes for a fraction of what it would cost for one high priced sonic tooth brush. It was a nice find in my opinion.</li>
    <li> my kid has always liked watching me use my electric toothbrush so I got this to entice him to brush his teeth a little more. It seems to be working so far, he loves using this brush during bed time rituals</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I wanted and needed!  It is now very simple to do a daily routine task.  Wish I had purchased it sooner!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great and a great buy! I did snag a discount for them. They are very strong even safe for children to use which is a big plus. Love the feeling of really clean teeth. It&#x27;s nice to have a his and hers, def recommend.</li>
    <li> Love them!! Works just as well as my Sonicare, great for kids, will need to buy more replacement brushes. Just hope those aren&#x27;t priced as ridiculously as Sonicare ones!</li>
    <li> I reviewed these in the past but my review seems to have disappeared so I am adding another one to make sure people know what a great set it is!  I was in the market for new toothbrushes as I was kind of tired of the same old same old.  I was offered an opportunity of a discount in exchange for an honest review for these and thought it was great timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love that the kit has two brushes and two refills for each brush.  If you replace your brush heads at the recommended 6 month rate, this is 18 months worth of use in one package for a couple or two kids- or you could mark some of the heads and use the same brushes for several people!  If you are on your own you&#x27;ve got a cool 3 years of brushing here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next on to the grip of the brush- the handle is lightweight but substantial enough that you won&#x27;t feel like you are going to break it.  The barrel is slightly bigger and rounded and fits really well into your palm.  The on/off is easy to find and use without having to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head has a nice shape, texture and firmness.  The back of the head has a textured tongue pad to get rid of morning yuck.  The brush works differently than other battery operated brushes in that the entire thing vibrates vs. only the bristles moving.  This gives it a little shake to jiggle the bristles into those little hiding places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it gives my teeth a great clean and the value and convenience of the package set is great!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I used the toothbrushes while on vacation. Just as efficient as our corded brush at home and travels so much easier</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. Got them to replace my worn out Sonicare.  They work just as well.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to try a battery operated toothbrush. High quality, great price.</li>
    <li> This battery operated portable toothbrush is great for traveling. My dentist recommended that I stop using a manual toothbrush because of the damage I was doing to my gums. He told me that electric toothbrushes work much better at cleaning my gums and teeth. I started using an electric toothbrush at home, but I travel frequently and sometimes for long periods of time and I would always go back to a manual toothbrush during these times. This toothbrush is very easy and convenient to travel with. I don&#x27;t have to worry about a base and a plug since it&#x27;s battery operated. There are 2 toothbrushes in this set which is perfect for me and my husband. Each toothbrush requires an AAA battery and they are even included in the package. Also in the package, are 2 extra brush heads for each toothbrush. The wave shaped bristles get in there and clean my teeth thoroughly. The bristles are soft and that is good for me because I tend to press down on the brush while I am using it. The handle is comfortable to hold while using the toothbrush and has a rubber grip to keep it from slipping out of my hand. The on and off button are located near where my thumb is placed, making them easy to access and use. I received these toothbrushes at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> My son loves the Electric Toothbrush Portable, received this as a promotional offer.  I did not review it myself because I only have ever used a manual tooth brush ,but my son love the electric tooth brushes.  He has been using this toothbrush for a while now and is very happy with it!  I know I got him another brand a few months ago and he did not like it because if he put pressure on it, the rotation would stop, not this one!  Again, he has been using it for a little while now and it seems to do a good job and the batteries are still working well!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery, and seems to be working very well. These old teeth and gums are appreciative of the gentle vibration.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate for a honest review. This is a great tooth brush set for the price. It doesn&#x27;t need a charging station to take up space and energy on the counter and you can change out the battery if it starts to get low. It comes with 2 tooth brushes with 4 replacement heads which is a awesome bonus. It&#x27;s very gentle to use on my gums doesn&#x27;t vibrate too hard like some do its just right. And my teeth feels fresh and super clean after using. Great product would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Beach Boys fans rejoice, as now you can experience &amp;#34;Good Vibrations&amp;#34; and excitations all in the name of oral health care.  Much like the lyrics of said song, the excitations go on and on thanks to this toothbrush by TempIr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable models have issues such as finding a spot to keep it plugged in your bathroom, flimsy charging units and non-replaceable rechargeable batteries which lose their potency over time.  “Wouldn’t it Be Nice” to have a simple battery operated unit? Simply twist off the bottom of the toothbrush and replace the provided single AAA Alkaline battery to use it “All Summer Long”.  To replace the head simply tug and pull, then push on a fresh head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit to being a fan of TempIR products, but that in no way taints this review like plaque on teeth.  This ‘His and Hers’ set comes with a total of 6 bristle heads (3 each) which should last you a total of 9 months each if you follow the rule of changing your toothbrush every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to review two electric tooth brushes on my own so I said “Help Me, Ronda” and had the &amp;#34;Little Saint Nick&amp;#34; gift the pink one to my good friend, “Barbara Ann”, for her opinion. She has reservations about not being able to control the output speed. So I told her “Don’t Worry Baby”, you “Mike Love” it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agree the clean feeling seems improved unlike the “Cotton Fields” of other popular manual Oral toothbrushes, like “Sloop John B”.  The vibration is nice on the very tip of the bristles so brushing fairly light is the key.  So why buy an electric toothbrush?  Well, this particular model vibrates at a reported 30,000 brush strokes a minute.  That may sound as if it should, “Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll” the teeth out of your mouth. (OOPS, wrong boy band.) But the gentle, pleasant humming actually gives you cleaner teeth by eliminating more plaque and helping to loosen tartar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaner on the back of the brush heads is actually an important part of oral care. What good is brushing your teeth if your tongue simply spreads it around again? This stimulus package also helps for healthy gums, but that is no excuse to forget flossing.  Total oral care is important, or risk losing teeth like the Beach Boys loses Brian Wilson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minor cons being the brush is too wide to fit in most toothbrush holders in your bathroom.  Nor will it fit in some commercial toothbrush holders. Neither does it stand on its own.  Nor do I see a way to purchase more heads.  Are they even interchangeable with other models?  But having such a powerful toothbrush on the go is a definite plus.  I find the tongue cleaner to be of limited use but my co-reviewer thinks it is cool.  The brushing heads are on the small side, but effective enough. Overall I tend to brush a little longer for the sheer enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point isn’t bad in this twofer, but some may consider it a bit costly.  So is having your dentist fix your oral neglect.  But that price point comes with TempIr’s great customer service and product replacement guarantee.  Can the TempIr toothbrush really give you cleaner teeth and a healthier mouth which might improve your overall health? “God Only Knows.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep perspective.  In the end you get a comfortable and effective toothbrush which is still made of common plastic, rubber and nylon brushes.  The difference is in the science behind getting your mouth it’s cleanest.  The TempIr toothbrush should help your “Fun, Fun, Fun” in asking “California Girls” “Do You Wanna Dance” way down in “Kokomo”.  Your “Smiley Smile” will never be the same as you brag to your friends, “I Get Around”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the old school references. “I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times”.  If you have a different taste in music “That’s Why God Made the Radio”.  Otherwise, “Be True to Your School”.  If you have any questions, I’ll be “In My Room”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please hold up a lighter for the Beach Boys by clicking “yes” on this review.  {:-Dve any questions, I’ll be “In My Room”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please hold up a lighter for the Beach Boys by clicking “yes” on this review.  {:-D</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!  It is light weight and is perfect for my wife as she has lost strength in her hands due to a stroke. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased my fair share of pulsating toothbrushes. It wasn&#x27;t until I purchased this one at a promotional price that I finally found one I loved. Here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel really clean. I am able to brush up close to my gums without them hurting. It vibrates but not so much that my mouth hurts after brushing. Plus this set came with two toothbrushes, plus an extra set of brush heads, making it a great bargain. The bristles are also nice and soft. After using it for a few months, I still works great like the day I got it.</li>
    <li> great product. Is just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great and a great buy! I did snag a discount for them. They are very strong, by bf thinks too strong but I like it! Love the feeling of really clean teeth. It&#x27;s nice to have a his and hers, def recommend.</li>
    <li> We bought these for a upcoming vacation, but I did try them once.  They worked fine and were easy to grip and use.</li>
    <li> Received these toothbrushes a few days ago and can honestly say there is not one issue I have with them. Though, the packaging does need improvement (the replacement heads flew out as I tried to open the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Massage Mode&amp;#34; does a great job as it isn&#x27;t unpleasant to use (doesn&#x27;t rattle your head).&lt;br /&gt;Portable size and lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable bristles&lt;br /&gt;Tongue cleaner is a definite plus and does a decent job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Packaging ... please put the replacement heads in a little bag to protect them from outside germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend? Definitely.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Our daughters were thrilled to open this package and go try them out - as a parent who can ask for more than not having to remind your kids to brush.  This came with two additional exchangeable brush heads.  So far so good with our daughters enjoying the use and the effectiveness of the brush.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that these were more sonic than battery , but I as mistaken . They do have some juice and help get stuff between your teeth, but they are overpriced and not what they appear to be.</li>
    <li> What a great pair of toothbrushes. Handle is super ergonomic and fits nicely in my hand. The brush head isn&#x27;t HUGE which I hate as that type just doesn&#x27;t get to the back well enough. The vibration isn&#x27;t too forceful but much more massaging and soothing. Stimulates the gums and does a great job of getting my teeth clean. Hubby is a super picky toothbrush person and he loved his as well. Cannot attest to battery life other than we have used ours 2 times a day for awhile now and are still going strong. Extra heads make this a really affordable and great deal.</li>
