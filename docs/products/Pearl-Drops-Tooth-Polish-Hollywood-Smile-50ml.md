### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I had been out with some friends and we were talking about some of the GREAT products that once graced the store shelves of grocery stores, hardware stores and drug stores.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this works exceptionally well.</li>
      <li>I love Pearl Drops tooth polish!</li>
      <li>I Love Pearl Drops!</li>
      <li>This method has given me the best results so far.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand.</li>
      <li>Worth it!!</li>
      <li>I had mentioned about how Pearl Drops Tooth Polish had always been my favorite and was no longer available.</li>
      <li>Safe to use, and very worth it</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get that super scrubbed feeling to your teeth, which is what I liked with the original.  </li>
      <li>REALLY WORKS WELL, LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Wish that it was still available in drug stores here in US.</li>
      <li>He loved the old Halo Shampoo and claimed he could still buy it.</li>
      <li>works awesome and love how it turns ur teeth back to the white side and quick!</li>
      <li>I have tried several on here and all were good.</li>
      <li>I love this product - it makes my teeth squeaky clean like no other.</li>
      <li>And I think this (Pearl Drops Hollywood Smile)</li>
      <li>The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my teeth would get white eventually, but this product isn&#x27;t like the original Pearl Drops.</li>
      <li>I know that when I order this product, it will always be exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice teeth any whiter using for 2 weeks, so went back to my Anise flavored toothpaste without Fluoride that I like-a better taste.</li>
      <li>there is a stronger whitening version by Pearl Drops, I&#x27;d certainly like to try it.</li>
      <li>I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha.</li>
      <li>I should have taken before and after photos to say how much.  </li>
      <li>Not the same formula as the original Pearl Drops.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>If you want WHITE (I managed a dental office for years), then Crest White Strips or visiting your local dental office for a tube of bleaching gel (about $25) will give you much better results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this is no longer available in US, but I am very grateful that Amazon has sellers to provide Pearl Drops.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is hard to find but I have been using it for over thirty years and hate the taste of most toothpastes - this one is good!!</li>
      <li>Offered for sale via Amazon, as well as a half dozen other on-line retailers; Pearl Drops now come in about six or eight different varieties and I am happy to say that I now possess ten bottles or tubes of Pearl Drop products.</li>
      <li>A friend of mind in the group indicated that old products can still be obtained via on-line</li>
      <li>I went to the dentist to talk about professional whitening, but he said there was nothing he could do for me because my shade was off the charts on the white scale.  </li>
      <li>Crest Vivid White Toothpaste will give you the same results.</li>
      <li>Pearl Drops I believe were first introduced to the American market sometime in the mid sixties and remained as such until a few years ago; when they were discontinued for the American market.</li>

<li> I was extremely disappointed as I had used Pearl Drops continuously for more than forty years.</li>
<li> Besides this point, this stuff is like any other whitening toothpaste.</li>
<li> whitener version has made a slight difference.</li>
<li> I had previously been a level B, and now I&#x27;m whiter than an A.</li>
<li> Or use a little baking soda and some lemon juice (to be used less often as it removes enamel from the teeth).</li>
<li> Subjectively, I&#x27;d say the product works, but I&#x27;m not sure how the abrasiveness would impact your teeth long-term.</li>
<li> This vendor is robbing anyone who buys this blind with the cost of this stuff plus shipping which seems to change daily.</li>
<li> So I just use a small amount for the taste.</li>
<li> I was disappointed thought that it contained fluoride, which is a known toxic carcinogen.</li>

    <li> I love this product - it makes my teeth squeaky clean like no other.</li>
    <li> Not the same formula as the original Pearl Drops.  You don&#x27;t get that super scrubbed feeling to your teeth, which is what I liked with the original.  You knew your teeth were clean with the original,,this stuff,, they just feel like you used weak crest toothpaste</li>
    <li> Have used pearl drops for a while. I know that when I order this product, it will always be exactly as advertised. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Truly whitens and does not have any abrasive materials or ingredients. Safe to use, and very worth it</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard to find but I have been using it for over thirty years and hate the taste of most toothpastes - this one is good!!</li>
    <li> I saw results in 2 days of using 2x a day.  I was disappointed thought that it contained fluoride, which is a known toxic carcinogen.</li>
    <li> Pearl Drops I believe were first introduced to the American market sometime in the mid sixties and remained as such until a few years ago; when they were discontinued for the American market. I was extremely disappointed as I had used Pearl Drops continuously for more than forty years. I had been out with some friends and we were talking about some of the GREAT products that once graced the store shelves of grocery stores, hardware stores and drug stores. I had mentioned about how Pearl Drops Tooth Polish had always been my favorite and was no longer available. A friend of mind in the group indicated that old products can still be obtained via on-line and I would have to go into my preferred search engine and try to find it. He loved the old Halo Shampoo and claimed he could still buy it. I did as he suggested and found that the company that once made Pearl Drops Tooth Polish for the American Market (Church &amp; Dwight) continues to produce Pearl Drops for the European Market from a plant in England. Offered for sale via Amazon, as well as a half dozen other on-line retailers; Pearl Drops now come in about six or eight different varieties and I am happy to say that I now possess ten bottles or tubes of Pearl Drop products. Thank You Amazon and Thank You Church &amp; Dwight!!!</li>
    <li> For that added touch after brushing this is just the ticket👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I never received The Pearl Drops tooth Polish.  They sent me Pearl Drops ultimate whitening instead and I don&#x27;t want it I want just the tooth polish.  The box in the picture is what I want.  Thank you Judy Grisham</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is no longer available in US, but I am very grateful that Amazon has sellers to provide Pearl Drops.  It&#x27;s is my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; toothpaste.  Buy two though bcz it takes a while for it to receive it and you don&#x27;t want to run out before the reorder arrives.</li>
    <li> does polish the teeth and make them glow</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand. And I think this (Pearl Drops Hollywood Smile) whitener version has made a slight difference. I didn&#x27;t use the little comparison strips, so I can only go by the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a stronger whitening version by Pearl Drops, I&#x27;d certainly like to try it.</li>
    <li> For the difference in price from the regular tooth polish I did not see a big difference. I purchased 2 and I don&#x27;t think I will re order this specific one again,</li>
    <li> This vendor is robbing anyone who buys this blind with the cost of this stuff plus shipping which seems to change daily. It ranges from &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; to $10.80 like I paid (a total of $22.29 for a 50 ml bottle). Besides this point, this stuff is like any other whitening toothpaste. Works for some..not for others. It is not a miracle whitening paste. Crest Vivid White Toothpaste will give you the same results. If you want WHITE (I managed a dental office for years), then Crest White Strips or visiting your local dental office for a tube of bleaching gel (about $25) will give you much better results and you won&#x27;t have to brush twice a day for 6 months to see a change in the color of your teeth. Or use a little baking soda and some lemon juice (to be used less often as it removes enamel from the teeth). This method has given me the best results so far.</li>
    <li> I love Pearl Drops tooth polish!</li>
    <li> Some brightening.  I should have taken before and after photos to say how much.  Subjectively, I&#x27;d say the product works, but I&#x27;m not sure how the abrasiveness would impact your teeth long-term.</li>
    <li> Cant beat this toothpaste just wish it was easier to find on the store shelves</li>
    <li> I do not whiten my teeth with strips or bleach or anything else.  I use toothpaste and this product only. I went to the dentist to talk about professional whitening, but he said there was nothing he could do for me because my shade was off the charts on the white scale.  I had previously been a level B, and now I&#x27;m whiter than an A. I&#x27;d say this works exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> REALLY WORKS WELL, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it is going to do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure my teeth would get white eventually, but this product isn&#x27;t like the original Pearl Drops. I didn&#x27;t notice teeth any whiter using for 2 weeks, so went back to my Anise flavored toothpaste without Fluoride that I like-a better taste.</li>
    <li> I Love Pearl Drops! Been using the product for over 10 years! NEVER have problems with tarter build up or yellowing, stained teeth! Wish that it was still available in drug stores here in US. Since it isn&#x27;t, I will continue to pay extra for it and get it online here!! Worth it!!</li>
    <li> works awesome and love how it turns ur teeth back to the white side and quick! definately works for in between dentists visits</li>
    <li> What can I say? I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha. I have tried several on here and all were good. Since it is no longer in stores these tubes can be more expensive then regular toothpaste. But for me it takes forever to go through an entire tube. As my dentist once told me you don&#x27;t need to use a lot or any actually. So I just use a small amount for the taste. The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily. Good luck.</li>
