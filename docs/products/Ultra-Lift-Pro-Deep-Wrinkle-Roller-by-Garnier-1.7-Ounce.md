      <li>I am hoping that it will work more the more I use it.  </li>

      <li>So I gave up and use L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products that work way better.</li>

      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>of bought more for this</li>
      <li>When I looked for it in the stores it seems to be no longer available so get it here while you can!  </li>
      <li>Love the roller application.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Both of these get rid of the top layer of skin forcing your body to reproduce collagen</li>
      <li>I said sure, I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be 100% sure this product has been helpful</li>
      <li>Knowing how products often become discontinued, I went online and ordered three more bottles to keep in stock.  </li>
      <li>I dont use it all the time but start using it again if I start noticing line getting more noticable.</li>
      <li>It was more than the product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and the manner in which it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
      <li>I love it and suggest you get it.</li>
      <li>I wash my face, then roll this on before applying makeup, and it always makes my skin feel and look better - tighter and healthier.</li>
      <li>Seems to be okay.  </li>
      <li>I just returned for a few more bottles, because it&#x27;s the best serum I have used, for a great economical price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken pretty good care of my face, but neglected the neck area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with a good result for a right price.</li>
      <li>It really hadn&#x27;t impressed me much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m NOT the best test-subject; I&#x27;m slack in my application sometimes, and don&#x27;t really check my skin&#x27;s before-and-after that closely, but I feel that if it&#x27;s going to live up to the hype, I shouldn&#x27;t have to look at my skin w/ a magnifying glass!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use--it goes on before the day or night cream.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s been fine on my combination skin (oily in t-zone).</li>
      <li>it takes tons of money to get rid of fine wrinkles....</li>
      <li>This is an okay product, I&#x27;m not passionate about it, but it&#x27;s a good value as it lasts quite awhile.</li>
      <li>not wrinkle free yet ...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use daily, but when I do, it works great.  </li>
      <li>I use a good natural moisturizer as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it very much.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give Garnier products a try and was excited that I saw this item for sale at 70% off list price.</li>
      <li>I use it once or twice a day on a clean face and neck before my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Garnier Ultra-Life day and night cream for several years and I&#x27;ve had good results with those products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it does any good on deep wrinkles, not for me anyway.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face too, and since I use other anti-aging products on my face already did not see as great an improvement as on my décolletage, but did see some.  </li>
      <li>Im 28 years old now and really looking for a product that i just love for my under eye fine lines.</li>
      <li>Used this daily and it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to work kind of, but I personally think it should have been cheaper than it was.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about this product is it was a very nice serum that absorbed quickly in the skin and the new roller ball delivery system</li>
      <li>I love this product--it&#x27;s easy to use--just roll it on in an upward motion and let it dry.  </li>
      <li>right...</li>
      <li>The price is right, it lasts quite a while and is applied twice a day.  </li>
      <li>particularly that I had in mind when I bought it, no change, but it is fast and easy to apply and moisturizes</li>
      <li>Maybe I expect too much too quick.  ?</li>
      <li>I have fine lines around my eyes, and have since I was about 12 years old.</li>
      <li>I notice a difference if i use it consistently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miraculous face lift, but it is most definitely a noticeable improvement.</li>
      <li>You must use it twice a day but you will notice a difference after consistent use.</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t say if this product really works or not!</li>
      <li>Not,in the deep lines around my mouth but surely on my cheeks and neck</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and I&#x27;m so glad I have found this again, it works even on deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my face, but on a whim decided to use it on my neck and décolletage where I have some deep lines (I am 56, as it is now tank top season</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy this as long as they make it, or until someone shows me something that works better for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Now in my 60&#x27;s its easy to see the need to have included the neck in a daily regimen.</li>
      <li>Thanks.....</li>
      <li>This is obviously Garnier trying to get rid of expired product at a cheap price.</li>
      <li>and i have to say I really like how its in a convenient roller.</li>
      <li>My lines did not get any better and my eyes water profusely when using this product any where near my eye area, and my eyes burned and turned red.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and lasts a long time too.</li>
      <li>I started using the Garnier roller on a daily basis and in no time I noticed a significant improvement in the tautness of my neck skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it and use it to condition my skin before applying other moisturizers and makeup.</li>
      <li>I have seen mild results, i would definately recommend this product to anyone who is just starting to see fine lines, but realize it takes time to see the results and its not an instant fix.</li>
      <li>very easy to use, no sticky fingers, and I have been using Garnier for a few months and have seen a difference.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve used face creams consistently throughout my adult years, I had not been in the habit of using a neck cream.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait for my new order!</li>
      <li>I located it on Amazon, and stocked up on a few more.</li>
      <li>I love this product, and have had trouble finding it in stores.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the money to send back!!  </li>
      <li>The four bottles I purchased through Amazon could be outdated because it does not tingle or feel as good on my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my face, but on a whim decided to use it on my neck and décolletage where I have some deep lines (I am 56, as it is now tank top season and I was unhappy with how I looked.  After only a few night time applications, the lines softened greatly and are much less noticeable!  I use it on my face too, and since I use other anti-aging products on my face already did not see as great an improvement as on my décolletage, but did see some.  When I looked for it in the stores it seems to be no longer available so get it here while you can!  It goes on easy and lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> Another product I was looking forward to using. It does nothing, changes nothing. I have been using it faithfully since I received it but what ever ingredient they put into it to lift deep wrinkles must be so small that it just doesn&#x27;t show any change. I do not have a lot of wrinkles so I am not looking for miricles. No difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and have had trouble finding it in stores.  The price was almost too good, and then came the postage.  It was more than the product.  Just seems like not great merchandising to me.  Still like the product though.  My face seems a lot tighter.</li>
    <li> My fav moisturizer. Amazon is the only place I can still buy it. Love the roller application.</li>
    <li> This item is a roll-on facial roller that targets wrinkles and smoothes skin.  It is easy to apply and feels good on the skin....and it works!!  It&#x27;s a great product, easy to apply and helps enhance the look of your skin.  The price is right, it lasts quite a while and is applied twice a day.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of it for it to work.  I&#x27;m pleased with it and use it to condition my skin before applying other moisturizers and makeup. Another great product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  Thanks.....</li>
    <li> I needed something for under my eyes and forehead wrinkles. I dont see any of a difference using this. So I gave up and use L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products that work way better.</li>
    <li> Purchase this product 4/5 times a year.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give Garnier products a try and was excited that I saw this item for sale at 70% off list price. That should have been a red flag. I get the item and see that there is a coupon attached that expires in September 2010. So I go to a site to enter in the batch code to find out when this item was manufactured and when it expired [...]. This was manufactured in September 2008 and has a shelf life of 36 months. So, it expired last year. This is obviously Garnier trying to get rid of expired product at a cheap price. I&#x27;m returning it for a refund and not even going to try it.</li>
    <li> This product is okay I used to use it often but I have to admit after this one ran out I never purchased it again. It seemed to work kind of, but I personally think it should have been cheaper than it was.</li>
    <li> not exactly what i expected. have used it twice daily as prescribed but see no results.  this is my second bottle.  still like garnier&#x27;s products tho</li>
    <li> REALLY larger bottle than I expected, so not a bad deal, but the SHIPPING&#x27;S OUTRAGEOUS!!  No real change in skin texture, wrinkles that I could see.  I&#x27;m NOT the best test-subject; I&#x27;m slack in my application sometimes, and don&#x27;t really check my skin&#x27;s before-and-after that closely, but I feel that if it&#x27;s going to live up to the hype, I shouldn&#x27;t have to look at my skin w/ a magnifying glass!  I think I used this diligently 2ce a day for 2 weeks or so.  About that time I got some home acid peels to try out &amp; I felt I need to use bio-oil, vaseline, etc. for a stronger moisturizing effect after the peels, so I abandoned this.  It really hadn&#x27;t impressed me much.  I do like the convenience of the roll-on &amp; not having to get my hands gooey w/ lotion but that&#x27;s the best thing about it at this point.  I keep it in my nightstand as a last-minute moisturizer when I&#x27;ve forgotten to use my other stuff.  Maybe I expect too much too quick.  ?</li>
    <li> The roller action is very good for smoothing. Keep chilled if you like for better effect. I keep it at the bedside so that it is easier to use while watching TV.</li>
    <li> Service was excellent in this product.  I purchased this product initially a couple of years ago and though I do not expect it to get rid of wrinkles I love the feel of this product on my face.  The four bottles I purchased through Amazon could be outdated because it does not tingle or feel as good on my face.  I think they have quit making this product and that is why I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> yes love it !! not wrinkle free yet ...but working on it&lt;br /&gt;sure of bought more for this price.next hope to find good deal</li>
    <li> Several weeks ago, I purchased two bottles of this product.  Based on a previous review, I decided to check the batch code of each of them. This is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these products (Product Code:  FF024) has been out-of-date since January 24, 2012!! I have just finished using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one (Product Code:  FE274) has been out-of-date since&lt;br /&gt;September 30, 2011!! I probably won&#x27;t be using this one at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money to send back!!  Surprises me that AMAZON allows their Merchant Sellers to sell out-of-date products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I happened to try this product by accident when one of my client&#x27;s was cleaning out her bathroom closet.  She had purchased it but wasn&#x27;t using it, so she asked if I wanted it.  I said sure, I&#x27;d try it.  Interestingly enough, only weeks before I had noticed how my neck was starting to show signs of my age (57).  Although I&#x27;ve used face creams consistently throughout my adult years, I had not been in the habit of using a neck cream.  I started using the Garnier roller on a daily basis and in no time I noticed a significant improvement in the tautness of my neck skin.  Knowing how products often become discontinued, I went online and ordered three more bottles to keep in stock.  I love this product--it&#x27;s easy to use--just roll it on in an upward motion and let it dry.  My neck skin feels softer and is thanking me for finally including it in my facial moisturizing routine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use daily, but when I do, it works great.  I assume it does.  No one ever says I look old and beat up.</li>
    <li> I started using this product several months ago and find that it does \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your wrinkles up and out. I love it and suggest you get it.</li>
    <li> I use it several times daily under my 73 year old eyes and I have no lines!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a base proior to moisturiser. My face loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it lifts, but I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be okay.  It usually works quite well and I have yet to see since I am not sure how accurate the expiration date was due to the tattored packaging and exposure to heat during delivery.</li>
    <li> Once again, didnt notice any major shift or anything...it didnt last as long as the green ones I bought either...I would buy the eye roller over this one next time</li>
    <li> very easy to use, no sticky fingers, and I have been using Garnier for a few months and have seen a difference.  Not,in the deep lines around my mouth but surely on my cheeks and neck</li>
    <li> It works - that&#x27;s all that needs to be said!</li>
    <li> I  purchased this thinking it could be used...but after I recieved this and looking at the box of the item which looked old &amp; crushed (not from shipping) I took notice that this item is EXPIRED!...People please read all reviews before making purchase, something I didn&#x27;t do! Seller shouldn&#x27;t be selling this!!! So I can&#x27;t say if this product really works or not!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Garnier...I definitely saw results in one week.  I make sure I never run out of this one!</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, I&#x27;m not passionate about it, but it&#x27;s a good value as it lasts quite awhile. I use it sporadically, and still using the first one I purchased, and I&#x27;ll probably get another when it&#x27;s finally empty when I find it priced right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it does any good on deep wrinkles, not for me anyway. I&#x27;ve got 3 or 4 particularly that I had in mind when I bought it, no change, but it is fast and easy to apply and moisturizes okay.</li>
    <li> Dont know, but the wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I notice a difference if i use it consistently. It it had to find a product that actually works with deep lines and is not harsh.  I use a good natural moisturizer as well. I tend to use is more at night it is very slightly oily but I can use it in the a.m as well if i use less and rub it in.  I dont use it all the time but start using it again if I start noticing line getting more noticable.</li>
    <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have wrinkles, this product is great for applying and massaging these great ingredients into the skin. Smells great too!!! Thank you again Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with a good result for a right price. I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it very much.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones. Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I tried it several years ago and after buying it a couple of times, couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores (but I live in a small rural community, and can&#x27;t find a lot of things). I located it on Amazon, and stocked up on a few more. I just returned for a few more bottles, because it&#x27;s the best serum I have used, for a great economical price. I&#x27;ve paid 5-7 times more for Avon and other brands, and this works equally well, if not better. I wash my face, then roll this on before applying makeup, and it always makes my skin feel and look better - tighter and healthier. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miraculous face lift, but it is most definitely a noticeable improvement. I&#x27;ll buy this as long as they make it, or until someone shows me something that works better for a reasonable price. I&#x27;m happy to be able to order it here.</li>
    <li> I will buy Ultra-Lift Deep Wrinkle Roller by Garnier again.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so good, Makes wonders for my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine lines around my eyes, and have since I was about 12 years old. Nothing I have tried as gotten rid of them-but my mom purchased this product and raved about it. I was curious about it because it does have retinol in it-a know anti acne and anti-wrinkle fighter. My lines did not get any better and my eyes water profusely when using this product any where near my eye area, and my eyes burned and turned red. Additionally I broke out slightly on my forehead after using product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only known wrinkle fighter in this formula as far as I can tell is the retinol-but I cannot figure out the concentration in the serum. The only positive thing I can say about this product is it was a very nice serum that absorbed quickly in the skin and the new roller ball delivery system seemed to stimulate circulation in my face slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews seemed to be pretty mixed about this stuff, but I was able to purchase this at the super store for about $16-not a terrible loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, acne prone, semi-sensitive, slightly pigmented, few lines</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!! Can&#x27;t wait for my new order!</li>
    <li> Product has greatly improved my lines on my face.  It the best I have used.  I have used lots of products.</li>
    <li> this is great to use either at night or in the morning. it works great if you use it at night with a gel to keep the moisture in.</li>
    <li> so so, no special feeling</li>
    <li> it takes tons of money to get rid of fine wrinkles.... so why dont give it a try for 5$? but i did nothing un two weeks of faithful everyday use , and the SMELL is terrible like a MEN&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
    <li> I use it once or twice a day on a clean face and neck before my moisturizer. Noticably tighter skin!</li>
    <li> Second time buying this also. There is a reason I&#x27;ve bought it twice and it&#x27;s because I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> It Is a little early to see any real difference in wrinkles, however my face feels better than it has in a long time.  If nothing else comes of it I will still use the produce just for that reason.  Maybe I waited too long to start treating the problem.  I would suggest starting Garnier at an early age.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and I&#x27;m so glad I have found this again, it works even on deep wrinkles. You must use it twice a day but you will notice a difference after consistent use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be 100% sure this product has been helpful but I think it has. I&#x27;ve used the Garnier Ultra-Life day and night cream for several years and I&#x27;ve had good results with those products.  When I heard about this product I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s easy to use--it goes on before the day or night cream.  I&#x27;ve taken pretty good care of my face, but neglected the neck area. Now in my 60&#x27;s its easy to see the need to have included the neck in a daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the manner in which it&#x27;s applied.  I&#x27;m sorry that it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
    <li> Used this daily and it goes on nicely.  It does not leave anything on your skin, not greasy feeling.  I reordered.  I am hoping that it will work more the more I use it.  It helped my wrinkles a little.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. People have guessed my age the highest so far 32, but I am 44. I&#x27;m good with that.</li>
    <li> I tried it and my skin started to breakout a bitt...but I am sensitive anyway. It does smell really nice.</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter but not dried out after using this product every morning which is why I use it before applying my make up. I want a firmer feeling face at my age (46). I love that I am putting a vitamin enriched product on my face. This can be tingly or even burn a little if you&#x27;ve just used a scrub so keep that in mind. Some people with sensitive skin feel this product is too harsh but it&#x27;s been fine on my combination skin (oily in t-zone). If you have sensitive areas on your face skip over them or use the product every other day in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a doctor tested and recommended product to help with wrinkles a prescription strength Retin A/Tretinoin cream is the best or micro-dermabrasion treatments. Both of these get rid of the top layer of skin forcing your body to reproduce collagen enriched skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve begun having some acne breakouts (whiteheads &amp; trapped pores that cause cystic acne) so I stumbled across a 2% salicylic acid product (Clearasil Ultra Pore Cleansing Pads) that treats &amp; prevents acne and ended up being amazed at how much this reduced my very deep forehead wrinkles, crows feet and the old acne scars on my chin!!! I am thrilled (: The pads are rough and I&#x27;m not too gentle when rubbing over my forehead wrinkles and my chin where the acne occurs &amp; the scars are located. I get a little dermabrasion in these two areas every night after using a mild cleanser. I am very careful &amp; gentle around my eyes and on my cheeks where I&#x27;m a little more sensitive. I dab on some 100% Aloe Vera Gel afterwards especially if my face feels irritated.</li>
    <li> This roller feels great going on, relaxing and cooling, plus it smells great! As for wrinkles? Didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Im 28 years old now and really looking for a product that i just love for my under eye fine lines. Ive been using this product for a while now and i have to say I really like how its in a convenient roller. I also like the size of the product you get , since i only paid four something for it! I have seen mild results, i would definately recommend this product to anyone who is just starting to see fine lines, but realize it takes time to see the results and its not an instant fix.</li>
