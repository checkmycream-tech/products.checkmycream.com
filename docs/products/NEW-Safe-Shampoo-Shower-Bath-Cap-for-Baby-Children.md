<li> I don&#x27;t think it will last long.</li>
<li> I have had it laying flat for 2 weeks</li>
<li> I used this on my 9 month old, no matter how tight i made the cap water still leaked over her face.  </li>
<li> I ordered pink and got yellow for starters.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still too big &amp; that&#x27;s saying a lot because my lo&#x27;s head is above average!</li>
<li> It was very strange because it took over 2 weeks to ship (I think it came from Hong Kong).  </li>
<li> This product was a great idea but is terrible quality.  </li>
<li> The cap did arrive before the expected dated.</li>
<li> Also ordered the pink color but received</li>
<li> I expected pink as in the photo because other colors were advertised separately.  </li>
<li> It came folded in eighths in a small bubble envelope and is yellow.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t stay closed!  </li>
<li> fits only small kids under 30 pounds</li>
<li> Really can&#x27;t complain for the price, but when its crammed into a tiny package making horrible creases in it its kind of useless.</li>
<li> it is too hard n trying to send it back n</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> I was getting a little anxious because it took so long to arrive.  </li>
<li> Plus it had black grease marks.</li>
<li> Also way too big for a baby&#x27;s tiny head and too difficult to get on.</li>
<li> However with was mailed folded so when used some water does escape through the creases and down my little ones face.</li>
<li> So Inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t get tight on my baby girls head.</li>
<li> great for kids who hate getting water on their face or are afraid of the shower or bathtub.</li>
<li> Please do not buy, it&#x27;s a waste of money .&lt;br</li>
<li> and It was folded up so small it had creases all over.</li>
<li> When it arrived (after taking a month to ship), it was all folded up and shoved into a small package as another reviewer also said.  </li>
<li> Horrible material haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet...</li>
<li> I am not sure</li>
<li> I bought this a little while back for my daughter to try and help out the crazy bath time.</li>
<li> really sucks, has no support at all.</li>
<li> My daughter rips it off her head but slowly she is getting used to it.  </li>
<li> It  was not a wise purchase...</li>
<li> The material is too thin to hold the water weight, and not enough flexible to be tighten up to your baby&#x27;s head without being annoying.</li>
<li> I can wash her hair without any disturbing to her play time.</li>
<li> This is very thin and flimsy.</li>
<li> Very poor quality item!</li>
<li> She hated getting her hair washed because she couldn&#x27;t stand the water getting in her eyes.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> OMG THIS SAVE MY LIFE FOR MY BABY GIRL. no water on her face / ears. Love it...</li>
    <li> I bought this a little while back for my daughter to try and help out the crazy bath time. There&#x27;s reviews saying its &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34;, it was like 2 bucks, what do you expect? And although its flimsy it still stays out of her eyes. 5 stars from me and I&#x27;d recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> Please do not buy, it&#x27;s a waste of money .&lt;br /&gt;It really sucks, has no support at all. I used it on my 3 month old , when I would bathe her it would come off, with the weight of the water. It is sooo flimsy, honestly it&#x27;s like a price of foam/ a paper plate.</li>
    <li> NEW Safe Shampoo Shower Bath Cap for Baby Children,it&#x60;s acceptable product especially four kids who fear from water bath to entering their eyes and ear like my daughter.</li>
    <li> Kind of small...my one year old wears it on the last snap, but she laughs when it&#x27;s on and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her bc it&#x27;s really light!</li>
    <li> I ordered pink and got yellow for starters. When it came it was all rolled up and misshaped. Just didn&#x27;t like the overall product.</li>
    <li> The water would still run in my baby&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> great for my grandgrils</li>
    <li> I love this.. helps to wash little ones hair.</li>
    <li> this item might not be of best quality but i love it!!!! my 8 month daughter loves it too..  she enjoys her showers and baths.&lt;br /&gt;it is so cute and effective. it is amazing how simple inventions make your life easier.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap. I don&#x27;t think it will last long. It&#x27;s so flimsy and feels like it is going to tear any second.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this for my granddaughter.  She hated getting her hair washed because she couldn&#x27;t stand the water getting in her eyes.  When I showed her this, she was one happy little girl.  I was getting a little anxious because it took so long to arrive.  I got it Monday and it made my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a child who hates to get her hair washed, purchasing this will be a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> Both my baby and I love the shampoo bath cap.I don&#x27;t have to worry about water getting in their ears or soap getting in their eyes! One of the smartest things invented!</li>
    <li> This product was a great idea but is terrible quality.  It&#x27;s basically a piece of styrofoam.  When it arrived (after taking a month to ship), it was all folded up and shoved into a small package as another reviewer also said.  Also ordered the pink color but received yellow- but not worth trying to get the right color!  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> just received it today .. didn&#x27;t try it yet but it seems like a good product to have&lt;br /&gt;and like the material it&#x27;s soft and safe for children ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not even worth to pay $1.00 for this product. You could do it yourself with a better quality using a school-grade foam sheet. The material is too thin to hold the water weight, and not enough flexible to be tighten up to your baby&#x27;s head without being annoying. I know I paid just $ 1.60, but in this case you don&#x27;t even get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great for +6 months or older that can crawl in the bath tub. I can wash her hair without any disturbing to her play time.</li>
    <li> This works great - if you can get your toddler to wear the thing. Mine completely flipped out. Also, wish we could have specified color &amp; size. However, reading the directions was hysterical; something got lost in translation.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it properly, but had fun taking a couple pics with it on our LO. She takes it off very easily since she&#x27;s a toddler now. Probably would work better if she was younger. It an inexpensive item for a laugh with a couple of memorable pics for us.</li>
    <li> I expected pink as in the photo because other colors were advertised separately.  It arrived at  the outside limit of the delivery date.  As a matter of fact, I received things I ordered much later before I received this.  It came folded in eighths in a small bubble envelope and is yellow.  I have had it laying flat for 2 weeks and it still has not recovered from the folding.  The best thing about this item was the envelope was post marked China.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t complain for the price, but when its crammed into a tiny package making horrible creases in it its kind of useless. Oh well, it was more of a gag gift anyways...</li>
    <li> This is very thin and flimsy. The packaging was terrible! It arrived in a plastic envelope that was about 2x3in and the cap was folded up and squeezed inside. When I opened it it was creased and bent which makes the water go into the child&#x27;s eyes?! Great concept but the proper packaging would have made all the difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter no longer fears for her life when I wash her hair.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift.  I hope it helps them.</li>
    <li> This is is a flimsy/stinky piece of foam/plastic that&#x27;s worth what you pay.  It also took about 2 weeks for me to get it delivered.</li>
    <li> works well for shampooing hair.  needed time to get use to it.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality item! Won&#x27;t be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Bath cap is perfect for babies that can sit up in the bathtub.  It keeps the shampoo from running into the eyes when rinsing the hair.  Whoever invented this did a great job.  It works!</li>
    <li> I used this on my 9 month old, no matter how tight i made the cap water still leaked over her face.  My baby&#x27;s&#x27; head seems pretty symmetrical, I gave these away...save your money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still too big &amp; that&#x27;s saying a lot because my lo&#x27;s head is above average! It also smelled awful!</li>
    <li> Super cheap flimsy product. Saw cuter ones at Babies R us recently.</li>
    <li> It took forever to get to me, like almost a month.  My 10 month old niece will not keep it on her head for nothing,  my 2 month old niece I am not sure but her mother took it and thanked me. Although they were only 2 something  a piece It  was not a wise purchase...</li>
    <li> The cap did arrive before the expected dated. However with was mailed folded so when used some water does escape through the creases and down my little ones face. You get what you pay for and not anything more.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Not too excited about it anymore.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that i like the product but until today i have not yet received</li>
    <li> it is too hard n trying to send it back n nobody from your company answer me back with the right answer</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Just a piece of foam/plastic that had been folded into quarters so it was permanently creased.  Smelled aweful.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay closed!  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The material is cheap, the buttons barely click and it was folded in delivery and now wont become a circle again, works alright though.</li>
    <li> Got this 2 months after I purchased it. Cheaply made in Hong kong. Used once and I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Too big for my baby so far. But she Should grow into it. Great idea though for a cry less bath.</li>
    <li> So Inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t get tight on my baby girls head. Just wonderful!</li>
    <li> My daughter rips it off her head but slowly she is getting used to it.  It was very strange because it took over 2 weeks to ship (I think it came from Hong Kong).  But overall it is helpful.</li>
    <li> i love that thing.it s easy to use and very comfortabe.baby loves to take shower with that shower hat. eyes are always preserved from water.</li>
    <li> My daughter always cry when we wash her head. So, i decided to order this shower cap. When i received it i thought wow it looks cheap, but what the hell, it cost me only a few dollars. At first my 10 month daughter did not like it and always  tried to get it off, but after a few days she start liking it and now washing her head is no problem at all. She laughs all the time during the bath time and not afraid anymore to wash her head,.In my case it works really well.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and It was folded up so small it had creases all over. Plus it had black grease marks. This was supposed to be for my new baby niece. It was all foam and not even worth it. Horrible quality. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Its ok but not what I expected. for the price is what you get.</li>
    <li> The item arrived app. 1 month after I ordered it. In addition, even on the largest setting it won&#x27;t fit my two year old. It&#x27;s a floppy piece and wonder if it would work even if it fit properly.</li>
    <li> Horrible material haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work.. Can&#x27;t ask for much since it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
    <li> This is a soft foam when I thought it would be a plastic. But it still does what I purchased it to do. It great at keeping the water and soap out of my babies eyes :-)</li>
    <li> great for kids who hate getting water on their face or are afraid of the shower or bathtub. fits only small kids under 30 pounds</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrived on time</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Is basically a styrofoam plate with a hole and some buttons. Also way too big for a baby&#x27;s tiny head and too difficult to get on. I tried to return in and the seller refused, not a big deal, but they promised to refund me a portion of the cost and did not.</li>
