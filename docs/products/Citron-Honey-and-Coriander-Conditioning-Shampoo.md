      <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a premium one that really justifies the HUGE price difference.  </li>

      <li>I have pretty much decided to just buy the 3 dollar shampoo at the grocery store from now on.</li>
      <li>But my hair is 1/8&amp;#34; long so this lasts me 3 months :-)</li>
      <li>but I really like it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the cheap fragrance when I opened what this company has put on the market with the same name.  </li>
      <li>I hope someone with normal hair comments on this product.</li>

<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>

<li> Bonuses - it is made without sulfates, parabens and other bad stuff that strips your hair.</li>
<li> Expensive.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> It was terrible</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s shampoo.  It smells okay.  It&#x27;s nothing special.  I have pretty much decided to just buy the 3 dollar shampoo at the grocery store from now on. I&#x27;ve yet to find a premium one that really justifies the HUGE price difference.  This one I bought because I happened upon another one of C&amp;E&#x27;s products in a hotel and really liked it. That product was not available on Amazon, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try... and like I said, it&#x27;s shampoo, it will clean your hair, but it&#x27;s truly nothing special.</li>
    <li> The Crabtree and Evelyn Citron, Honey, and Coriander shampoo was a trial size shampoo for me at a hotel last year. I think it was at a Doubletree. I used it once and I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great shampoo. The citron, honey, and coriander has a nice, pleasant aroma, and it really lathers well. I love it and alternate between this one, the Crabtree and Evelyn Avocado, Olive and Basil shampoo, and their Tarocco Orange, Eucalyptus, and Sage shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but worth it. However, I do try to look for better deals on price.</li>
    <li> I stay in Hilton Hotels quite a bit and saved up a lot of the free shampoo.... and as I ran out I realized I&#x27;d really like some more the same stuff. This bottle is premium quality Champagne priced accordingly but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I should have read this ad closer, the bottle is TINY for the price.  I do like the shampoo, however.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love citron and coriander together. Hair feels and smells clean and fresh and easy to rinse out.</li>
    <li> The company that took over Crabtree &amp; Evelyn about four years ago is selling this shampoo with the same name as what is found in Doubletree hotels.  It does not have the same ingredients or fragrance.  I bought it because I had used the hotel shampoo.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the cheap fragrance when I opened what this company has put on the market with the same name.  I will no longer buy any product from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for its fabulous volumnizing of my hair.  The smell is fantastic.  The trouble I have with Amazon is the price.  They want $25.00 a bottle here.  On the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn website they want $12.60 for the same size.</li>
    <li> I am very please with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles, because I had a sample bottle, and fell in love with the smell of this amazing aroma. But, was quite displeased with the reaction my hair had to it. Now, I have dyed hair, so maybe this shampoo is meant for people with normal un-dyed hair, but this product dried my hair out, so, I do not know if it was the product or because I was using this on dyed hair. I hope someone with normal hair comments on this product. But it smells great!!</li>
    <li> It is just what I ordered and it works just fine. i would order more if i run out soon</li>
    <li> I first came across this while staying at the Hilton DoubleTree hotel in Chicago, Illinois. It has a clean, fresh scent and cleans my hair beautifully. Bonuses - it is made without sulfates, parabens and other bad stuff that strips your hair.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his shampoo!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. this product was one of the samples in a Double Tree Hotel in LA.LOVED IT!  But when I used the product I ordered.....nothing like the sample.  It was terrible (I wouldnt even give it one star)!    BUT the retail service was prompt.</li>
    <li> Way overpriced and not the same stuff we got from several hotel stays.  Although the bottle reads the same, its not as soapy and doesnt smell the same.  I wont repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I have a problem with itchy scalp. This product is sulfate free. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it has taken care of  that problem. Nice shine also.</li>
    <li> I swim daily and need a shampoo that not only cleans but keeps the chlorine smell away.  I really love this one!</li>
    <li> Good stuff &amp; got here quickly</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and conditioner at a resort, and loved it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  It smells great, volumizes my hair, and it just takes a bit to wash my hair.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> not the same as in the Double Tree Hotels</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not even feel like the samples in the Doubletree rooms .  It seemed to dry the hair out immediately upon use.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Expensive. But my hair is 1/8&amp;#34; long so this lasts me 3 months :-)</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but not as good as the shampoo and conditioner by themselves. The combination product is just ok.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that is provided at the Hilton Hotels.  I really liked the clarifying shampoo that I used while staying at a Hilton Hotel, and thought this would be close.  I have tried sticking with it, but it truly leaves my hair feeling like it is not clean.  Bummed.</li>
