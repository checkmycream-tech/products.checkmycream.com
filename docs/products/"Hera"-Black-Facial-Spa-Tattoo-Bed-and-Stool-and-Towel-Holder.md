      <li>Since I have good common sense it took me less than an hour to put the table together, but I had to reposition a couple of rods a few times.    </li>

<li> The other thing is a couple of the rods have holes drilled in them near the edge of the rod, but on one of them the hole is drilled so close that there isn&#x27;t much metal left, making it weak.  </li>
<li> The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of instructions.</li>
<li> Due to the low cost, I was a bit concerned with the quality of this chair and stool....</li>
<li> down side is that the chair does not fold up for storage if space is a big issue....</li>
<li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t break and the chair back doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
<li> No written explanation, just black and white pictures.  </li>
<li> A lot smaller then the typical facial bed but can hold heavy set clients.</li>
<li> Only issue was a part missing on the stool.</li>
<li> The box was ripped and taped up during transit and that handle was protruding slightly.</li>
<li> Previously  I was using a massage bed.</li>
<li> The plastic cover for the lift/lower handle was missing seems to be from the shipping.</li>
<li> If it weren&#x27;t for the 3 pics on this page I&#x27;m not sure it would have gotten together.</li>
<li> Totally the worst English translation ive ever saw.</li>

    <li> Some screws were mismatched but overall a great value.</li>
    <li> Due to the low cost, I was a bit concerned with the quality of this chair and stool....but they are great.&lt;br /&gt;My clients find the chair very comfortable and I love the stool which rolls easily and has a great hydrolic system.&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that the chair does not fold up for storage if space is a big issue....but I still recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and relaxing, it was very easy to assemble and serves its purpose. The stool doesn&#x27;t fair so well as the seat comes off constantly but it works.</li>
    <li> This chair cannot be beat for the money. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this big and sturdy. Assembly was a breeze.</li>
    <li> I really like this table and chair.  Very comfortable with thick padding.  I would have given five stars, but it doesn&#x27;t have a towel holder like it says.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it anyway, but the point is it should come with one since it&#x27;s advertised as such.  The only two real drawbacks were the directions and one of the metal rods.  The directions could be made a lot more clear, as I had to study them for quite some time to understand the pictures.  No written explanation, just black and white pictures.  Since I have good common sense it took me less than an hour to put the table together, but I had to reposition a couple of rods a few times.    The other thing is a couple of the rods have holes drilled in them near the edge of the rod, but on one of them the hole is drilled so close that there isn&#x27;t much metal left, making it weak.  Kind of like using a three-hole punch and punching too close to the edge of the paper. There isn&#x27;t any strength to the paper and it will rip out of a 3-ring binder.  Same thing here with the metal rod.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t break and the chair back doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
    <li> This chair is awesome, it was simple to set up. And everything was there. It came earlier than my shipping date. And it&#x27;s very sturdy. The stool is very easy to move around on and keeps me comfortable for hours. Perfect for the price</li>
    <li> A lot smaller then the typical facial bed but can hold heavy set clients. Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for such a multi functional bed/chair. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of instructions.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Sturdy and comfortable. Easy assembly. Only issue was a part missing on the stool. The plastic cover for the lift/lower handle was missing seems to be from the shipping. The box was ripped and taped up during transit and that handle was protruding slightly.</li>
    <li> I like this bed &amp; stool.  I love the price.  It&#x27;s very affordable and sturdy. I use it for waxing lash extension at my business. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy. I love the chair and stool. Only problem is the instructions weren&#x27;t detailed and we were missing a bolt.</li>
    <li> I use this chair in a salon to do facials, great for beginners. OK durability and def will get you started. Once my clientele picks up I will most likely get a hydraulic chair. But overall I am very very happy with this one. It can also handle all of my heave clients</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble.. but it would&#x27;ve helped if all the screws came with it. Luckily I was able to find some that fit so I&#x27;m able to use it</li>
    <li> This is an awesome value, relatively inexpensive but really nice quality!  I will definitely purchase another one sometime in the near future.!</li>
    <li> We recently bought it...easy to install and we love it. Its stable and made with good material. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> awseom product. I use it for lash extensions. Previously  I was using a massage bed. Clients noticed straight away, commenting on how comfortable the bed is. It takes all weights and widths of people. I&#x27;m soooo glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> love it even though I pretty much had to guess when putting together. English directions anyone?</li>
    <li> It came quickly. Its actually really nice. The only issue is the instructions are garbage. Totally the worst English translation ive ever saw. If it weren&#x27;t for the 3 pics on this page I&#x27;m not sure it would have gotten together. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re using this chair for body piercing in my store; everyone loves it!  The padding is much thicker than we expected and it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
    <li> Was pretty much happy with the chair. Only issue I had was the instructions were not very clear at all. I had to figure it out on my own</li>
    <li> great bed .. very sturdy even for people with little extra pounds would feel comfortable sleeping on it .. no complains so far ..</li>
