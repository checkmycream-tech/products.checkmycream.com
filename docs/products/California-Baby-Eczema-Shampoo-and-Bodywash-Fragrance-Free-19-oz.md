      <li>my hair super soft, so I didn&#x27;t mind paying the high price.</li>
      <li>This is intentional as most soaps are actually over-doing it, particularly if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>That being said, their products are still leaps and bounds ahead of most other companies.  </li>
      <li>I picked up two bottles of what I thought were the original California Baby shampoo and body wash from a local retailer.</li>
      <li>For over a year I tried everything (at least 20+ products - even one made by my derm), including cetaphil and cerave (which I still use for moisturizers) and nothing seemed to keep my skin happy for long.</li>
      <li>I normally use the California Babies Tea Tree Oil shampoo on my kids.</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t know how much this cleanser helps with the soothing, but it&#x27;s definitely gentle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use the soap in the morning and throughout the day my face feels soft and doesn&#x27;t itch or flake.</li>
      <li>My son is 8 and his eczema has really flared up in the last year.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my Grandson who is two years old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an adult with frequent eczema and this helps to keep it at bay.  </li>
      <li>purchased it for my 3 years old son.</li>
      <li>; version doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well at controlling itch as the old version did.  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with a big size bottle of shampoo and I&#x27;m out the money to buy more shampoo and the CB products are not cheap!</li>
      <li>My baby has occasional eczema flare ups mainly on her forearms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>do&#x27;s not make enough bobbles foam, leave hair dry , but once the hair is dry it feels normal clean.</li>
      <li>the commercial products in restrooms reek havoc on my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Hey...I have an idea...let&#x27;s create a $30 soap to treat eczema, the most common symptom of gluten intolerance, and then fill it with gluten, no one will mind!  </li>
      <li>Eczema isn&#x27;t a fun battle but for our little guy this product has been a hlep.</li>
      <li>I use this soap almost daily for bathing my 9 month old and have been using it for about 4 months.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this works for children with eczema, but as an adult this is literally the only soap I can use on my skin daily, regardless of season, without irritation.</li>
      <li>The price is kind of ridiculous, but it usually lasts me a couple of months.  </li>

<li> Recommend for any child with really dry skin.</li>
<li> Made my son&#x27;s skin very dry.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the smell, in the bottle in was kinda bad.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve been out camping for a few days, or work outside etc.</li>
<li> It was a rough week clearing up the rash.</li>
<li> Received as advertised and when expected.</li>
<li> This made my wet hair like a gob of wet cotton.</li>
<li> But reading the bottle made me curious, so I tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> She has eczema and other allergies</li>
<li> but I feel there are other products to that</li>
<li> Quality is nothing like other CB products.  </li>
<li> The few times I tried switching, my little boy broke back out.</li>
<li> Little one can not live without!</li>
<li> My husband and kids asked me not to buy it again, though, because they think it has an odd smell to it.</li>
<li> I do use some locally made tea tree oil soap (goat milk) for bad eczema flair ups in conjunction with Cerave cream (you need to constantly moisturize with eczema!), but even the tea tree (and really any other soap) can be irritating.</li>
<li> smells stale and old.</li>
<li> But what i received was nothing like the sample I had, this stuff actually made my skin worse, and gave me dandruff.</li>
<li> My son has pretty bad eczema in the winter and while this is what we use in conjunction with coconut oil and aquafor after bath.</li>
<li> i carry some in a small bottle in my purse during cold and flu season for frequent hand washing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d give it negative stars if it were an option...</li>
<li> It was not fun, and just looks a little awkward, carrying a bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Other than the weird smell, I would buy it again.</li>
<li> Poor little guy!</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes</li>
<li> When I realized I had bought the wrong thing I contemplated returning it, as our daughter doesn&#x27;t have any serious skin issues.</li>
<li> This stuff is so expensive and does nothing to relieve eczema.</li>
<li> In fact, it makes my sons eczema worse!</li>
<li> does nothing for my son&#x27;s eczema and I am just using it up because I hate to waste it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive, I will have to continue my search for another alternative for my infant.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m an adult with frequent eczema and this helps to keep it at bay.  My skin feels moisturized when I leave the shower, and it&#x27;s not a bad scent.  One bottle lasts me about a month when I use it as a body wash.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by Cal Baby but they&#x27;ve changed formulation on a lot of products and several of them contain preservatives that I&#x27;m not a fan of.  That being said, their products are still leaps and bounds ahead of most other companies.  I don&#x27;t see much difference between this soap and the unscented/gentle variety that they sell.  My son has pretty bad eczema in the winter and while this is what we use in conjunction with coconut oil and aquafor after bath.</li>
    <li> one of the most amazing shampoo for baby and toddler having and Eczema</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for a baby-I use it for myself :) It&#x27;s been great for my eczema and my back-where most of mine is-has really cleared up, and my skin is softer overall. -1 star for the fact it shouldn&#x27;t be used as shampoo if you&#x27;re an adult; I have curly hair and it made it super tangled.</li>
    <li> My son is 8 and his eczema has really flared up in the last year.  He can not have anything with scent or manmade perfumes.  California Baby is the best stuff!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that works incredibly well on my daughter&#x27;s heavy eczema.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to keep my child&#x27;s eczema in check.  It has a nice neutral smell.  Recommend for any child with really dry skin.</li>
    <li> Made my son&#x27;s skin very dry. He has very sensitive skin and this was recommended to me by a friend but just didnt work out.</li>
    <li> Way overrated. This stuff is so expensive and does nothing to relieve eczema. In fact, it makes my sons eczema worse! I also hate the smell. If you want a cure for your babies eczema, then try Aquaphor baby healing ointment and the Aquaphor gentle wash! that stuff works wonders and cleared up my sons issues in days!</li>
    <li> My grandson has an allergy and this bodywash is perfect for his skin.</li>
    <li> This product it does not burn her eyes, use it on my grandbaby whole whole body&#x27;s.  All in one.  It helps her skin a lot.  We also use the California Baby cream.</li>
    <li> I like the product. However, I do not like the price.  It&#x27;s too expensive, I will have to continue my search for another alternative for my infant.</li>
    <li> Significantly helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema! Gentle and effective. We have been using it for months and are very pleased.</li>
    <li> purchased it for my 3 years old son. do&#x27;s not make enough bobbles foam, leave hair dry , but once the hair is dry it feels normal clean. did not purchased it for the 2nd time, to costly and dosent smell good enough to enjoy.</li>

    <li> This &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well at controlling itch as the old version did.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my daughter&#x27;s eczema as under control.  It is ok, I can&#x27;t really justify the expense anymore since this new formula doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other eczema wash I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Helps with eczema instantly. Lathers well, ok smell. Helps with itching and irritations. Little one can not live without! Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Hey...I have an idea...let&#x27;s create a $30 soap to treat eczema, the most common symptom of gluten intolerance, and then fill it with gluten, no one will mind!  I&#x27;d give it negative stars if it were an option...</li>
    <li> I use this soap almost daily for bathing my 9 month old and have been using it for about 4 months. It has been a great help in dealing with his eczema. It is very mild. When his skin is flared up he typically is much improved after taking a bath using this soap. Eczema isn&#x27;t a fun battle but for our little guy this product has been a hlep.</li>
    <li> I love the California baby hair conditioner, but when I used this body wash, my daughter broke out in a rash all over. She has eczema and other allergies so I wanted to give this a try. It was a rough week clearing up the rash.</li>
    <li> I picked up two bottles of what I thought were the original California Baby shampoo and body wash from a local retailer. When I realized I had bought the wrong thing I contemplated returning it, as our daughter doesn&#x27;t have any serious skin issues. But reading the bottle made me curious, so I tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I moved to Southern California I have battled the dry, desert climate--frankly, I have not been winning. The skin on my face has gone from oily to flakey to itchy to everything in between. For a while I used softer soaps and a lotion from a company called Melaleuca. If they weren&#x27;t run like pyramid scheme it might soften my opinion, but so it goes. Nonetheless, the lotion worked, to a degree, as I would have to carry a bottle in the car in case I was outside all day. It was not fun, and just looks a little awkward, carrying a bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since the &amp;#34;great mistake&amp;#34; I have been using the eczema soap on my face and I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it feels. It actually makes my face feel like it did years ago, before the move west. I use the soap in the morning and throughout the day my face feels soft and doesn&#x27;t itch or flake. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, like lotion or oils do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap.</li>
    <li> i carry some in a small bottle in my purse during cold and flu season for frequent hand washing.  the commercial products in restrooms reek havoc on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> smells stale and old. does nothing for my son&#x27;s eczema and I am just using it up because I hate to waste it.  Quality is nothing like other CB products.  I would not ever buy this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this works for children with eczema, but as an adult this is literally the only soap I can use on my skin daily, regardless of season, without irritation. When I moved to Chicago about five years ago, my skin was constantly irritated with bouts of eczema in the winter. I had been living in much milder, temperate climates and my skin seemed to be having a constant melt-down. For over a year I tried everything (at least 20+ products - even one made by my derm), including cetaphil and cerave (which I still use for moisturizers) and nothing seemed to keep my skin happy for long. I stumbled on this at Target and noticed the colloidal oatmeal, which my doctors had told me was soothing (aveeno actually has some great products with this, but the soap was still a no-go for me). I gave it a try and am so relieved I did. This is the ONLY product that with continued use, keeps my skin calm and happy. I do use some locally made tea tree oil soap (goat milk) for bad eczema flair ups in conjunction with Cerave cream (you need to constantly moisturize with eczema!), but even the tea tree (and really any other soap) can be irritating. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have discovered this product.    Some caveats:  The price is kind of ridiculous, but it usually lasts me a couple of months.  This soap is gentle and therefore might not get you as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling as others. This is intentional as most soaps are actually over-doing it, particularly if you have sensitive skin. If you&#x27;ve been out camping for a few days, or work outside etc. I recommend using a loofah or some castile soap for those areas that you might feel need extra cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is all that we use! The few times I tried switching, my little boy broke back out. A must for eczema!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the smell, in the bottle in was kinda bad. However, once I used it I loved the way my baby smelled. My baby&#x27;s skin was so creamy soft afterwards, it really moisturizes well and leaves baby clean. I like this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gentle on my sensitive baby girls skin. Her eczema has chilled out quite a bit since using this soap.</li>
    <li> I normally use the California Babies Tea Tree Oil shampoo on my kids. It works wonderfully at keeping their eczema under wraps, even on their scalps. When I saw the eczema formula I thought- Great!! This will probably work even better and looks more gentle. Since making the switch, my son now has eczema all over his scalp and has scabs where he has been scratching. Poor little guy! Needless to say I had to go back out and buy more of the Tea Tree Oil shampoo. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a big size bottle of shampoo and I&#x27;m out the money to buy more shampoo and the CB products are not cheap!</li>
