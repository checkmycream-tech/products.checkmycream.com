      <li>The serum leaves your skin feeling smooth and, for lack of a better way to say it, firm-like.</li>
      <li>I think Shiseido could have good anti-aging products, but with so much perfume, I won&#x27;t find out.</li>

      <li>People started asking if i was pregnant because i had that unique glow in my face!&lt;br</li>
      <li>product arrived ahead of schedule, securely packaged  in a beautiful white box with a lovely lavender ribbon tied around the outside.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks so fantastic right now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old with fine lines, mostly around my mouth.</li>
      <li>This product really delivers!!</li>

      <li>5/16/13 - I still use this right before I apply makeup.  </li>
      <li>Normally the serum is creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes the skin very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>i have 31 and people always said that i looked older, sometimes 38!!</li>
      <li>Try a sample first (sephora) if you&#x27;re hesitant.</li>
      <li>First off, I came here from another beauty site where they wanted 80$ for this.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way to making my skin feel and look smooth, radiant, and happy.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not fond of getting my photo taken, but we have had the birth of a new grandchild which necessitates lots of picture taking.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>and wow!</li>
      <li>have only been using the Bio Performance Super Corrective Serum for approximately five weeks, so it works its magic in record time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody that wants a product for specific needs.</li>
      <li>It also has little scent and doesn&#x27;t break me out, but I need help with the fine lines, so will try something else next time.</li>
      <li>My skin hs always been extremely dry and Shiseido skincare creams keep me very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It really works for making your pores smaller and it makes my face looks glowing, younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>I ended up putting it on my decolletage where it&#x27;s really hard to tell if it&#x27;s working on fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Constantly breaking out as a teenager and now battling to diminish 25 yr old acne scars as well as continuing to fight off new blemishes daily.  </li>
      <li>I usually go with the lowest-priced drugstore or supermarket moisturizers but this is worth getting to use under makeup.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could afford to buy this regularly but unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little (a lot) too much for me.</li>

<li> The price is unbelievable low, doubt it if it is really Shiseido product.</li>
<li> Definitely a plus for dry skin.  </li>
<li> This is my third time purchasing this Shiseido Bio Performance serum (my previous two purchases were at local department stores).</li>

<li> This time, the serum consistency was different: pasty, grainy, and uneven.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  </li>
<li> She also gets some of their other products.</li>
<li> If you have the money to splurge, go for it, but know that other companies make serums that work just as well for a lot less.</li>
<li> The only negative aspect is that hefty price tag...</li>
<li> Like other reviewers said, it does peel off seriously and too dry for my dry skin!</li>
<li> No more Proactiv, no more sulphur agents or salycylic acids, no more organic mineral products that don&#x27;t do a thing they claim.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s been so dull and lifeless and nothing else seems to be waking it up.</li>
<li> i felt hopeless, i tough about botox etc.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I turned out to be allergic to almost all of them, this product included.  </li>
<li> This is just a very, very expensive moisturizing cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me preface this by explaining my skin problems.  Constantly breaking out as a teenager and now battling to diminish 25 yr old acne scars as well as continuing to fight off new blemishes daily.  Skin is combination but mostly dry and irritated.  Have tried everything on the shelves and through online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shiseido Bioperformance line has done away with any and all of my former acne formulated products.  No more Proactiv, no more sulphur agents or salycylic acids, no more organic mineral products that don&#x27;t do a thing they claim.  Shiseido Essence, Bioperformance eye contour cream and serum are all I use for well balanced, hydrated radiant skin.  Very impressed with their line so much so that I&#x27;m purchasing their refining primer with SPF 21.  Love them and finally love my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product to have. Its not cheap but its not too expensive considering that in retail store it cost a lot more. This bottle of cream is worth every penny. Will def order again once I will be done with it.</li>
    <li> Great product that appears to work fine. I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody that wants a product for specific needs. Works almost right away,none greasey,absords directly into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old with fine lines, mostly around my mouth. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now every night, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. It does seem to moisturize and my skin feels really nice right after using it. It also has little scent and doesn&#x27;t break me out, but I need help with the fine lines, so will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes the skin very soft and smooth. Very good for those with sensitive skin. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Best thing to soften acne scars.  I use it at night only, not morning and night.  I see it work instantly.  Glad Amazon is the cheapest place to get this product, $18 cheaper! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/16/13 - I still use this right before I apply makeup.  I currently use La Mer&#x27;s concentrate at night and in the morning to soften acne scars.  It has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells great and instantly brightens and smooths skin. The only negative aspect is that hefty price tag...ouch! If you have the money to splurge, go for it, but know that other companies make serums that work just as well for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I just used a sample of this that I got in the mail and wow! I love it! My skin looks so fantastic right now. It&#x27;s been so dull and lifeless and nothing else seems to be waking it up. I wish I could afford to buy this regularly but unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little (a lot) too much for me. I wish I could find a drugstore brand that worked this well!</li>
    <li> First off, I came here from another beauty site where they wanted 80$ for this. While I was considering paying that price, I came to amazon and found this for almost 30$ off! This makes my skin feel and look amazing, but it&#x27;s no miracle product. It helps mattify my face and lessens the appearance of my pores. I enjoyed this serum much more then others I have tried (looking at you vino serum by Caudaile!). Try a sample first (sephora) if you&#x27;re hesitant.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific cream that I use both under my moisturizer and also on its own.  A little goes a long way to making my skin feel and look smooth, radiant, and happy.  After 5 months I can say that I am hooked on this serum and the wonderful results I have achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I needed more, I did some pricing comparisons between Amazon and Macy&#x27;s.com to be sure that I was getting good value for my money.  We all know how fabulous Amazon is with fair pricing and outstanding customer service, but in this case I was dealing with another vendor named AZPerfume.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how fabulous this vendor is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived ahead of schedule, securely packaged  in a beautiful white box with a lovely lavender ribbon tied around the outside.  It was literally the icing on the cake.  If you have an opportunity to purchase anything from this Vendor, please do not hesitate. Not only will you save a ton of money, but you can&#x27;t beat the presentation.  This AZ Perfume really cares about the customer.</li>
    <li> Does not work for me. I always used Bio Performance cream and decided to try out this product. However it does not moisturize enough and then its peeling off effect I hate that.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers said, it does peel off seriously and too dry for my dry skin! I will never repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> Definitely a plus for dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years and love it.  It definitely adds that extra punch.</li>
    <li> Great product. People have commented on how great my skin looks</li>
    <li> The wife Loves this product. I guess word of mouth is the best advertising. She either read about it or heard it from someone, like  a friend. She tried it and has been buying it ever since. She also gets some of their other products. If it makes her happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and my skin feels great and looks nourished and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shiseido&#x27;s skincare for 35-40 years and my skin looks very healthy.....it does help somewhat with wrinkles but it is more about the radiance of the skin that is important and Shiseido&#x27;s entire skincare line is excellent.  My skin hs always been extremely dry and Shiseido skincare creams keep me very moisturized.  Good price for this item...</li>
    <li> This product really delivers!!</li>
    <li> This is my third time purchasing this Shiseido Bio Performance serum (my previous two purchases were at local department stores). This time, the serum consistency was different: pasty, grainy, and uneven. Normally the serum is creamy and smooth. I suspect it was an older bottle. Skin care products have a limited shelf life.</li>
    <li> Very good! Satisfy for the qualify and service</li>
    <li> i have 31 and people always said that i looked older, sometimes 38!! i felt hopeless, i tough about botox etc. but still i know i am young.&lt;br /&gt;so i started using clarins, i saw a lil bit of difference in the hydrate cream but i knew i needed something else. So after reading some reviews about shiseido products i gave it a try WOW! the eye cream make my eyes look smooth and more open. And this serum give to my face a beautiful spectacular glow i never had it in my life. People started asking if i was pregnant because i had that unique glow in my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin now looks so healthy, so pretty. Im mixing this with clarins daily cream and its working VERY WELL. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am 48 and I cont to shock people when I tell them my age, need I say more.  :-)</li>
    <li> I usually go with the lowest-priced drugstore or supermarket moisturizers but this is worth getting to use under makeup.  It goes on very smoothly, absorbs quickly and creates a nice base. It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  It makes the foundation look better.  BTW, I also recommend Shiseido foundation -- there, too, you have to use only a little and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 1/2 years now and I must say Im glad I tried it. It really works for making your pores smaller and it makes my face looks glowing, younger looking skin. I love this serum and will continue using it. I am happy that I can buy it here at Amazon.com much cheaper. I used to buy it at NEX no tax for 69.00 dlrs.</li>
    <li> I bought a number of Shiseido products and got a number of gifts with purchase.  Unfortunately, I turned out to be allergic to almost all of them, this product included.  I tried to use it and didn&#x27;t see much results.  I ended up putting it on my decolletage where it&#x27;s really hard to tell if it&#x27;s working on fine lines.  I think Shiseido could have good anti-aging products, but with so much perfume, I won&#x27;t find out.</li>
    <li> This is just a very, very expensive moisturizing cream. An inexpensive drugstore hand &amp; face cream would work just as well.</li>
    <li> very good and ship fast. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It must be doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; because I will be 50 in a couple months, and last week my driver&#x27;s license had to be checked for an airline flight and the gentleman who had to identify me couldn&#x27;t believe I am the age that I am. He used the words &amp;#34;you have good genes.&amp;#34; NEVER has my age been in doubt since my mid-twenties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the Bio Performance Super Corrective Serum for approximately five weeks, so it works its magic in record time. The serum leaves your skin feeling smooth and, for lack of a better way to say it, firm-like. I&#x27;m not fond of getting my photo taken, but we have had the birth of a new grandchild which necessitates lots of picture taking. It is in these photos that I actually do see a difference in my skin. It looks less saggy and has a new glow that has been missing for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a lady or a gent, you will love this product!</li>
    <li> The price is unbelievable low, doubt it if it is really Shiseido product.</li>
    <li> Well packaged. Creamy and smooth on face. Leaves my face hydrated and smooth! I love Shiseido products!!</li>
