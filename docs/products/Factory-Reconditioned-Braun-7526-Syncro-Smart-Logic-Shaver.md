<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To the seller:&lt;br /&gt;Can you amend  your product for Intenraitonal Shipping available .?&lt;br /&gt;Justin, London</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that certain blood born infections remain virulent despite heat and chemical attempts at disinfection, hospitals now use ALL disposable instruments. Scissors, staple removers, forceps, as well as syringes, scalpels, and sutures are SINGLE USE. Hepatitis C patients are universally counseled to keep razors inaccessable to children and guests. In my opinion, the resale of used razors should not be permitted, as the reuse of contaminated instruments is not permitted.</li>
    <li> Bought it on sale for 24.99 (reconditioned). Intended only for beard trimming but once I tried the full face shave I&#x27;m never coming back to a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I logged on to Hotmail.com one day and an annoying pop up ad appeared. Fortunately I took the time to read it! I have always had problems with sensitive skin in the past. I have tried just about every razor out there and nothing has helped much. I was a little skeptical that the Braun 7526 would be any better, but for the pice it was being offered at, I figured it was worth a try. I can&#x27;t beging to describe how happy I have been with it! For the first time in 19 years of shaving, I can get a close shave on my neck without getting even the first sign of irritation. It&#x27;s amazing! My only complaint is the same as most other customers giving reviews here. It is that the original description of the razor led us to believe that it came with the clean and charge base. It would have been nice to have. They&#x27;ve fixed the description since I purchased mine, so that people know they aren&#x27;t getting the clean and charge base, and they&#x27;ve increased the price.</li>
    <li> Shaver arrived w/some difficulty as Amazon will not ship kitchen wares to FPO/APO addresses, so buyer needs to find alternate shipper.  Recondition shaver is new or like new condition.  The switch locking devise dosen&#x27;t work on mine but item under warranty.  Clean shaver head before use as black grease from servicing will mark your face.  Nice smooth n&#x27; quiet shaver.  Does a great job of getting those hard to reach spots where the straight razor nicks &amp;amp; cuts.  Shaver not as easy to hold as others I&#x27;ve used but ok.  Most retailers sell the 7526 shaver in a kit, which includes the cleaning module/base, etc., as low as $126.  Unfortunately, the recondition model comes without so you pay for just the shaver...but at $49 &amp;amp; no shipping, this updated model was cheaper than my 1994 Braun shaver.  Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st Braun, and i must say its GREAT!&lt;BR&gt;Hope it holds up to a new one!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t not receive all the self cleaning parts nor did customer service want to help much over the phone. The text has been changed since and so I had to fight them on what it said when I ordered. If it hadn&#x27;t been for the other reviews I&#x27;d not have gotten my point across. Thanks guys! This is now the second problem I&#x27;ve had with Amazon. Are they not trying as hard? At least they gave me a 20% refund for all the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaver is great, works well, but now I have to find a cleaning base to complete it. Feels much better then my old Braun which lasted many years. It is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor about 2 weeks ago because of the great price and fairly good recommendations from other users. I also got tricked into thinking the charge base was included, due to the obvious mistake on the product page which has since been changed. The whole experience soured me a bit on Amazon&#x27;s customer service. As for the razor, I am very pleased with it overall. I have been using a Norelco 5000 series for a number of years and was never crazy about it. Too much irritation, especially on the neck. And the shave quality went down with the battery charge, with shave time increasing. Maybe that&#x27;s better with their newer razors due to better technology, I don&#x27;t know. The Braun gives a very close shave, and absolutely NO irritation at all. The neck is tougher to do, as it was with the Norelco, but I found that you have to turn the razor a bit as you are shaving as the neck hairs must grow at different angles. This gives me a close shave on the neck too. Battery life is great in my opinion, and the razor&#x27;s speed doesn&#x27;t seem to slow much as the battery discharges. Quick recharge too. Two disadvantages: the Norelco was easier for me to hold than the Braun, and the Braun does drop stubble while shaving. So shave before putting on the clean white dress shirt!! Since I very rarely use a blade to shave, I can&#x27;t offer an opinion on the closeness of shave vs a blade. I don&#x27;t think its a fair comparison anyway. Bottom line, the Braun is significantly better than my old Norleco, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Use extreme caution when ordering this item.  Some parts may be missing, and customer service will NOT refund you your whole purchase price even if it is there error.  They will blame the return on you and charge you a $10.00 restocking fee and $4.00 for shipping.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Received this unit 3 days ago and i&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  The unit i got look brand new with a factory service sticker on the handle.  This is a great bargain considering the price and the quality of the unit.  It works/performs well and does come with a 2 years warranty.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor in many ways.  It shaves very closely, almost enough so that I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Since my beard grows very quickly this has been a constant problem over the years.  Also, since my beard is very wiry, few shavers are good at grinding it off.  This one, however, does so beautifully, and it is very quiet.  &lt;br /&gt;The Syncro is not quite as fast in getting the whiskers off as an old Remington D307 my wife brought home to shave her legs with, and which I discovered shaved far, far more closely than the Norelco triple headers I&#x27;ve used for nearly 30 years.  The Syncro is far quieter than the buzzy, loud Remington, and eventually does a noticeably better job of getting all the whiskers.  &lt;br /&gt;Since I shave right after getting out of the shower in the morning I&#x27;ve never noticed whether the unit retains cut whiskers, and don&#x27;t care.  For the record, it doesn&#x27;t seem to suffer from drop out of cut whiskers.  And the units do look brand new - not a scratch on them, gleaming and perfect, at least the two I got.&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I went through two of these reconditioned units trying to find one which would recharge properly.  An old Remington cheapie I&#x27;ve used for a couple of years has recharged perfectly off the same bathroom socket I&#x27;m using, and continues to do so without trouble.  &lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some problem with the provided power cord which causes the recharging function to abort shortly after being plugged in, resulting in almost no recharging.  Perhaps when you get the full product with the provided cleaning unit and recharger the unit recharges more reliably, or at least is kept recharged enough so that this problem doesn&#x27;t show up.  &lt;br /&gt;I did get the recharging function to work by jiggling the power plug so that it was halfway out of the socket, but what kind of a fix is that?  and would it last in the long run?  I didn&#x27;t care to try and have given up on these reconditioned units.  Could problems of this sort be why these reconditioned units are so much in evidence both on Amazon and EBay?  &lt;br /&gt;Braun has discontinued the Syncro line worldwide, except for North America, in favor of a new line it calls the Activator line, its new 8500 series.  It has a new type of shaving screen and perhaps an improved recharging system.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great!  I previously owned a Braun 4000 series, and the first thing I noticed was how much faster the motor runs on this shaver.  It&#x27;s weight and profile fit my hand perfectly.  The shave is close and smooth, and I&#x27;m finished faster than with my previous shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although reconditioned, it looks just like a new unit, except for the sticker that identifies it as factory serviced.  It was completely clean and had no cosmetic flaws at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the unit is advertised as having the \\&quot;Smart Logic\\&quot; system for battery maintenance, the unit I received did not have this feature.  Completely discharging the unit every six months and recharging it will recondition the battery.  This is the same thing that the Smart Logic feature does automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works so well that I didn&#x27;t even consider returning it on this minor point, but buyers should be aware that they might not receive a model that includes the feature - I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today&#x27;s date (04/18/10) I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 6 years.  I&#x27;ve replaced the shaving cutters and screen a few times, and it still shaves great.  The battery shows no sign of fatigue, and continues to hold a charge for over a week.</li>
    <li> I use an electric shaver almost exclusively.  Although I have to admit that a razor gives a closer shave, nothing beats an electric for convenience. I bought this shaver last week to replace an old Panasonic.  The 7526 was delivered quickly, it was impecably clean and brand-new looking and it delivers! &lt;br /&gt;A great shave at a great price.  This is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> BRAUN SYNCHRO 7526&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never was a fan of the knife. Much to my father&#x27;s despair, because he was an artist both with the real one and the Gilette. My first electric shaver in Caracas was one of those Remington \\&quot;egg\\&quot; contraptions. Ouch! ... but I wouldn&#x27;t budge. Then we moved back from Venezuela to Germany and I discovered Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The Synchro 7526 is now my umpteenth Braun shaver. Starting with the legendary Sixtant in the sixties, over to the fancier Universal and in between a forerunner of the Synchro (with which I was not happy at all) this is about my tenth electric shaver from them. Frankly, I lost track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression:&lt;br /&gt;Being a refurbished model, I was a bit skeptical. At first, even before opening the package, I was surprised because it was so light. The unit arrived in an \\&quot;el Cheapo\\&quot; box, and after unpacking the few components I \\&quot;felt\\&quot; it.&lt;br /&gt;The actual design is not my taste. Gone are the days of clear, sleek and straight Braun lines - I&#x27;ve owned stereo hi-fi sets and speakers, coffee makers, toothbrushes, clocks, and lighters from them, and I still have a Braun wrist watch lying around somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Gone are as well the metal surroundings of my former Universal. It looks like that now everything has to be \\&quot;round\\&quot; with jazzy stripes and indents all over the place. Even where there is no need for them. This one feels like \\&quot;plastic fantastic\\&quot;. A definite minus point.&lt;br /&gt;The supplied \\&quot;storage bag\\&quot; is more than cheap. Compared with the hard-shell cases of my former Brauns, it&#x27;s a laugh. Another minus point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First shave:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent! A much higher motor speed, the tilting head, and the added \\&quot;longer hair trimmer\\&quot; in between the two round shaving blocks - I am not talking about the normal trimmer at position \\&quot;3\\&quot; of the switch - makes it a breeze to shave. And I mean, \\&quot;shave!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I grew expressly a two-day old stubble for my first test drive. No muss, no fuss, and didn&#x27;t have to switch the trimmer on for the first pass to cut down the stubble to an agreeable size for the blade. I had to do that with my former Brauns. Two plus points. ... and shaving is basically what this thing (and report) is all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling:&lt;br /&gt;The full charge was quick, less than an hour and a half, despite the instructions saying four hours minimum. The charging light went off and the speed is the same with the AC cord plugged in or not. Plus point here as well.&lt;br /&gt;The new plug sits much \\&quot;safer\\&quot; in the socket than in the former models, and its definite \\&quot;click\\&quot; helps making sure it is really seated well.&lt;br /&gt;The cord (made in China!) itself is bulky, with the transformer sitting in the plug, rather than in the shaver. A second look on the shaver, after discovering the Chinese plug, reconfirms that it is \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;. A huge relief.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus goes to the locking switch. It cannot turn itself on during travel. Former Brauns had all sort of tricks to circumvent that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Being a refurbished - and impeccably clean - model, with a full two-year warranty, the price is Ok for a shaver with German technology and a Chinese plug.&lt;br /&gt;Paying full price for a brand new model, even with the added (useless) charger / cleaner unit would have had me disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see how long this one lasts. But here, in the tropics - in the meanwhile I am living in Costa Rica - one tends to take things easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday (Oct. 12th, 2005) the foil suddenly had a hole! Out of the blue and nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;According to instructions one should change the foil-cutter unit every 18 months. This one didn&#x27;t last the 18 months, barely 12. On my former Braun shavers these units lasted 24+ months or more.&lt;br /&gt;Question: is the foil/cutter block a minor quality?&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I had ordered a spare foil-cutter unit so I could replace it inmediately. But, at 30+ bucks a pop this is too much in too short a time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to downgrade the shaverto a two-star rating due to the short life of the main components and the high cost of replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM # 2:&lt;br /&gt;Once more the foil failed within considerably less than the 18-month life-span advertised (see above). Just after X-Mas the foil presented a hole which became bigger and bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Do we Braun Series 7000 users get bonus miles on the block and foil price? I&#x27;ll have to ask customer service directly.&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year (2007)!the foil failed within considerably less than the 18-month life-span advertised (see above). Just after X-Mas the foil presented a hole which became bigger and bigger.  Do we Braun Series 7000 users get bonus miles on the block and foil price?

    <li> This is my second Braun shaver.  The first gave out a couple years ago after many years of use.  I then decided to try a Norelco, which was a huge mistake.  The shave was time consuming and inefficient.  I then went to using a blade and put up with the razor burns and cuts every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this shaver advertised at a great price on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal.  First off, don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;Factory Reconditioned\\&quot; part put you off.  The only way I could tell that it was reconditioned was the sticker.  After just a few days of shaving (evidently your beard needs time to adjust) I was getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Finally no more cuts or razor burn.  Although it would be nice to have the cleaner stand that comes with the retail model, the cleaning and charging are all easy.  I&#x27;m very glad that I came back to Braun.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun.  I enjoy the cleaning system BUT this is my second Braun electric razor in 26 months that has DIED?    The shave is as good as the foil Panasonic but my Panasonic after 6 years is still working.    There is DEFINITELY a problem with this model.  1 year use and throw it away!  It resembles the realiability length of time as 20 BIC RAZORS.  I love electric razors but for $140.00 they should last longer than 1 year.</li>
    <li> The shaver performs very well and provides a close shave. Our unit developed a non-functioning switch about three months after purchase. However we returned the unit to Braun and it was promptly replaced with what appears to be a new unit and returned to us. Again the returned shaver works well and we are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The discounted price is right too.  If you are in the market for an electric shaver, get this one!</li>
    <li> I too was somewhat skeptical with the low price and it being factory reconditioned.  This is one great shaver and would not hesitate to buy another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I replaced an older top-of-the line Norelco and the Braun is far superior. The Braun is very quite and powerful and I get an extremely close shave and is very easy to clean.  My son has a Remington foil shaver and tried the Braun, he couldn&#x27;t beleive how close the shave was and how fast he was able to shave. Guess what he is getting as a birthday present.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am extremely happy with this purchase and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I am 34 and have been using Braun shavers for my entire life.  I have always been pleased with their products except for this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t pick up the hairs on your face unless you go back and forth 10-15 times.  Everything else is fine on the shaver.  It just doesn&#x27;t work unless you continually go back and forth over the area.  I am very disappointed with Braun.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this razor if you want something that lasts longer than 6 months. I was delighted with this razor when I first got it. It shaves cleanly and smoothly, much better than the Remington it replaced. But soon after I got it, the light that indicates it is fully charged stopped working. No big deal; I charge it for several hours when it needs it and that seemed to do the trick. However, now the power cuts off to razor whenever you add any pressure to the front (the side where the power slide-button is located.) This also happens to be where you hold the razor when you shave. This means that shaving has now become impossible without contorting my hand into a ridiculous, uncomfortable position which reduces shave quality and increases shave time, basically rendering this thing useless. Save your money for something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace my Braun 6512 purchased 4 years ago. The old shaver still works great, but the foil is shot. The price to replace the foil is about half the cost of this one, so I bought it. I am very happy with how it shaves. It does make a bit more mess as it doesn&#x27;t contain all the hairs in it&#x27;s head, but no big deal, I shave over the sink and rinse away the trimmings. It shaves nice and close and leaves me with less skin irritaion than my old one did when it was new. I highly recommend the Braun 7526.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon well over a year ago and have no complaints (yet). The unit looked new and works better than my old Braun (went bust after 15 years). I still only have to charge it about once every month and have not yet noticed any decline in the battery life. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 7526 Syncro shaver,it arrived quickly.But the shave that I get from it is as close as most blade razors.I&#x27;ve used Braun for long time,the7526 Syscro is the best I&#x27;ve had,of the three I own(other 2 still work).I&#x27;m glad I got it at amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Thils is my first electric shaver and I was very concerned about opinions and other reviews I have read regarding electric razors, so I bought this with those considerations in mind.  The razor arrived in first rate shape and looked absolutely like new.  This has been a very pleasing experience as I have had no razor burns or irritations a first-time user may incure.  I would agree with most of the reviews of the Braun 7526, very close shave(some neck stubles are difficult to remove), fast enough( about 2-3minutes to shave), and no irritations(I do use after shave lotion), but the deal was the price on Amazon.  If you want to up grade from an older razor or if you are a first-time user like me, the Braun 7526 reconditioned razor is a \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a 7256 I received Christmas 2004 that had a mechanical failure (the power switch locked in position 3 after I had trimmed my sideburns one morning - couldn&#x27;t get it to retract).  I am hoping that the failure is not a common occurence w/ this model - I have owned 2 earlier model Brauns and had no mechanical problems w/ either. I really like this shaver - it works much better than the earlier models and the cleaning/charging station is a nice feature (although you won&#x27;t receive it as part of the refurbished package).  I managed to live w/o a cleaning/charging station for almost 20 years however and if my wife had been able to purchase this model w/o it I wouldn&#x27;t have felt cheated in any way.  I would recommend this razor to any one.  You do have to let your face/beard adjust to it but once your face  has adjusted you will be rewarded w/ close shaves.</li>
    <li> It was as good as new even though it was claimed to be refurbished. It is clearly the best in class.</li>
    <li> For $49 you can&#x27;t beat this deal. If, like me, you sign up for the Amazon CC and get another $30 off with your first purchase making this thing $19 delivered - it is flat-out insane!</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 Braun and 1 norelco.  This is by far the best.  Cuts clean on my medium growth.  I have owned it for about 6 months and it is as good as the day I opened it.  What a deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy of my Braun rechargable shaver.It working about 5 days from one charge of 30 min. Also, it workig quietly  vithout vibration and shaving good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Braun which I bought on Amazon for over a year now.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  Any spot that was difficult to shave is still difficult relative to the rest of my face, but much less difficult than with previous razors.  I find it very easy on my face.  Cleaning is a breeze if you follow the instructions and partially open the screen and run it for a few seconds.  Why anyone would spend money on the cradle and cleaners is beyond me.  The battery still lasts me at least two weeks between recharging as indicated by the flashing red light.  The beard trimmer works great.  It would probably cut grass if you wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would never consider spending the small fortune a new system with the cleaning cradle costs these days.  This does everything I could ask of it at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I used to work for BrAun back in the 80&#x27;s. So I have been using BrAun shavers since 1985, and here we are 25 years later and BrAun is still the best electric shaver in my opinion. Keep you screen and blades clean for the best shave, and keep a fresh charge for the least painful shave. My facial hair is medium/heavy; this razor does a great job when I need a quick Sunday morning shave.</li>
    <li> This unit shaves closer that any Electric Razor that I have ever used.    Can&#x27;t beat the price. The fact that it was refurbished makes it even less expensive and one cannot tell that it is refurbished!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Synchro shaver for over a year now and have been very pleased. I&#x27;m convinced it will be hard for any electric (screen or rotary) to totally match a blade, however the Braun is certainly close. I&#x27;m still curious how much the \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; helps direct hair into the screen openings, but, hey, it feels great once you get used to it...anything to help wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is particularly handy and is easily activated with the thumb. I was surprised that a shaver this expensive didn&#x27;t have multiple comfort settings, however in retrospect, I&#x27;ve never really needed them. Never had a problem with razor burn, even pressing rather firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t purchased the auto-cleaner unit, which might be handy. Cleaning the unit manually is pretty straightforward although to do it properly takes a few minutes. It is much easier than cleaning any of the rotaries (i.e. Norelco) with less chance pf dropping small parts.&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re used to an electric shaver already, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the unit.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving with it for a couple of weeks and love the close shave. This is the best Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve owned (have been shaving with them for over 10 years).</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;RECONDITIONED shaver does NOT come with Clean &amp;amp; Charge Base&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worthless if you don&#x27;t get that. Just make sure you know what your doing when you order it. I just noticed it so I&#x27;m not going to get the RECONDITIONED one.</li>
    <li> I have just ordered this product after waiting for a long time as it was not coming with the cleaning base before. Atleast this time it is mentioned that this unit includes the cleaning base and extra refill, so i just thought to give it a try. I will update you once I receive the unit.</li>
    <li> I have always used an electric shaver. This product is my first Braun and it is large enough to fit my hand. Even using preshave, it takes more than 7 slow storkes to get most of the beard, more than 12 and still a slight stubble remains. It did not come with a charger-cleaner base. I find this is not necessary as releasing the foil &amp; running for 5 seconds clears the cutters. Every third day I remove the foil &amp; cutters, rinsing under hot water &amp; gently brushing, then setting aside till dry. When I want a realy close shave I resort to my 1950 AC-DC Remington three head flat bar shaver.</li>
    <li> I was able to find the base at:  [...]  Cost $47, does an excellent job.  So the total cost of the shaver comes out to around $90.  Still not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 7526 for two weeks now and I absolutlely love it.  Many years ago, I used a Remington but was frustrated at its inability to get close enough.  I used to have shave twice a day--not convenient.  I&#x27;ve been using a blade ever since and living with the cuts and nicks for years.  Only after getting complete frustrated did I decide to try the Braun.  I am completely satisfied.  It shaves extremely close, leaves no burning sensation, and is flexible enough with options.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it in Europe where I recharged it using 220V with no problems.  I really like that I can switch the heads to NOT swivel (I&#x27;ve never liked swivelling heads on any shavers).  The cleaning system is a bit large, but also not necessary to have sitting out 24/7.  I leave mine tucked away in a cabinet and pulled it out only after two weeks for a cleaning.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great shaver with excellent options.  The price caused me a little sticker shock, but after using it, I have absolutely no complaints--money well spent.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a 7560 Syncro Shaving system complete with base and cleaner.  I recently dropped my shaver several times, causing the head of the shaver to fall apart.  I bought this reconditioned one and was very suprised to find it looking almost brand new when it arrived.  Once I charged it up and turned it on, I was amazed to find how quiet this razor was compared to my original.  I guess I had been using a broken shaver for the past 2 years.  Anyway, great shaver for close, comfortable shaves.  Would highly recommend this elevtric razor.</li>
    <li> Beware it doesn&#x27;t include the base. Amazon sells it without metioning this point. I have seen these exact same reconditioned model sold on ebay etc. and they all point out that fact. I emailed Amazon and they said it was too big of a problem to fix eight weeks ago. They still haven&#x27;t updated their site to state that this does not include the cleaning base like a braun 7526 should. Truth in advertising is very impotant on the internet.</li>
    <li> Received my reconditioned 7526 a few weeks ago and have to say -- this is far and away the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned! F    or years I used a Norelco three-head shaver that was fine, but the Braun blows it out of the water: it delivers a much closer shave and an all-around more pleasant shaving experience.     The reconditioned unit looked like new, save for a small sticker denoting its refurb status.     The Braun is a joy to use and to behold... it feels like a quality piece of equipment, nicely weighted and solid.     Charges last an incredibly long time. I    n short, for about the cost of 2 cutter refills for my old Norelco, I got an entire \\&quot;new\\&quot; razor that is light years ahead of my old one.     The reconditioned unit has gone up in price about 20% since I bought, it seems, but it is still a phenomenal deal.      UPDATE from August 2011:     Well, it is 6 years later, and I am still using this razor!     Battery is still going strong, and I&#x27;ve spent far more on replacement screens and cutter blocks than I ever did on the razor itself.     That a $50 reconditioned razor would perform so reliably for so long is a tribute to Braun design and build quality.     Have definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth from this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 2 months already. At first, I was disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t cutting the growth on my neck close enough. I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave every working day, so having a shadow isn&#x27;t acceptable. I bought some William&#x27;s Lectric Shave as suggested by other Amazon reviewers and it really does make all the difference. The William&#x27;s is $5 at wal-mart for a 7oz bottle (Amazon sells smaller bottles for a lower price). I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and for some reason using this Braun without the William&#x27;s will irritate my neck. It&#x27;s still a little irritating, but not nearly as much so as the first month (especially without the William&#x27;s). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes me about 5 minutes which is only a little bit longer then with a Bic razor. This Braun does not come with the automatic cleaning stand, but brushing it clean (cleaning brush is included) with every use only takes a minute or two and is fairly easy. The Braun sometimes misses a few spots on my face, which is no big deal because it doesn&#x27;t happen too often. I&#x27;ve been checking the shaving foil every day, there aren&#x27;t any holes yet. This Braun holds a battery charge very well, the red warning light came on after using it for 3 weeks. Assuming the foil will last me another few months, I am making this Braun my permanant razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I paid only $20 for this Braun by signing up for the Amazon.com Visa card (takes $30 off) so that&#x27;s a great deal. It might be refurbished, but it looks and works like new.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun shaver in the mid 80&#x27;s in college, used it for almost 15 years until it finally gave out. I was looking at this one, but was scared off by the cost of a new one. So far, I&#x27;m not disappointed with the performance of this factory-reconditioned model - it&#x27;s smoother than my old Braun, and convenient and works well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, satisfied with this unit. Would recommend this unit to others!</li>
    <li> I replaced my 10 year old Braun with this product. It is a much better shaver, ie, technology over 10 years suggest more quick replacement in the future. I get a much better shave with this product than its predecessor. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This unit looked old and worne, it was old and worne, the battery would NOT charge. What a piece of JUNK.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my husband (that I think I threw away by mistake).  He had a fit when he couldn&#x27;t his..let&#x27;s you know he loves this razor&#x27;s convenience and reliability!</li>
    <li> This unit replaces my Panasonic, which replaced a Remington.  This unit is superior to both.  The initial charge lasted about 3 weeks before the red \\&quot;20% left\\&quot; led came on.  As other reviews mention, this unit does not have the automatic battery maintenance feature.   &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.  Just snap off the screen.  I have given it a spray with cleaner and lubricant, but usually just blow or brush.   &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy; you can&#x27;t beat it at this price.</li>
    <li> I already have a norelco shaver and my wife was always using it on her legs. The norelco did a lousy job on her legs so I decided to try this Braun for her. I tried the reconditioned so I wouldn&#x27;t be out so much money if she didn&#x27;t like it. Well I&#x27;m glad I did, it works great and does an excellent job on her legs, at least twice as good as the norelco in half the time. &lt;br /&gt; As for my face I would say it&#x27;s about equal to the norelco. I have very sensitive skin and the Norelco irritates me some and I need to use lotion every time I use it, but the Braun doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me much at all. The Norelco does a little better on my neck. I get a much better shave if I use Williams Lectric Shave but I read that it wears out the foil of the braun way too fast. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and I am very pleased with it, I will definitely buy another one when this one wears out. Good Shave at a great price. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Does a good job, nice upgrade from several other Braun shavers I&#x27;ve had over the years. Easy to clean, easy to use. No complaints, and the refurb purchase saved me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an earlier Braun model.  There is a palpable improvement.  The only problem is that occasionally the foil-head comes off.  It takes a minute to realize what&#x27;s wrong --  annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade to shave my whole life.  I&#x27;ve recently retired and my life is more relaxed. So, I wanted a good electric razor that I could use to get a decent shave.  I&#x27;ve been surprised and very pleased with my Reconditioned Braun 7526 shaver.  I&#x27;m getting an excellent shave, almost as close as I received with a blade. The price was also attractive to me.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hi. I personally have the model below this, which mainly is the same unit without the charge light and with less advanced charging technology. I purchased this particular one through Amazon for my dad. He recently underwent bypass surgery and cannot risk cutting himself with a blade. He really enjoys it, especially after a string of cheap disappointments. I have owned it for a few years and really like it. I also own the charging base which is nice, but not essential.  It wasnt always this way, however. When I first started to use it, I didnt get a very good shave with it, despite long shaving sessions, and my chin and jawbone remained hairy despite my best efforts. This being my first electric, I relunctantly settled on the decision that this is how electrics work. They  dont give you even close to the shave of a blade, miss lots of hairs, and must be popular mainly for the convenience.  I read on Amazon that someone with my same small face and angular jawline had difficulty at first getting an acceptable shave and that for some people the skin of the face builds up a tough epidermal layer to protect from the harshness of the shaver (and probably the harsh alcohol based after shave too).  I continued on with my electric shaving, endured comments from female friends like \\&quot;you need to shave\\&quot; only hours after I indeed did, and got used to the limits of my new electric friend. After about a month and a half, things started to change. I started to get a better and better shave, and now a handful of years later I get a great shave with it. Granted its still not as close as a blade, and its easier to miss spots so  you really need to check yourself out and see if  got everything, but I wouldnt go back to a blade (my face is softer and thanks me!)  and I don&#x27;t think you will either. It&#x27;s easier, cleaner, more portable, and better on my face, too. I think that can be said about all electrics, but this one does a great job once you \\&quot;break it in\\&quot;- or break your face in, as itmay be. I still use a razor about once a week to clean up my neck, but thats it. Craftsmanship is very high, with low tolerances on the way pieces fit together and a feel of high quality materials throughout. The unit has a nice weight to it that makes it feel solid and well screwed together.  Because of this I have purchased a few other Braun products, and found similar levels of quality and engineering in those items, too. IF you&#x27;re not familar with Braun products, this is a nice introduction to their line of home consumer products. Braun often partners with Gillette, maybe they are owned by them (I&#x27;m not sure who is with who anymore!)  They are a german company whose products in my experience, are well designed and constructed. Yes, Gillette was notorious for there extensive use of animals in cruel and often unnecessary lab tests, but they have, as a result of public outcry and consumer pressure, halted the development of any new tests and are currently developing non-animal methods.  Conscientious buyers (parden the spelling)  can now feel less guilty if they are considering this or any Gillette product, at least for now. Gillette recently announced they are being bought by Proctor and Gamble, whose product testing practices are just as dirty and underhanded as the old Gillette ones. TIme will tell how Gillette will fair and whether they will revert back to the outdated, old school ways, but for now... shave on!   I realize these comments are about a different model but they both are nearly identical when it comes to shaving dynamics, balance, and cutting ability so comments on its performance can be applied to multiple models that may be under your consideration. This is a great price on this unit too. I&#x27;m confident that razors costing twice as much as this one, new or refurb, will not give you the satisfaction of this one. As far as the vendor (Amazon) is concerned, they shipped it out quick and it was received well packaged and charged too.  I would rate thebuying process as high as the razor itself.  I hope this has been hopeful in deciding if an electric is for you, and if Braun and Amazon are the brand and store you want to get it from!   Enjoy and God bless! Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t work. Exchange is fairly convenient, but I have read other reviews with the same problem.</li>
    <li> This shaver is replacing an old single head Braun that I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s amazing how far they have come regarding speed and closeness! This was sold as reconditioned but it appears to have never been removed from the original wrapper, only the outside box was not original. Now if only it will last as long as my previous shaver...</li>
    <li> Everything was good to go until I realized that the electrical outlet needs to be attach very firmly, usually it&#x27;ll only work on a power strip. It just doesn&#x27;t stick on very well, I have an adapter that I hook up to it that suctions the electrical power recharger thing for it to work.</li>
    <li> This shaver is superior to any shaver I have ever used in the many years I have used one. I worked for a large wholesale distributor back before WW11 when the first electric shaver was introduced, so my experience covers over 75 years.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;It has been a good choice to buy it thru amazon.</li>
    <li> This has been an opportunity for me to use a Braun shaving product at a much reduced price.  It is an effective razor with no problems that I can find.  I have not gotten a foil or cutter replacement, so I do not know how expensive this will be.  I still may hesitate to pay full price for the product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver.  No problems to date. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Will not cut as close as razor, but a good product.  If you have really thick facial hair like me, then you shoud stick to a razor.</li>
    <li> This is probably my husband&#x27;s third of these razors. He loves them.  Getting them through Amazon \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I use this every now and then but it takes forever to get a decent shave, probably will be last refurb I ever buy. I have the feeling if I bought a new set of blades it would be night and day. If something is sold as a refurb isn&#x27;t it supposed to be inspected and brought up to factory standards. As far as construction of unit and battery life they are fine. I happened to be writing a review for a brilliant Oral Breeze irrigator when other products I bought came up for review so decided to state my piece on this even though I&#x27;ve had it for six months or more. I&#x27;m convinced it is a good product and design,  but was sent out with worn out blades. I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric shaver fan but using a friend&#x27;s at his weekend house was impressed - totally different experience than what I received. I should have complained right away. I&#x27;m told that most refurbs are not done at the factory but contracted out to refurb houses, I can&#x27;t imagine Braun (a company I&#x27;ve always respected) sending out a unit like this. You would think blades, even as a matter of hygiene, would be totally replaced in a refurb.</li>
    <li> It was all I hoped for.  No problems.  Good buy.  Same performance as a new razor.  Greatly surprised to get base/cleaner/etc.,also.  I was just expecting the razor.</li>
    <li> To the seller:&lt;br /&gt;Can you amend  your product for Intenraitonal Shipping available .?&lt;br /&gt;Justin, London</li>
    <li> The trimer and shaver are the very best I have ever used. The condition of the product was a like new condition. I have to say&lt;BR&gt;I am more than satified. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I was uneasy about purchasing a reconditioned shaver, but this is brand new.  I LOVE MY NEW Braun shaver.  I purchased a Norelco 8894XL in November, the Braun is far better than the Norelco.  I will be sending the 8894XL back to Norelco for a refund.  Thank you Braun and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased a factory reconditioned Braun 7526 on this site 3 months ago.  I have fairly light beard growth, and the unit provides a smooth shave fairly quickly.  The most impressive thing about this shaver is that I have only had to charge it once in three months.  I use it daily 7 days a week for about 1 minute each day.  It is about due for another charge, now.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have been dissappointed with the battery life, but my shaver had been remarkable.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco since past 3 years. I tried to go for Braun 7526 after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was not good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;BR&gt;++ Little bit closer shave then Norelco.&lt;BR&gt;++ Good Price. Amazon rocks!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;BR&gt;-- Need to clean every 2-3 days where as Norelco can be cleaned every 2 weeks.&lt;BR&gt;-- Unit was not very clean as described.&lt;BR&gt;-- Difficult to shave 2 or more days of growth.&lt;BR&gt;-- More noisy then Norelco&lt;BR&gt;-- Very Low Durability. The foil on my shaver is broken in just 3 months and it is not covered under warranty. So, I need to spend about $30 to replace the foil and cutter as they come together. I will rather discard this unit all together.&lt;BR&gt;-- Customer Service at Braun not upto professional standard.</li>
    <li> Cut closer than my previous 5-yr-old shaver.  Great for sideburns.  Definitely worth the cheap $50.</li>
    <li> I went through two of these shavers, neither of which would recharge properly.  Now Amazon is seeking to levy an undisclosed $10 restocking fee on the return of a defective product.  There&#x27;s a reason these shavers are cheap - they&#x27;re lemons, and you&#x27;ll pay $10 for the privilege of trying one and returning it.</li>
    <li> I purhased the razor as a gift for my husband. I am now living with a happy man. The razor is doing a excellent job and he said&amp;quot; never again with a blade&amp;quot; .  He is finding the longer he uses it the closer the shave is. Great Product, Juanita</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced an earlier model that was stolen, and I am very impressed with the performance.  You cannot tell that it is a re-conditioned unit, except for the packaging.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of the Reconditioned Braun 7526. I have an older braun shaver, about 6 years old, and it was time to replace the foil and cutterblock for this shaver. I checked and saw that this was going to cost around $30. I then saw that I could get this new, better, razor for just $20 more and decided to try that. I am glad I did. My first test was to not shave for about 5 days and then use the new razor. Usually, for a better and more comfortable shave, I would knock the beard down a little using the trimmer on the razor, before using the regular razor. But with the new razor I just used the razor, without trimming it down first, and it did a great job. It was a comfortable and close shave. The razor did not have trouble with the longer hairs, the shave was close, and my skin did not feel burned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor I received looked like new. I could not really tell that it was reconditioned. I am glad I spent the extra $20 to ge this new razor, rather than getting a new foil and cutterblock for my old one.</li>
    <li> I got this a year ago; yeah they have had these refurb. shavers @ Amazon for a while.  I have always used Norelco® rotary type razors in the past and have to admit I was a little skeptical.  I figured what the heck, for the price (or less) of a blade replacement I would take my chance.  Well this Braun® is wonderful!  I get lots of shave time on a charge (about 1.5 weeks per).  It shaves quick, close and the trimmer part works very well, much better than others I have ever tried.  A great choice.  I can&#x27;t imagine being dissatisfied with this purchase as long as the unit s complete, mine was \\&quot;brand-new\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I am also a long time braun shaver user. My latest 5414 has dull blades and tired batteries. So instead of $25 for blades I decided to try this reconditioned 7000 series shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The box came a couple of days earlier than estimated by Amazon. It&#x27;s a plain white box with a label on the cover identifying the shaver. It came with a power cord, caring case and cleaning brush. The case is soft sided, exactly like my 5414 case. The shaver is clean, with no marks or other way of knowing it is a refurb, it was charged up and ready to go.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My face is already used to an electric, so no conditioning or waiting was necessary. This shaver feels good in my hand, shaves very fast and clean.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a top quality shaver at a great price &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this electric razor for about 4 months now, and so far I can&#x27;t complain.  It is built very ruggedly, and does it&#x27;s job reliably.  Other reviewers have complained that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, but mine runs approximately 2 weeks (sometimes longer) before the battery starts to get weak and wont cut the stubble.  It does an excellent job of giving me a shave that is almost as good as a razor. My only gripe is that sometimes it will not cut my neck hairs if I let them get too long, no matter how many times I pass over them.  But a quick swipe with the razor takes care of them anyway, so it&#x27;s really not a big deal.  The sideburn trimmer is also a great feature.  It comes in handy and works like a charm.  Overall, I&#x27;d say this refurbished Braun is well worth the money I spent, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> When the battery gave out, as they always do too soon, on my Braun 5525, I bought this one based on the fine reviews found here. It&#x27;s very good. Where before I had to repeat passes on my cheek and neck, this razor does the job in many fewer passes. I estimate a time savings of one third. &lt;br /&gt;This did not come with the automatic cleaner. I recommend that the cleaner be purchased. The razor accumulates finer hair than the 5525, which makes for a harder clean-up. You can&#x27;t just knock the side of the blade and have most of the clippings fall out. &lt;br /&gt;Overall a fine electric razor.</li>
    <li> The product was as good as I expected from a Braun. Nice job Amazon.com for making this produce available to me.</li>
    <li> -This thing was never able to give me a close shave on the neck unless I attacked each hair individually &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-This morning, after just a couple of months, a plastic piece broke &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Norelco</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a razor for years and decided to give a shaver a try.  This one&#x27;s seems to be pretty good so far.  It gives a fairly close shave, just make sure that you shave BEFORE you shower.  If you shave afterwards, your face isn&#x27;t so forgiving.  Your face will also have to get used to getting the abrasion of a shaver, but it will after a couple of weeks. &lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T be afraid to get the factory reconditioned model, mine works and looks brand new.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriend. He gets ingrown hairs from shaving with a razor and so we thought he needed an electric shaver. I originally wanted to get him a norelco however they were all very expensive. We didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of moneyand I had heard that the Braun was good. The price was excellent and I figured if it didn&#x27;t work well I could always return it.  &lt;br /&gt;It works really, really well. It seems brand new. He gets a very close shave (which surprised me), and no more ingrown hairs. And what they say is true: your hair has to \\&quot;get used to\\&quot; the shaver. Everytime he shaves it gets easier and gives a better shave. I highly recommend this product. Also, the battery life is excellent and it charges quickly.</li>
    <li> As someone who has to shave everyday for work, I was getting sick of using a blade razor. The refill blades were expensive and dulled after 3 or 4 uses. I finally gave this razor a try and I love it!!! Shaving is so much quicker and it shaves so damn close. The battery lasts a long time and cleanup is very easy. I highly recommend this rasor for someone who shaves on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor a couple of months ago, when my Norelco was starting to die. So far it&#x27;s lived up to its reputation as being a quality shaver. I&#x27;d been a using the Norelco&#x27;s for a long time, but thought I&#x27;d try the Braun because of the price and reputation. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This razor is very comfortable in my hand and does a good job when it comes to giving me a close shave. It does however take a little getting use to after shaving with the Norelco&#x27;s all those years. However, after a couple shaves, it felt like I&#x27;d been using it for years. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with refurbished electric razors from Braun, and this one is no exception.  It gives an excellent close shave, and the refurbished price is excellent for this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7526 is my second Braun shaver. The first is still working just fine, but is now my travel shaver. The 7526 feels solid and well put together. It provides as good a shave as any from an electric razor and probably better than most. It does a good job of getting the problem areas, such as the under side of the jaw and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to hold a charge well. I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks now and it&#x27;s still going on the original charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is obviously not the original retail packaging - I know because I saw it in the store - but so what. I think that&#x27;s a good thing, because it doesn&#x27;t come with the silly cleaning station and its recurring expense refills. This all helps to make it cheaper to purchase, which is probably why you&#x27;re considering a reconditioned model in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I&#x27;m not crazy about is that the 7526 can&#x27;t be used in water and can&#x27;t be rinsed under running water, either. My other Braun could and I guess I just took that feature for granted. Also, although it&#x27;s supposed have the option to lock the pivoting head, I haven&#x27;t been able to do so. None of these, however, are deal breakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good shaver and one that I recommend.</li>
    <li> It is really good deal. &lt;br /&gt;Even thought the refurbished(reconditioned), &lt;br /&gt;it works excellent. &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. &lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I am satisfied with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only complain is that it does not cut deep enought to the end. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Impressed with the Braun name, and having read a few reviews warning about factory reconditioned units, I purchased it anyway at a great $39.95 price. Ultimately, the problem was the cheap little plastic ON/OFF switch. Move it up and the shaver turned on. With much effort, I finally got the switch to slide up higher to the \\&quot;clipper\\&quot; mode. Problem was, it stayed stuck in this mode and would not budge downward. When I finally did get it down, the thin metal element beneath the switch was damaged. What a cheap, crappy switch Braun decided to use!  Why, who knows. Amazon promptly refunded my money. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I Bought a reconditioned mod.7526 shaver. I get better shaves using a dull razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for the past five years. With sensitive skin and a fast-growing beard, it&#x27;s really the best choice for me. When my last shaver&#x27;s blades grew dull (also a Braun) and I couldn&#x27;t find replacements anywhere for less than $40, I picked up this one. The replacement blades and foils are readily available and significantly less expensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life on the 7526 Syncro is impressive. It&#x27;s gone for nearly three weeks of daily morning shaves without a charge, meaning that I won&#x27;t even pack the charger for my next vacation. After two weeks to adjust to the new shaver, my morning shave is closer and faster than before, with significantly less effort for the difficult chin and neck area.</li>
    <li> I bought it 3 months ago and it works very well. It is much better than my old Braun shaver. That is my 3rd Braun shaver. No one gave me any issue. The reason that I did not give it 5 starts is that it is not perfect when shaving my chin.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had though it does pull hair if you get too close to parts you don&#x27;t want to shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver like this, but was unwilling to spend the money for a new one.  This has been a great buy, it works like a charm and gives a great shave with no irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic - this was the shaver I was looking for.  I used a 3 rotary blade Norelco that never gave me a close shave for a long (much too long time).  I used my dad&#x27;s Braun and was so happy with it that I bought my own.  I don&#x27;t bother using the self-cleaning stand, so I just plug it in, wash it off, brush it clean and shave.  And it shaves very, very well.  No razor burn, gets all the weird hairs, super close and then I&#x27;m done for the day.</li>
    <li> Bought this reconditioned shaver after much debate.  Read all the previous comments but thought for [the price], can&#x27;t miss.  Been using mostly Norelco brand electric shavers and needed to replace it.  I am new to the Braun foil type shavers but so far have been impressed with its ability to get a decent close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge for over 2 months of daily shavings which is very surprising.  Even though it is reconditioned, I still think this was an awesome deal knowing the price is now ... more.  Wow.  Can&#x27;t expect more but will look for the base cleaner unit for good price later somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!!</li>

    <li> Never received the Braun shaver but would like to.&lt;br /&gt;Could you check it out?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Don Smith</li>
    <li> Mine holds a charge for 4 days. &lt;BR&gt;shaves only slightly better than other cordless.</li>
    <li> I got this electric saver last week and I am very happy with this product. It is a great product and the price is unbeatable. I saw this electric saver on Walmart, Target and other places, it cost more than $120 most of the places.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun 7526 recently and received it in record time (even with standard shipping).  I&#x27;m on shave #3, and can already feel the difference.  I&#x27;ve always been a blade shaver, and had the idea that electrics couldn&#x27;t give as close a shave.  Well, now that I&#x27;ve switched, I&#x27;ll never go back!&lt;br /&gt;My shave is really close and soft...probably not the closest I&#x27;ve had, but remarkable better than the usual blade experience.  Trying to get this same shave with a blade usually requires voodoo preparations, or results in dozens of nicks...and yes, even with a Mach3, etc...tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;No more tedious shaving ritual to get a nice shave:  hot shower (to soften face), sink full of water, messy lather, nicks &amp;amp; cuts, cleanup.  Now it&#x27;s 2-3 minutes of the Braun on dry skin, followed by my favorite shaving balm.  Lasts well into the evening, even for a mid-heavy beard.  The trimmer&#x27;s a nice touch for burns...&amp;lt;g&amp;gt;.  And, no more throwing tons of plastic and metal away with disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, great product.  Great price.  Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I just bought one a few days ago and today I am buying a second Braun 7526 .  I usually keep 2 in use because I wouldn&#x27;t like to be in a situation without one .  At this price it doesn&#x27;t make sense to repair a shaver or even replace cutters . Many years ago I tried all the major brands &amp;amp; this has been my choice by far. I gave the others to my friends and maybe they like them or perhaps the price was right.</li>
    <li> This razor is somewhere between a bargain and a steal at this price. I have been using electric razors for 50 years, Sunbeams, Norelcos, and Remingtons. This razor is the best I have seen. The Remington Microscreen 3 TCT will shave as close and as fast, but not as smooth. The Braun is quiet and extemely smooth.Forget the charging base, it&#x27;s no good. No one can clean an electric razor in a liquid. Take off the head and use the brush daily for the best shaves. It only takes about 2 minutes or less. Remington also has a short head life, about 6 months and the foil wears through. Wish I had bought a Braun year ago. (the price dissuaded me, but it would have been worth it. R.Day</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes. My cousin had the same model, and i thought i would get similar results.Doing a bit of research, the model came more or less highly recommended.. I bought this factory reconditioned model, and tried it out...  The first shave was alright... no bumps or anything. irritated the skin  a bit ( as expected) and i continued for three weeks. Subsequent shaves were horrible... I do not know if is my hair type (coarse, curly) and skin type ( very sensitive) but the razor always left stubble in the same areas... attempts at going closer would leave my skin raw and tender, and then the rzor bumps kept on coming. The reason for buying this unit was to avoid razor bumps and get a close shave . This unit was touted as being able to do both, but in my case failed sadly...  If you have the same type of hair as me ( curly, coarse ) you may do best to look elsewhere.. Disappointed, I gave it to my brother in law, and hoped he had better results.. I&#x27;m back to razors and cream...</li>
    <li> The reconditioned Braun 7526 is a very good value, but for me the shave is disappointing. Consumer Reports gave top marks to similar Braun shavers, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. My last shaver, a Norelco rotary, was a reconditioned shaver, too. That shaver served me well for 7-8 years until the rechargeable batteries past their useful life and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than several shaves. Rather than get new batteries and new heads, I figured a new shaver was a better choice and a reconditioned one a good value. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pictures of the Braun 7526 hinted of a compact, contemporary design.  That it is, but there are a few flaws. The on/off button is a slide switch right where you hold the shaver as you use it. It accidentally slips to another position, either off or head locked, as you sweep the beard. Second is the plastic head cover. It slides side to side to take it on and off, and not very smoothly. It&#x27;s too easy to damage the foil screen with a fingernail as you take the cover off.  Protecting the head is very important, so a cover should be easy to remove and replace without risk to the head. Now, I&#x27;ll adjust to these as time goes by. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the shave that really counts, and this one is only fair. First, it takes me longer than with the Norelco since I must sweep back in forth in all directions to get the close shave in all face areas. Then, when I finally do get a close shave, oh the razor burn. To be fair, I normally shave with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo in the shower each morning, and nothing can beat that for closeness or comfort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way, the shaver Amazon first sent had a small dent in the foil screen. I reported it online and Amazon sent a replacement within 3 days. Way to go, Amazon! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought my re-conditioned 7526 around Mid-August 2004 and have been using it since. True to what most other reviewers write, it does not come with the base or cleaner - but I was aware of that. It does come with a cord to charge it with, and that works just fine for me. &lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to the shaver as it would be my second one after a gap of over a decade. The instructions suggested upto 2 weeks for my skin/beard to be conditioned to the shaver. That appeared to be true in my case, though initially I had to use my regular razor blade to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the stray hairs that the shaver missed. Maybe it is my skin texture (too soft) or just the contours, but indeed the shaver could not shave as close as a razor around the neck/under-the-chin area. I&#x27;ve gotten used to that now. It may take a couple of extra passes and some maneuvering to get a stubborn hair out of the way. If you have smooth or very contoured skin texture, I would be prepared for a likelihood of NOT quite liking this electric shaver over a regular razor blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts extremely well on the face though - very smooth; no burns; and clean. I was very impressed how well it shaved on my face. &lt;br /&gt;It is true that the shaver spills hair all around - and as a result I have to shave over a sink. But I have not complaints about the same, I don&#x27;t know of any other shaver that does not spill any hair at all. &lt;br /&gt;I also like the extendible side-burn clipper which is really handy if I missed out shaving for a few days and have a fuzz. Trimming the beard first and then shaving, saves a lot of agony. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life is excellent. I shave every third day or so, and don&#x27;t have to charge the battery for at least a month after it&#x27;s fully charged. Each time I shave I use the 7526 Shaver for around 10 minutes on the the free and fixed positions for the foil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor head could be cumbersome depending on how regularly you clean the shaver. The foil can snap off ocassionally when trying to remove plastic protective cover, but never during shaving, unless it was improperly seated to start with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the form and shape of the razor. If I COULD re-design this machine though, I would make it a tad bit shorter and LIGHTER. My impression was that it felt a bit too heavy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all a great value for money and performance, especially if you want a quality instrument with less frills (no cleaner or base charger for example). I think Braun vindicates its reputation in this instrument and hopefully it will last me a good bit.</li>
    <li> First, read Irwin Shapiro&#x27;s review (d. 11/28/03) - it outlines how the razor works, that it DOES NOT come with the recharging base/cleaner stand and that it works fine as a stand alone model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My comments: If you already own this model in the Synchro System version (with the stand/cleaner base), this fits and works the same as the unit that you get with the complete system.  I bought this one as a travel model - take it on short trips and then pop it in the stand when I return (I bought a full Synchro System separately) - thus I get it all clean and ready to go for the next trip.  Less hassle than the old way of manually cleaning.  And for those that either want to clean it before you get back home to the base stand, you can pop off the foil and clean it manually with the brush they include with the unit.  By the way, beaside the shaver, you get a little brush, a vinyl travel/storage bag, a cord and an iinstruction book.  As best I can tell you can use the model with or without the cord.  I usually charge and go, thus the reason I am not certain on corded usage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you want to spend $30 - $35 to replace a foil and a cutter block on your existing model, go ahead, but I would suggest just buying this one - at least you have a new unit, new foil and cutter block, and a battery that is suppose to last longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the only differences I notice from the Synchro System shaver unit I recently bought (Feb-05) and the factory reconditioned unit I just got from here is that the buttons are a differenct color blue and the charging lights and lenses on those lights are slightly different shades.  Kind of like buying the 2004 Hoonda Accord and the 2005 Honda Accord - same car, maybe the shade of the seat fabric is slightly different.</li>
    <li> Ok...So before buying this razor, I read all of the reviews posted to date. I was looking for details on how CLOSE the razor would shave (having used a blade all of my life and having a very thick beard), as that would be the determining factor for me. Of course these reviews differ in that aspect. Some say close as a blade, others \\&quot;pretty close\\&quot;, and even a few said they didn&#x27;t come close. But in the end, I finally decided I&#x27;d had enough of razor burn, nicks, and high costs of blades (Mach). So I purchased this Braun.  &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but I didn&#x27;t expect the difference to be as much as it was. BUT, after a week, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m never going back to a blade. It seemed like my beard began adjusting to the new shaver and I got better at gliding it across my face and neck to get a satisfactory shave. For me, the tradeoff (extremely close--blade vs. fairly close--Braun) has been worth it. The razor works great, cleans up well, and the best part is my face and skin simply feel better.</li>
    <li> For the price that i paid for the shaver the quality is outstanding, i would reccomend to everyone shop amazon.com, Thanks Royston Kocher</li>
    <li> has anyone used this shaver to shave his head before?  if the answer is yes, then how did it perform?      i sometimes let my hair grown too long and it is a pain in the butt to shave with a razor when your hair is more than three or four days old.  i am not looking for this thing to give me a razor close shave on my head, but just short enough for me to use my razor later with ease.    any help is truly appreciated.</li>
    <li> Shaves almost as well as a straight razor.  Best electric razor I have every used.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver after reading positive reviews on an electric shaver blog.  This shaver allegedly gives the best shave at 60 % faster shave time due to the larger holes in the razor screen, and also needs recharged 1 or 2 times/month.My experience is this new model does not exceed my old mid-level Braun.  This new Braun misses several hairs on my face daily and makes me go over and over at different angles to get it cut, but then I have slight razor burn.  The razor screen protector is awkward to remove each day, and I want to protect the screen so it doesn&#x27;t get torn.  I envisioned an extremely quick, turbo  shave due to the screen holes bigger diameter (they aren&#x27;t bigger than my 10 yr old Braun), and completing the shave in one or two passes over each area, so as to eliminate razor burn.  This razor is decent, but the perfect shave has still eluded me.</li>
    <li> The seller needs to do a little research.  The 7526 is the shaving system with the automatic cleaner.  What is advertised here is the 7505 shaver only.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier. Price was good. Shaver operates fine. And the reason I use you was beacuse I bought a crappy new Remington at Christmastime that only gave me a neck rash. It did nothing with my beard, but if you want a gauranteed rash, that was the Remington. Luckily I found you on the Internet.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This razor shaves better than any foil razor I have owned and at least as good or better than any rotory razor.  The time between charging is better than any other electric I&#x27;ve owned by far, although my previous electric was at least ten years ago and battery technology in general has improved a lot since then.  Having paid less than $50 for this, it is a real bargain and worth the money.</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be a great razor so far, and at a great price.  Battery life has been exceptional: I&#x27;ve only had it for three weeks but it&#x27;s still on its first charge.</li>
    <li> It does not shave good around Neck and you need to shave it with razor again. Also you cannot trim u r sices with blade provided at front side of Shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time rotary shaver user, mostly Norelcos.  I had test drove a few straight blade electrics over the years, but always preferred my current rotary.  However I had heard such great things about the Braun electric razors, that I figured I just had to give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does cut close and smooth, and if you have used similiar style razors in the past, you will probably like it.  But if you are use to a rotary electric shaver -- beware.  I gave the Braun a fair trail of about a month, and while it did a good job, it just takes too dang long to use it.  I found that to get a good shave, particularly on my neck and chin, I had to be very careful to run the razor in just the right direction, broadside against the grain, to get good results.  Now for you guys who regularly use this type of razor, or a manual razor, you&#x27;re probably saying, \\&quot;Well, duh!\\&quot;  But with a rotary the technique used is more like waxing your car, moving the head in circular motions quickly across your beard.  This causes the shaver head to move against the beard&#x27;s grain for at least some portion of the head&#x27;s travel allowing it to get a good cut.  Personally I&#x27;ve found the end result is being able to shave your entire face much more quickly then with a convention razor or an electric like the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Braun did give me a somewhat closer shave compared to my current 5 year old Norelco with the original blades.  And I know some people with problem beards don&#x27;t find that rotaries give them a close enough shave regardless.  If that&#x27;s your situation, this Braun may be a bargain for you.  But be aware that there is no money-back guarantee from Braun for refurbished razors, and you can&#x27;t return it to Amazon if it is used.  So if you don&#x27;t like it, too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: if your experience is mostly with electric rotaries -- buy a &amp;lt;U&gt;new&amp;lt;/U&gt; Braun so you can at least get your money back if you find it doesn&#x27;t work out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, since my girl friend doesn&#x27;t like using it on her legs (the buzz is annoying), I guess I&#x27;ll just have to save it for weekends when I can afford to take the extra time and may want an extra close shave for some occasion.&gt;As for me, since my girl friend doesn&#x27;t like using it on her legs (the buzz is annoying), I guess I&#x27;ll just have to save it for weekends when I can afford to take the extra time and may want an extra close shave for some occasion.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old Panasonic shaver needed a new screen and blades. For the same price, I could get this reconditioned Braun shaver. I have never had a Braun, but knew it had a great reputation. 8 months later it is still going strong although the blades are getting close to needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaves as close as a shaver costing 3 times as much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Solid, expensive feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Foil is thick enough not to break when dropped (Had that happen  with the Panasonic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively inexpensive replacement foil/blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Blades seem to dull a little faster then Panasonic shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not have Smart battery system as advertised, need to drain the battery periodically manually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Hey guys if u read paul&#x27;s review, he has a problem getting it up.. maybe he should buy some pills instead of a shave that might help:)</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year power user of electric shavers, and many years of those with Remington microscreen shavers. My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable. I had had several rotary shavers which never really worked well for me. So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died. This shaver has NIMH batteries instead of NICAD which should have a much longer life. This shaver shaves as well as my original Microscreen. It shaves close without any irritation. I have had a past Microscreen shaver that irritated my skin badly. I returned it for a refund. It shaves a little slowly, but the other advantages outweigh that. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to use an electric shaver. You will find it hard to beat this price. I have used this every day for 11 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED after 2 more years; all of the above is still true. Very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added after 6 years; It finally gave up the ghost after using every day. It really used very few replacement screens, maybe only every 2 years. I only wish I had been able to buy a new one just like it, but it is no longer available, even in a Factory Reman. So I just purchased a Braun 340s-4 and we will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> if you just use it for ur face it&#x27;ll do great, the best electric razor in my opinion, but i have a big bald head and i burned it up pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This is a natural evolution of Braun&#x27;s revered line of synchro-mesh shavers. Prior to using this one, I had 2 Brauns over the last 6 years (ever since I started using electric razors), each one better than the previous one. This one didn&#x27;t disappoint either. The shave is closer and more comfortable than the older models. The battery lasts for about a half-hour of shaving (which is about 7-10 shaves), which is standard, or maybe a slight improvement over the older ones. The thing I noticed about the 7526 is that when it runs out of juice, there is no warning -- it just dies (all the other shavers I used ran a little sluggishly for a couple of shaves before dying out). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good thing or a bad, but my feeling is that the shaver runs at maximum throughput for as long as it can, without ever going sluggish, and then just dies. Which is a good thing... I think. Maybe other reviewers can shed some light on this aspect as well. &lt;br /&gt;In terms of the shave, the razor is capable of grabbing almost everything from the face, including finer hair strands in the first attempt, which is a definite improvement. The shave is very close and comfortable. I don&#x27;t really know how well the adjustable head works, since I always lock the head while shaving. Speaking of the locked position, kudos to Braun for figuring out this design. In this new design, the chances of the shaver \\&quot;slipping\\&quot; to the adjustable position (as with all previous ones) are slim -- gotta love that. Even in the locked position, it works well over contours and corners of the face. The third position is the trimmer, which is pretty effective and does not stick out in an awkward angle like my older 5416 -- another improvement. &lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;refurb\\&quot; package, which I am writing about, comes with a pouch, a cleaning brush and a bulky charger. I wonder why the charger (which was only a cord in the previous editions) actually *grew* in size. It&#x27;s only a minor irritation, though, and if it&#x27;s doing the unit anygood, it&#x27;s an annoyance that can be forgiven. &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you can get a shaver like this for this price, just buy it.</li>
    <li> The shaver I got was not good at all. After 10 minutes of shaving, I had to use a razor to finish. Maybe it was just mine that was bad, but I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t used an electric razor for probably ten years.  I remember being dissatisfied with the shave.  I went with a blade and havn&#x27;t gone back.  But, I couldn&#x27;t resist the cheap price from Amazon on the Braun 7526 and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;There are several things to consider before you buy.  This razor is refurbished. It does not come with the cleaner/charger stand.  Amazon implies that refurbished means that the original packaging was damaged.  In reality, it may actually have been used.  Mine was spotless and looked new.  I am sure that they are very well cleaned.  The unit is also not difficult to manually clean, so the lack of a base/charger didn&#x27;t mean much to me.  &lt;br /&gt;It really took a week or two to get my shave where I liked it.  This was probably due to the fact that I had to adjust to how I had to shave to get the best shave. &lt;br /&gt;The shave is actually better than a blade.  I used to use the Sensor.  It actually does a better job of shaving under my chin, which used to be a problem area for me.  It also seems like it takes me less time.  There is no prep time.  No more preparing my beard, applying the shaving cream, etc.  No mess either. No more water and shaving cream everywhere.  &lt;br /&gt;The razor is also very comportable.  I ued to get razor burn.  My face would sting and itch and turn red in places.  Now, my face feels great all the time.  I can feels just a little bit \\&quot;raw\\&quot;  after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great purchase and a great price....  I got one for my dad too.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver and now have used it for over a month. It is one of the best shavers that I have ever used. Not as close as a blade razor, but then, I was tired of cutting myself all of the time. When I bought it, it was also on sale for twenty-nine rather than the current price. I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive quality unit. It also comes with a multi year warranty.</li>
    <li> As with other reviewers, I had not used an electric shaver for 15 years and was never satisfied with the shave.  The reconditioned Braun was selected as a trial run back to electric shaving without significant investment.  From the first shave, I received a close, irritation-free result.  I was so pleased that I searched the Web and found a source for the cleaning unit and promptly ordered it.  The cleaning unit was also a great convenience in maintaining the Braun shaver (and I would encourage Amazon to make this unit available to their customers).  My total investment was still less than half the cost of a new unit.</li>
    <li> Great razor for about a month.  Then it just flat out stopped working.  Best of all, you can&#x27;t return or exhange it through Amazon after 30 days.  Your taking a big rish if you buy this item.            -Scott,  So Cal</li>
    <li> I have been using Norleco 7-Series for las 2 years. Since the new razors were costing $29 I decided to buy this factory reconditioned Braun. Some people have said it looks like new. No it does not. Battery life is good, excellent if you shave daily and beard is not grown for more than a day. But, still after shaving you can see some hairs on ur shirt and on top of the foil. Norelco scores full marks in this department, not even a single hair is left outside. And if I don&#x27;t shave for a day I wouldn&#x27;t try Braun the next day, its horrible with whiskers. The Norelco is also easy to go around the chin area.&lt;BR&gt;But, since my Norelco still works excellent on whiskers I still use it and use this Braun for daily shaving. Considering it price as compared to a new unit its an average deal considering that the reconditioned Braun does not come with the cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting charge, it was at least two weeks before I had to plug in the charger again.  I am very pleased with this razor.  While nothing can get as close as a good blade, this does very well.  Cleaning is not the easiest, but still jusst a few min. and you are don with that too.  All in all..a very good deal</li>
    <li> I owned several Remington Microscreen 3000 shavers over a number of years with good results.   Unfortunately these no longer are made in USA and their Chinese imports are inferior . . . so I decided to try this reconditioned top of the line Braun model and was very pleased with the results.  The shaver cannot be told from brand new except for the removable &amp;quot;factory reconditioned&amp;quot; sticker.  The price was a fraction of a new one.  The Syncro model works fast, gives very close shaves and is easy to hold.  The advantage of the 7526 over the 7505 (also available reconditioned) is the red warning light that tells when the battery is getting low and it&#x27;s time to recharge.  I understand that battery life is prolonged by letting the shaver cycle down instead of plugging in the charger cord every few days.  I was surprised that I got 30 shaves before the light first came on, indicating 20 percent of battery life was left.  There was no slowing of the shaver&#x27;s speed at this point.For weekly cleaning I simply push two buttons and the head assembly lifts up but doesn&#x27;t come off.  Turn on the shaver upside down and the clippings vibrate neatly into the sink.  Then snap the head back in place.  As for not having the clean and charge stand (that doesn&#x27;t come with the reconditioned models) I don&#x27;t think this expensive to refill accessory really is necessary as I use a aerosol shaver cleaner/lubricant along with the supplied brush for thorough cleanings which are only occasionally needed -- and the 7526&#x27;s red signal light tells me when to recharge instead of the charger stand doing this automatically.A few words about the seller.  Not only was Amazon&#x27;s price the lowest, but they offer a money back guarantee of satisfaction and free shipping for orders over $25.  I was very pleased how well I was treated when the first shaver they sent was defective.  Not only did Amazon send out a replacement immediately by second day air but they also provided in their e-mail acknowledgement a postage paid return label for me to print out and tape to the package.  I&#x27;ll never hesitate to do business with Amazon.  Their handling of a problem was exceptional.In sum, good product and great seller.</li>
    <li> All I recived was the shaver, charging cord and brush. I am sending back and requesting the clean &amp;amp; charge base with the refill.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver...have borrowed my sons...but I would like to get what was ordered.</li>
    <li> This reconditioned razor is very valuable considering you are getting a high quality razor for a low price.  Braun is reliable in my opinion for razors and this one is no exception.  Great for trimming face stubble and great for trimming long hair with the pop-up trimmer.&lt;BR&gt;I bought this razor from Amazon.com b/c my old braun was finally about to bite the dust after many years of use.</li>
    <li> great shaver.holds charge well,easy to clean. best shaver I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> The refurbished 7526 I received had 4 blades missing from one side, you have to look very closely.  It shaves much better with a new blade but that cost $25, I didn&#x27;t catch it time for a return.  For the total price I could have bought a new one.  Learn from my mistake!  Check that blade ASAP.</li>
    <li> i guess i&#x27;m review # 130 ... i&#x27;ve read all 129 of the previous ... i&#x27;ve had 3-4 braun razors over the past 7-8 yrs. + this is the best so far ... all brauns have a 2 yr. warranty whether refurbed or new ... so that knucklehead who said he had 2 fail in 24 months + threw them out is clueless + full of it ... he could have had both fixed like new for FREE ... i live in clearwater fla + there is a small appliance shaver repair store here like there is in most cities in america ... just carry it in with amazon reciept ...+ they will fix it for FREE ... braun pays these guys for all warranty work ... easier then mailing it in ... the battery life is great on this razor ... just be sure to charge it fully out of he box ...+ run it till it is dead every once in a while... want a good shave ... SHAVE BEFORE U GET IN THE SHOWER ... the oils in your skin help give u a much closer shave then after the shower when they are washed out + your skin is soft ... i have a tough beard + it takes about 3-5 minutes to get a complete shave ... u have to run it side to side + up + down in all directions to get the neck hair + all the rough spots ... u might have to use a blade in the shower every now + then to get weird angles on your neck ... but this braun gives a smooth close shave quick + easy ... this is very quiet razor to me ... if u think its real loud as some have suggested u may have a problem with the pivot head ... mine is quiet to me ... but if u have any problem braun will fix it ... everything is under warranty except the foil + cutter blades...    the cutter blades + foil should be replaced about 1-2 times a year or when worn rough or thru the foil according to your face ... they are about $20 for both on line or at walmart ... i had the braun 2000 + 3000 series + they were ok ... but after2 years its not worth replacing the cutter + foil when u can get a new 1 at this price ... my refurb model came fast with free shipping from amazon ... i knew it did&#x27;nt come with the cleaning base + cleaning cartridges ... i didnt want that feature or to have to buy the cartridges ... the head snaps off + u can run it to loosen the shaved hairs + brush it off with the supplied brush ... the cutter block pulls out easily + is easy to clean with the brush or soak it in some alcohol... the refurbed ones come with a brand new foil + cutter block blades ... there is no way u are going to catch a diease from it like one reader suggested ... electrics are not for everyone or perfect like everything else in life ... as far as hairs spilling out on your clothes ... mine rarely does it ... + only a few if at all ... i dump the shavings out after every shave ... it takes a sec ... the button lock does&#x27;nt work real well on mine.. my only drawback ... but i&#x27;ll get it fixed if its a real bother ... the 4 way piviot head is great + allows u to get all the angles to get a close shave ... go with + against the grain of the beard to get em all ... + this razor gets em all for a great price backed by a 2 yr warranty from braun + amazons nice customer service ... thank u very much                  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This was a great deal when I bought it, and it still is at $49. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor generally gives a good shave for an electric dry razor (usually a blade gives a closer shave, and I have seen wet razors do so, too) -- but the real benefit of this thing is NO razor burn.  I love that!  I have struggled with razor burn (and those stupid bumps on my neck as a result) for YEARS, and with this I rarely get even minor irritation.  Even that, I&#x27;ve only gotten when my face is wet.  Finally, I should say that although the users&#x27; manual recommends that you shave prior to showering, I would say that generally I&#x27;ve had to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; after showering, too.  Just something to be aware of!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Used many other shavers but this one works... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy the high-end version for a lot more, but then I found this and glad I bought the reconditioned version &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday on my way to work for about 3 months now &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has already paid for the amount of 3-blade razors that I used to use, but without the razor burn &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it does not get every single neck hair...thus I carry one of my left over 3-blade razors and use that to get those 2 to 3 remaining hairs... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At this point I am not even sure why you NEED the cleaning...I just click open the screen, turn it on for 3 seconds outside my car window...and I&#x27;m done...then every week or so I use that cleaning brush thing when I am recharging... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Items like this is what Amazon was invented for...</li>
    <li> I just started using Braun shavers again 2 years ago. I had stopped using electric shavers after I replaced an old braun with a norelco. The Norelco caused rashs so I stoped using them. I ended up buying a 6610 freeglider which I loved so much that I went out and bought there top of the line freeglider the 6900. &lt;br /&gt; My son just turned 15 and was ready for his first shave. I bought him this 7526 for his birthday. He loves it but he realy only has peach fuzz but does have a small mustach. I wanted to se how the razor was so I put it to the test. I used it a few times and have to admit that I think the razor is stronger than my 6900. I find it weighs more than my other shavers but it feels better in your hand. The shave was better and faster than my other shavers. I liked it so much that I bought another one to give to my brother in law for his birthday. For the price you can not get a better shaver and IMO you won&#x27;t find a better shaver even if you were to spend twice as much.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low, low price.  They keep the cleaning stand, and for the price of the stand, you might as well buy a new unit (shaver and stand together) instead of trying your luck with a reconditioned shaver.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off!</li>
    <li> I bought this from amazon a couple of months ago for $49 - $20 credit that I had on account.  I replaced an old norelco, and the braun gives me a much improved shave.  Much closer, just as easy to use, faster moving blades, and it takes a somewhat shorter time to finish.  Of course, the fact that my norelco was about 8 or 9 years old and I never sharpened the blades or oiled the rotors probably doesn&#x27;t make it a fair comparison, but overall, I&#x27;m happy with the new braun.  I&#x27;m just lazy and I don&#x27;t want to do much maintenance, so time will tell...  I am now cleaning the braun daily-ish with the brush and weekly-ish with compressed air.</li>
    <li> This is the first Braun shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;m impressed with its performance.  Shaves noticeably closer than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to clearly hear when it&#x27;s cutting your whiskers and also easy to tell when you are DONE because you don&#x27;t hear it cutting anything more.</li>
    <li> been using my Braun 7526 a little while now and I honestly can say it does it job.  It is sometimes kinda akward to line out my beard when I am not clean shaving but as I say ... not the best of buys ... not the worst of buys!</li>
    <li> I purchased this good shaver, plugged it in for 6hrs and expected my new shaver to caress my face.  However, it never worked!  My wiskers are going to have to stay on for an extra day.  The factory recommended that the new charger be plugged in for 4 hrs.  I did that and 2 more!  As we speak, I have the shaver plugged in, the red light is flashing (this indicates that less than 20% of a charge on the battery), and my bushy face is getting bushier.  Buyer beware!  Also, this product DOES NOT come with the cool Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> I prefer shaving with a blade, but my face is such that I have to shave every other day--if I shave daily my face gets scratched up and irritated. I purchased this shaver for those times when I need a shave (e.g. meeting) but I can&#x27;t use a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is well-built, tough, and functional. I have had no problems with it thus far. Having used it for a while now, I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade (I&#x27;ve never seen a shaver that does) but it does well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One plus: my kids (4 and 2 years old) always want to do what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m shaving, and since this won&#x27;t cut their faces I can actually let them try it out. They love the way it tickles.</li>
    <li> i originally purchased this same razor at Target for 100.00. &lt;br /&gt;A day or two later i was online and just happen to look up this exact same model on Amazon and it was 1/2 the price. It is of course recoditioned but after receiiving it i was please that there appeared to be no difference. It has a full warrenty as well. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> A good value product, that works for me, a 30year+ wet shaver, very well. Its not as close as wet shaving of course, but works well on the boat ( limited water etc)</li>
    <li> Used a braun 6520 for several years before I dropped it &amp; broke it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7526 is quieter and provides an equivalent shave (very good!). It actually does even better on the neck; it takes fewer passes and gets the problem hairs quickly.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the placement of the switch is unfortunate and it is easy to inadvertantly move the position. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find the shave closer than what I can get with a razor blade shaving &#x27;down.&#x27; There is also less irritation.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and I have been using Braun shavers all my life. This was the finest one for about 2 years. By now it stopped shaving. It became noisy and takes forever to get anything but a close shave. I noticed that the cutting block has a huge play. It has probably reached the level when it does not move through an entire hole in the foil any more. I do not think replacing the block would help since the hole in the plastic part that tranfers the motion to it got enlarged. Looks like it is a design flaw. Other customers who complain about the slowness of the shaving and noise most likely experiencing the same problem in progeress.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve owned the reconditioned Braun 7526 for about three months now, after using a blade razor for the last three decades.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried different electric shavers - triple-headers, foil head, etc. - but I&#x27;ve found them terribly lacking.  Either the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough, or the shaver got dirty and clogged, or my face would be irritated as the shaver pulled out whiskers rather than cut them.  This shaver truly gives me as close a shave as I&#x27;ve ever had with a razor, is easy to clean, and holds a long charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IMPORTANT NOTE TO THOSE BUYING THE RECONDITIONED MODEL - I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and wasn&#x27;t aware that the reconditioned shaver comes without the clean &amp; charge unit.  The price for the reconditioned unit is terrific, the shaver is &#x60;as new&#x27; as could be desired, but I want to be able to clean the shaving head as completely as possible.  The clean &amp; charge unit holds an alcohol cleansing solution that lasts for about thirty days or so.  You can&#x27;t buy it in the store and it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find on the web as a standalone unit.  I was able to find a site that sells it - for about the same price as the reconditioned shaver itself - and waited about seven weeks for it to ship.  I&#x27;ve been using the cleaner for a few weeks now and believe it keeps the shaving head cleaner, resulting in a better shave.  I still saved money by buying the reconditioned shaver and the cleaning unit from another vendor, but those who want to save time may want to buy the non-reconditioned shaver, although the reconditioned one is, as far as I can tell, in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father&#x27;s day for my husband.  It does a good job on my husband&#x27;s face.  It is consistent (He has had this one for over six months now).  The trimmer is a very nice feature.  You can&#x27;t beat the value for the money - it is very inexpensive and does a great job.  He honestly has no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t cut me easily like Panasonics do.  I would HIGHLY recommend it, especially since the product looks completely new when you get it.  I&#x27;m not sure what part of this razor is refurbished (must be the inside motor or battery), but the shaver head and everything on the outside looks completely new.  For $50, this is a really great deal.  The only thing is doesn&#x27;t have is the clean and charge automatic cleaner, but I think that is overpriced anyway (the refills will cost you).  I&#x27;ve found that using the brush and Remington Shaver Saver lubricant spray really helps the razor function even better.</li>
    <li> I am old school Braun.I have one of the first self cleaning systems for years.Then all of a sudden,the charger/cleaner went to hell.In the garbage it went.To Amazon I go and find this refur model for almost nothing.I get it in the mail in less then a week and what a deal.Being 52 and with a thick,tough beard I can put a razor to the test.This Braun,model 7526 cuts right through my beard.I have had it almost a month now and shave daily.I an still working on the initial charge.And it will cut your neck hairs,try turning the razor sideways.</li>
    <li> Urun sifirindan farksiz. Sadece kutusu sifir degildi o kadar. 1 yildir kullaniyorum sarjinda yada kullaniminda hicbir sorun cikmadi. :)</li>
    <li> this is the best electric shaver I have used. this shaver is far superior to my old rotary shavers. shave is smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> I am used to shaving with a Norelco 3 head shaver and decided to purchase a Braun. Here are the results: &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1. Cool factor &lt;br /&gt;2. Cleaning station works well &lt;br /&gt;3. Keeps good charge &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1. Noisy! &lt;br /&gt;2. Odd shape and difficult to hold  &lt;br /&gt;3. Heavy &lt;br /&gt;4. Cannot shave neck areas well at all (I have already shaved 10 times with it, so it is not training) &lt;br /&gt;5. Cut hair falls down (have to shave in front of sink) &lt;br /&gt;6. Price - not worth the price (incl cleaning station)</li>
    <li> Infuriating.  It takes 20 to 30 minutes to shave with the Braun 7526.  The screen keeps popping off!  I&#x27;ve used it for only 7  months, but I am going to have to look for a new one.  It won&#x27;t be a Braun.    I later learned the foil stays on if you push on the black plastic wings on the side of the foil and not on the top of the foil.  So, now I&#x27;d give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I was amazed. I&#x27;ve used electric shavers as a convenience when necessary, but found them painful, awkward, and not giving a good shave. This one is easy, pleasant, and gives a very close, comfortable shave with very little effort. I&#x27;m hooked. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little heavy, which gives it a sure feel in the hand but makes it a little less appealing to pack for long trips involving lots of pack-lugging.</li>
    <li> I have owned a eight year old Hitache shaver, although the unit is still working, I wanted to try something which will not leave the longer hairs untoughed. This braun shaver does exactly as I expected. It  charges fast (1 hour vs 16 hours), it give my skin a smooth feeling, and it is still going strong after 8 days use. Best of all, it only cost me mere1/3 of a new one. I could hardly see a sign of being used previouly, and I don&#x27;t miss the cleaning/charging unit. I highly recommended this shaver to anyone looking for a great shaver and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months use, the unit is still going strong. What amazes me is that each charge gives me exactly one month.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 7526 Factory Recon.  It gives a great shave like all of the braun shavers I have had over the past 25 years.  One problem is that it came with the on off switch malfunctioning.  Perhaps it was checked quite carefully enough or it was damaged in shipping.  I am returning to get the same model.  I like the shave but can&#x27;t deal with the shaver going off if I don&#x27;t hold the face firmly in place while shaving.</li>
    <li> I had a little concern about getting a reconditioned razor, but that concern was really unfounded.  The razor looked brand new out of the box.  I tried to detect some evidence that the razor might have been used, but could find none.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in maybe 10 years.  I was pleasently surprised that the shave was as close as it was.  It is a different kind of shave from a blade, but very close none the less.  I guess after shaving with a blade for so long that I have gotten a &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; and I know what areas need special attention.  I need a little more practice with the Braun to get it down.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I got one for my dad as a father&#x27;s day present.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors since 1985 and this is the best one yet. Quite, smooth, close cut the trimer works great. I purchased this one because of the good reviews and the price and im satisfied with my purchase. If you need a razor get this one it comes like new with instructions, razor, cleaning brush and charger. I came across this review i made some months ago. I must say the braun is everything i hoped and more in a razor. Still performs great with a smooth cut. The only thing i noticed is that the head needs to be emptied after 3 shaves in my case or shaved wiskers will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 09/29/2012  I have used this reconditioned braun shaver since June 2003 and its just now needing replacing due to the latch holding the foil head is not working properly. The shaver still runs great and charges fine.  Amazing product and the best Electric shaver I have ever used.  I would buy the same model if I could but it looks like i will have to go with a new braun shaver, just which one.</li>
    <li> This truly is a fabulous razor.  I have been shaving with a mid-level Remington wet/dry razor for about the past six years now.  I went thru multiple screens/blades with it and it has finally given up on me.  All in all it was just a fair razor--noisy, charge lasted a mediocre amount of time, but decent shave for not a lot of money.  I switched to a Gillette Sensor blade while shopping for a new razor, which ate up my face incredibly bad.  I had razor burn for weeks.  After lots of shopping around I decided on the Braun 7526.  I really wanted the new one with the clean/charge base, but couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of paying all that money.  So I went with a refurb and it has been a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks of use the razor is still on its first charge.  It is quiet, cuts smoothly and efficiently, and best of all does not eat up my face.  The shave I get with it is perhaps not as close as a blade, but it is 95% there without giving any razor burn.  My refurb model came in a plain box but looks brand new--no scratches or dents, and was well oiled.  I&#x27;m sad about not getting the clean/charge base but considering I only paid a sixth of the retail price (the refurb models go on sale and I caught this one at a quarter of a Franklin), I can&#x27;t complain a bit.  &lt;br /&gt;I would definetly recommend this to anyone looking for a good electric razor.  So far my only complaints are that it&#x27;s bulkier than my old Remington, and you cannot rince it under the faucet to clean it out.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought my Braun 7526. &lt;BR&gt;Since I don&#x27;t need the self-cleaning accessory, I &lt;BR&gt;figured how could I go wrong for [the price]been using my 15 year old Braun corded shaver, &lt;BR&gt;since I had found no other electric shavers that come &lt;BR&gt;anywhere near it&#x27;s performance. &lt;br /&gt;Well, now I have a terrific cordless electric shaver &lt;BR&gt;that shaves close and comfortable. I am *very* happy &lt;BR&gt;with the Braun 7526.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and was never able to get a close shave without some type of pain. Now, with my Braun syncro shaver, it is painless and oh so close! MY wife loves how soft my face feels! Mine was a reconditioned one and it worked great. Still works like new and I have had it for about 4 months now. I did get the cleaning base--you really don&#x27;t need it but it comes in handy when it is cleaning time.&lt;br /&gt;The four way pivot is great to get those tough spots under my chin. Cleaning is a snap and charging takes no time at all. A great buy, especially when it is on sale for $40!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Remington user for many years.  However, after burning out the circuit boards on the last 2 well-maintained shavers, I don&#x27;t have any interest in buying another Remington.  Yesterday my Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver arrived in a slightly smashed box.  I&#x27;ve never used a Braun shaver before, but after using it for one day, I can say that I made a good choice.  Close shave!  The only downside is that the razor is extremely loud.  I called Braun and after running the razor for the woman on the other end, she believes that the product may have sustained damage during shipping.  I contact Amazon and within minutes I was notified via Email that a replacement product would be shipped within 2 days at their expense.  I have to admit that I am impressed with Amazon&#x27;s return policy. Other than the problem with the noise, I have only high praises for this factory reconditioned razor.  I see no reason not to get it.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product today, and would just like to say this was a great deal. It waorks better than my regular razor and is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Braun has made a very nice and balanced product.  &lt;BR&gt;I bought the complete system with the charging/cleaning/air dry/sterilizing base.  As with any electric razor it does not cut as well after the first 20 cuts.  &lt;BR&gt;So when they tell you the blade last 18 months it only cuts as well as a new blade for about 3 months.&lt;BR&gt;Replacement blades are around $25.</li>
    <li> I had my prior Braun 5150 foil shaver for 6 years and three foils. It was a terrific razor, and I was sad to say goodbye. I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg - and this reconditioned model was a great opportunity to get a top of the line razor at a low price. &lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed - and fully agree with most of the reviews. It came clean and new in a perfect box. It came charged - and I literally used it every day for 2 months before it needed a recharge. That&#x27;s incredible - and blows away my old 5150. Secondly - closer shave than the 5150 and the foil gets the neck a little better but you still need the trimmers to finish off the neck. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you like foil shavers and the reasonable price. I don&#x27;t think the cleaning is such a big deal that you need the base - but that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
    <li> The product is not as described, DOES NOT come with charger nor cleaner refil.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I also received the unit without the charging/self cleaning stand and no cartridge. The ad clearly states this is a self cleaning shaver with a cleaning cartridge provided.  It&#x27;s not self cleaning without the stand.  Where is the cartridge (also not sent), supposed to go-without the stand?   Amazon sent me a second shipment, and it too was missing the same items.  There is clearly a communication problem between amazon advertising and amazon shipping.  My one star is based on the fact that I did not receive a complete shipment, and can&#x27;t use the item. My first bad experience with amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent Cheap Razor! Nice close shaves and no more sore red skin. There are some complaints that the razor did not come with the self-cleaning base. There is no real need for it. Anyway you want the self-cleaning base- buy the complete system. Withstanding this a still a first rate razor. It made a great gift. With all honestly, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have shaved for over 40 years. During this time I have used many electric shavers including remmington, norelco, and now Braun. I really liked my remmington, which died afted 5 years. I have had three norelcos, all of which worked well. Having never tried a braun I purchased a braun travel #370 on sale at a local store for $10.00. I was quite surprised. It provided the closest shave I have ever had other than a atra blade, but with out the irratated skin. The down side was that it isn&#x27;t rechargeable. I then purchased a reconditioned 7526 for $39.00. It arrived well package. It looked brand new except for a small sticker stateing it was reconditioned. I have now used tis razor for 6 months with no problems. I some times shaver twice a day and the top of my head. The pop up trimmer is far superior to the norelco and in my case a much the razor provides closer shave equaling my old blades. At $39.00 it has already paid for itself. I have considered ordering the self cleaning base (on line for $40.00) but think that it is not needed. I wash the 7526 under hot water once aweek and it needs chargeing for about one hour every 2.5 weeks. The 7526 in my opinon is a excellent value at $39.00. I peronally would find it hard to pay the regular price for this or any other electric shaver. All in all I have to say that I am more than satisfied with the 7526.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for 3 days, but so far it has been an excellent shaver.  Very close, comfortable, and fast.  The reconditioned unit was in like new condition.  Very quiet.  I used to use a Remington Microscreen and was happy with it until the batteries died.  However, new Remingtons are no longer made in the US and seem to be of lower quality.  The 7526 Syncro is a major improvement.  Definitely closer and catches stubble the Remington used to miss.  Couldn&#x27;t justify the extra cost to buy a new razor with the cleaning system when this was readily available.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver and really like. It meets my needs perfectly. The battery lasts for almost 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I got the Refurb Braun 7526 about 2 weeks ago. My 1st shave was a bit irritating but all other shaves after felt great. I never saw any scratches of defects on this shaver, it&#x27;s in perfect working condition. One charge lasts a really long time. I usually don&#x27;t shave every day, and this shaver is able to cut through 3 or 4 days of beard with no problem. It however like all other foil shavers cannot shave under my neck cleanly, I still have to use a razor under my neck. I have found this to be the case of all foil shavers. This shaver is a great deal for the performance. $50 well spent. I hope braun makes a water proof version of this shaver in the future, this shaver cannot be used with wet shaves. This shaver feels great in my hand, nice size and weight. Excellent 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d coasted along for a while on an old Norelco 3-wheel and a Panasonic 3-blade linear.  Used in combination, they were not too bad, I could look presentable if I needed too, though real smoothness eluded me, particularly on the neck.  But very unsatisfying...made me less interested in shaving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got the Braun 7526...and damn, what a difference.  The thing is incredible.  Even without the \\&quot;lectric shave\\&quot; stuff I&#x27;ve heard helps, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric.  I can actually get smooth even on the neck, and better yet - it&#x27;s not irritating at all!  It is the Dyson of shavers...if you&#x27;re used to old crap, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had my last Braun shaver for over 10 years, so instead of purchasing a new foil and cutter this time, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I really wanted to get the best possible shaver for my money, so when I saw this shaver for such an unbeatable price, I decided to take a chance on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed!  The shaver charges quickly, in less than an hour and lasts well over a week on a single charge.  I have a rather thick and coarse beard, but having used a Braun shaver for the last 10 or so years, I was familiar with how to handle it.  Compared to my last shaver, however, this shaver glides effortlessly across my face.  It never pulls, and I have had zero irritation.  I have always had to shave at least once a day, and a shave from this shaver lasts at least 24 hours for me.  Even on days (such as weekends) where I have not shaved on consecutive days, I seem to get an even better and closer shave when the hair is longer -- with 2 days of growth!  Again, even after two days, it doesn&#x27;t pull or cause any irritation.  I can definitely tell that the foil is thinner than in days&#x27; past, but I believe this is what contributes to the exceptional shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is quiet -- the vibration is pitched much higher than my older shaver, and as it cuts the hairs, it makes a higher-pitched \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; (?) sound -- which means the blade is definitely oscillating quicker than my older shaver.  It definitely cuts more, and I don&#x27;t have to pass over my face many times, although the problem spots on my neck and under my chin always requires additional care.  It takes me anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes to shave with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat I have: I don&#x27;t like how the foil assembly/cover removes from the razor.  I do it very gently, but it always seems to stick, and I&#x27;m always afraid that I might pull it off and damage the foil.  I&#x27;ve learned to take my time when removing the foil to clean the shaver, but don&#x27;t try to quickly remove the foil or you&#x27;ll undoubtedly damage the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent buy.  I could not tell it was a refurbished unit.  And since I wasn&#x27;t interested in the self-cleaning base (which adds to overall longterm cost), this was perfect for me.  I got a high-priced shaver for a bargain -- and it works great!ve the foil or you&#x27;ll undoubtedly damage the foil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent buy.  I could not tell it was a refurbished unit.  And since I wasn&#x27;t interested in the self-cleaning base (which adds to overall longterm cost), this was perfect for me.  I got a high-priced shaver for a bargain -- and it works great!</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a four year old Braun.  What a differance the new one makes!  The cutter blades are moving much faster than the old model shavers.  Shaving time is about half from my old one. This model shaves as close as a razor.  Battery life is outstanding.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver. I&#x27;ve still never found an electric that&#x27;s as good as a blade, but I find using a blade daily irritates my skin. For the price and everything I&#x27;m satisfied. Anything for $50 is usually going to be a piece of junk, and this is a quality item though. It&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> My older (series 6000 Flex) Braun developed hole in the screen. This was normal after about 2 years of use, so I pulled a spare one from the drawer and installed it. This was a last one from my collection and I needed to buy a couple of new ones (I always keep spare one on hand, electric shaver users know how painful is not to have one for more than one shaving). So I went on Internet to find them, but incidentally Google gave me also a list of Braun shavers instead of screens only and led me to Amazon stores. I found factory reconditioned Braun 7526.  The shaver arrived in few days (sooner than promissed). It looked like it was never in use. There must be some other reason to classify them as factory rebuilt - possibly the fact, that it is sold without the cleaning device. Actually I never liked the idea of washing the shaver and buying repeatedly special washing fluids. The bottom line: I am 65 and use electric shavers starting from my twenties. These times I consider Braun brand to be the best in the world. Thanks to this incredible deal from Amazon, for a price slightly higher than two spare screens, I can use the best shaver from Braun line and keep my old Braun Flex as a spare one. One more thing - this is not just a new shaver. The faster motor and a new cutting block, also a new pattern of screen holes, makes shaving a whole new and more enjoyable experience.  &lt;br /&gt;Z.

    <li> Having used Braun electric shavers for more than 20 years, I purchased the Braun 7526 a month ago and I find it the best shaver I have ever used or seen.  It is light, easy to handle, and seldom needs charging. Also it gives the closest shave of any shaver I have ever used, and I have used many, even better than the old steel blade razor without the bother of using shaving soap.  Providing both pivoting and fixed positions of the head ensures that every corner of the beard is reached easily and effectively.  &lt;br /&gt;I give the highest praise to this model because it is the most efficient shaver I have ever used, is well worth the price, and I cannot tell the difference from a brand new model.</li>
    <li> I think this a marvelous shaver. I love everything about it. Easy to use, easy to clean, and great on the skin. The only thing about my unit is that after 5 shaves, its off to the charger.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My previous electric shaver would go 2 weeks before i had to charge it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great value.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 7526 to replace my Panasonic shaver.  Overall, I don&#x27;t like it as much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1)  Shaves closely &lt;br /&gt;2)  Charge lasts a long time &lt;br /&gt;3)  Has a LED that indicates the charge is almost gone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Takes a long time to shave (longer than any other electric shaver I have used) &lt;br /&gt;2) No charging stand &lt;br /&gt;3) Shavings are not collected in the shaver head and fall out (meaning you basically have to shave over the sink) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and have to agree.  I used a rechargeble Norelco for years and got tired of 3 heads and never as close as a blade shave.  This Braun is almost as close as a blade.  I considered the one with the wash basin but cleaning this myself is worth the $50+ bucks in savings.  Thanks for those of you who took time to write a review.  P.S.  You can take the refurb sticker off if it bothers you.  I like having a closer shave for $50 bucks and pitching my Norelco 3-head shaver.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced electric shaver user having owned 4 or 5 Brauns.  My last one I left in a hotel room so i was forced to look for a new one.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 but also didn&#x27;t want to buy the cheapest shaver out there.  I have done that before and there is a difference between the entry level and top of the line.  When I saw this premium Braun for $50 I had to try it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though my unit said factory reconditioned it looked like new.  As the other reviewers have stated the motor is very powerful yet quieter than any shaver I have ever used.  It holds a charge for a long time and there is no signifigant slowdown in motor speed until the red charge light comes on.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While this shaver does a good overall job it wil never cut as close as a blade.  That is just the nature of electrics.  The speed, convenience, and safety outweigh the slightly infereor shave quality.  I have never used an electric that did a great job on my neck.  I use my Mach 3for touch ups.  I recommend using a pre-electric lotion -- Afta or Lectric Shave are good.  I bought a can of Remington Shaver Saver (also available from Amazon) to clean the shaver head and cutter block every few weeks.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as replacment for previous Remington Foil Shaver and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  VERY close shave.  This is first electric I have been able to use prior to meetings and not be worried about stubble.  I have experienced very long battery life thus far.  2 weeks of shaving almost every day.  Overall very happy with the value for this refurb unit.</li>
    <li> Although everything about this product clearly states that it is a \\&quot;Smart Logic Shaver,\\&quot; that is not what you will receive.  What you will get is a Braun 7505 with an extra LED, low battery to be exact.  But no where on the box, or in the user guide does it say anything about \\&quot;Smart Logic.\\&quot;  So despite the fact this is supposedly a great shave, this one is going back because I did not receive what I was sold.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7526 works great. There is no skin irrations in the &lt;br /&gt;neck area under the chin which I was getting with another Brand &lt;br /&gt;shaver. The reconditioned 7526 shaver looks and works like new.</li>
    <li> When looking for a replacement cutter block for my Braun Flex Integral I saw the \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; Syncro 7526. Since the batteries in my Flex were starting to go, it seemed like a good deal on a new shaver. I prefer foil shavers and have owned three Braun shavers over the years.  Each one seems to get better.  So far I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about the Syncro 7526.  It gives a close, comfortable shave and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a foil shaver. The \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; Syncro 7526 does NOT include the clean/charge stand.  It comes in a plain cardboard box with the power cord, cleaning brush, and a soft carry case.</li>
    <li> I am using this shaver and this thing gives me a smooth shave. Better than the Panasonic shaver that I current own at 1/4 of the cost. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver yesterday. Received confirmation today that it shipped already. Thats good. I&#x27;m sure that I will enjoyed the shaver, but today you have lowered the price by five dollars. I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a factory reconditioned 5000 series Braun for over 4 years now and it still works.  I have replaced the foil about once a year or so--crucial to maintain a good shave.  But I thought I&#x27;d checlk out the new technology.  So I tried the Norelco James Bond.  It shaved me no better than my old Braun.  When I saw this newer Braun with a faster motor on sale, I bought it.  It is the best shaver I have ever used.  It gives me a really close shave and blows the Norelco away.  And to hell with the self cleaning unit--a waste of money for most of us (and an ongoing expense, too).  Just make sure to regularly (I do it during my shave) shake or tap the hair out from under the foil and periodically use the cleaning brush.  If you want, you can rinse the cutters in alcohol or water to clean them now and them, but anything the self cleaner does you can do yourself.  Get this razor!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver alot. I have not experienced any problems and it has been about 8 months already. I get a very close shave, the clipper part out it is not the sharpest, but the shaver itself is very sharp and smooth. &lt;BR&gt;I found out the place to get the charge stand. link should be : [...]&lt;br /&gt;If that link changes because the move the product around just go to: [...]&lt;br /&gt;I believe the stand will make a great difference because it will extend the life of your blade.</li>
    <li> Prior to buying the Braun 7526, I was using Norelco electric shavers, two of which broke due to poor quality control at the factory. It was time to get a new one, but I almost fell off my chair when I saw how expensive some of the models were. I just wanted a good electric shaver, not morgage the house. :) I saw the Braun on sale here on Amazon, and decided to switch from the rotary style to the linear cutting blade system.&lt;br /&gt;When the Braun shaver arrived, it was packaged in a nice box. In the box were the shaver, a cleaning brush, the battery charging cord and a carrying bag for the unit. The Braun 7526 is a nice hefty unit that feels balanced in the hand. Before using the shaver, it must be charged to full capacity and then run all the way down to condition the battery. Some reports of the battery running down may be due to user error in not following the directions on how to set up the shaver. If the battery is not conditioned correctly, it may shorten or disable the full charge capabilities of the Braun. The directions are very clear about this aspect of conditioning the battery. But then again, who reads the manuals anyway?&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a nice high tech look to it and shaves very close. Closer than any of my Norelcos ever did. There is a slight hum when you turn on the unit, but nothing objectionable unless you plan to shave in the library.:) The blades do a really good job of cutting away facial hair and you can actually hear the shafts of hair being cut. The shaver needs to be used so that the hair is directly in the path of the shaver. If you shave in a diagonal angle, some hairs slip past. This was not a problem as I adapted to the style pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There has been a few comments regarding the lack of the cleaner/charging base being left out of the package, but I see this as not a problem. The shaver heads are fully accessible by popping them right off. You get to all the debris by using the brush that is supplied with the kit. The heads can be rotated around so that you can get at all the spaces between the blades. Considering that the cleaning cartridges are so expensive and will cost you more than the shaver over the long run, the brush is not such a bad alternative to cleaning the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kept the Braun from scoring a perfect 5 was the lack of an LCD bar read out for how much power is left. The unit does alert you to when it needs charging, but the addition of the graphic power meter would have been great. However, since this unit is so inexpensive to begin with, it is still a great bargin. The comments about the very close shave you get with the Braun are not overstated. One of my friends mentioned to me that she could tell that I was using a better shaver because my face was so smooth. Before, she could always feel a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye Norelco.

Hello Braun.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;d been using an old low-end Remmington that was so lame I actually had to go over my face with a blade if I wanted to look sharp. That said, almost anything would have been an improvement---but this shaver works better than I ever thought an electric could. Factor in the price of this refurbished model, as opposed to what you&#x27;d pay for a brand-new one, and you&#x27;ll feel like a genius if you buy one of these.  The one I bought had no scratches, no leftover stubble from the previous owner, absolutely no indication it had ever actually been used. For this price, I really doubt you could do better.</li>
    <li> I had long wanted a Braun 7xxx Syncro Shaver but felt the price for a new shaver was too much.  When I saw a reconditioned 7526 on sale at Amazon I went for it.  Excellent shaver.  It is in excellent condition and I would not suspect it had ever been used if not for the FACTORY RECONDITIONED sticker on it.  It worked flawlessly and gives a very good, close and quick shave.  The battery lasts a long time and kept the charge with no problem.  The neckline is difficult to shave closely but that is true of every shaver I have used.  It does better than many other shavers on the neck.  Nothing shaves as close as a blade but the Braun Syncro does well.  Better than any other shaver.  I am happry with this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a factory refurbished and surgically sterilized Braun 7526 available for less than 1/2 of its list price. It is a great razor, though as shipped in this deal it does not include the cleaning apparatus, though this and the required cleaning solution can be ordered separately.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun in 20years. It is so quiet that I can watch TV while shaving without turning up the volume and others near me are not bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous shaver was a Panasonic Wet Shaver. Had Norelco triple header and prior Braun high ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver gives the BEST shave I have ever had...blades included! I have had none of the problems in other reviews like bad batteries.  It comes with a simple soft bag and cleaning brush.  Fits easily in creavices in luggage when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reconditioned unit looks and runs like it is brand new...only the shipping box looks like it is a reconditioned unit...and that is a new box but with no graphics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it...you&#x27;ll be happy you did!!</li>
    <li> The Braun Syncro factory service unit has turned out to be a great investment.  I&#x27;ve been gun-shy about electric shavers for the past several years, because the Norelco &amp; Remington shavers I owned in the past left me bleeding and with ingrown hairs that got infected.  Overall, electric shaving just wasn&#x27;t worth it, especially since the Norelco &amp; Remington just didn&#x27;t shave very close -- not to mention the discomfort they caused. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I took a risk on this Braun shaver mostly because I was desperate to save time shaving.  My face is not friendly to shaving in general, thus it is a fairly painful and very time-intensive process to shave my beard manually.  Long story short, it was worth the $49 cost to take a chance on another electric unit compared to the time I was investing in manual shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Braun has really changed my tune about electric shavers.  While no electric shaver will probably ever match the closeness of a twin/triple/quadruple razor blade, this shaver does shave very close (truly smooth skin), and yet it has never cut my face even once during the first few months of use.  While it occasionally leaves a few whiskers behind, they rarely become ingrown and have never become infected like they did with my prior electric shavers.  The Braun shaver is effective enough that I can dance cheek to cheek with my 18 month old daughter and not worry about rubbing any \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; up against her face.  And the battery charge lasts for at least a dozen thorough uses, and generally more like 20 to 25 average uses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the 4-way shaver head pivots and moves side-to-side to match the contours of my face.  I also like the fact that I can lock the head at a specific pivot angle if desired.  Regardless of whether the lock is enabled, I&#x27;ve found I can move the shaver along my skin in any direction comfortably -- either with the grain or against it. The unit cleans easily, and the construction seems very solid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If I had known how excellent this shaver is, I would&#x27;ve been willing to plunk down the full price for it -- however I&#x27;m glad my skepticism about electric shavers drove me toward the refurbished unit, because I got a very good shaver for less than $50.  As far as I know, the warranty is the same as a brand new unit, but the initial cost of the unit is slashed by about 50%. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So the question is, is the Braun brand really that much better than Norelco/Remington, or have I just been out of the electric shaver market for enough years that technology has advanced in general?  I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, but I can tell you that if you are skeptical about electric shavers from past experience, you will be glad you took the risk on this Braun, just like I did.  It provides a very good, pain-free, quick shave for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It is true that it takes your face a while to adjust to this shaver, so give it a good two weeks before you form your final judgements.  But I cannot say I am completely satisfied.  I get a nice close shave, closer than what I expect from a typical electric--but it always leaves little areas unshaved, and I often find myself going over the same spot repeatedly.  I have to use a disposable razor now AFTER shaving with this shaver, just to make sure I catch all the problem spots.  That shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;ve noticed that shavings leak out of the shaver-head while I&#x27;m still shaving, so it&#x27;s basically impossible for me to shave anywhere except over a sink.  This defect seriously limits the usefulness of a cordless shaver.</li>
    <li> My old Braun 4501 had tired batteries and also would have needed a new blade&amp;screen; so I decided to replace it with a new model Braun. I am extremely happy with my choice to buy the 7526 ! It shaves very close and clean, and is absolutely non-irritating to the skin. My unit looked like a new one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to be shipped by standard shipping ...you said you could not ship UPS to a PO box,,,,but that is what you have done..SO...HOW DO I GET THE ITEM AS UPS WILL NOT DELIVER TO A PO BOX??????</li>
    <li> I received my Braun 7526 sooner than the date that it was promised and it looked like it was brand new. The sideburn trimer is excellent. The shaver works great but I think I have an easier time shaving with a Norelco rotary.</li>
    <li> Well, I read each and every review (good and bad) before I ordered this shaver. I can honestly say it&#x27;s working every bit as well as I would have hoped from a new Braun product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cutting block and screen appeared to be new. It was blemish-free. It shaves quite closely, and the battery has been going strong since the day I charged it, nearly two weeks ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My experience has been great. I admit I had some trepidation about the possibility of blood-borne disease on the blades. But as any doctor or nurse can tell you, HIV (likely the worst-case scenario) is a very fragile virus and doesn&#x27;t survive long outside the body. Having said that, I would say (to Braun) that it would be nice if they explicitly stated whether or not the cutting block and/or screen is new or refurbished.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Brought two of these factory reconditioned razors, one for myself and one for my father.  We both have found them to be far superior to other electrics we&#x27;ve used in the past (Remington, Norelco, Sunbeam).  Delivered in plain box but in as-new condition.  It doesn&#x27;t come with the cleaner base, but how hard is it to pop a screen off and brush it out?  Not very. A hundred dollars hard? - I don&#x27;t think so.  Great shave at a great price.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a Remington rotary electric shaver to the Braun shaver after reading the positive reviews on foil shavers with Braun being a top quality brand.  After having the shaver for a month, it was a great deal you should not pass up: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Great price, very close shave, nice trimmer, long battery life and the razor can be used with or without the cord. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Loud shaver and does leave a lot of cut hairs on the sink or surface you shave over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this shaver and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shaver!  For just a few dollars over what he would have had to spend getting his old shaver&#x27;s blades sharpened, he was able to get this one.  Not a complaint, just smiles!</li>
    <li> I like the design and feel of the shaver.  It has an incredibly long charge time.  I have used it for 3 weeks every day and it still has a charge to the point where I haven&#x27;t been warned that it needs charging.  It does a good job shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of it is very easy.  All you have to do is partially open the top of it, turn it upside down and turn it on.  It then shakes out the debris on its own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I have a bread, and just use it to clean up my cheeks and neck, so it really saves time over using a razor.  My brother has the same model, so i can use his cleaning dock. It really clean the shaver well. I wold probalby recomend getting one with the cleaning dock if you dont have access to one</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 7526 Syncro nearly two years ago after years of shaving with a Gillette Sensor and similar hand-held razors. I figured I would give the reconditioned Braun a try. The results have been amazing. The unit is easy to clean, easier to charge and, most importantly, provides a remarkably close shave for an electric razor. This product is a definite value given its current price.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this because of the thought of using someone else&#x27;s razor, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  Even though it&#x27;s marked \\&quot;Factory Serviced Unit\\&quot; with a small sticker, it was hard to tell that the razor was anything but brand new.  It was perfectly clean and flawless.  I bought this one as a second razor for my beach house, and I would be hard pressed to tell it apart from my primary Braun 7526 that I bought new -- but this one was half the price.  This one doesn&#x27;t come with the self-cleaning unit, but that&#x27;s more of a gimmick anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these a few months ago and have been completely satisfied.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, shaver performance is very subjective: those who love rotary head shavers often hate foil heads and vice-versa; some think there&#x27;s nothing like a blade for a good shave, while others find a blade irritating beyond endurance.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have been a satisfied user of foil-type electric shavers for years (yes, I&#x27;ve tried other types also).  I&#x27;ve found that Braun shavers give me a good shave and are well-made, dependable units.  This 7526 unit is no exception.  It gives me the closest shave, without irritation, of any shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s quiet (for an electric shaver), and goes for weeks on a single charge.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One particularly nice thing is that this shaver uses an NimH battery, which is not only environmentally friedlier than the older NiCad type, but also should last a lot longer.  (NiCad batteries lose their ability to accept a full charge over time, especially if charged before they are completely discharged.  Eventually they won&#x27;t charge at all.  Experience with NiMH batteries has shown that they last a *lot* longer and can be charged pretty much whenever you want with no ill effects.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition, the egonomics of the shaver are excellent -- it&#x27;s well-balanced and comfortable in the hand, and it&#x27;s easy to see what you are doing even while shaving tricky areas.  The off-on switch is designed very well, has very positive action, and should last longer than the design used on earlier Braun shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would be happy with the 7526 at full price.  At this price for a refurbished unit -- and I couldn&#x27;t see any sign of previous use at all -- it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these, one for car and the other for home. They are awesome! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Lasted a very long time, and is only now running out of juice...&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the battery has had it&#x27;s fill of recharges, but have been very impressed with it&#x27;s longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy another if available.</li>
    <li> Just got my 7526 electric shaver (sans cleaning/charging unit) in the mail today. I have been using a Braun 5614 electric shaver for the past year or so, and have not been impressed by its performance. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this model was going to be much better, but it has gotten such good reviews that I thought it worth a try. Much to my surprise, the 7526 is a MUCH better shaver. First of all, it is much quieter than my old unit. But the best part is that it actually shaves quite a bit closer with a lot fewer strokes. This shaver is definitely all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. I would definitely recommend the Braun 7526 to anyone looking to get a good shave with an electric shaver. I may even splurge to purchase the charger/cleaning unit to make sure the shaver is always in peak condition</li>
    <li> I bought a reconditioned Braun 7526 almost two years ago to replace a Braun 5145.  I was a bit hesitant to get the reconditioned unit.  I had had a bad experience with the 5145.  The battery needed to be replaced shortly before the warranty ran out.  Then the motor failed just after the warranty period ended.  But I love the shave that I get from Braun razors and the price of this reconditioned unit was too good to pass up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now two years later, the 7526 is still a great performer for me.  I get a good, close shave.  The battery holds a charge for almost two weeks and I have had no problems at all with the motor.  I have been so satisfied that I bought one for my Dad who is very pleased as well.  I need to replace the cutter block which has lost a couple of blades, but I expect with any electric razor that periodic maintenance will be required.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s page for this item does not indicate that the refurbed units do not come with the cleaning base.  To make matters worse, the review of the item talks about the cleaning base, which lead me to believe that it came with the unit...  I have not as yet tried the razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this same shaver from Amazon last month (a refurb model). It arrived in great shape, and it works as expected.  But after giving myself plenty of time to adjust to my first electric razor, I can tell you confidently that it is NOT blade-close.  I doubt any electric is, really.  I have to shave twice a day with this thing if I&#x27;m going out in the evening.  Not so with my old 50-cent disposable twin blade.  Even right after shaving I can&#x27;t get my lower jaw or neck as smooth as a twin blade could.  And how&#x27;s this - it takes LONGER to shave in the morning than it used to!&lt;br /&gt;So why am I still using it?  Good question.  Maybe I&#x27;ll post mine for sale.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these brand new, used it for 2 months, then it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it.  Smart battery technology, huh?</li>
    <li> It works great. &lt;BR&gt;It is so powerful, while working on my copper wire facial hair, it sounds like a key grinder at a hardware store.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve had 6 or 7 electrics in the last 10 years, and this is the first one I have used that I did not have to follow up with a disposable blade.</li>
    <li> I used to own a Syncro 7570 which was top of the line when I bought  it.  I was extremely happy with it and can honestly say it was the best reazor I ever owned.  Sadly I left it behind by mistake on a vacation.  So, I took the cheap route and bought a refurbished 7625 to replace it.  I assumed it was basically the same razor without the LCD display but was sadly disappionted.  It is far louder, much more rough against the skin, vibrates radically and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  I really miss my 7570!</li>
    <li> After reading the 9 January review, I called Amazon and said I would keep both shavers if I received the same 20% discount for the hastle.  They readily agreed. It seemed a positive solution by Amazon, and I am satisfied. Though I didn&#x27;t need two shavers, since the cutter heads and foil cost $25, I have a spare shaver for a few dollars more. I have previously used a new Braun 7526, and was very satisfied (thus my 5 stars).  I can order the base from the Braun sales outlet for $39.95. I&#x27;m sure that the error was unintentional.  The Ad writer just wasn&#x27;t familiar with this unique type product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this reconditioned shaver several weeks ago and figured that it would take me a few weeks to get acclimated to using an elecric shaver instead of the Gillette Mach 3 razor that I have been using. The shaver is great except, for me, it did not shave my neck thoroughly. I finally called Braun and they could not have been any more pro-active. They sent me a brand new cutter block/foil at no charge and it arrived in 3 days. I now get a very close shave and am very happy with my purchase. If you find any minor problems with your shaver, I suggest that you call Braun customer service as they seem eager to make sure that you are happy with their products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun 7526 reconditioned shaver and followed the directions exactly. (ie. charging for 4 hours intially, etc.)  When I shaved with it for the first time (I have always used blades and hated electric shavers but due to being placed on the drug Coumadin I had no choice), I was amazed!  The shave was better than a blade!  I could not believe it.  Five stars - right?  Well, no.  The razor, supposedly reconditioned can not hold a charge and now I must go through Braun to get it, well, &amp;quot;re-reconditioned&amp;quot;.  Purchasers should also be aware that it does not come with the &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; base.  This cost another 39.99 from theessentials.com yet still well worth it.  Those who complain about the cost of replacement cartridges should consider how much the pay for razor blades over the course of a year.  (For me Mach 3 Turbo and they are quite pricey!)  Had it not been for the charging problem and inconvience, I would give this a huge 5 stars.  Best shave ever.</li>
    <li> After reading a number of reviews, I decided to give this shaver a try.  I use an electric shaver as a touch-up for evenings out when I don&#x27;t want to show the 5:00 shadow but don&#x27;t want to pull out the razor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower -- and frankly, nothing is better.  I tried to go all electric when this unit arrived -- but I just can&#x27;t get the shave I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m sure I did not give my face enough time to adjust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the pivot head -- but it&#x27;s great.  All in all, this is an excellent shaver for my use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, it goes without saying -- Amazon is a delight to do business with.</li>
    <li> I purchased a reconditioned Braun 7526 shaver and am glad I did. You can&#x27;t beat the price. It looks as good as new and gives a really good shave. It shaves better than an older Braun shaver that I was using.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a travel shaver.  Since I am on the road about 35% of the time, it gets a lot of use.  I have found this reconditioned unit to work extremely well, meeting all my shaving needs while on the road.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for a couple of years, and the battery recently stopped holding a full charge. So, I thought I&#x27;d give this Braun 7526 a chance; certainly, the reasonable cost of a re-conditioned unit and the good reviews listed on this site were major factors in the decision.When I first shaved with it, the shaves had poor results...lots of beard left on my neck and in the mustache area and many repetitions to get it sort of cleaned up. I figured I&#x27;d give it some time and took it on a two month trip...the bad  part of the decision being that I left my Norelco at home. For the whole two months, the shaves were the same...very poor relative to the easy and quick ones I was used to with my old Norelco. So, I&#x27;m now back in the Norelco family with a new 9160 XL and the shaves are even better than with the old one. The Braun was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I have owned many models of razors and this one just did not cut well enough.  It seemed like I had to go over and over my face to get the close shave I wanted.  Product reliability was very good, but the closeness was poor.</li>
    <li> The Best electrical shaver I have ever tried. It has a very good shape for holding, and it&#x27;s battery capacity is pretty high so you don&#x27;t need to recharge the unit very often. You will definitely like it.</li>
    <li> This razor looks and performs as new. This may be the closest and easiest shave that I have ever been able to accomplish. For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this razor.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; tag this thing came with, but when it got here it looks brand new, there was no way to tell this thing was reconditioned.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get close shave with it every time and the best part is that I get no razor burn! My neck is very sensative and with every shaver in the past, I have gotten razor burn; but not with this Braun! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the money its the best deal out there, definetly recomended.</li>
    <li> Product as described, good as new, very close shave. Switched from Panasonic linear and equal in speed and quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 7526 Reconditioned shaver about 3 weeks ago based on the positive reviews I had read on Amazon&#x27;s web site. This is the third electric shaver I have owned and by far the best so far.  It worked right out of the box and after charging the battery for the 4 hours indicated on the instructions. Even though all of the things I read on this razor indicated it would get about 50 minutes per charge, I have actually ended up getting about 75 to 80 minutes beginning with the first week I had it. I am bald and therefore have to shave both my face and head. It am getting a much closer shave that lasts much longer throughout the day than with my previous electric razor.  My co-workers and friends can hardly believe I am getting such a close shave on my head with an electric razor. I am completely satisfied with this product and for the money, it cannot be beat.  I shopped around the area at every store that sells electric razors looking at all makes and models and this is by far the best deal out there.</li>
    <li> This shaver does well on the checks and the face, give a smooth finish, but it does not give a clean shave under the chin ( on your throat). I dont know about others but my growth is quick and thick, but at this price it was a decent buy</li>
    <li> The reconditioned razor I got looks like new, shaves great. Compare the price to a new Braun at your local megamart, &amp; you&#x27;ll like this price. Holds its charge for weeks in my case, is light &amp; easy to use in the car or on the run. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I am a several year Remington user.  I was going to order a Remington MS3-2700 because I am using a 1700, and it has to be charged every 5 shaves (I have a heavy beard, and I like it close, so it takes me 15 minutes to shave), and the 1700 cannot be run on the cord with  the battery exhausted.  The 2700 can. I have the 3700, but it has turbo, which means the motor runs slower, but can be jumped faster, but the 1700 runs the right speed all the time.  I happened to see the Reconditioned Braun, and all the good comments, BUT I AM RETURNING IT... &lt;br /&gt; 1) It is just too heavy. &lt;br /&gt; 2) The switch that moves up the cutter is right where my     &lt;br /&gt;    thumb always is, and it slides when I don&#x27;t want it. &lt;br /&gt; 3) It is quiter than the Remington, but at first, it made a  &lt;br /&gt;    loud noise that I could not believe, then after a day, it &lt;br /&gt;    suddenly quieted.  Maybe the cutter was not seated, but after &lt;br /&gt;    it quieted down, it still vibrates my nose when I do my cheek &lt;br /&gt;    near my nose, and causes my sinuses to vibrate, though it &lt;br /&gt;    is slight, but uncomfortably. &lt;br /&gt; 4) It is harder to clean, and is not water proof like Remington. &lt;br /&gt; 5) Becasue it is reconditioned, the American Express Return  &lt;br /&gt;    protection that will take items back within 90 days  &lt;br /&gt;    excludes it, so I can&#x27;t take the risk (Gold and Blue cards, &lt;br /&gt;    and maybe others) &lt;br /&gt;You would think that something German would be engineered great, but I have had German cars, and that is bull.  And again now. &lt;br /&gt;It is quiet, and the battery might run long, and it might cut just a little closer, but I hate holding and handling it, so bye bye.  This thing also caused be to miss a $30 rebate on the Remington.  Boo, too.</li>
    <li> I found the Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver to be a really good bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> This is really a bad deal.  The 7526 was first made 8 years ago and has since been followed up with 2 more Braun model series (the 8000 and 5 series).  Price wise, this model is not much less than the subsequent models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this reconditioned model does NOT come with the cleaning/charging base.  On Amazon you can get this model WITH the charging base for about $1.11 more [[ASIN:B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]].  I think it&#x27;s quite clear that it would be foolish to buy this reconditioned model.</li>
    <li> Very good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I ever owned - still use it after all these years, and will use it as long as the parts are available!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of traveling and bring my Braun 7526 with me eveywhere.  In the course of my travels, I damaged my shaver and took it to a local, authorized repair shop to have it fixed.  I was going to have to spend $...(U.S.) for the repairs and then receive only a 30-day warranty (parts and labor).  I decided to buy a factory-reconditioned unit because the cost was the same and I was to receive a two-year warranty.  My \\&quot;new\\&quot; shaver arrived in mint condition and is quieter than my old one ever was.  This was one of the smartest purchases I have made.  Thanks to amazon.com and Braun for a great idea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wettie, but Amazon had this on sale for $ so I snapped it up. So did a friend. For that price it was a steal. As of this writing, Amzon has it for $. Still a deal... And I have to say, &#x27;it&#x27;s just a shaver&#x27;. Shaves fine, but nothing amazing or particularly special. It just shaves your growth away. One thing is that it is not so noisy and that is pleasant. Do an internet search and if you can&#x27;t get it for less than $, then buy it from Amazon...</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is right.  However, I wish the shaver would have come with the clean and charge base which is a ... option when ordered from Braun.  Although the shaver was reconditioned, it arrived looking factory fresh and new.</li>
    <li> When I came of shaving age in the 1970&#x27;s the available equipment was mostly cheap units, that tended to take a little skin with the hairs.  So, being that I had grown a beard and moustache, which I still have, I switched back to blades.  &lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this reconditioned shaver, and I have never yet bought a bad Braun product, so I figured, &amp;quot;What have I got to lose?&amp;quot;  Truly, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain.&lt;br /&gt;This unit was an amazement to me.  And it truly is the very first electric shaver that I can say did shave virtually as close as a blade.  The 4 way Lock &amp;amp; Swivel head allows the shaver to get hair that was unreachable by conventional shavers of the past.  And the clean, smooth, effortless way in which it removed the hair without even a pinch, no less a cut or nick, was especially rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;This rechargeable cordless unit, is so versatile and so effective that there truly is no way one can go wrong at this price.  I highly recommend the unit.</li>
    <li> I have been skeptical of electric shavers since I was young.  I was always told that they &amp;quot;chew your face up.&amp;quot;  At the same time, I also have very sensative skin so I usually cut myself with a blade (even with a Mach3).  I decided to try my brothers Norelco shaver just for a change.  It was nice, but didn&#x27;t cut very close.  I saw an ad for the Braun and I had seen all the commericals so I checked it out.  The price was outrageous, $200 for a shaver, wow!  But I saw an ad for one for only $40.  When I found out it was reconditioned, I had some serious doubts, but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It is great!!!  I use it daily.  I clean it with the provided brush once a week to save on the expensive cleaning packs.  I have never had a closer shave unless it was a blade, but without the cuts I usually received from a blade, no matter how careful I was.  This shaver is the best thing that I could&#x27;ve spent my money on.  Believe me, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I got my Braun 7526 syncro shaver but I am very diappointed.&lt;BR&gt;When I turned it on, I shakes radically, which made it very&lt;BR&gt;uncomfortable and difficult to shave. I don&#x27;t whether this is&lt;BR&gt;a common problem of this kind of shaver or just mine has this&lt;BR&gt;problem.&lt;BR&gt;I must return it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Clean shave. Highly recommonded for anyone looking for electric shaver. Unit looked brand new (except sticker indicationg factory reconditioned)and clean. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Have used Braun shavers for many years and know their great reputation.  Purchased this shaver because of the bargain price and have found it to be a great shaver.  Easy to use and clean and does a good job.  Would highly recommend it even at a higher price than what I paid.  The screen lasts for a long time and I find that you do not need the alcohol bath to clean it.  I usually clean the screen and cutter with running hot water which does an excellant job.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a bargin and very dependable as well. Those who have had problems with the recharging have probably not read the manual. You have to fully charge the shaver and then run the battery all the way down and then recharge it again, otherwise, the battery will not hold a full charge. Not following this procedure will cause damage to the shaver. READ THE MANUAL guys.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver, and buying it refurbished was a great deal. I wanted to say, for Dean Andrews who posted earlier about his shaver not holding a charge -- this was the case with mine as well. But remember that even though this is a refurbished model, it still comes with the full 2 year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty! So I called Braun, and got the address of the nearest service facility and mailed it in. I received a replacement unit (which did not have the scaped dots on the front that my original one did), and now it holds a charge just fine! So if you have battery problems and you are still under warranty, be sure to send it in for repair!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  It cleans itself and charges, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  I&#x27;ve had it for 1 1/2 years and it&#x27;s still good as new!</li>
    <li> This shaver barely maked a dent in my beard. To get anywhere near to a close shave, I must go over the area repeatedly. Even, then, my disposable razors far outshine this debacle. After I saw that it was not an every-day shaver for me, I was going to use it when I travel, just to touch up. Even then, it&#x27;s not a real shaver. I saw other good reviews. Do you have peach fuzz for a beard? Mine is, I think, average. At any rate I am going to try and return this. Whew!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic piece of equipment. My previous electric shavers either took a piece of my skin or left most of the facial hair in place. I never had one that does such a great job without hurting my face. The shaver does a 5 star job on my face and a 4 star job under the chin, but there is a solution for that: use the Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, available also at Amazon to decrease your shave time further. With this lotion, Braun 7526 performs as well as a pro barber in three minutes shaving time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought the refurbished unit, that came with no surprises. It was clean and not missing any pieces at all. The battery holds charge well, and recharges fast.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: BUY!</li>
    <li> I bought this reconditioned shaver, thinking that it would work like a brand new shaver.  However, it simply broke down after using it for less than a month and now even plugged, it does not work.  Very disappointed, will never purchase another \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; machine.</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver pooped out on me and I needed a new one ASAP.  I found this shaver right away on Amazon and was floored by the price, but I was wary becuase it said \\&quot;factory reconditioned.\\&quot;  I did some reading and found that in this instance, \\&quot;factory reconditioned\\&quot; meant that the packaging for the shaver was damaged and it had to be re-packaged.  I took this as meaning that the shaver was never damaged or defective or returned, so I was getting a new shaver in different packaging.  And I was right!  This shaver is fantastic, and definitely worth getting for this price!  Don&#x27;t let \\&quot;factory reconditioned\\&quot; scare you off, this works like a dream!</li>
    <li> Decent razor.  Not the closest shave but does a decent job.  Very sleek design.  Would prefer if it had a docking station.</li>
    <li> I have owned one other Braun shaver and regarded it as excellent. This product arrived in excellent condition and fulfills all my expectations. The number of shaves before recharging was more than anticipated. Fully satisfied with product and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this shaver.Try as I might I do not get a close shave.The stubble simply stays there. &lt;br /&gt;So I am shaving with a razor blade now 2x a week to keep myself well groomed. &lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver was a Norelco which I used for 14 years,until it stopped charging,it always gave me a decent shave. John Le Cheminant.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad.My Dad didn&#x27;t complain about this. &lt;br /&gt;I guess this is okay.:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Black male with fairly thick hair, and have used rotary shavers for the past 18+ years, and have switched to using this foil style shaver a few months ago. It cuts pretty close without bumping my face up. I tend to press the shaver head very hard against my cheeks to get a closer cut, and this shaver performs very good in that regard too. I use authentic Shea butter as an \\&quot;after-shave\\&quot; treatment, and  the results leave my face feeling nice and smooth...</li>
    <li> I was replacing a very old Norelco unit, and I haven&#x27;t kept up on the latest advancements, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this shaver.  The shave is close, the locking head position is a good feature, and the pop-up head gives a very good cut (better than my dedicated beard shaver).  Battery life is fantastic, and the unit it is relatively quiet.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> The first 7526 I ordered had a problem with the battery. It was not holding the charge at all. Amazon replaced it right away and sent me the second one which is working nicely.</li>
    <li> My dissasitsfation with this razor is about the design not the fact that it has been refurbished. It works like it is supposed to, it just happens that it can&#x27;t cut a thing. &lt;br /&gt;I suffer from folliclitus, and I am extremely frustrated by every razor thinking that the only thing that men care about is how close it shaves. Neither myself or any of the men in my family care how close of a shave they get, the real issue is irritaion and whether the razor actually cuts what it is supposed to cut. &lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves close enough, but misses massive amounts of hair especially on the neck and under the chin area. The long hair trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t work. The blade moves, but run it over some hair and nothing ever happens except you maybe irritate your face a little bit more trying to cut the hair that the normal head left behind. &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you have ever had trouble at all with folliclitus, skin irritaion, the razor not cutting all your hair, or if you need a working trimmer, this is not the razor for you. &lt;br /&gt;If you are the type of guy that has stiff straight facial hair and never gets irritated for any reason, you may like this razor, but even then you probably care more about closeness than I do, in which case this razor probably won&#x27;t live up to your expectations.</li>
    <li> I had wanted a Braun 7526 for some time but couldn&#x27;t spend the money on a new product so when a reconditioned unit became available, I jumped on the opportunity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I had doubts that the product would work properly, and if it did, that I would encounter intermittent performance problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After three months, those myths have been totally dispelled, and I use this razor every day. From the time I opened the package and charged the razor for the first time, I&#x27;ve never had any problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor is in a class by itself. I have a tough and heavy beard, Remington and Norelco could never do a decent job of shaving, but the Braun does. In fact, this razor actually gives me a closer shave than any blade razor especially in those hard to reach areas under my nose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great product at a great price. No more costly blades. I&#x27;m sold on Braun!</li>
    <li> I had 2 Norelco shavers and i tried a Schick shaver and boy did I get razor burn with it. I just got this one from Amazon and I love it. I get a close shave and no razor burn. This is the best shaver for the money. I don&#x27;t need there cleaner, I just use the brush it comes with. It shaves fast.  I recomend it highly. BUY IT. I ordered one from Ebay and never got it.</li>
    <li> I was eager to avoid the bells and whistles of the RETAIL version, and opt for this fantastic price for the RECONDITIONED shaver. When it arrived, I was immediately suspect to it&#x27;s quality, as there was a visable CRACK in the lower part of the shaver. The packaging was as minimal as you&#x27;d expect (it would have come better prepared off CRAIGSLIST)~ After plugging it in for a few hours, then turning it on, it was louder than any shaver I had purchased before... but ever the optomist, I decided that I should give it a try. I had read other \\&quot;favorable\\&quot; reviews, and decided it was now my turn to test this item. After a lame attempt at a smooth shave, I tried again. Still it was weak on removing the hairs that were not all growing in the same direction. In summary, I sent it back and wished I had never ordered it. I guess when they say, \\&quot;IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, THAN IT IS...\\&quot; is pretty much accurate when it comes to this Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver. AVOID IT AT ANY COST.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND HAS ONE OF THESE SHAVERS THAT HAS LASTED SEVERAL YEARS AND HE ENJOYS SHAVING WITH IT. HE NEEDED A NEW RPL SO WE WENT WITH THE SAME ONE RECONDITIONED. THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE A NEWER MODEL AND WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> i have had other razors that deliver a closer shave but all in these is a good product</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with it.  It gives a really close shave and doen&#x27;t pull his face.  He says it is nice and a lot better than the rotary one he had before.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember which year I purchased it but it&#x27;s well over 10 years ago and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> I replace an aging Braun with this reconditionned 7526. I&#x27;m very pleased with its power even when I used it unplugged. I always used it until the red light flashes then recharge it, probably every ten days (5 minutes a day). I clean it myself and don&#x27;t need the fancy cleaner that only comes with the brand new shaver. The cut is not as close as a mechanical shaver but I&#x27;m very satisfied. The trimmer works great and cut correctly unlike the one on some cheaper shavers. Overall an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> We purchased this 2 years ago for my husband, and it continues to work like a dream. Long charge, good shave. GREAT value. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a electric shaver since a long time . I like this product because of its ease of use and smooth slide across the face. Recommended for anyone wanting to buy this product</li>
    <li> I suppose the shaver does what it is supposed to do. It&#x27;s just that I have used a blade since my Norelco died 30 odd years ago and am not used to electric shaving. I was hoping that improvements in design might actually lead to a close, comfortable shave. But alas, all the bells and whistles do is give the same old sort of close, razor burn shave. Braun states in the directions to give it 3 weeks for your beard to adjust to the shaver as if using the thing will cause a physiological change in your facial hair that magically allows the shaver to cut more close and comfortable after 21 days. Don&#x27;t count on it. The automatic cleaning/charging unit is a nice feature but does not improve the shave. The reconditioned unit works just fine. No problems there. It&#x27;s just that the shave is more of a \\&quot;clean up the face for work\\&quot; shave than a \\&quot;rub cheek with your girl\\&quot; shave.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.</li>
    <li> Excellent.so far it has been very good.Very easy to take care.There are newer models on he market today.Braun an excellent name.</li>
    <li> Great price for a factory recondition.  Used for four years then the screen torn.  This is very typical for all electric shaver.  The item was donated to the local authorized recycle electric appliances and other items.</li>
    <li> Like:&lt;BR&gt;1) Close shave, closest I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver.&lt;BR&gt;2) Leaves face feeling smooth and unhurt. My old electric shaver was a remington, and I tried the Norelco reflex action  - both were rough on my face, the Norelco especially so. The Braun leaves my face unharmed. Even the pop-up trimmer (which I use for stray hairs on the face) leaves no nicks or scrapes. I don&#x27;t know how these guys do it, but I love the effect :-)&lt;BR&gt;Don&#x27;t like:&lt;BR&gt;None so far.</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that certain blood born infections remain virulent despite heat and chemical attempts at disinfection, hospitals now use ALL disposable instruments. Scissors, staple removers, forceps, as well as syringes, scalpels, and sutures are SINGLE USE. Hepatitis C patients are universally counseled to keep razors inaccessable to children and guests. In my opinion, the resale of used razors should not be permitted, as the reuse of contaminated instruments is not permitted.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these reconditioned units about 4 months ago, replacing an aging Norelco.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++  Noticeably closer shave than my Norelco Lift-and-Cut&lt;br /&gt;++  Less likely to cut me too!&lt;br /&gt;++  Very good price, compared to a new and complete system&lt;br /&gt;++  Reconditioned unit looked brand-new and totally clean&lt;br /&gt;++  Multi-voltage and frequency for international travel&lt;br /&gt;--  Much more likely to scatter stubble onto the countertop&lt;br /&gt;--  Not adept at shaving 2+ days of growth.  When in this situation, I use my old Norelco to get the bulk, and then use the Braun to finish.&lt;br /&gt;??  Uncertain of the durability or cost of the expendable parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;A couple months ago, the switch on my Braun shaver failed -- it was stuck in the ON position.  I had to let it run until the battery was depleted.  A bit of work with a web search engine showed my problem is not an isolated incident -- there is clearly a design or materials defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed Braun, which is owned by Gillette, reporting the problem, my search findings, and asked them to either repair my shaver for free or to send me a reconditioned unit.  Braun/Gillette declined, citing it was out of warranty.  This is true -- it is out of warranty by one year (it carried a three year warranty) but I had expected they would stand behind their product.  We exchanged a couple more emails but they would not budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being very electro-mechanical, I decided to take it apart to see if I could repair it myself.  This turned out to be an impossible task -- it&#x27;s not repairable -- almost everything is glued-together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a regular razor and shaving cream for a month, I decided to go back to my old, reliable, 12 year-old Norelco whose NiCads had worn-out.  I bought replacement batteries at a local electronics supplier for $[...], easily opened-up the Norelco with four screws, and after five minutes with a soldering iron I was back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun/Gillette&#x27;s refusal to stand behind their product for a loyal customer (I also have three Braun electric toothbrushes in my house) has left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  When my Norelco finally dies for good, I will NOT be buying a Braun!duct for a loyal customer (I also have three Braun electric toothbrushes in my house) has left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  When my Norelco finally dies for good, I will NOT be buying a Braun!</li>
    <li> Originally ordered reconditioned shaver only, for $39.99 in early Dec.  Shaver works great, better than my old Braun 6525.  Then saw entire reconditioned system for $49.99 so I ordered that as well.  As with other posters, I received no cleaning components.  Amazon sent me a replacement, but still no cleaning components.  Then I saw the price for entire system lowered to $39.99.  When I informed them of the second error, I too was offered the 20% discount, which would only put my price at the currently offered $39.99, really no discount or attempt to rectify problem.  Amazon should have made good on their error and provided all components of the shaving system that were offered in the ad.  Ad has been corrected and now only shaver offered.</li>
    <li> No, the base doesn&#x27;t come with this shaver. But, it does a great job; much better than my old 5500 series. As far as being reconditioned, who can tell? It looks brand new, which it probably is. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 4 weeks now and feel that is&lt;BR&gt;a fair amount of time to write a review. The \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot; system is certainly a step up from before. It does a nice job of automatically cleaning, lubricating and giving a nice lemon scent to the foil blade for your next use. The only downside of course is the cleaning liquid needs to get replaced about every 5 weeks. Ok now the shave itself. Does it replace your mach 3 or sensor excels. No, in my opinion it doesnt come close. The real problematic areas have been under the chin and neck area. Hairs don&#x27;t (for most men anyways) grow in a nice linear pattern. I was finding myself going over those areas 4 times and it still leaves enough to warrent breaking out the ol&#x27; sensor exel and quickly touching up. It does make it a lot easier for touching up because it softens the skin up and gets rid of a good amount of the stubble. So all you really have to do is run the sensor exel or mach 3 under hot water then quickly hit areas you feel can be improved upon. Usually the syncro does a nice enough job on the cheeks so you dont really need to go back over unless you want your shave as close as possible. My over all shave has improved since using the syncho in conjunction with a sensor exel for touch ups. I have virtually no more small scrapes on my neck area and feel the synchro does help the exel work better towards the closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had. Is the synchro shaver worth 110 bucks?  Well It isn&#x27;t a total replacement but it does make a good addition.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Great product!  What more could you want?  I have been using a Panasonic Wet/Dry Linear for a few years now and thought it was a good shaver.  It did okay dry and better wet, but was a pain to use with shaving cream.  This Braun is closer than their Wet shave.  I have also used Norelco and they frankly are significantly lacking.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!  It&#x27;s worth more you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for nearly a decade.  Back then, it took forever to shave, it wasn&#x27;t that close, and it left razor burn.  I gave it up for the razor because if I&#x27;m going to get razor burn, I might as well get a close shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided to take the plung and try it out again with this refurbished Braun product.  I figured I could spare $50 and see if I like it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The results:  Not too bad.  My shave is a lot closer.  Nearly as close as a Gillette razor.  It does takes several swipes (it takes longer than razor shaving, but since I&#x27;m doing it while driving, the time difference comes up a wash).  My only complaint is that I have a goatee (is that how you spell it????) and it is very difficult to shave around it.  I have to put the razor in all different sorts of directions to get that trim done right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And for the razor burn?  I used to wait two days to shave to resist the razor burn, or at least keep it down, but now I shave nearly every morning and my razor burn is quite mild.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the last thing, battery life.  It lasts a very long time!!!  I am surprised at the amount of battery life from this.  I charged it one time and it lasted several weeks while being put to use 5-10 minutes PER DAY.  Plus, it survives the heat of Las Vegas in July and August with no problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will keep my Gillette razor for special events, but I&#x27;m now primarily an electric shaver convert.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a Norelco 7885XL Quadra Action as a back-up shaver but hated it.  I returned it a purchase the Braun 7526 as a back up to my 2+ year old Braun 7570. Long story short - the 7570 is the back-up and the 7526 is my primary shaver.</li>
    <li> First thing, nothing shaves as close as a blade.  Having said that I&#x27;m very happy with my Braun.  Shaving with a blade is not a pleasure for me.  It&#x27;s too much trouble and I bleed easily.  My new (reconditioned)Braun does the job for me.  I get a close shave in a minimal amount of time.  It&#x27;s quite and comfortable in my hand.  The trimmer works better than any I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I do apply a pre-shave.  I was somewhat skeptical buying a reconditioned shaver, but the 2-year guarantee helped relieve my anxiety.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco 6616X, Braun 3XXX,  &lt;br /&gt;this one is the best, why: &lt;br /&gt;1. ultra-fast motor, shaves fast and close, &lt;br /&gt;2. cord and cordless operation, not like the Norelco 6616X which is only for cordless use,  &lt;br /&gt;3. feels good when holding it.</li>
    <li> This is my third attempt to purchase an electric razor, this is my second razor in 5 years since having a stroke. Since I&#x27;m on a blood-thinner,I can&#x27;t use a standard razor to get a close  shave &lt;br /&gt;so this razor allows me to look \\&quot;clean-cut\\&quot; again! The features I like are its comfort grip,easy to clean, and a close shave as advertised. Take it from a guy who was searching for a solution for 5 years...buy  it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical given the very low price, but it performs great and was everything that it was advertised to be.  It would be nice to get the charging base but for a $90 saving I can do without it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have purchased two of these shavers from Amazon, one for me and one for my college-age son.  One thing Braun should market is the speed of the shave -- compared to a rotary shaver.  I get a good, close shave in about 3 minutes -- try that with a rotary!</li>
    <li> i am not sure if the dead battery was caused by \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; for a few times. before that (dry shaving for a few months), it worked just nicely and the cut was as close as it gets. once i found i could get shaving results even better with \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot;, i started to use it with shaving gel. after a few times, it died and battery would never recharge again. IT IS RECONDITIONED anyway, i thought, so $40 went to drain. i guess that&#x27;s what it was worth with.</li>
    <li> My husband has owned other 2 shavers in the past and he thinks this is the absolute best shaver he has used. It holds a charge well &amp; is easy to clean.  &lt;br /&gt;My dad just may find one of these under the Christmas tree for him!</li>
    <li> looked through all the reviews on razors and finally picked this one for my man. He says its great, and he has shaved every day since he got it. For someone who would shave once or twice a week (because he hates shaving)this is great.</li>
    <li> One of the primary advantages of Amazon reader reviews is that reading several of them about the same product may give a potential buyer a cross section of user opinion and experience about a prospective purchase.  This can be especially helpful with a tool such as the factory reconditioned Braun 7526.  That&#x27;s because all beards are not created equal.  Skin sensitivity varies.  Hairs grow in different directions.  Some beards are coarser than others.  Because of such differences, the same shaver design that works well for one individual may not give such good results for another person.  So, here&#x27;s my individual user report to add to the general Braun database. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On balance, the Braun does the job for me.  In fact, I&#x27;ve put away my safety razor.  The Braun is slower to use than that conventional razor, but, if I take the time, it gives me a close shave.  I can also now spend shaving time in front of a computer screen or a TV, rather than devoting myself exclusively to shaving in a steamy bathroom.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have some nerve damage in my shaving hand.  This influences my razor choice.  The movements I need to make to get a clean shave with a safety razor often produce somewhat colorful results.  In personal grooming, this is not a good thing.  The rehabilitated Braun is also a little clumsy for me to handle; however, it gives good results without nicks, cuts or other errors. The Braun irritates my skin somewhat more than a blade does, but a splash of Old Spice aftershave fixes that.   &lt;br /&gt;If I were to buy the Braun today, using the experience I now have, I&#x27;d opt for a new unit that comes with the liquid cleaning system.  This is because it is difficult for me to effectively clean the Braun&#x27;s cutters with a brush.   The overhauled unit does not come with the snazzy cleaning system.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Without products such as the top-end reconditioned-Braun 7526 on the market, those wishing to try electric shaving would be compelled to buy either low-endjunk (which only teaches that you get what you pay for) or to pay a substantial initiation price for a high-quality model.  At about fifty bucks, the Braun makes for a good introduction to electric shaving, without breaking the bank.  Even if you eventually decide you&#x27;re a \\&quot;blade man,\\&quot; at worst you&#x27;ve obtained a backup travel shaver.      &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Even though it is factory reconditoned I did not have any problem with the product. Price is a bargain.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun.  I&#x27;ve also had a Norelco and Remington.  This is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned by far.  But then, all of the others where near the entry level models.  The razor gives a close shave and moves smoothly across my face.  And I don&#x27;t have to go over my face a billion times to get the missed hairs.  I have a dimple like Kirt Douglas and this razor cuts the hair and not my face.  While my other rechargables required weekly charging, this one easily goes for a month.  I was a little leary of buying a refurb model, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  It looks just like new.  It also cleans really easy, it take about 10 seconds.  I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I used Braun Syncro 7526 (bought refurbished) for a couple of months now. Before, I used Gillette Mach3, and I probably need to tell about both the shaving method and the particular machine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaving system: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they say in the manual it takes time for your skin/hair to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the new shaving method (2 weeks they say: I totally agree).  &lt;br /&gt;The first 2 weeks I couldn&#x27;t get a perfect shaving maybe also because the hair near to my neck used to grow parallel to the skin. Because of the way this machine cuts, the hair has to enter the holes of the foil in order to be cut, and for that it&#x27;s best if it grows as much away of the skin as possible. During the first 2 weeks I still used my Gillette mach3 for making it \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;, or actually to remove the solitary hairs Braun couldn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks it looked as my hair truly got used to the method, and Braun did a perfect shave. &lt;br /&gt;Compared to the classical shave, this method shouldn&#x27;t be done on wet skin and this turns to be an advantage. It&#x27;s because when the skin is wet it&#x27;s also swollen, and the hair can not be cut so well. My girlfriend actually confirmed this as she noticed right away that my skin is a lot softer then before, and it stays longer that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About this particular machine: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I didn&#x27;t use other type of electrical shaver my opinion could be somewhat one sided, but I&#x27;ll give my observations: &lt;br /&gt;-by buying this unit refurbished from Amazon I think you make an excellent deal, but you should note however that you don&#x27;t get the cleaning base as when you buy the unit new. However getting it for nearly $100 cheaper, and for only about the double price of the foil and cutter block it makes it such a good deal. And don&#x27;t think your shaver will get dirtier and dirtier because you lack the original cleaning system. You may keep it clean by following the manual instructions, and it&#x27;s pretty easy procedure. &lt;br /&gt;-the battery lasts truly over 1 month worth of shaving, but not after first charge, and as with all the batteries would be the best if you charge it completely and only when it&#x27;s empty &lt;br /&gt;-the machine has also a sideburns/moustache/beard trimmer, a pretty cool and necessary feature &lt;br /&gt;-the shaver looks good overall, it&#x27;s easy to carry with the charger in the provided carrying pouch, and for travellers: it&#x27;s international power compliant (you would need top buy plug adapters however, but those are cheap and small as you may know). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy about the decision I made buying the machine, and I highly recommend it.  &lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve seen a speculation saying that these machines are sold refurbished for a reason, in my opinion the speculation should be that the reason it&#x27;s the cleaning base. Maybe that went bad for many items, people returned the shaver and that&#x27;s why they are sold now refurbished and without the cleaning base. Of course, just a speculation.</li>
    <li> Never had an electric shaver before and this has worked perfectly. Best price, nothing wrong with reconditioned - you just don&#x27;t pay extra costs.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for years with adequate results. The new models  were not always 220 volt adaptable so I checked the Braun. I was hesitant to pay the full price for a shaver I had no previous experience with but I am fully satisfied with the unit. I run the batery to empty before I recharge so I don&#x27;t know if the automatic system works or not but I only need to recharge every 6-8 weeks. Great shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> in this case, reconditioned &#x3D; lemon &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the switch is defective, and I&#x27;m almost certain was the original problem....otherwise why would it have to be RE-conditioned? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;oh, the switch worked well for the first few times, but soon it became evident it had to be repeatedly repaired ~by me~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;OH YES, IT&#x27;S A LEMON ALRIGHT....and I lose....lesson learned?</li>
    <li> A good electric shaver typical of the Brawn make. Close shave easy to use and a good buy at the factory reconditioned price. Suggest to also buy the replacement foil &amp; blade because these models can go out of style.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver is a very good quality shaver. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The design and styling are excellent.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver, the past two were great, and this one appears to be along the same lines.  I highly recommend this product, as my pervious ones have lasted many years.</li>
    <li> Shaves great. Lasts a long time on each charge. Relatively quiet. The hair trimmer comes in handy for the sideburns.    My only regret is not buying a *second one* for use in the car, when I had a chance.    YEAR PLUS LATER UPDATE: still used daily and still on the same blade. Still happy and still will look for a Braun shaver when this one, for whatever reason, stops performing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor factory refurbished and loved it, it would stay charged for 3 weeks. After about 6 months it would stay charged for less and less time. Finally it would hardly hold a charge at all and would only work plugged in, even then it was very slowed down and weak. I ended up purchasing a newer model brand new with a 2 year warranty. It works great, even got the cleaner/charger stand this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over 5 years, and it works just as well now as it did when I bought it. The little cleaner device hasn&#x27;t held up so well, but it&#x27;s largely superfluous anyway.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my Father-in-law and he is astounded.  Say&#x27;s its the best shaver he&#x27;s owned!  Flexible head is a nice feature.  Battery keeps a good charge.  Shaves close.  The trimmer does only a moderate job on sideburns, especially if they are longer. but it&#x27;s good for single single hairs on neck that the shaver misses. It seems the teeth are so close together it has a hard time getting through thicker hair. Oh well, that&#x27;s what barbers are for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this shaver seven years later. I use it as a travel shaver, approximately ten times per month. I also use a rotary style shaver on a daily basis, which is convenient &amp; fast,  but doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as this Braun. The sideburn trimmer is a very strong point...it still works, whereas the trimmers on rotary shavers seem to wear out quickly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced the Braun screen several times. (I&#x27;d say a screen is good for 6 mos of daily shaving...you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed that the battery still works.</li>
    <li> worked good for about a year then died... seems like it should have lasted longer than a year.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this razor in 2003.  I bought a cleaning/charging base for it and a couple of spare blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this exact razor today.  Not a similar one...the exact one.  It has been with me to Moscow, London, Germany, North and South America, all over Europe and has not missed a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what battery they put in it, but I am really impressed.  It holds a charge for weeks (I use the razor every other day) and even with all the different power plugs I have used, it never gave up.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. He didn&#x27;t say whether he liked it or not, so I&#x27;m giving it a neutral rating.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but it&#x27;s loud and the cleaning solution is a pain to deal with.  Better to just rinse it off.</li>
