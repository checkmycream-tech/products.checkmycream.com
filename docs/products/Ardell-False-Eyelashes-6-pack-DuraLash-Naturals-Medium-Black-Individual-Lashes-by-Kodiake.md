      <li>They look good when they are complete!</li>
      <li>I will definitely edit this review enjoy!!!</li>
      <li>These are not too long and give your eyes a great look.  </li>
      <li>Longer if you don&#x27;t like your lashes really full.</li>
      <li>and these are so nice and natural looking.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and look really natural :)</li>
      <li>They look really good and not to long.</li>
      <li>but they look amazing, honestly nicer and more natural than the last 2 sets of extensions I&#x27;ve had done professionally.  </li>
      <li>and such a great alternative to going to get your lashes professionally done.</li>
      <li>My super critical mother actually complimented how natural they look lol if anything changes</li>
      <li>These look great on, I mix them with double flares also from Ardell and use lash tite dark adhesive.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t give five star because sometimes some get really stuck and when I try to remove, they break apart.</li>
      <li>It takes a minute learning to put them on, but they look real and stay on quite well.  </li>
      <li>so there are enough to last you 7 or more month.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it....</li>
      <li>They are long lasting and easy to apply, which are the two most important aspects of false eyelashes!</li>

<li> One set will last about 3 months for me, maybe less time if you&#x27;re rougher with them or don&#x27;t take care of them properly.</li>
<li> I returned the short lashes because I could not get the lashes to adhere using the same brand black adhesive.</li>
<li> And if one is coming loose and I don&#x27;t want to replace it</li>
<li> It took a few minutes to get the hang of applying individual lashes</li>
<li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfief.</li>
<li> These are my old standby for all formal events that require a dramatic eye.</li>
<li> so I use black now.  </li>
<li> Just a few add a touch to your make up!</li>
<li> The only thing I hate is they look bushy after a couple of days.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed.</li>

    <li> these are the best false eyelashes on the market they look beautiful when applied</li>
    <li> I love them. They look really good and not to long. The box has 6packs so there are enough to last you 7 or more month. Longer if you don&#x27;t like your lashes really full.</li>
    <li> these are so convenient! and such a great alternative to going to get your lashes professionally done. i&#x27;m sticking with these. they work well with the ardell glue too</li>

    <li> I love these!! These are not too long and give your eyes a great look.  It is a great price.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions, and the fact they come in a 6 pack is amazing. I use about 2 rows each time I do it, and never have to touch these ones up. One set will last about 3 months for me, maybe less time if you&#x27;re rougher with them or don&#x27;t take care of them properly.</li>

    <li> After figuring out how to get them out, they are great! Very natural, I were them to the office and they look great! For night I just add mascara!</li>
    <li> These are just like you would get at Sally&#x27;s, knot free, and easy to use.  It takes a minute learning to put them on, but they look real and stay on quite well.  I tried the clear glue and didn&#x27;t like it so I use black now.  And if one is coming loose and I don&#x27;t want to replace it yet I just add another drop of glue with a toothpick and all is well!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite clusters. Work great and the medium is a very good length. Never have problems with quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this while taking a makeup class and these are so nice and natural looking.  Just a few add a touch to your make up! Highly recommend it....</li>
    <li> This is great to be able to order these on line....as I have worn them for over 35 years.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This must not be the same eyelashes that are sold in stores. It hurts when I stick it on my eye lid.</li>
    <li> I returned the short lashes because I could not get the lashes to adhere using the same brand black adhesive. I was really disappointed. I returned this product without using them because they were way too long.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Easy to apply and look really natural :) *The wife*</li>
