<ol>
      <li>Great Service!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t want to have a TON of glitter all over their nails</li>
      <li>It is good as a shimmer coat to another nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Great product and really nice color.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light polish, maybe try their Happy Anniversary.  </li>
      <li>and it adds a nice shimmer to a neutral polish.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be a nice, shimmery nude color, however, you may as well not even paint your nails.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will be better on its own.</li>
      <li>I love OPI and own many of their polishes.  </li>
      <li>This is best described as barely there sparkles.</li>
      <li>It looks beautiful on it&#x27;s own with just a hint of sparkle on a natural nail.</li>
      <li>and I usually love OPI??</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute over another color to give it a shine like nude or something.</li>
      <li>It is a sheer color with a hint of sparkle perfect alone or, as I love to do...over another color.</li>
      <li>I love OPI, but I would pass on this one and go for something else.</li>
      <li>I purchased OPI&#x27;s So many clowns...</li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>This nail polish seems to make my nails chip more than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>no base coat/ top coat/</li>
      <li>I wear this over black and it looks awesome.</li>
      <li>One can&#x27;t really see this sparkly polish unless it is a top coat on another color.</li>
      <li>Not only is the name just awesome, it give your manicure an extra barely-there sparkle.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want color on your nails, but want to do something other than clear, this is a perfect polish to get.  </li>
      <li>It first spider webs--looks all cracked but is smooth, then shortly after it just starts to flake off on its own.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  </li>
      <li>It really works best as a top coat only with other OPI polishes, and do not use a clear top coat over it.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about the simplicity of this polish, but soon found out that the sparkles in the polish cause it to chip way faster then normal.  </li>
      <li>I forgot to mention, it did come very quickly for a nail polish, a full ten days before the estimated time.</li>
      <li>Love OPI, but this one chips practically instantly and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this color before and used the whole bottle...then couldn&#x27;t find it to replace it!</li>
      <li>but it is pretty.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty but not what i wanted</li>
      <li>I wish it came in a bigger bottle! :)</li>
      <li>It also adds a lot of beauty over the top of solid colors by adding depth and barely-there shimmer.</li>
      <li>Granted most polishes with sparkle chip quickly, but with this polish all of it was chipped completely away on all my fingers by the next day.  </li>
      <li>will use it as top coat over other colors.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to put this over a dark color like you would a normal glitter topcoat, because it just isn&#x27;t going to show much, if at all.</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous clear color with pink and blue flecks.</li>
      <li>I apply another top coat to my nails every day, and if you use anything else on top of this, it gets weird wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I love the super subtle sparkle.  </li>
      <li>I use it after my nail polish before the topcoat &amp; it has a little spakler l Love it</li>
      <li>The color is very light and pale.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and it goes on well, but once dried, the polish cracks and falls off within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>The polish was more yellow than expected and has a watery consistency.</li>
      <li>The glitter particles are VERY fine and add just a little something extra to nails.  </li>
      <li>and instead it was a clear glitter polish.  </li>
      <li>The product must be too old.</li>
      <li>Dries instantly and chips off just as fast.</li>
      <li>My bottle is almost empty and thats rare for me to finish a bottle of nail polish.</li>
      <li>I do work a bit with my hands, but nothing more then the usual female.  </li>
      <li>This is such a homage to the old cotton candy.</li>
      <li>the color is barely there.</li>
      <li>It chipped one its own, with a polish underneath, and with a top coat - worst polish I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
      <li>I wish there was a tiny box full of bubble wrap instead, I&#x27;m always scared I&#x27;ll open the bag and find a mess!</li>

<li> although the sparkles are pretty, i had wanted a pale pink with pink sparkles nail polish as i had seen online and on the OPI website.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;d give it less than one star if I could. It chipped one its own, with a polish underneath, and with a top coat - worst polish I&#x27;ve ever bought and I usually love OPI??</li>
    <li> i like this I use it after my nail polish before the topcoat &amp; it has a little spakler l Love it</li>
    <li> One can&#x27;t really see this sparkly polish unless it is a top coat on another color. Also I found it cracks within a few days of wear especially after dishes or nail straining activities.</li>
    <li> The polish was more yellow than expected and has a watery consistency.</li>
    <li> This nail polish seems to make my nails chip more than when I don&#x27;t use it. The sparkles are super subtle so I usually put on two coats so it&#x27;s noticeable in the sun. My nails last about two days with this so I don&#x27;t use it but it is pretty.</li>
    <li> I thought this would actually be a nail color and instead it was a clear glitter polish.  It is good as a shimmer coat to another nail polish.  I purchased OPI&#x27;s So many clowns...so little time with this and it adds a nice shimmer to a neutral polish.  If I would have known I would have purchased another color in their Femme De Cirque line.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Love OPI, but this one chips practically instantly and the color is barely there. Not what I expect from OPI</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear over other polishes and you can barely see it. Maybe it will be better on its own.</li>
    <li> Dries instantly and chips off just as fast. Not exaggerating. Very thin consistency and very bad quality. I&#x27;m hoping i just got a bad batch or an old polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this color before and used the whole bottle...then couldn&#x27;t find it to replace it! Yay for Amazon...I did!  It is a sheer color with a hint of sparkle perfect alone or, as I love to do...over another color.</li>
    <li> This is such a homage to the old cotton candy. It has a slight shimmer with a purple blue glimmer at an angle. Love this!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous clear color with pink and blue flecks. My bottle is almost empty and thats rare for me to finish a bottle of nail polish. I wear this over black and it looks awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve adored this polish since I stumbled across it online. Not only is the name just awesome, it give your manicure an extra barely-there sparkle. It dries incredibly fast, hard and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is about the packaging, but it&#x27;s something that always bugs me about buying nail polish online. I hate getting it in the tiny bubble wrap bag. I wish there was a tiny box full of bubble wrap instead, I&#x27;m always scared I&#x27;ll open the bag and find a mess! EDIT: I forgot to mention, it did come very quickly for a nail polish, a full ten days before the estimated time.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It looks beautiful on it&#x27;s own with just a hint of sparkle on a natural nail. It&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t want to have a TON of glitter all over their nails (you know -- those of us who aren&#x27;t 16 anymore!). It also adds a lot of beauty over the top of solid colors by adding depth and barely-there shimmer. I wish it came in a bigger bottle! :)</li>
    <li> This nail polish looked different in the picture online that I saw. I thought it would be a nice, shimmery nude color, however, you may as well not even paint your nails. It is basically like putting on a topcoat and that&#x27;s it. I couldn&#x27;t even tell my nails were painted. I would definitely only use this as a topcoat. It wasn&#x27;t even that shiny though. I love OPI, but I would pass on this one and go for something else.</li>
    <li> This is best described as barely there sparkles. It&#x27;s really cute over another color to give it a shine like nude or something. Next trip to the nail salon, it&#x27;s coming with me! used on my toes and I love it!</li>
    <li> maybe i misread or saw it differently online, but when it arrived, it was not what i expected it to be. the lacquer is clear with very small sparkles in it that gives it a pink tone. although the sparkles are pretty, i had wanted a pale pink with pink sparkles nail polish as i had seen online and on the OPI website. it&#x27;s pretty but not what i wanted and i cannot return due to it being an explosive hazard. will use it as top coat over other colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a glitter polish, it&#x27;s a shimmer polish.  The glitter particles are VERY fine and add just a little something extra to nails.  If you don&#x27;t want color on your nails, but want to do something other than clear, this is a perfect polish to get.  I add it over a French design too.  The color is very light and pale.  You won&#x27;t be able to put this over a dark color like you would a normal glitter topcoat, because it just isn&#x27;t going to show much, if at all.</li>
    <li> I love the super subtle sparkle.  It really works best as a top coat only with other OPI polishes, and do not use a clear top coat over it.  I apply another top coat to my nails every day, and if you use anything else on top of this, it gets weird wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the quality of this polish.  I love OPI and own many of their polishes.  I was excited about the simplicity of this polish, but soon found out that the sparkles in the polish cause it to chip way faster then normal.  Granted most polishes with sparkle chip quickly, but with this polish all of it was chipped completely away on all my fingers by the next day.  I gave it three chances and the same thing happened each time I tried.  I do work a bit with my hands, but nothing more then the usual female.  I am not a construction worker by any means.  If you are looking for a light polish, maybe try their Happy Anniversary.  It is similar, but more of a white base color then clear and it does not chip like this one does.</li>
    <li> Great product and really nice color.</li>
    <li> Though the tiny glitter color spectrum is beautiful, the polish itself if horrible. It doesn&#x27;t matter how I put the polish on (with a base coat/no base coat/ top coat/no top coat, 1 coat of the I Juggle Men color or 5 coats of the color) it Immediately chips the next day. It first spider webs--looks all cracked but is smooth, then shortly after it just starts to flake off on its own. I have tried it several times, several different way since I have receive the product, and without fail, the next day it spider webs and flakes off. I was thoroughly disappointed that I spent almost $8 for a nail polish that does that.</li>
    <li> Love the color and it goes on well, but once dried, the polish cracks and falls off within 24 hours. The product must be too old.</li>
    <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
