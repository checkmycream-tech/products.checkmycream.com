      <li>All the products are nice to give away to your dad, husband or boyfriend.</li>
      <li>I rated Dove Men Plus care pack 5 stars because it is a nice set.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is not over or under sudsy, and also has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>Dove soap has always been a favorite, so the brand has been one I automatically associate with good quality.</li>
      <li>This is a nice gift set with three full-size products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I own.  </li>
      <li>This would make an excellent gift for sure, but each of the three products is worth keeping for yourself!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner leaves your hair manageable and smelling nice.</li>
      <li>The Dove Men&#x27;s line is good for the skin and easy on the pocketbook.</li>
      <li>It is very strongly fragranced; sort of a cologne/forest/generic men&#x27;s bath products smell.  </li>
      <li>The deodorant is nice, but could do a bit better job.</li>
      <li>With this slanted triangular top I couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>so many choices available, it&#x27;s good to know Dove quality is available to men too.</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband to try because he had been using Dove soap, thinking that if he liked one product he might enjoy the others.  </li>
      <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  </li>
      <li>shampoo is my favorite item.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that has been improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>His comment was that his hair did not feel any more awake.  </li>
      <li>The shower gel is described as cooling, but he thought the shampoo more cooling than the shower gel.  </li>
      <li>It is, however, quite refreshing.  </li>
      <li>If you have prime it is an even better</li>
      <li>it was generally better than most I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>We all love the body wash, it&#x27;s got a rich lather, rinses well, and smells lightly fragrant, good for a man, fine for a woman too.</li>
      <li>The products all smell similar--like fine men&#x27;s cologne rather than mainstream deodorants, shampoos, and body washes (most of which are geared toward more feminine scents.</li>
      <li>If someone gave this to me at an office party, I would be thrilled--it&#x27;s better than most gifts I&#x27;ve received and more useful too!</li>
      <li>Having said that, consistency of this stick is better than many have tried and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smelled good, produced adequate suds, and seemed to clean well.</li>
      <li>It isnt overpowering and has a pretty light smell which is good for those of you that dont like overpowering smells.  </li>

      <li>These are all standard sized bottles, so the set is a great deal.</li>
      <li>The odor dissipates fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t particularly strong.</li>

      <li>and then you clean yourself.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Dove Men Plus Care Everyday Gift Pack contains full sizes of the Body and Face Wash, Antiperspirant and Shampoo/Conditioner.  My husband was happy to sample these and report his findings.  First - all the same scent; indeed fresh and not overwhelming. Second - you don&#x27;t need much of any of the products; a little goes a long way and due to that fact and the size of the containers, this is enough product to last quite a while.  Third - because the two cleansing products are combos (face/body and shampoo/conditioner) less stuff to buy and simpler to use.  Most importantly, they do the job while being gentle on the skin.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  Definitely recommend this as a gift to the man in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note:  My husband is a competitive swimmer.  His barber recently asked him what shampoo he uses, because his hair is not dried out at all, even though he spends all that time in the pool.  No expensive shampoos needed - Dove Men Plus Care shampoo does the job.</li>
    <li> I rated Dove Men Plus care pack 5 stars because it is a nice set. The scent is pleasant for a man. All the products are nice to give away to your dad, husband or boyfriend. This set includes Micro Moisture Body Wash, Anti-Perspirant Deodorant 48 Hr Powerful Protection, Fortifying Shampoo + Conditioner.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men Plus Care Everyday Gift Pack is a fine assortment for a man, whether as a gift or just to buy for yourself.  The distinguishing feature of this set is its Fresh Scent.  The Wash gives a fresh, tingling feeling to both body and face.  The shampoo and the deodorant continue the theme.  If you like the fresh feeling this is the pack for you.</li>
    <li> Up front, I should mention that I&#x27;m not too picky as to the body wash/deodorants I use (I keep my hair short and usually use a body/hair wash product and therefore don&#x27;t often buy a separate shampoo). I usually pick them due to their sales price. I&#x27;m not saying there is no difference between brands, but I don&#x27;t think the differences are big enough for me to care much about.  Here&#x27;s what I found with this Dove Men gift pack:  PRO 1) Unlike some other reviewers, I found the scents for all three products were subtle and didn&#x27;t conflict at all with my citrus-based cologne (a musky cologne might be a different story)  2) The body wash and shampoo rinsed away cleanly and quickly  3) The deodorant is dispensed by twisting the base of the unit. With most brands, you twist a small wheel built into the base, but with this Dove unit, you twist the entire base. Which makes it easy to dispense.  CON  1) The body wash does not create a great deal of lather. I had to apply twice as much to get the lather I get from a less-expensive Suave body wash.  2) The Dove products are a bit more than bargain brands that are really not that bad.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 boxes non were damaged. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> This would make an excellent gift for sure, but each of the three products is worth keeping for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo/Body Wash/Deoderant&lt;br /&gt;Another great &amp;#34;gift pack&amp;#34; product from Dove</li>
    <li> This is a very nice gift set! It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It smells fresh and clean. The shampoo/conditioner leaves hair clean and soft. The body wash cleans without drying your skin out. The anti-perspirant is long lasting and smells fresh. The Dove Men&#x27;s line is good for the skin and easy on the pocketbook.</li>
    <li> I used all three products, body wash, deodorant, and shampoo + conditioner for a couple of weeks and was generally happy with the products. The deodorant was good, went on easily and seemed to last through the day even on hot days (80s and low 90s). The shampoo smelled good, produced adequate suds, and seemed to clean well. Since I keep my hair very short I can&#x27;t say much about the conditioner aspect of the shampoo plus conditioner product. When I had longer hair conditioner would make it feel softer and more manageable, but with my current hair style this feature is lost on me. One feature of packaging the shampoo may seem a nit pick, but I noticed the lid is a slanted triangle. I like to turn squeeze products upside down when you get near the bottom so the liquid flows out easily and you don&#x27;t have to shake it as much to get it out. With this slanted triangular top I couldn&#x27;t do that. I was interested in the body wash because my skin tends to get dry over time with just using soap. This body wash advertises that it&#x27;s a light wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out skin as much; I couldn&#x27;t tell about this claim from using it only a couple of weeks. The body wash had a nice fragrance which it left on the skin after showering. But it seemed to me I had to use a lot of it, and about three applications for every shower, to get the level of suds I like. I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other body wash products. The deodorant and shampoo compares favorably to many similar products. If I were rating these three products individually I would give the deodorant and shampoo four stars and the body wash three. Since the product is a set of all three products, I&#x27;ll go with three stars for the set since I&#x27;m not sure about the body wash&#x27;s anti-dry skin claim. However this could make a good gift for men.</li>
    <li> Considering what this stuff usually costs each this starts off as a good deal.  If you have prime it is an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was smell everything.  It isnt overpowering and has a pretty light smell which is good for those of you that dont like overpowering smells.  It doesnt feel bad either.  You use a little and then you clean yourself.  All in all a pretty solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really dont have anything negative to say here.  It is what it is and does what it says it will do well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove products for years now, and this set is pretty standard (that&#x27;s a good thing). I have limp, stringy, oily hair, and the Dove Shampoo/Conditioner works just find. All of their products have a similar smell that, um, I find comforting (is that weird?). So with the deodorant which is sticky bar type I don&#x27;t have an issue smelling like a Dove product. The odor dissipates fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t particularly strong. Though I can&#x27;t vouch for the 48 hours coverage claim, I walk 2 miles each way to/from my work transportation and except on blazingly hot days, I don&#x27;t end up with pit moisture circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fresh body and face wash? I can&#x27;t really say much about other than it works and, surprise, smells like a Dove product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says so an easy 5 out of 5 Amazon stars for me.</li>
    <li> This mix of products has a unified theme -- the scent is similar between the deodorant, body wash, and shampoo. But there are subtle differences that are harder to describe throughout each product -- though all of them have a somewhat green color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant, at 15.2% aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY for the active ingredient, is less potent than another 19% Unilever deodorant that I&#x27;m using (Degree.) Given the sometimes controversial use of aluminum in deodorants, this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, as that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. While I have used it daily for a week or so, if I skipped a day, I think I&#x27;d be okay as the product indicates 48 hour effectiveness and haven&#x27;t had any odor issues so far. When using the shampoo, my hair is clean, but I do have a bit of a dry scalp, so I usually prefer some anti-dandruff ingredient. The body wash lathers well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and fine. The body wash and shampoo contain menthol, while the shampoo also contains caffeine. Menthol is something I usually think of for soothing sore throats and coughs, not in a personal care product. It&#x27;s not exactly clear what these items are used for as they aren&#x27;t described the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t 100% unified on all the products, and they&#x27;re definitely &amp;#34;cologne-esque&amp;#34; -- that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. It&#x27;s not floral. Personally, I prefer something a little bit more subtle, but I don&#x27;t find them totally objectionable. There&#x27;s also definitely plenty of marketing speak on the packaging -- for example, what does &amp;#34;care built in&amp;#34; really mean? None of the products claim to be &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; or anything of the sort -- the ingredients list has plenty of long names that are hard to pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I feel clean and less stinky? Yes. Am I using &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products? No. It definitely depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. The overall price is reasonable for the set -- shampoo, body/face wash, and deodorant. But are there other options with better ingredients where you can pick and choose what you want? Yes. If you&#x27;re looking a gift for a young guy who likes a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; scent and doesn&#x27;t care about &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; ingredients, this pack is likely ideal.</li>
    <li> This man kit is pretty decent.  The only real negative that I have to  say about it is that with the addition of Menthol to the  shampoo, it smells a bit &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; to me.  It is, however, quite refreshing.  The soap smells pretty nice and leaves your skin feeling rejuvenated.  The deodorant works quite well and I can say for a fact that it does not irritate.  I personally have a real problem  with deodorants causing my &#x27;pits&#x27; to itch...not so with this product.  It also has a fairly understated scent and won&#x27;t overwhelm your aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gift pack would make an OK present for father&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men Plus Care Everyday Gift Pack is a great set for the man in your life. The scents are really nice (musky) and seem to fade just a bit, but still last throughout the day. The only real complaint is that the body wash and shampoo bottles are designed in a way that they&#x27;re hard to open when wet - not ideal for use in a shower. These are all standard sized bottles, so the set is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well. It smells good. The shampoo/conditioner leaves your hair manageable and smelling nice. The body wash smells good too and cleans with a bit of a tingle. The deodorant is nice, but could do a bit better job. It advertises as being 48 hour, and I don&#x27;t necessarily agree. I&#x27;ve had anti-persperants that worked a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall nice smelling man care products</li>
    <li> Some things are pretty basic, like body wash, shampoo, and deodorant. So how do you differentiate your products from everyone else&#x27;s?  The body wash: The marketing hype says, &amp;#34;Dove Men+Care Extra Fresh Body and Face Wash with MICROMOISTURE technology is clinically proven to fight skin dryness better than regular men’s body wash. This ultra-light formula delivers extra refreshment with a cooling agent, then rinses off easily for total skin comfort.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure what any of that means but for a body wash it was generally better than most I&#x27;ve used. I like the consistency, the way it lathered, and the way it completely rinsed. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in &amp;#34;skin dryness&amp;#34; after using this body wash. The fragrance in the body wash does tend to linger after you get out of the shower, a feature that I do not care for.  The shampoo: Of all the products in this package, the shampoo would make the biggest difference. I don&#x27;t particularly care for two in one haircare products because I really don&#x27;t need the conditioner aspect. Having said that, I didn&#x27;t deduct points for the combination. While it seemed to clean quite well, it did dry my scalp, which is not a good thing. Caffeine in my shampoo? It seems like more of a gimmick than anything else as it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in the final outcome. When all was said and done, however, I did not see any difference between hair washed with this product versus my normal shampoo. Mrs. Boilermate didn&#x27;t notice any difference either.  The deodorant: This is the product that I&#x27;m least likely to use on a daily basis. I normally prefer a roll-on deodorant and normally don&#x27;t care for a stick type deodorant. Having said that, consistency of this stick is better than many have tried and goes on smoothly. What I don&#x27;t care for, however, is the fragrance. Based on how long the fragrance lingered, though, I would tend to believe that the &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; claim.  The Bottom Line: Neither the body wash or the deodorant seem to work any better (or worse) than the products that I use on a daily basis. What seems to differentiate these daily care products is there fragrance, and that fragrance, in the deodorant particularly, lingered far too long. The shampoo/conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference on my hair but left my scalp dry.  When I exit the bathroom following my morning routine I don&#x27;t want to smell like anything. For me, the purpose of showering, shampooing, etc. is to remove dirt and odors, and not simply replace one odor with another. I don&#x27;t mind a bit of fragrance while using the shampoo or body wash, but I want that fragrance to wash off when I rinse off. The lingering fragrance of these products is enough to cause me to pass them by, particularly the deodorant.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men + Care Everyday Gift Pack is comprised of Shampoo, Body wash, and Deodorant.  The scent is fairly unified amongst the three and is reminiscent of Polo to me.  The body wash made my skin soft and has a pleasant scent.  The shampoo is not over or under sudsy, and also has a nice scent.  The deodorant does work for 48 hours as claimed...I put it to the test and it performed as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the kit is a good value and gives me &amp;#34;my own stuff&amp;#34; in the shower now.</li>
    <li> These product do leave you feeling extra fresh and clean. I liked the way the shampoo left my hair conditioned and easy to manage. The deodorant was strong and lasted all day. The body wash left me feeling shower fresh for most the day. Great products.</li>
    <li> All three products smell great, not overly scented like other product lines. We all love the body wash, it&#x27;s got a rich lather, rinses well, and smells lightly fragrant, good for a man, fine for a woman too. The shampoo was a hit with my husband since it&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner in one. He also likes the deodorant, even though it doesn&#x27;t go on clear. He&#x27;s used Dove deodorant a lot before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be a strange &#x27;gift&#x27; since it&#x27;s drugstore products, however, if someone gave me a ladies version, I&#x27;d be happy enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s currently about $11, which is a good gift pack for any man.&lt;br /&gt;The smells are masculine and the anti-persperant works.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> This product set will get you or whomever you give it to smelling and looking great. One feature I really like is that the body wash container sets on its opening so you don&#x27;t have to waste time shaking the contents down to the opening each time and the opening is small so that you don&#x27;t get too much product out of it and waste it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to try because he had been using Dove soap, thinking that if he liked one product he might enjoy the others.  I was wrong.  I have to preface this review by saying that it is a good deal more tempered than his reaction.  He used words like Bunkum and hooey (leading me to believe that my husband is actually a good deal older then I thought he was ;)  He reacted pretty badly to the entire concept of most of the products and felt it was a badly aimed marketing ploy.  He told me, among other things, that &amp;#34;men do not want to be micro-moisturized,&amp;#34; adding, especially in their eyes.  (He used some of the shower gel on his face while in the shower, and said that is not something you want to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo contains caffeine, which I have read is supposed to stimulate hair growth.  His comment was that his hair did not feel any more awake.  The shower gel is described as cooling, but he thought the shampoo more cooling than the shower gel.  They claim that the deoderant lasts 48 hours, and he said that this was the only claim he had not tested, of which I am pretty glad.  I like that he showers routinely, and at least once/ day ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He warned me not to try these products because they were just for men, and went on to add that a very small subsection of the male population would be interested in anything like this.  I don&#x27;t know that he can speak for all men, but he does know more than I about men&#x27;s tastes in general than I do.  He is more than happy to let me have my boutique bath products but has no interest in them (or anything like them) himself.  Everyone can decide for themselves whether or not a product or concept appeals to them.  His feeling is that there was not a lot to the product claims (or, if there was, he did not much care).  He is not interested in moisturizer and said that really, what he wants from a bath product is to get clean.  I think, at least with respect to this male, the entire package/ concept was a bad misfire.  I am guessing that what he liked about Dove was that it was a simple, basic soap, and these products not only do not appeal, but make it less likely that he would purchase or use Dove products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son, unlike his father, does use shower gel and is pretty  picky about what he likes.  He also has definite preferences in shampoo (although he plays down both, saying it doesn&#x27;t matter, though I know that it does).  His preferences, however, are also pretty straight-forward, having nothing to do with packaging or marketing claims.  He clearly enjoys  certain scents (and finds others annoying) again, opting for something pretty basic over something heavily perfumed.  He tends to go organic, though I do not think that he considers that so much as that they do not sting his eyes, for example, or smell conspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I have found only one product my husband like better than whatever is close at hand, and it is a rosemary-mint shampoo (though he always tells me not to go out of the way to get it for him).  When it materializes in the bathroom, he does enjoy it.  This too, is something with a clean scent, no artificial perfumes, and  product which likely does clean better, or have a fresher scent.  We live in he tropics (Hawaii) and after a hot day, mint does have a certain appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I recommend these products, or would he?  I&#x27;d say from his reaction, decidedly no.  It is not that they are necessarily bad products so much as that he felt that it was a marketing ploy, and he has no interest in anything beyond a very basic soap, shampoo, deoderant.  He wants them to work, and that is all, and would rather have soap which smells like soap....  The only caveat I would add is that he did not like the shower gel as an overall wash, does not want to worry about getting it in his eyes.  His reaction was overall pretty negative.  I have smoothed out the rough edges, and suspect that he would not have given the products 3 stars, finding them less desirable overall than the basic soap he had been using from the same company.s, finding them less desirable overall than the basic soap he had been using from the same company.</li>
    <li> My military son enjoys receiving gift packs &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; without any special reason. He&#x27;s liked Dove&#x27;s Men products a lot in the past except for the deodorant which seemed to leave little white clumps behind. I&#x27;m glad to say that has been improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack is an easy grab-n-go for me to purchase because the items are the same scent so there&#x27;s no clashing fragrance battles for a guy on the go. Neither the body wash nor shampoo/conditioner are frothy, sudsy messes similar products can be. There&#x27;s a clean fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t linger or dry out the skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many choices available, it&#x27;s good to know Dove quality is available to men too.</li>
    <li> Great body wash &amp; great shampoo!  I was less than excited about the deodorant though.  I&#x27;m not someone that uses 48 hr protection antiperspirant, so I was not ready for the texture.  This deodorant applies so well that I couldn&#x27;t scrub it off my skin in the shower.  I think 48 hr is a little much, but if that&#x27;s for you - give it a shot.  As for the scent of all three: I think the smell is nice, but not overwhelming.  I have sensitive skin &amp; allergies - the shampoo &amp; body wash didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and my dad loved it so much. This makes a great gift for any dad.</li>
    <li> Shipped this out when my fiancé was away for work for a month. He came to really enjoy it that it&#x27;s now his main brand of body care.</li>
    <li> I have used the Dove Men+Care (which is not a good name IMHO) extra fresh body wash.  I tend to prefer this body wash over Dial and other &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; brands.  I had not used the Dove Fresh Clean Shampoo/Conditioner or Antiperspirant prior to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a standard 2-in-1 product which has a fresh clean scent which is more on the masculine side.  It is infused with caffeine and menthol.  The menthol has a cooling effect.  Why caffeine?  As an additive, caffeine gets introduced to the hair follicle. When being left on for 2 minutes, caffeine penetrates the hair follicle, thereby strengthening weakened hair roots and preventing hereditary hair loss.  In addition, there is some research that it stimulates hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner mix rinses out clean and leaves hair clean and soft.  I don&#x27;t find it drying for my hair which is rather fine in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the deodorant, I usually use a clinical formulation from another manufacturer because I have developed a rash from using other antiperspirants.  However, this product does not produce a rash and leaves me smelling and feeling clean and dry all day.  It also has a moisturising effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good gift set (or a gift for yourself set).  I like all of the coordinated products and they all seem effective.  This is also a good way to get introduced to the Dove product line if you have not experienced it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/21/15: the shampoo/conditioner do have a slightly menthol scent.  The shampoo / conditioner leather quite readily.  The deodorant works better than my current &#x27;clinical&#x27; brand and keeps a fresh scent throughout the day.  One thing I dislike about the deodorant is the sharp edges of the dispenser.  The product dispenses initially as an oddly shaped dome and leaves the sharp edges of the bottle to scrape your underarms.</li>
    <li> Dove Men+Care Everyday Gift Pack is something anyone would appreciate. For the men, they get high-quality shampoo/conditioner (12 oz.), body/face wash (13.5 oz), and deodorant in a compact, masculine-looking black and grey box. If someone gave this to me at an office party, I would be thrilled--it&#x27;s better than most gifts I&#x27;ve received and more useful too! The products all smell similar--like fine men&#x27;s cologne rather than mainstream deodorants, shampoos, and body washes (most of which are geared toward more feminine scents. I also appreciate that the smell is not so overpowering that I still notice it hours later. 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a nice gift set with three full-size products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is my favorite item.  It doesn&#x27;t clear as much grease as some (I need to use clarifying shampoo at least once a week with it), but it leaves my hair fluffy.  It also has a pleasant minty-ness to it on top of the foresty scent that is the base of all the products&#x27; fragrance.  Just be careful not to get it into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is average.  The whole &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; thing is obviously a marketing gimmick, but it does have significantly different ingredients than the Dove for women body wash I own.  I like that it is made to stand on its lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant does not last for 48 hours as claimed; 24 was as far as I was willing to push it.  It is very strongly fragranced; sort of a cologne/forest/generic men&#x27;s bath products smell.  Plus, the smell lingers.  You will smell of your deodorant for hours like a teenage boy who doused himself in Axe.  It&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
    <li> Dove soap has always been a favorite, so the brand has been one I automatically associate with good quality. The Body Wash is excellent, and since it is thick ( and not watery) not a lot is needed. It also has menthol, as does the hair shampoo, so the cooling effect is excellent, and in my view it has a great feel.The Deodorant is the one I am somewhat ambivalent about; it does not feel good on my skin, and the Dr&#x27;s caution on the deodorant is somewhat chilling, since how would all people know if they have kidney problems; anyway, overall, its a good package, but be cautious with the deodorant.Hopefully the different components are available separately if you should want one or two, and not a third item.</li>
    <li> Good deal and good products</li>
    <li> Purchased for my godson and my spouse as gifts. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Extra Fresh Body Wash (13.5 oz) - smells clean and fresh, nice and thick too. Does the job!&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Clean Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (12 oz) - my favorite out of the set of three. Quite a step up from my Aveeno shampoo or old and aftwards my hair is squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;Extra Fresh Antiperspirant (2.7 oz) - easy to use; no drips or crumbling; and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is neat and clean. Perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> My husband has used these products for a few days. Both of us love the fresh scent. He is very happy with both the antiperspirant and the shampoo. As he keeps his hair very short it is harder to evaluate the conditioner combined with the shampoo. He is not as happy with the body wash. It does not provide as much lather as the brand he was using previously and he has seen no difference in the moisture level of his skin. He says it does rinse away easily but says that is because there was not much lather to begin with. We will definitely purchase the antiperspirant again because he says it works much better than his previous brand for sweat and odor and it is long lasting. The shampoo would be a purchase we could go either way on. As for the body wash, he will finish the bottle but would probably not purchase again. We do agree that as a gift pack this is an excellent value and men would appreciate the gift.</li>
    <li> This 3 item set of men&#x27;s bath time products is not only a good value but performs very well in scrubbing you down and getting you spiffed up. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) 2-in-1 Shampoo/Conditioner -- Has extremely strong lather. A small dollop is all that is required to foam up a full head of hair and rinse out a day&#x27;s worth of grease and gunk. Fragrance is pleasant, crisp and clean and not sweet. Conditioning finish is OK - not the best but pretty good for a combo product.&lt;br /&gt;2) Body/Face wash -- Lather is &#x27;ok&#x27; and overall is a good body wash that rinses off easily and leaves a refreshing scent on the skin. As a face wash it tends to leave my face a bit drier than I would like so I would only use it in a pinch on the face and to moisturize immediately afterward.&lt;br /&gt;3) Anti-Perspirant stick -- fragrance is similar to the body wash and is formulated as a non-irritant product. It&#x27;s also labeled as having &#x27;48 hour powerful protection.&#x27; Overall, a decent deodorant on par with other garden variety drug store brands.</li>
    <li> This is perfectly good product. I am not especially picky about shampoo, but the scent is nice in the morning shower and is somewhat masculine, or at least not at all feminine. The deodorant works well, and the body wash is great. I will definitely buy again.</li>
