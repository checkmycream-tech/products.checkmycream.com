    <li> These bars of soap are  definitely the right colour, they are golden for sure :)  Smells so clean and fresh, makes your whole bathroom smell lovely.  I have paid a small fortune for these at a near-by Italian deli, buying them through Amazon was just the best thing...Thank you Amazon :)</li>
    <li> Like it lots. I have face and back acne, thus I am careful what goes on my skin. This soap is really nice for me so much so that it replaced my skin cleanser keeping my skin pimple free. I used it on my 3 yr old and it helped keep his skin rash at bay on his sensitive skin. Great product. The bars are large, and the scent is just ok. A bit pricey for 6 bars though.</li>
    <li> Smells like the soap in hotels and I&#x27;m allergic to it.. Gave it away. Although it feels soft on your body I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I first used this soap at a relative&#x27;s house. It was by the sink, and I used it many times to wash my hands. I wash my hands a lot, and they get extremely dry and cracked. I noticed this soap kept them supple and moisturized. I liked the fragrance. It&#x27;s pleasant, neither masculine or feminine, and fades from the skin quickly. When I ordered some for myself, I tried using it in the shower. I LOVE it. The lather is so luxurious. My skin feels soft after using it. I have sensitive skin, and this is one of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t cause any problems or irritation. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This soap is so nice.  Wonderful fragrance and it leaves the skin soft and smooth.  I buy it when I need a &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34; gift or a small remembrance.</li>
    <li> This soap is absolutely fantastic  .I ordered this through the company initially and I have made another offer through AMAZON .The only thing I can say about this soap is that once you use it,you really don&#x27;t want to use another soap.You become addicted.Great smelling but if you have allergies,this may not be the soap for you as it definitely has a fragrance.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this is the finest soap I have ever used!!! Love it and the six bar box makes a great gift...</li>
    <li> Feels great using for shower.</li>
    <li> I only use European soap in the shower. I found this bar soap a couple of years ago and have been using it daily ever since. Love the clean smell and it never conflicts with any of my colognes.</li>
    <li> All of the Carli products - we have tried - are excellent.  We are return customers. We love the bar soap, hand soap and olive oil.  It is all first class.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Kinda pricey. went back to dial.</li>
    <li> Great soap -- especially for people with sensitive skin.  Even my husband likes it!!!  I sometimes develop rashes from other soaps but this one is so creamy and smooth.  My skin feels wonderful after a shower.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, will buy again</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SOAP AND A FRIEND GAVE ME ONE BAR AS A GIFT.  NOW I AM GIVING ONE BAR TO OTHER FRIENDS.  LOVE THE SMELL AND THEY WAY IT FEELS ON MY SKIN.  CARLA HESKETT</li>
    <li> This is the soap I use for my face.  I love it because I feel clean and refreshed and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap. Dry skin disappears! Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....we have been using it for years but I never knew that I could order it from Amazon so I am thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;My husband won&#x27;t use any other soap. The service from Amazon was fantastic too ...I will be back to order more things.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Heather Hunter</li>
    <li> Love everything about this soap.  Suds up beautifully and rinses off well.  Has a lovely clean fragrance.  Will definitely order again.  Also, nice to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> This soap makes your bathroom smell great. I love using it because the smell lingers throughout the day too. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> We love this soap.  It was given to us by friends and we in turn have bought it for ourselves and others.</li>
    <li> My husband discovered this soap in a little Moroccan store in Tarrytown, NY.  He decided to try it because of very dry skin in the winter that made him itch even though it was a little on the expensive side for one bar of soap.  Wow did it ever help!  We bought a case of it and a year later when we were running low, we discovered we could buy it on Amazon!  I use it all the time now, too and love it.  The olive oil doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel on your skin but it sure takes care of that dry skin!  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
