      <li>I can use it as a highlighter, which I only do on full-makeup days, but on a normal day out, I swipe it on my brow bone in place of eye shadow, and it really makes a huge difference, because I still look natural, and yet a lot prettier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had this mini size for over a year, and it&#x27;s still going. I love this because it is really versatile. I can use it as a highlighter, which I only do on full-makeup days, but on a normal day out, I swipe it on my brow bone in place of eye shadow, and it really makes a huge difference, because I still look natural, and yet a lot prettier. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted the big size of this and it&#x27;s been in my basket for a couple of weeks. But I just couldn&#x27;t afford it, so I was thrilled to find a mini.....however, I didn&#x27;t know it was quite THAT mini!  It was a bittersweet moment for me. I really love it but it was so so small. 😥</li>
    <li> One of the two pieces received was previously used. It&#x27;s illegal to sell this used, so be careful when you open it up.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Watt&#x27;s Up! after seeing it on pinterest for alittle while now, paying full retail for the big tube. I decided I was over the $30 and bought this little size. It is just as good, the shade is perfect, and it is easy to apply .I use it on my nose, chin, collar bones and cheeks for highlighting.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for the right high lighter / illuminator for what seems like ages and this works very well to give you a dewy, glowy look. I&#x27;ve found it works best to use a cosmetic sponge to apply it. I use it on my cheeks and brow bone and it really gives me the look I was going for. The search is over!</li>
    <li> Got this in a benefit sample size gift set that I LOVE and this makes my face (I am a brown/dark/mocha color) and it literally illuminates my skin I draw a line from the center of my forehead down my nose and cupids bow my chin as well as under my eyes. It covers,my dark circles and hives,my face that perfect \\&quot;pregnancy glow\\&quot; sunkissed look. This is mini nut im considering purchasing the large for 30$ its that good... The large is HUGE might I add *Mrs.Chu*</li>
    <li> Loved this product. I saw a friend using it at her wedding and wanted to try it for myself. It highlighted my cheeks and under eyes. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> A great product. It is great for everyday wear. It gives the skin a healthy glow. I use it on forehead, cheeks, and chin.</li>
    <li> This is very mini, and I mean VERY...MINI...But it&#x27;s all good, I bought it for my sister along with several other items for her birthday and she was thrilled. She had pinned it in her Pinterest which I thought was absolutely genius for me to peruse before I went B-day shopping for her.</li>
    <li> got this in sample size with a birthday promotion at Sephora.  LOVE IT.  Great on cheekbones, eyelids.  Will continue using.</li>
    <li> I suppose I love it because I know how I&#x27;m supposed to use it.. It&#x27;s very small, but a little goes a long way and you get ally of bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency - I can wear it over my foundation or even mix it into it for an overall glow. The result is a subtle but sexy look, without being too flashy or obvious.</li>
    <li> fIRST DAY USING IT AND ITS OK BUT NOTHING TO GO CRAZY OVER</li>

    <li> I use this as an eyeshadow base and highlighter. It works great and the small tube lasts a really long time (at least a year). I just ordered my 2nd tube. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but only use it under my eyes. Don&#x27;t attempt to have the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look with this because it can be greasy feeling later in the day.</li>
