      <li>my daughter put these to great use!!!!</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>Great size and colors...</li>
      <li>Great value</li>
      <li>The package arrived looking great on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>They are a good size for accents on nails.</li>
      <li>The variety of colors is just what I was looking for and the size is good.</li>
      <li>Love my manicure and pedicures!</li>
      <li>These are cute and the perefect size!</li>
      <li>There is a great variety in color and they seem to hold up pretty well on my nails and they look great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a large amount of gems and the color is excellent.</li>
      <li>Nice choice of colors for nail decoration.</li>
      <li>Fast shipper and great prices!</li>
      <li>but once they are they add a nice bling to your design.</li>
      <li>The rhinestones are nice and they were just as described.  </li>
      <li>Fun colors and great for nails</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re holding up just fine!</li>
      <li>But they do the job and overall these are great for the price!</li>
      <li>The colors I received are cute, but in the description it says \\&quot;Color:</li>
      <li>My item arrived a week earlier than estimated time which is awesome...</li>
      <li>and the fact that they were static is not the sellers fault.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply to the nail.</li>
      <li>My only criticism is that when they arrived they were very static and stuck to the top of the lid, but after I fixed it it was okay</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure these will come in handy for me somewhere down the line...</li>
      <li>and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments.</li>
      <li>This was very much worth it</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t count to see if there were actually 1800pcs in the wheel, but the wheel was packed full for sure.</li>
      <li>Other people even like them so much they have claimed them for their own paper crafts or nail art!</li>
      <li>12 pretty colors</li>
      <li>I love all of the different color options and everything.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for too much is that the packaging could have been a lot better.</li>
      <li>I love these delicate rhinstones, they are tinny,and when placed together for my art, my work takes on a unique sparkle!</li>
      <li>This item came fast and it is a cute little accessory to add to your nails if your into the whole nail art thing</li>
      <li>the actual wheel doesnt look as full as the one in picture.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be as small as they are) and I&#x27;m pretty sure there isn&#x27;t 1,800 rhinestones in the wheel I received...</li>
      <li>The rhinestones are super duper tiny</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it to any nail enthusiast who loves a little bling :)</li>
      <li>However they rinestones seem to vary in size but not by much and the wheel was alot smaller</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with them since it was only a few dollars.</li>
      <li>It took a few weeks to arrive from overseas, but well worth the wait.</li>

<li> Look pretty but extremely hard to work with</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a black (most are just dark brown).</li>
<li> I just painted my nails and placed the rhinestone where I wanted it to be, pressed down on it a little, and then applied one to two coats of clear over it</li>
<li> The gems were all well sorted in their individual slots with maybe a few scattered during shipping.</li>
<li> These are just what I expected!</li>
<li> there is so few they don&#x27;t even cover the bottom of the tray in each section....</li>
<li> i wouldnt mine the poor quality of rhinestones as im going to use for nails then throw them away when i take off the design, but with this limited number of pcs i wont be doing what i planned.</li>
<li> I get compliments from anyone who sees these delicate stones attached to my art.</li>
<li> THESE RHINESTONES ARE NOT GOOD</li>
<li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND THE RHINESTONES ARE VERY PLASTIC POOR QUALITY</li>
<li> What a mess!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s miserable to try and find the colors I want/need without spilling half on the floor because the rhinestone organizer it comes in is broken!!!</li>

    <li> Great price. This was very much worth it and I highly recommend it to any nail enthusiast who loves a little bling :)</li>
    <li> Nice choice of colors for nail decoration. Great value but wish I would have bought one size bigger than this.</li>
    <li> I got these all the way from Hong Kong and they didn&#x27;t take forever to get. Other people even like them so much they have claimed them for their own paper crafts or nail art!</li>
    <li> THESE RHINESTONES ARE NOT GOOD THEY ARE TINY LIKR POPPY SEEDS ON A BAGEL.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t count to see if there were actually 1800pcs in the wheel, but the wheel was packed full for sure. The variety of colors is just what I was looking for and the size is good. The gems were all well sorted in their individual slots with maybe a few scattered during shipping. Everything was well contained otherwise. Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> the actual wheel doesnt look as full as the one in picture. i wouldnt mine the poor quality of rhinestones as im going to use for nails then throw them away when i take off the design, but with this limited number of pcs i wont be doing what i planned.</li>
    <li> I love these delicate rhinstones, they are tinny,and when placed together for my art, my work takes on a unique sparkle! I get compliments from anyone who sees these delicate stones attached to my art.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not 1800 but it&#x27;s a large amount of gems and the color is excellent. I&#x27;m really pleased with them since it was only a few dollars. Had I gone to my local Beauty Supply store I would have paid over $8 for a wheel of gems that only held a hundred or so.</li>
    <li> Product was as ordered and on time. Was exactly what I needed. Colors were just what the information said it would be.</li>
    <li> i got like maybe 600 pieces.... there is only about 50 of each color....  there is so few they don&#x27;t even cover the bottom of the tray in each section....</li>
    <li> my daughter put these to great use!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipper and great prices!</li>
    <li> Look pretty but extremely hard to work with</li>
    <li> These are as described.  They are a good size for accents on nails.</li>
    <li> Great size and colors... I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a black (most are just dark brown). Love my manicure and pedicures!</li>
    <li> I have been obsessed with doing nail art in my own home experimenting on myself and other family members! I love all of the different color options and everything. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for too much is that the packaging could have been a lot better. In my opinion there could have been a possibility of it breaking in some way.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, the rhinestones are like they are portrayed in the picture. My only criticism is that when they arrived they were very static and stuck to the top of the lid, but after I fixed it it was okay and the fact that they were static is not the sellers fault.</li>
    <li> I bought these to add a bit of sparkle in my nail designs. There is a great variety in color and they seem to hold up pretty well on my nails and they look great. However they rinestones seem to vary in size but not by much and the wheel was alot smaller then i thought it would be. But they do the job and overall these are great for the price!</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are nice and they were just as described.  It takes a pit of practice getting them on but once they are they add a nice bling to your design.</li>
    <li> These are cute and the perefect size! They&#x27;re easy to apply to the nail. I didn&#x27;t even need glue! I just painted my nails and placed the rhinestone where I wanted it to be, pressed down on it a little, and then applied one to two coats of clear over it and they&#x27;re holding up just fine!</li>
    <li> IT DOSE NOT HAVE 1800 AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;EACH SECTION HAS MAX 75!!!!!!!!!!  SOME ONLY HAVE 45!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I COUNTED EACH SECTION MYSELF I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND THE RHINESTONES ARE VERY PLASTIC POOR QUALITY</li>
    <li> Fun colors and great for nails</li>
    <li> These came just as decribed and pictured. It took a few weeks to arrive from overseas, but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> My item arrived a week earlier than estimated time which is awesome... The colors I received are cute, but in the description it says \\&quot;Color: as pictures shown\\&quot;, but my colors look nothing like those images...The rhinestones are super duper tiny (I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be as small as they are) and I&#x27;m pretty sure there isn&#x27;t 1,800 rhinestones in the wheel I received... but I&#x27;m sure these will come in handy for me somewhere down the line... I&#x27;ll add some pictures...</li>
    <li> The package arrived looking great on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it there was glitter all over the bag that the rhinestones came in.&lt;br /&gt;All the colors were mixed. What a mess!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s miserable to try and find the colors I want/need without spilling half on the floor because the rhinestone organizer it comes in is broken!!!</li>
    <li> These are just what I expected! 12 pretty colors and i cant wait to use them all!</li>
    <li> This item came fast and it is a cute little accessory to add to your nails if your into the whole nail art thing</li>
    <li> I have just gotten into the nail art for me and my girls and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments.</li>
