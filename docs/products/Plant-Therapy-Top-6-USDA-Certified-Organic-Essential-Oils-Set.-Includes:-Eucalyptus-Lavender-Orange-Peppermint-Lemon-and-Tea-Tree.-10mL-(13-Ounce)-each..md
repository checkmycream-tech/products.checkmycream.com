      <li>It&#x27;s no &amp;#34;Young Living&amp;#34; oil, but it is a really great cheap alternative.</li>

      <li>Satisfied with oils, they all smell good.  </li>
      <li>am still really loving these oils.</li>
      <li>Great set of some of my favorite oils - if only it included rosemary it would be a perfect box.  </li>
      <li>Very strong-</li>
      <li>The oils are pretty good but don&#x27;t seem very strong.</li>
      <li>Use in diffuser to make living room air refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love my oils.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
      <li>So glad we ordered it...</li>

      <li>These are wonderful essential oils for the price.</li>
      <li>So, I would say I love what I got and will order again.</li>
      <li>great smell, arrived on time and as describe it , thanks</li>
      <li>I wish though they had a kit with more oils.</li>
      <li>Excited to reap the benefits of ALL of them!</li>
      <li>It includes a good selection of oils at a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>The oils themselves are just as strong as the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; oils I had gotten samples of and have worked beautifully in my diffuser, topically, and ingested.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy all the relaxing sent.</li>
      <li>I hooked up with the big D and still was so happy EO&#x27;s came into my life.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy, on my research, fit all my needs.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic company.</li>
      <li>May be some others with more well known name but as with anything else price is also a consideration especially of the ingrediants are of good quality and all one is paying for is the name.</li>
      <li>These seem to be exactly what I wanted so, so far, I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price, quality not as good as more expensive oils.</li>
      <li>The set arrived in great shape in a cute little box.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying the variety of oils and learning to mix them and create my own facial and moisturizing products.</li>
      <li>I going to have to buy more very soon.</li>
      <li>Came quick.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the lavender it just doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as other lavenders I bought before.  </li>
      <li>The oils seem potent and appear clear as they should.</li>
      <li>I purchased a Smile Daisy and bought these oils.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about is that I got cinnamon bark and Vanilla instead of tea tree and orange.  </li>
      <li>These are just right</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as many drops compared to other brands when making my many potions ;] Will continue to buy from Plant Therapy.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Enjoying finding out what I can do with the essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they were substituted when the description lists exactly what you are supposed to be getting.  </li>
      <li>After dealing with a few friends who have been using oils and are engaged with &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; companies, I decided I needed to try a brand with good reviews that I could afford.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use it for household cleaners and fragrance, but this set isn&#x27;t fit for an essential oils first aid kit.</li>
      <li>The lemon was pure and rosemary too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice little set for the price.</li>
      <li>didnt really include if they even understood quality in oils.</li>
      <li>and she really enjoys the oils for diffusing.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really tell whether they&#x27;re organic or not..</li>
      <li>so not the whole case,</li>
      <li>I would recommend this set to anyone and have put many of the other oils I want to try on my Amazon</li>
      <li>The other essential oils are good so far.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them highly</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this company.</li>
      <li>If I had just done a little more digging.</li>
      <li>If you do your essential oils research you&#x27;ll find that the lavender oil included in this kit is not species used for most topical applications and the peppermint oil is actually corn mint, not peppermint.</li>
      <li>My daughter had a stuffy nose and the Eucalyptus and Lavender helped her sleep and helped to clear her breathing.  </li>
      <li>Neither was plant therapy, BUT plant therapy took up the costs for pulling their tea tree oil product until they fixed it and took care of business and sent back a new sample.</li>
      <li>The potency remains strong after initial purchase a few months ago.  </li>
      <li>I am new to essential oils and got them to put in our humidifies that we have on our wood burning stove.  </li>
      <li>The oils are high quality and this is my second or third set.</li>

    <li> Great quality stuff! It&#x27;s no &amp;#34;Young Living&amp;#34; oil, but it is a really great cheap alternative. Will buy again and recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Enjoying finding out what I can do with the essential oils.  The only thing I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about is that I got cinnamon bark and Vanilla instead of tea tree and orange.  I don&#x27;t know why they were substituted when the description lists exactly what you are supposed to be getting.  I will use them anyway, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this.</li>
    <li> Very nice beginners set.  Gave to daughter and family for a Christmas gift and she really enjoys the oils for diffusing.</li>
    <li> This set has been great to have.  I put a couple of drops of the lavender in my diffuser at night.  Smells great, not too strong.  All the oils are equivalent to the very expensive MLM companies&#x27; oils.  I highly recommend this company.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Smile Daisy and bought these oils.  My daughter had a stuffy nose and the Eucalyptus and Lavender helped her sleep and helped to clear her breathing.  She loves watching the lights and setting it all up herself.  I plan to buy more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with oils, they all smell good.  Fast delivery! Very happy with quality of oils.&lt;br /&gt;Just what I needed</li>
    <li> These seem to be exactly what I wanted so, so far, I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want bigger bottles.  These are just right</li>
    <li> If you do your essential oils research you&#x27;ll find that the lavender oil included in this kit is not species used for most topical applications and the peppermint oil is actually corn mint, not peppermint. I&#x27;ll use it for household cleaners and fragrance, but this set isn&#x27;t fit for an essential oils first aid kit. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great price, quality not as good as more expensive oils.</li>
    <li> Love my oils. Have been using them in my diffuser and am quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Have been using Plant Therapy products for over a year and I love them.</li>
    <li> Great selection!  Especially like the lemon and lime.  Use in diffuser to make living room air refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the variety of oils and learning to mix them and create my own facial and moisturizing products.</li>
    <li> A great set, at a great price!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. May be some others with more well known name but as with anything else price is also a consideration especially of the ingrediants are of good quality and all one is paying for is the name.</li>
    <li> I love plant therapy oils and this set has a great selection of oils.  Its a great buy!</li>

    <li> Great set of some of my favorite oils - if only it included rosemary it would be a perfect box.  The oils are high quality and this is my second or third set.</li>
    <li> This package was great for starter.  I enjoy all the relaxing sent.</li>
    <li> Nice little set for the price.</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils and got them to put in our humidifies that we have on our wood burning stove.  I and smell them when I get close but I am afraid to put to many drops in as I do not want to over run our allergies.  I know what the lavender and eucalyptus are great for us to be able to breath or when I have a sinus headache.  My husband has had trouble with his allergies here lately and he has no idea why he is not bothered when he is inside so I know they are working.  I want to mix some of the oils but not sure what they will do to me... have bad allergies...do not want to make it worse.  So, I would say I love what I got and will order again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the lavender it just doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as other lavenders I bought before.  The other essential oils are good so far. Can&#x27;t really tell whether they&#x27;re organic or not..</li>
    <li> I bought organic Rosemary and Organic Lemon... so not the whole case, but I am also a Doterra sales person. I hooked up with the big D and still was so happy EO&#x27;s came into my life. I threw money away on that. Damn. If I had just done a little more digging. I found out today that there is a third party tester online who says the big D and YL arent compliant in their stuff. Neither was plant therapy, BUT plant therapy took up the costs for pulling their tea tree oil product until they fixed it and took care of business and sent back a new sample. That sample was compliang. D and YL are kind of b**chy. They are overselling on their products and its a shame. I do not want to do buisiness with either company. And Ill be continuing my business with plant therapy. The lemon was pure and rosemary too.&lt;br /&gt;I know my oils. I used to think people who wrote reviews didnt really include if they even understood quality in oils. I do. This is a fantastic company.</li>
    <li> After dealing with a few friends who have been using oils and are engaged with &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; companies, I decided I needed to try a brand with good reviews that I could afford.  Plant Therapy, on my research, fit all my needs.  The set arrived in great shape in a cute little box.  The oils themselves are just as strong as the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; oils I had gotten samples of and have worked beautifully in my diffuser, topically, and ingested.  I would recommend this set to anyone and have put many of the other oils I want to try on my Amazon wish list!  Excited to reap the benefits of ALL of them!</li>
    <li> I took a chance on buying these oils as not knowing this company.  they are really great.  I would recommend them highly</li>
    <li> These are wonderful essential oils for the price. Very strong- I don&#x27;t need to use as many drops compared to other brands when making my many potions ;] Will continue to buy from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Oils were as described and smelled great! My wife won&#x27;t stop using them.  I going to have to buy more very soon.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this kit. It includes a good selection of oils at a reasonable cost. The oils seem potent and appear clear as they should. They work well in a diffuser or topically. I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*JUST AN UPDATE: 5/1/15&lt;br /&gt;I am still really loving these oils. The potency remains strong after initial purchase a few months ago.  I am buying 2 other boxes for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend these oils.</li>
    <li> A really great set of oils!  So glad we ordered it...</li>
    <li> Some of the lemon was spilled when I received the package bc they are laid sideways in the box. The oils are pretty good but don&#x27;t seem very strong. I had to use quite a bit of the bottle to scent a spray bottle of homemade cleanser. I will try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> great smell, arrived on time and as describe it , thanks</li>
    <li> Great price! Came quick.</li>
