<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok . Not sure about product as of now .. takes 30 days or so to see results</li>
    <li> Great product, horrible packaging because the top will not stay on bottle.  Majority of the product spilt from a faulty lid.</li>
    <li> Love to slather this on my face, neck, arms and hands. I soaks in quickly and I feel moisturized for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Tried this Vitamin C serum hoping to clear some damage, not expecting a huge change especially from something that cost less than $20. This stuff works great, and I will be back, thanks!</li>
    <li> The price was excellent! Never used it before but with the concoction my friend gave me I&#x27;ve had excellent results</li>
    <li> Have not really had it long enough to tell if it is making a difference</li>
    <li> I have used several vitamin c serum at 20%.  This has no smell and he feels like water going on your skin.  I have used it a couple of times and I am not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! its made my skin smoother and I can really tell a difference since I started using this. It smells really good too which is important to me because Im very sensitive to scent. Also, its helped to keep my skin moisturized but I don&#x27;t get oily during the day. Been using day and night time and I think the quality is very high.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of vitamin C serums since they have changed my skin for the better.  I have combination skin.  My nose, cheeks, and chin can feel rather dry and get sort of flakey and my forehead and eyelids like to get really greasy by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve noticed that I get far less greasy at the end of the day if I am using a vitamin C serum and tend to also suffer from less dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;ll get brand specific.  I think Cosmedica offers a nice formula.  I think the white dropper top is extra cute! The serum comes in a glass bottle and is easy to transport. When first applying it has a light-amber-earthy kind of scent, but it goes away really fast in my opinion.  The serum isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky at all and quickly absorbs into my skin.  I think the jojoba oil and aloe in the product help keep my skin from getting dry and the witch hazel helps keep my greasiness to a minimum.  Overall it feels very soothing on my skin and seems to give my face a youthful glow.  The bottle says to apply a drop or two, but I find myself using anywhere from 4-6 drops.  Maybe I just have a big face, but that is what works best for me.  I apply after I wash my face and use my toner and have had great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face seems to have firmed up quite a bit and it helps keep my big pores clear and tighter.  My face seems a lot smoother when I use vitamin C serum as well and I rarely get a breakout these days.  The only thing I&#x27;d like this brand to improve or change is that I&#x27;d like to see the ingredients listed on the bottle label.  They are listed on the packaging, but I never keep my packaging and because I&#x27;m a nerd I like to look at the ingredients from time to time.  Other than that I can&#x27;t really think of anything negative to say, I really like this product and think it is a keeper. I received a sample of the serum for review purposes and am pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> a little oily than I expected</li>
    <li> Finally a great product that combines several into one and still works. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a short time, having relegated my multiple products to the back of the cabinet. I was heading out of town for a few weeks and, as you know, space it at a premium when you fly and only take carry-on luggage. When Cosmedica reached out to me to try this for my upcoming trip I was hesitant, but I agreed. I was hoping it would be at least OK, but I was so happy when I it worked as well, if not better, than the multiple individual products I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and fully absorbs quickly. I find that if I rub it in I have to wait longer and sometimes it&#x27;s a bit tacky. Instead, tapping it onto my skin with my fingertips gives me better coverage and a more flawless application. It felt great under my makeup and after hours in the sun sightseeing never once did I feel it. It kept my skin protected from the sun and hydrated in the intense desert heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the price and the great value received. Since it replaces several products it&#x27;s not only quicker to get ready, but it saves money (to buy more lipstick and eyeshadow!). As a 40-something it&#x27;s important that I take greater care of my skin and I like being able to use one product for day and night. I use this before I go to bed and when I wake up my face feels fabulous. I&#x27;ve noticed (and others have too) that my skin is more luminescent and hydrated. I also tap it onto my neck and chest after a long day in the sun as a way to help the skin repair.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the Cosmedica Hyaluronic Acid, and after reading reviews that this blend of  Vit. C, E, and Hyaluronic acid worked even better, I splurged on spending the $25 for it. Sadly, it seems to make my acne flare up. I&#x27;m going to have to stick with their Hyaluronic Acid, which is wonderful for my skin, and only use this about once a week. Although this isn&#x27;t something I can use everyday, it has a great consistency, absorbs quickly, and helps provide moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum thinking it would be a lesser expensive alternative to another serum I was paying $35 for. It feels like you&#x27;re applying water, not a moisturizer, to your skin. I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and I thank you for making this transaction a very pleasant one. I am enjoying the use of this product!</li>
    <li> Use this after derma roller......Love It! Great for collagen  production! Will definitely buy again. Fast delivery. The dark bottle ensures it stays clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this serum. I noticed an improvement within just a few days. My skin was smoother and it works well with makeup</li>
    <li> I USE IT TWICE A DAY AND THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYES AND LIP AREA ARE DIMINISHING. IT FEELS AND LOOKS LIKE IT IS TIGHTENING MY SKIN MINUTES AFTER I APPLY IT. I JUST PURCHASED TWO MORE BOTTLES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have tried many vitamin C / correcting serums and was quite shocked at the results of this product. My sunspots and blotches have vanished! It even works on my occasional acne and red spots. People began complimenting me on my complexion within a week of use. I use it twice a day and can&#x27;t go without it now. Absolutely a must-have for me. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new shin care. I do not know why it took so long to find out about these products.</li>
    <li> Noticed no real change.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I&#x27;m an aesthetician and I used in my cabin!</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. Makes my skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate, not even around my eyes. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I kind of liked it. I probably would order again.</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c serum! This is my second bottle and I will continue to repurchase. The consistency is nice and it absorbs into my skin easily and quickly. I use it by mixing a couple drops with another serum and 1 drop of rose hip seed oil. My skin seems to be brighter since using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin C, I use it myself and bought one for my Aunt who has hyperpigmentation and her skin is now even. Her friends at work noticed the difference too.</li>
    <li> I just received this last week and have been using it for only four days and I can already see the improvement in my skin.  I love that it has vitamin C, vitamin E &amp; hyaluronic acid in one bottle and yet, is so gentle on the skin.  My skin is brighter, smoother, and clearer.  I was previously using the Perricone MD Vitamin C serum, but I noticed better results from this serum AND it&#x27;s a lot more affordable!  I will definitely be using this for years to come.  Excited to try Cosmedica Skincare&#x27;s other products!</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week so far and initially I had some qualms about it as it was not as thick as I had expected, (in the past, I have used Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum). I wanted to try a Vitamin C serum as I read in a magazine article how Vit C is best for moisturizing your skin... I also previously tried Body Shop&#x27;s Vit C moisturizer and loved that. I am starting to love this serum... it&#x27;s definitely growing on me. It has a neutral scent and is easily absorbed by my skin. I only use a few drops of this at night and I definitely wake up with my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> It last for about 1.5 month. Sometimes I use it on my neck too. I feel that is a nice way to give vitamins to my skin. You will see improvement in the first week. 15 minutes to absorb before to apply anything on top. Use sunscreen broad spectrum and go out 15 to 20 minutes after</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum has a gel like texture non greasy. A little goes a long way. Maybe a little wet need to wait a few seconds to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
    <li> After 12 days I find no real difference in appearance but softer skin.</li>
    <li> I received my product with no interruption and with a quick turn around.  The product has been included in my daily beauty regimin.  I have noticed a brighter appearance in my skin tone and complexion.  I also have been using the serum on my neck and upper arms.  All areas have improved in tone and complexion.  I still have product to use a little lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> We have been on vacation &amp; will be for another month.I will review it when we return,thanks.Ask me in April</li>
    <li> A non-greasy, fast absorbing serum.  In addition to vitamin C, it also contains hyaluronic acid and ferulic acid, so you get the added hydration benefits along with dark spot correction.  You&#x27;ll notice the hydrating effects quickly, within a couple of days of twice daily use.  It may take several weeks to notice dark spots lighteneing.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I like it but I did not have enough time to see the results, but I really like the product I hope it solve my skin problems.</li>
    <li> This is the second serum I purchased from Cosmedica Skincare.  I like the product and my skin does too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product exactly as described. Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> Good price, great product, so far really liking what this serum does! Appears to have the same actions as the super expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Never noticed a difference after using all of this product. Used it as night after washing my face and I did not noticed a softer feel or a healthier look. No change at all :(</li>
    <li> If it is  Cosmedica Skincare it must be good and it truly is! No disappointment with this serum but highly satisfied and happy with this. Yes it truly works and I love applying it to my face. Apply it after washing the face and can be applied under a moisturizer. Not sticky at all and absorbs well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I  have used other serums in the past and I would not purchase this one again .  At first I was excited because it was thicker than the last product I had used and this product wasn&#x27;t so runny however when I applied it to my face I felt like I was just applying thick water.  My last product made my face feel soft and creamy and made my next products in my skin care regimen go on so much easier.  This product did not make my face feel soft or help my other skin care products go on.  I was very disappointed in this product.  I will use it until it is gone but I will not be purchasing it again;  There are other Vitamin C serums out there that are much better.  I really just felt like this was thick water.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C works just as well as the more expensive C that I&#x27;ve been buying for years.... But not anymore:)))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin serum for a month now and I love it. I have skin allergies/reactions to many things and cannot use most skin care products, make up, or sunscreens and this is one product I can use that is nonirritating to my skin. It goes on very light and does not leave the skin with a sticky feeling. It seems to have a brightening effect on the skin. I wear it under Neutrogena Pure and Free sunscreen. Very pleased with the product and the price is right - a bottle lasts for a month or so.</li>
    <li> This product is good. It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  I just wish it came in a larger size. Definitely worth purchasing and trying this out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s made out to do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ole Henriksen from Sephora (72$)- it&#x27;s good but way too pricey. So when i stumbled on this i thought it was too good to be true. its definitely not! i&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past 2 weeks and its made a drastic improvement. My pores look smaller, crows feet are a little softer but overall my skin just looks better, even got a compliment the other day! That&#x27;s why im swearing by this stuff, i cant say enough!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product or Cosmedica.  It really works.  I am not a skincare product junkie, but I have had the opportunity to try some really expensive products that made bold claims but DID NOT WORK.  This product does.  It doesn&#x27;t happen immediately, but no product can reverse sun/environment damage overnight.  I started noticing subtle brightening after about 2 weeks.  I thought I was imagining things, but I wasn&#x27;t.  Still, I waited to post this until now.  I have been using this product for about 7 months and I will continue.  I am also using their retinol serum, their hyaluronic serum, and their toner.  I love them all, and I am extremely impressed by their company.  I am grateful that such a company even exists these days.  They make excellent products that really deliver, and they are completely affordable.  This bottle lasts me about 5-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I gave this product the 5 star rating because its sheer effectiveness.  The texture of my skin is smooth.  The acne scars have faded. Wonderful product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> very smooth, works well love it</li>
    <li> great product!!. great for my skin</li>
    <li> firmly product, my face is smooth and firmly tiht and i love to buy more and look more youthful ever.</li>
    <li> Actually, it works wells. Clears the face up nicely smoothing out it out. I was drinking a lot if water too. That&#x27;s important. It tightens the skin as well. You can tell the difference in your skin. I will be purchasing again. Amazing results for my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I love that it has no parabens and has hyaluronic acid and a collagen booster along with a UV protection.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I think its a little to strong I do prefer only hyaluronic acid with out anything else I got a rash after using it.</li>
    <li> I could see a slight improvement but I&#x27;m too old to get much help from anything!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to add extra health and glow to my skin. I have uneven skin and vit C is good for evening skin tone. This feels really good on my skin, especially after harsh exfoliants like retinol or peels.  It feel like my skin drinks this stuff. I will prob repurchase</li>
    <li> the bottle opens easily,  each time I take it,  it is opened,  regardless the effort when I close it....maybe it is the reason for it is almost dried...I feel the product ok,  bye the container is the problem....</li>
    <li> Feels good on your face. Probably better than some of the very expensive serums. Buy it with hyaluronic acid bottle.</li>
    <li> Perfection in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ve used other stuff in the past and decided why not give it a try. Used for age spots and discoloration a on my cheek and it&#x27;s been about 5-6 weeks. I can tell the difference. I also use an organic argan oil on top of that after about ten kindred of the applications. I&#x27;m in my early forties and want to maintain supple and beautiful skin. both formulas together provide a non greasy soft feel and a glow. I throw on a little transluctsnt powder and my skin looks flawless.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I also know that Vitamin C Serum does give a stinging sensation that often subsides after a few days of use. I have used serums with HALF the percent of vitamin C as this one states (and vitamin E added) and have felt a STRONG stinging sensation. I just feel this product is NOT doing what it claims to be doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced there are active ingredients in this brand. My other one stings a bit as would be expected from vitamin c.</li>
    <li> I have been using vitamin C serum for quite some time and  recently stumbled upon  this Cosmedica Vitamin C - it is the best!  I use it everyday under my moisturizer and many have commented on my &#x27;glowing&#x27; skin.  It has helped to even out my skin tone and enhanced my skins elasticity.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as Obagi C Serum but it is a great product for the price. It would be a better product if the smell was fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like what this does to my skin.  It makes pores less noticeable.  Brightens skin and sort of stretches it out.  I mix it with essential oils and it works better.  Made of great ingredients for your skin.  I recommend this to those who are looking for a good ORGANIC vit C serum.</li>
    <li> I used to use Obagi, but it was getting way too expensive. I was turned onto this by a cousin of mine, and I really like it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and I can see and feel the difference. I was skeptical at first because of the low price point, but now I know that&#x27;s just another positive thing about this product.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price; excellent results. Will continue to purchase this item going forward. The strength of the Vitamin C strong enough to be effective.</li>
    <li> I like this vitamin C serum although I would like a serum that is stronger and I have found it in another product. But in the meantime this serum did a get job and I was happy to use it. My skin soaked it up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a time now, and it is different than a similar product I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.&lt;br /&gt;(Thought I was ordering the same product).  This one is heavier, but seems to be having a bit more of a drying effect on my skin.  Can&#x27;t decide at the moment whether I like it better or less than prior product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading reviews, I have to say it is pretty good for the price. I suffer uneven skin tone with dark marks. I started using on dark marks on jaw line, for head area and around outer eye area. I have to say with in a couple weeks marks were noticeably lighter, and skin around eyes and forehead were so smooth. I will purchase again. Product came on time as described. Very easy to apply no heavy smell and not oily. I apply before sunscreen. Wait until it dries completely then apply sunblock.</li>
    <li> This product seems to help skin hydration, but I have been disappointed in its effect on lightening spots of sun damage&lt;br /&gt;and age spots on face and backs of hands.  I am a senior with relatively good skin for my age;  perhaps it is more effective&lt;br /&gt;on younger skin,</li>
    <li> I consider myself very knowledgable and have made extensive purchases when it comes to skin care and this product doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.  When I tried to apply my foundation my skin started rubbing off.  I thought perhaps I could only use it in the evening, but the same thing happened when I applied my moistruizer.  I waited 2-5 minutes before additional products were applied to my face nothing helped.</li>
    <li> This serum is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily, so you can use it under makeup! I didn&#x27;t like the smell (wasn&#x27;t bad just not something I liked), but I added some of my favorite essential oils to it and then it smelled great! My skin is so soft and glowing after using this! I can definitely tell a difference! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
    <li> very satisfied so far! I have tried it for 2 days only and it looks very good to me just the same as Estee Lauder night repair that I used to buy which is twice expensive but the same effect. I will keep monitoring it to make final decision</li>
    <li> I have a rare autoimmune disease called &amp;#34;Sjogren&#x27;s Disease&amp;#34;.  Sjogren&#x27;s attacks the moisture producing glands in your body among other not so great things.  My friend who works in the skincare industry highly recommended this product.  I had been using straight Moroccan Oil and different types of oil on my face to no avail.  I tried this product and it has made a huge impact on my skin.  I use the Cosmedica serum first  and then I follow up with a product that esthetician use for treating patients after they have fractional laser therapy.  Combind both products have a a big difference in my face.</li>
    <li> It was not at all what I thought it was going to be. It&#x27;s very watery and absorbs into my fingers before it&#x27;s even applied to my face. Instead of saying Vitamin C Serum it should say Vitamin C Water. Not happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a week now. It was a tad bit irritating on my extremely dry sensitive mature skin. I started mixing the drops with coconut oil and that cured the irritation problem for me. My face is still wrinkle free, mainly concerned about my neck and chest. Havent seen any improvement yet but already feek like I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for awhile now, and it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Vitamin C Serum first to my face then wait a couple of minutes - then apply the Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Best-Selling-Hyaluronic-Pure-Highest-Anti-Aging-Paraben-free-Best/dp/B0090UJFYI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1403620911&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&lt;br /&gt;Also by Cosmedica Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum works to promote healthy skin and cell turnover, while the Hyaluronic Acid promotes hydration and skin elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked so good. It used to be very dry before using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise buying both products for full benefit.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite, well absorbing, feels light, not greasy. Perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and am very pleased indeed with the changes in my skin. I&#x27;m a recent convert to serums - never really believed in them before, or imagined they could do anything a regular moisturiser couldn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m now a total convert, astonished and astounded by how profound a difference this serum has made to my complexion. My skin looks and feels younger with a finer texture and a brighter colour than before. Age spots on my hands are noticeably faded.&lt;br /&gt;People who find the strong citrussy smell of some other vitamin serums will love this brand as it is almost entirely devoid of scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very good value as it goes a long way - I find three drops a day ample, The skin drinks it in. An absolute delight to use and the results have been amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cosmetica Vitamin C Serum with Vit E and Hyaluronic Acid going on nearly four weeks.  This product delivers 100%!  I am 38 years old, and regretfully, I had CO2 Fractional Laser in April to treat minor fine lines.  After the treatment, my pores became more pronounced, my skin less firm, my youthful plumpness went away, and my skin tone became uneven.  After using a 0.05% retinol based cream for six months per MD recommendation to speed up the healing process and after it failed to help, I didn&#x27;t have faith in anything.  I remembered an aesthetician once told me years back that Vitamin C is vital to use in conjunction with my moisturizers, so I decided to buy this cream after reviewing several brands.  Let me tell you (crying after all I went through), this product made me feel and look human again.  My pores have nearly disappeared, my skin looks brighter, and I have my cheeks back! Ladies, don&#x27;t let the price misguide you.  It worked for me, and this product will continue to be part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is one of the basics in my skincare regime since menopause. My skin looks quite good for my age now whereas before I began using vit C during the day (and retinol cream at night) it was starting to show its age.&lt;br /&gt;I live on a careful budget and found the vit C moisturizers to be hideously expensive and sometimes comedogenic. After much costly experimentation I discovered that any inexpensive oil free moisturizer can be the carrier for vit. C. I put a small squirt of moisturizer on my finger in the morning, put two drops of this vit C serum into the moisturizer and use on my face daily. A little goes a long, long way,&lt;br /&gt;Making my own moisturizer this way is not only cost effective it seems to be creating a more powerful vit C effect. My skin looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with one reviewer that it is hard to apply the serum directly. Putting a couple drops into oil free moisturizer works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> Been using about 6 weeks now, not sure if this is doing anything or not.</li>
    <li> As with their other products, fabulous value. No reason to pay more!</li>
    <li> This product has cleared my face up and smoothed out my fine lines. I love it and will definitely be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> Not quite sure yet at the results and not sure I ever will because of the faulty top.  It does not screw on tightly and the first night I got this I put it in my drawer on it&#x27;s side and it leaked all over my drawer.  So then I tried screwing it on tighter and I could see that it unscrews automatically.  I then tried storing it up right and when I close my drawer apparently it fell over.  It leaked again and there is barely anything left.  Not happy!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  I heard one of the doctors on Dr Radio on Sirius/XM talk about how serum products are good for the skin so I figured I&#x27;d buy one.  I did that last year and have been using serums ever since.  This time I bought this one and it feels nice and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m not interested in putting harsh acids on my skin so this does the trick - mild and natural.  I&#x27;m happy with it.l</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a few days, but it seems to be addressing my dry skin.  It is easy to use, is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using it for about two weeks and I can already see a difference. My skin is less dry and has a nice glow. I have been using it on a daily basis, especially after exfoliating. The formula absorbs into the skin and dries smooth. It has a clean smell that is not overpowering. I would recommend applying your daily moisturizer after it has absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The product is sold at a reasonable price compared to other products I have used in the past. I will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> This works very well. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used products with very similar ingredients of the combination of vitamins C and E.  Most gave adequate results and very expensive. Thank you Cosmedica for bringing a product that makes my skin look and feel fabulous!!  I saw results on the first application of a brightening and beautiful softness.  The product is not greasy and is easy to apply. I love it so much that I bought it for my 16 year old daughter!!&lt;br /&gt;  Cathy G</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my skin, it has never looked better. My skin is so hydrated and smooth. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and I already see results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Every thing ok i hope take some theng from you again what you sell PLS tell me&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou for you</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Vit C Hyaluronic acid formula. My skin tends to become used to any  preparation so I alternate this with another serum. Between the two, I am seeing wonderful results. Still not a facelift, but much better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product as the price is reasonable and the product is good.</li>
    <li> We have used them for 2 months but we are going to keep on using&lt;br /&gt;for long time. We think it helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks but already my skin feels smoother. It feels a little sticky when I first apply it but once I get the moisturizer on top it feels fine. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this for my skin. Keep me looking great year after year. Shipping is always very fast</li>
    <li> Works great.  Half the price of Dr Gross that I have used.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed into the skin. Super hydrating !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all for trying things to improve my skin and look younger, I have to admit I bought this product because of the lower price in comparison to another brand of the &#x27;same&#x27; ingredients...just to try.  Well, I must say that I am very impressed with the results, I can totally tell the difference with this serum!  My skin has a new glow and smoothness that I didn&#x27;t expect but that I am most happy with.&lt;br /&gt;I am a new fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about two weeks. My skin seems to have brightened in clarity, but it has not yet faded any of my brown spots. I have a couple of spots on my face and hope that with daily and nightly use it will begin to fade them. I&#x27;ve heard that the main ingredient, Hyaluronic Acid, is great for moisturizing and plumping up the skin. I apply it and then I apply my day or night moisturizer over it. It does appear to plump my face and it keeps it very soft. Vitamin C is suppose to be very good at brightening the skin and fading spots too. I would recommend it and I will do another review in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have not used this long, but this is a wonderful product and does what it says.  Worth every dime!</li>
    <li> This helps with under eye puffiness!! I use it every night after cleansing my face. Big bottle!!! Wish definitely purchase more!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a few weeks, but so far, it is improved the skin tone on my forehead and nose areas. The skin looks and feel healthier and the pores have tightened. I have used a few drops twice a day and then applied a clear non-scented aloe vera gel on afterwards. I have had a bit of transient irritation and/or redness but that passes and it appears that it is related to the improvement in the skin. I plan to continue to use this serum.</li>
    <li> Would have given it more stars, but the darn cap won&#x27;t stay screwed on tight once opened. No matter how well closed, it unscrews itself overnight!  Must be due to the cheap rubber dropper top.  All of mine leaked out and now is gone after 2-3 uses...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Did not really notice much difference from this. I thought it would make my softer but it seems to dry it if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on.</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin loves it and I now use this twice daily as part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> vitamin C is good for your skin i have begun using it daily and have already started to see a change. i have less bags or darkness under my eyes, it helps me to keep that youthful glow to my skin and keep me looking fresh and it helps from getting over dried out from all the makeup and cleaners i use on my face. this 1 oz bottle is enough for about 2 months so its a very good value.</li>
    <li> Just like the name says, it&#x27;s the BEST!!! On my 3rd bottle. Wish it came in a larger size!</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this serum along with the pure hyaluronic serum from this same company.  I&#x27;ve learned quite a bit from my esthetician and vit c serum is a great antioxidant for every day use along with a SPF 30 or more.  I also apply the pure hyaluronic acid serum over this vit c daily &amp; then at night before my peptide/hyaluronic acid night cream (Derma e) all natural product.  I am 50 yrs old &amp; have been told ALOT this past year that I look like I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.  Have to say that always feels awesome!  I use several other products as well.  I will always try to keep up on what is best for my skin as I age.  I hope this info helps.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! I am on my second bottle and I can tell improvements in my skin!! My skin has a glow!! I will continue to purchase this serum as long as it&#x27;s quality remains consistent.</li>
    <li> Feels like your putting soap in your face. I didn&#x27;t see any changes on my skin not worth to try it</li>
    <li> Worth trying!!! You will see results !! Personally I thing it is a must have item. My face more clear and bright and tight and I don&#x27;t feel using foundation every day like before.  Enjoy !</li>
    <li> Having used Skinceuticals and Obaji for so long, I have not seen the results like I do with the others.  Price is great.  If you have not used Skinceuticals or Obaji, you may think it is great.</li>
    <li> I got this vitamin C serum for my acne because I heard vitamin C helps with acne. I use this product day and night on my face, neck, and back. It absorbs pretty fast into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy which is always a plus for me since I have oily skin. So far my acne is getting better and I have fewer acne marks since using this serum. When you are applying this serum you don&#x27;t need that much of it at all to cover your face and neck. I received this product for free to test and review so I can give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> takes time to know if a cosmetic product works</li>
    <li> Skin looks better all ready</li>
    <li> THE OTHER PRODUCT - TERRIFIC MOISTURIZING DURING NIGHT - NO WRINKLING  DURING THE NIGHT - ALSO WEAR UNDER MAKEUP IN DAYTIME.  I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN - AND WAS REASONABLY PRICED - ARRIVED WITH ALL SAFETY SEALS.  JUST A FINE PRODUCT FOR AN ANTI-AGING PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> great serum. As good as one I&#x27;ve been for several years that is three times the price</li>
    <li> This is a good serum product to help with age spots and brighten and smooth out a complexion.  I use it either in the morning under my face lotion or in the evening when I have cleaned my face.  Light and just a few drops are all you need but the Vitamin C %  really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> The serum tightens as it dries but doesn&#x27;t feel tight.  It leaves my face so smooth and ready for moisturizer.  I don&#x27; want to be without it!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected second time it was totally liquid caused burn on my skin do not buy</li>
    <li> runny like water, saw no difference. wouldn&#x27;t recommend. After trying this liquid water serum for a few weeks, I bought Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting &amp; Illuminating Serum and I can see a difference. It is a lotion not watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this C Serum</li>
    <li> So far, I like it.  We shall see if it does anything when I&#x27;ve had time to use it more. I like how it spreads easily and then dries quickly.  I hope all the positive reviews that convinced me to try this were right:)</li>
    <li> im not happy with this product at all. It felt like i put water on my face and didnt help with anything!! Im very unhappy with this, I was so excited to get it too. And this bottle was gone in 2 weeks and all i did was use it on my face and neck 2x a day.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference after just a week or so. I am concerned that the bottle won&#x27;t last very long though. Maybe 2 mo max</li>
    <li> I have been using this morning and night for a few weeks now and my skin feels so smooth. Oh, and I&#x27;m 61. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to tell the exact impact, because I am using a concoction of these, including halcyonic acid, but I am noticably smoother and look younger.  Who can ask for me?</li>
    <li> Fantastic product,  after first week saw already reduced lines,  skin feels hydrated and has a healthy glow</li>
    <li> Fabulous.  This really works! Xoxo</li>
    <li> I did not love this serum. I actually sent it back, which is rare for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Skinceuticals or Obagi for years and got sick of the ridiculous prices. I tried another serum prior to this and liked it, but thought I would venture out, as this one was even less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s more of a gel than a serum. Also, it&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t really seep into your skin. It obstructed my moisturizer (really just a sun block) from getting into my pores and left a layer on my skin. Check my other reviews - the other brand is better for not much more!</li>
    <li> Have not had it long enough to know if it is helping, or if I just think it is.  Jenny</li>
    <li> Works great. Gentle on skin. Love the other products by same company. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!..WILL SUBSCRIBE WHEN I CAN!!!</li>
    <li> Almost done with my first bottle of this and honestly I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s doing anything. I don&#x27;t see any changes at all to my skin. It feels the same and looks the same. In the past when I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C products on my facial skin I would feel a slight tingle after application which would make me think &amp;#34;it&#x27;s working&amp;#34;. Not this product. Call me crazy, but I would like some sign that it&#x27;s working either in the application, or the results after over a month. I will probably go back to my old standby Vitamin C product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how vit. C it contains. I used  to use Obagi vit. C 20% and after awhile it turns slightly yellow  which indicates that exposed to air vit. C does yellow</li>
    <li> Great value for the money</li>
    <li> My skin looks good- Great price- tons of vitamins no alcohol and no fragrance- compares easily to a $100 dollar offering by the big companies.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and no funky smells!</li>
    <li> Yes,  that&#x27;s what I did; I took a chance to see if this is all what it says to be. Even my dermatologist agrees to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I like how this cerium is more thick,and not watery like others I had bought.made my face feel moisturized,and great.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this. Ive been getting so many compliments lately and I will continue to use this serum regularly. The fine lines around my mouth, forehead are definitely lighter and overall my skin just looks brighter and less dull. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUECT, WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Good product I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product and its a must have to keep my skin healthy and glowing. If my mother say never go to work without eating your breakfast, then I say never go to sleep without applying this to my face before bedtime. Healthy glowing skin makes my day happy when I am with my friends especially when they ask if I still go to my dermatologist because of my beautiful skin. Much cheaper than what my dermatologist recommend but it gives me same result. My friends always say, I look like 10 yrs younger.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Works well, and true to it&#x27;s label.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a skincare junky and have tried many products from cheap to expensive. I was looking for a serum that wasn&#x27;t $75.00 to $150.00 as so many are. After researching the company online and reading the reviews, I will describe the product and give my opinion of it and how well it worked. I am 49 years old, have oily skin and, live in a humid climate so I have always taken excellent care of my skin. I have a microdermabrasion and a beta peel every six weeks. With that said, my skin loved this product. It is a serum that has a gel like consistency that went on smooth without stinging or causing redness. There was no fragrance or film left on my face. For those of you who said it made no difference, I wonder If having at least a lactic acid peel first would help with the effectiveness of the product. Lactic acid is very mild and safe for most people. This helps remove dead skin and helps remove spots. It takes time to see results especially if there has been a lot of sun damage and neglect to the skin. I keep mine in a wine refrigerator to preserve the integrity of the product. I will continue to use this as I find it to work well and the price is fabulous. Many of the high end products are overpriced. I hope this review helped, feel free to ask questions if needed.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. I love the smell and it absorbs into your skin rapidly. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results but I&#x27;ve only used It once a day for a couple weeks.I have sensitive skin so I try products slowly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added this at night before I moisturize and I notice that my skin looks much brighter and livelier. I use it in combination with other products that exfoliate etc and have had a great improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum.  It has helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. It absorbs quickly in to my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel. My skin tends to be sensitive and this serum is perfect. I bought it because I love the money back guarantee and I am 100% happy with it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to heal acne scars and to reduce hyper pigmentation on my skin (on both the face and upper back). I have been using this product for a little over a week now and see a huge improvement. As an added bonus, I discovered that this serum also helps with eczema! I had a small patch of eczema on my upper back as well as a large patch on my torso. When I was applying the product to my upper back area (mainly for hyper pigmentation) I would also smear the serum over my eczema patch - it was sort of unavoidable (how I could manage to have acne and eczema in the same skin area is beyond me). I noticed my eczema clearing up there while the patch on my torso continued to suffer. Realizing that the serum was helping my eczema on my back I immediately applied it to my torso and within a day experienced relief and could see the skin was not flared up anymore. As I continue to apply the serum to my eczema patches I see that the skin is actually healing! I am going to buy more of this product very soon.</li>
    <li> Smooths and diminishes spots and fine lines...</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive serums in the past and i can honestly say this is of equal quality and a super deal..love the way  my skin glows</li>
    <li> Just started using this and I really like it.  Have seen improvement in my skin in 1 week.  Goes on smoothly without feeling greasy or smelling weird, like some of these serums do.  My skin seems clearer, softer and dark spots are fading.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this brand. I have previously  tried another  brand with the same percentage of C &amp; E and this one did not leave my skin feeling and looking supple as the other brand has. I had to mix in hyaluronic acid to get the same results as the previous brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with the portable high frequency and it works great. the quality of my skin has improved</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the miracle I would wish for, but it does as good a job - or even a little better - as products that cost 5 times as much.</li>
    <li> Nice serum that dries very fast and leaves skin feeling very smooth. You can Use under any skin cream or makeup.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel soft and smooth, I really like it and i will probably purchase it again in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product right out of the gate. I&#x27;m used to Skin Medica or Skin Ceuticals, but decided to try this on a whim given the low cost. It is really effective at evening out my skin tone and isn&#x27;t irritating at all to my super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this regularly--it gives me a great glow and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, great price. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> It is a great product I put it on after cleansing and before bed. I feel my skin is brighter!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brand and am not that impressed. Seems to soak in and is very dry.</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect from this product since this was the first purchase I have made from this brand. It is an amazing serum. I cannot explain how much my skin loves it! Quality, afordable and perfectly packaged.  A++</li>
    <li> I like their hyaluronic acid serum much better.  It was most likely a faulty bottle but I found it highly annoying that my brand new bottle didn&#x27;t have a good seal ensuring that most of the liquid spilled out in my carry on bag.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference with my skin so won&#x27;t buy again.  What you need to cover your entire face is a good amount so you will go through this pricey product pretty quickly. I will stick with my peel masks and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Would not do the skin care without the vitamin C</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make that much difference.  Guess it can&#x27;t do any damage?</li>
    <li> It seemed to work nicely - I dropped the bottle with a 3/4 of it already used - but yes I did like it and will buy it again</li>
    <li> very very good! brighter tighter skin. Ordering more!</li>
    <li> This serum is ok. The thin consistency helps it go into the skin but I haven&#x27;t see any big changes in my skin since using it</li>
    <li> Not nourishing as it should be, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> is my third bottle. just love it.will buy it again</li>
    <li> Why I cringe when seeing Vitamin C Cancer in serum products across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read this it is chilling to the bone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010 the actress Melanie Griffith went under the knife to remove skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare Oliver died from melanoma at age 26 long before she had time to worry about external signs of skin aging. However she did worry about sunburn and generously applied sunscreens while enjoying time at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies report that the most frequent users of sunscreens develop the same type of skin cancer that killed Clare (Beitner 1990, Autier 1998, Wolf 1998, Westerdahl 2000).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other studies demonstrate skin cancer incidence continues to rise in spite of the fact that more people are using sunscreens than ever before (Aceituno-Madera 2010, Jemal 2008).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the study is to stay away from any vitamin C or vitamin A formula that contains palmitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes sense to avoid palmitate in any form unless you’re willing to gamble with your skin. Unfortunately, manufacturers are now using liposome forms of ascorbyl palmitate making it impossible to know that you’re putting this ingredient on your skin. You’ll often find this ingredient in   very expensive formulas and is often listed as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate  or ascorbyl tretaisopalmitate. If you’re concerned about the vitamin C in your product, leave a comment and I’ll comment ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright © 2014 Felecia Rose Labs </li>
    <li> Not impressed that much.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin look healthier and younger, and affordable!</li>
    <li> Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. I seem to notice a difference in dark spots and I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks regularly.</li>
    <li> It is a good stuff! Makes my face clear! Love it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem quite as robust as the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic.  Maybe that&#x27;s why the Skinceuticals brand is $145.  I&#x27;m thinking there&#x27;s a lot less of the &amp;#34;Ferulic&amp;#34; in this formulation.  Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything or not.  I do feel little tingle when I put it on though.</li>
    <li> smells fresh and citrusy. a little sticky right after putting it on but sinks in quickly. just got it so don&#x27;t know how it will effect skin ultimately.</li>
    <li> I learned there was such a thing as \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot; while searching \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; for alternative eye creams. Not being familiar with it, I wanted to check it out as \\&quot;economically\\&quot; as possible. \\&quot;Cosmedica\\&quot; easily had the best price so I got a bottle from them. Really liked the stuff too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tried this vitamin C w/hyaluronic combo, and like it better still! Hydrates, and has a kind of a natural, satin like glow , AND, to me anyway, a moister feel, though you still need to follow the application with the moisturizer of your choice of course.i</li>
    <li> Price is great, but serum is not.</li>
    <li> COSMEDICA SKINCARE supplies many different products so that everyone can find the one that works best for their skin type. This serum is a 20% Vitamin C serum that enhances what each of us already tries with taking oral vitamin C daily. This corm of the miracle vitamin is now applicable to the skin surface where it does its joy in erasing the advancing fine lies of aging that are so much more noticeable in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 20% vitamin C is coupled with the antioxidants of vitamin E, Ferulic acid and hyaluronic acid serum so the serum is both anti-aging and antioxidant that control and repair the effects of sun damage to the skin (why did we love to sun bathe so much as youths?.....). In keeping with Cosmedica values no parabens or alcohol are used so nothing can harm or dry out the skin. Couple this with their moisturizers especially during the winter and when exposed to sun and note the dramatic difference. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
    <li> Within the first week of using this product I noticed a visible difference. It helped with some minor acne outbreaks and my skin feels better.</li>
    <li> Dried my skin out. Felt powdery on my skin. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just a few days and my lines are lighter and my skin is brighter. Definitely worth much more than it cost.</li>
    <li> The smell was awful. I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I only been using it for a week and as of now no difference. But will keep posted</li>
    <li> I use this once a day, in the morning and the hyaluronic in the evening and in two weeks noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Very good Serum. hydrated my skin nicely. You can definitely see a diference on your skin after a week of using twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;So far (3 weeks using it), I&#x27;m very happy with this serum. Will continue the use for sure.</li>
