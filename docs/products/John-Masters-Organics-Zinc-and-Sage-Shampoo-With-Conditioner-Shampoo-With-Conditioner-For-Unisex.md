### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful - and not just this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The smell is awesome!  </li>
      <li>My hair feels wonderful</li>
      <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis and this is the best organic shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
      <li>For best results, after rinse, use the Bourbon &amp; Vanilla  hair texturizer.</li>
      <li>John Master&#x27;s Orange &amp; Vanilla body-wash is also great.</li>
      <li>Even without, my hair looked great.</li>
      <li>But it did smell great.</li>
      <li>Plus its smell is amazing!</li>
      <li>So I feel good about using it from the standpoint of not using toxic substances on my body.  </li>
      <li>and I freaked out and ordered this shampoo after reading the good reviews.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bonus Points: It smells REALLY good.</li>
      <li>Even better is the fact that it is a shampoo and conditioner in one!  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Result is amazing.</li>
      <li>AMAZING . . .</li>
      <li>(Both smell amazing, by the way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes hair feel nice after washing though</li>
      <li>just ordered a bar soap containing zinc [Noble brand] to try on my face and scalp; we&#x27;ll see how that works out.</li>
      <li>I think this is an absolutely great product, is so good for my hair, ,,,,, the only thing is that i do need a bit of conditioner after it, but it is a great product</li>
      <li>I was looking for a shampoo with some sage, and I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I am super allergic to hair products, but this shampoo is allergy free for me, plus my hair looks great.</li>
      <li>I did not buy this from Amazon, but I feel compelled to write a review for many people to see.  </li>
      <li>i am going to repurchase this product for sure.</li>
      <li>My dandruff issue is over and my hair is more moist than ever.</li>
      <li>(This was not shocking, though, as I&#x27;ve never seen a shampoo/conditioner combo that works on curly hair).&lt;br</li>
      <li>...strong, silky, healthy.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived fast and when I opened it the smell was great</li>
      <li>This condictioner is ok.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Thank you John Masters!!!!!! - for creating a product that is healthy and works day in and day out.  </li>
      <li>There are many brands that cannot boast the ingredients list you get with John Masters.</li>
      <li>It may be my all-time favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Even so, I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>hope I have better luck with that brand.</li>
      <li>It is softer, smoother, more manageable and dare I say it...</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells delicious especially if you like sweet, vanilla cake-batter smell!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and beautiful with no residue.</li>
      <li>But the shampoo is so good I am overlooking the fragrance because your hair won&#x27;t smell like icing after the shampoo is rinsed out and you apply your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pure, organic product which is what I was looking for</li>
      <li>besides that smells very good, it does it double function and</li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp and hair feeling clean and more balanced.</li>
      <li>My hair tangles easily, and the built-in conditioner doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.  </li>
      <li>just too strong of a product for me</li>
      <li>which I have huge issues with to begin with.  </li>
      <li>I understand its lack of lather because it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to know your scalp and hair and how to treat it.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>However, and this is important, you cannot rely on one product to be a cure-all for your problems.</li>
      <li>ordered Enjoy instead.</li>
      <li>NOPE- cloying sweet vanilla frosting is the scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, we are very satisfied and will be buying this again.</li>
      <li>WOW, what a HUGE difference does that make!  </li>
      <li>i just didnt get the right feel out of it after using .. might work well for others ... try it out</li>
      <li>The zinc and sage shampoo cleans the hair and scalp quite well - it really feels clean.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say that this product proves that a 2-in-1 can actually work just as well as using individual shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients.</li>
      <li>Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap.</li>
      <li>I have tried every natural shampoo my local natural foods store has to offer and John Masters is the best by far.</li>
      <li>I very much appreciate a manufacturer who pays attention to providing a product that is non-toxic.  </li>
      <li>this because it&#x27;s the first organic shampoo I&#x27;ve seen with zinc and not loaded with silicone, parabens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product, but</li>
      <li>The shape of my hair truly looks different - and better.  </li>
      <li>I am totally sold :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and will be buying it again.</li>
      <li>I was pretty amazed.</li>
      <li>These products have ALOE VERA as the first ingredient and</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft or clean</li>
      <li>As expected, the shampoo was perfect, the dandruff disappeared after a few times and it seems to strengthen my hair as I noticed that I am not shedding hair as I used to before.</li>
      <li>for\\&quot; definitely rings true here!</li>
      <li>It really is pure aromatherapy in the shower.</li>
      <li>it smells so much like a dessert.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Note, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as drug store shampoo, but my hair still feels very clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but lasts a while and really makes a difference with the health of my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much though.</li>
      <li>Also I dont think it cleans the oil off very well.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing for my flaky scalp; in fact, it made it even itchier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have lots of extremely fine hair and used to struggle with an oily scalp coupled with dry ends, and tons of my hair came out during showers.  </li>
      <li>Finally an organic product that works, smells good and you can use it everyday.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My wife asked me to buy this shampoo after we spent quite some time looking for a good shampoo with natural ingredients that wouldn&#x27;t dry her hair and scalp out.  </li>
      <li>My naturally curly hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much</li>
      <li>Worth the extra money!</li>
      <li>It did take a few washes to get used to the scent, but now I really love it.  </li>
      <li>It leave&#x27;s my hair soft and clean, my scalp feels moisturized and is free of flakes, and I don&#x27;t smell like (imitation) flowers mixed with chemicals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos and this is the right one for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about this at first after reading many reviews of other shampoo/conditioner combos which all suggested the combination products were not as good at shampooing and conditioning as their individual counterparts.  </li>
      <li>part seems to live up to it&#x27;s name though, after a couple weeks my scalp seems happier and haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
      <li>Pyrithione zinc shampoos work great, but they contain sulfates which make my [very thick, very curly] hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat dry, unfortunate hair, and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I came across this shampoo + conditioner at Whole Foods one day and decided to give it a shot since it smelled like spicy vanilla and caramel and had ingredients that generally agree well with my hair and scalp (lots of aloe!).</li>
      <li>Her hair has been much softer since the first use, and she says that her scalp isn&#x27;t dry at all anymore.  </li>
      <li>Since using this product, I have been able to wash my hair every-other day without my scalp looking like an oil slick.  </li>
      <li>I usually put in some kind of leave-in conditioner as well, but recently I went on a trip and forgot it.</li>
      <li>Lather is moderate but keep in mind it is a natural, real organic shampoo and does NOT have Sodium Lauryl Sulfates.  </li>
      <li>and it does make your hair soft, but</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a natural option for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural shampoo with no luck.</li>
      <li>It lathers well and cleans without removing all the natural oils in my hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this shampoo at Whole Foods after reading about several products that are sulfate-free online.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Finally an organic product that works, smells good and you can use it everyday. Thank you John Masters!!!!!! - for creating a product that is healthy and works day in and day out.  Keep it up!!!!  John Master&#x27;s Orange &amp; Vanilla body-wash is also great.</li>
    <li> I understand its lack of lather because it&#x27;s sulfate free but it was just a horrible experience overall. And after 2 weeks of use (i gave it a chance) it left my hair dry and my scalp flaky. Ugh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Enjoy instead. hope I have better luck with that brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos and this is the right one for my hair type. besides that smells very good, it does it double function and the price is reasonable. For best results, after rinse, use the Bourbon &amp; Vanilla  hair texturizer.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells delicious especially if you like sweet, vanilla cake-batter smell!  In the dry winter months, my scalp gets dry and flaky so I was looking for something gentle and moisturizing.  Plus I recently had a nasty eczema flare up so I was looking for a natural option for my sensitive skin.  The flakes are less, but not gone.  It helps if I shampoo my hair twice using a much smaller amount the second time.  And it does not seem to irritate my eczema.  My hair feels wonderful...strong, silky, healthy.  Lather is moderate but keep in mind it is a natural, real organic shampoo and does NOT have Sodium Lauryl Sulfates.  No extra conditioner is needed.  I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural shampoo with no luck. This one is completely different. It leaves my hair soft and beautiful with no residue. I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell!! Worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> Obviously no shampoo is going to work for everyone since everyone has different hair, but for me this stuff works really well. It lathers well and cleans without removing all the natural oils in my hair. I have somewhat dry, unfortunate hair, and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Points: It smells REALLY good. The vanilla gives it a caramel smell that is not feminine... but it does smell like food and I want to eat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad Times: It&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s any better than any other shampoo other than the scent. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy this shampoo after we spent quite some time looking for a good shampoo with natural ingredients that wouldn&#x27;t dry her hair and scalp out.  Her hair has been much softer since the first use, and she says that her scalp isn&#x27;t dry at all anymore.  She loves the way it makes her hair feel, and that it doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy residue as some shampoos do.  Even better is the fact that it is a shampoo and conditioner in one!  I was skeptical about this at first after reading many reviews of other shampoo/conditioner combos which all suggested the combination products were not as good at shampooing and conditioning as their individual counterparts.  I am happy to say that this product proves that a 2-in-1 can actually work just as well as using individual shampoos and conditioners. Overall, we are very satisfied and will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo at Whole Foods after reading about several products that are sulfate-free online.  It did take a few washes to get used to the scent, but now I really love it.  My boyfriend says it smells like cake batter. &#x3D;) Note, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as drug store shampoo, but my hair still feels very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of extremely fine hair and used to struggle with an oily scalp coupled with dry ends, and tons of my hair came out during showers.  Since using this product, I have been able to wash my hair every-other day without my scalp looking like an oil slick.  Less of it comes out during washing, and it looks much fuller and very shiny.  The shape of my hair truly looks different - and better.  I have received several comments &amp; compliments since switching to this product.  I definitely recommend this product with one caveat - you may need a detangler or an additional conditioner.  My hair tangles easily, and the built-in conditioner doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.  I keep the \\&quot;no more tangles\\&quot; for children on hand, but I may also try the John Masters detangler.  Even so, I LOVE this product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but lasts a while and really makes a difference with the health of my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This condictioner is ok. I like that it is organic. I am a male and it seems to make my hair a little flat. With other shampoos my hair is really nice and fluffy. Also I dont think it cleans the oil off very well. Makes hair feel nice after washing though</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon, but I feel compelled to write a review for many people to see.  This stuff is wonderful - and not just this shampoo.  I use this along with the Rosemary &amp; Peppermint Detangler. (Both smell amazing, by the way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to find a product that has anything but WATER as the first ingredient.  These products have ALOE VERA as the first ingredient and WOW, what a HUGE difference does that make!  I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days and can already tell a major difference in my hair.  It is softer, smoother, more manageable and dare I say it...less hair falling out...which I have huge issues with to begin with.  I think I&#x27;ve found my product!  I just wish it was a tad less expensive for only an 8oz bottle...but the saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; definitely rings true here!</li>
    <li> I think this would be good for fake blonds but not peeps with dandruff</li>
    <li> I am super allergic to hair products, but this shampoo is allergy free for me, plus my hair looks great. I usually put in some kind of leave-in conditioner as well, but recently I went on a trip and forgot it. Even without, my hair looked great. I was pretty amazed. I&#x27;ve bought at least three bottles of this shampoo. It is expensive, but if you aren&#x27;t also buying conditioner, the price is in line with most other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking high and low for a natural shampoo with zinc to control the seborrhaic dermatitis on my scalp.  Pyrithione zinc shampoos work great, but they contain sulfates which make my [very thick, very curly] hair dry and frizzy.  So I tried John Masters Zinc &amp; Sage shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells AMAZING . . . like caramel and vanilla.  Seriously, you&#x27;ll want to drink the stuff &#x27;cuz it smells so much like a dessert.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s sulfate-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Did absolutely nothing for my flaky scalp; in fact, it made it even itchier.&lt;br /&gt;- The word \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; in the title is a joke, and nothing but a marketing ploy to make you feel like you&#x27;re getting two products in an attempt to justify the price.  There is nothing \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; about this product.  Could not get a comb through hair without using a seperate conditioner after this product.  (This was not shocking, though, as I&#x27;ve never seen a shampoo/conditioner combo that works on curly hair).&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft or clean&lt;br /&gt;- The price - absolutely outrageous for a little 8 oz. product, especially one that doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The percentage of zinc is not listed on the bottle, leading me to suspect that there isn&#x27;t enough of it to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a bar soap containing zinc [Noble brand] to try on my face and scalp; we&#x27;ll see how that works out.</li>
    <li> The product arrived fast and when I opened it the smell was great but after a few days of use it left my scalp dry and flaky.. Maybe it is just my hair type because I have had no luck with different shampoos before but this did not work for me. But it did smell great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo should be call an anti-aging product because my hair went from dull, dry and slightly damaged from color treatments to super shiny and silky. i am going to repurchase this product for sure. can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is. i need to add a conditioner at the ends though because i have long hair.</li>
    <li> I used to use Aubrey Organics shampoo but was not totally satisfied. I have a dry and curly/wavy frizzy hair. And even with AUbrey my hair was still dry..And recently I had dandruff issues.So I decide to give it a try.Result is amazing.My dandruff issue is over and my hair is more moist than ever. I also use the hair cream..I am totally sold :)</li>
    <li> I started having dandruff for a few weeks and I freaked out and ordered this shampoo after reading the good reviews. As expected, the shampoo was perfect, the dandruff disappeared after a few times and it seems to strengthen my hair as I noticed that I am not shedding hair as I used to before. Plus its smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this is the best organic shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet. It leaves my scalp and hair feeling clean and more balanced. My naturally curly hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much and it looks shiny without looking oily. However, and this is important, you cannot rely on one product to be a cure-all for your problems. It&#x27;s important to know your scalp and hair and how to treat it. This product in combination with other natural solutions (apple cider vinegar rinses, ending the washing process with cold water) can be quite effective.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product in anticipation that it&#x27;d resolve my dry, itchy scalp, which has plague me off and on for years. After rubbing the product into my scalp and letting it set for a few minutes while I shower, my scalp experiences a calm and soothing feel that feels like my scalp is healing. Through just a few days worth of application, I&#x27;m experiencing substantially less dandruff and itching. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I try to use natural products whenever I can, but as a guy with dandruff, my options are limited for hair care products that don&#x27;t leave me smelling like a flower orchid for the rest of the day. I came across this shampoo + conditioner at Whole Foods one day and decided to give it a shot since it smelled like spicy vanilla and caramel and had ingredients that generally agree well with my hair and scalp (lots of aloe!). It leave&#x27;s my hair soft and clean, my scalp feels moisturized and is free of flakes, and I don&#x27;t smell like (imitation) flowers mixed with chemicals. 9/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> just too strong of a product for me and it does make your hair soft, but i just didnt get the right feel out of it after using .. might work well for others ... try it out</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help with my itching, flaklng, and inflamed scalp. Half way thru the bottle, no difference noted as yet.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I use both this and the John Masters Lavender and Rosemary.  I have tried every natural shampoo my local natural foods store has to offer and John Masters is the best by far. It cleans without the dreaded clumpy, tacky texture of other natural shampoos. I would recommend any of the John Masters Conditioners as well.  It is unrealistic to expect to get a truly natural, nontoxic product for the same price as cheap drugstore products. Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap. You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients. There are many brands that cannot boast the ingredients list you get with John Masters.</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t lather much though. Also feels a little oily, but yet seems to makes my hair feel dry afterwards, so I definitely need to condition.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my hair quality from using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well enough for my dandruff.  The smell is awesome!  It really is pure aromatherapy in the shower.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think by the name it might smell like sage, or something (anything!) earthy...&lt;br /&gt;but NOPE- cloying sweet vanilla frosting is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;WTF?!&lt;br /&gt;Lame.&lt;br /&gt;Zinc part seems to live up to it&#x27;s name though, after a couple weeks my scalp seems happier and haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because it&#x27;s the first organic shampoo I&#x27;ve seen with zinc and not loaded with silicone, parabens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product, but the smell is so incongruous I only use occasionally.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo with some sage, and I am pretty happy with this product. I have oily scalp, and started to have few gray hairs, so I wanted to use shampoo with having sage (sage herb can help for gray hair) and cleaning my oily scalp well. But, as other reviewers mentioned, you definitely need extra conditioner.</li>
    <li> I think this is an absolutely great product, is so good for my hair, ,,,,, the only thing is that i do need a bit of conditioner after it, but it is a great product</li>
    <li> The zinc and sage shampoo cleans the hair and scalp quite well - it really feels clean.  It may be my all-time favorite shampoo.  The only thing I am not that crazy about is the fragrance - it smells like very sweet icing or candy.  But the shampoo is so good I am overlooking the fragrance because your hair won&#x27;t smell like icing after the shampoo is rinsed out and you apply your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pure, organic product which is what I was looking for and I really appreciate that - when you read the label you can see it is not full of chemicals.  So I feel good about using it from the standpoint of not using toxic substances on my body.  I very much appreciate a manufacturer who pays attention to providing a product that is non-toxic.  I continue to purchase this shampoo over and over again.</li>
