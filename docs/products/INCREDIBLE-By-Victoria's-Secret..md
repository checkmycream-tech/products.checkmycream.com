      <li>My fiance couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me after he caught a whiff of it, so that&#x27;s nice too ;)</li>
      <li>and I absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>, I sprayed it and it just smells like cheaply scented water.</li>
      <li>it lightly stated hi</li>
      <li>The scent is so nice, and my sister really loves that</li>
      <li>First of all, I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get this item for 4 more days -</li>
      <li>But then again, maybe that&#x27;s what the original smells like, and my chemistry doesn&#x27;t work with it.</li>

      <li>Second, I&#x27;ve never bought the original scent that this one is &amp;#34;impression-ing&amp;#34;, but the name of this one is very fitting because it indeed smells &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Not too over powering but just enough sent to smell good and pretty.</li>
      <li>There are 2 different types of amazing perfume the first I got</li>
      <li>But its ok cause I brought it for my teenage daughter</li>
      <li>for that money I would buy a better brend in perfect shape...  :((</li>
      <li>This has become my daughters &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and it mixes very well with her body.</li>
      <li>The bottle is nice and somewhat heavy.</li>
      <li>And I rip it open because I&#x27;m so excited</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find</li>
      <li>I was buying it at the Dollar General Store</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m really disappointed because it arrived,one brooken and  one without the top, so more then half was spiled out.</li>

<li> The fragrance is light and not very long lasting, but it could work very well to scent your drawers, so your clothes smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for 10 dollars, I&#x27;m not so disappointed.</li>
<li> Normally I get bored fast with fragrances but not this one.</li>
<li> Please note that I&#x27;ve never smelled the original, so this may be an unfair review.</li>
<li> Thought this was really Victoria secret, But its not...</li>
<li> some other perfume came in its place.  </li>
<li> so I ordered it to have brought down to Brazil.  </li>
<li> I will end up giving it away to my little niece.  </li>
<li> As soon as I unboxed it, I sprayed a little on my wrist.</li>
<li> This is absolutely dead on!  </li>
<li> I found the smell very ordinary, and not very appealing.</li>
<li> Too late to do anything about it.</li>
<li> just splurge on some real stuff, not this strong-scented crap.</li>
<li> smells NOTHING like Victoria Secret Incredible &#x3D;(  very disappointed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not pleasant and it&#x27;s no</li>
<li> I was disappointed it did not smell the same</li>
<li> Came fast,and Was supposed to smell like Victoria&#x27;s secret &amp;#34;incredible&amp;#34; but smells nothing like it..</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I am so glad I was able to find this! I got a sample for Christmas and I absolutely fell in love with it! Such a great sent! And a great price! Cant beat it! A++ seller!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Came at a great price for a single working mom to afford!</li>
    <li> This has become my daughters &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and it mixes very well with her body. This is the best deal on it.</li>
    <li> overbearing scent that gives everyone a headache. just splurge on some real stuff, not this strong-scented crap. passed this off to my &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> love this products used this item regulary.</li>
    <li> I got it this morning, before it was estimated to arrive. And I rip it open because I&#x27;m so excited, I sprayed it and it just smells like cheaply scented water. It&#x27;s not pleasant and it&#x27;s no where near VS incredible... Please just spend your money on a diff scent. Trust me.</li>
    <li> Thought this was really Victoria secret, But its not...But its ok cause I brought it for my teenage daughter she said its just right not too strong and not too sweet.</li>
    <li> Please note that I&#x27;ve never smelled the original, so this may be an unfair review. I found the smell very ordinary, and not very appealing. Similar to rotting fruit. But then again, maybe that&#x27;s what the original smells like, and my chemistry doesn&#x27;t work with it. I will end up giving it away to my little niece.  The bottle is nice and somewhat heavy. The fragrance is light and not very long lasting, but it could work very well to scent your drawers, so your clothes smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for 10 dollars, I&#x27;m not so disappointed.</li>
    <li> What I say but OMG I smell do sexy, lots of compliments on good I smell.  One of the guys I work with whispered in mu ear that I smelled delicious.... its that good</li>
    <li> smells NOTHING like Victoria Secret Incredible &#x3D;(  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been running out of my VS Incredible for a while now, but didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money to replace it.  This is absolutely dead on!  I will be buying this from now on rather than VS.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and very affordable!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. Normally I get bored fast with fragrances but not this one. 5/5 all the way!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 , to give them as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is let&#x27;say,OK for the price but I&#x27;m really disappointed because it arrived,one brooken and  one without the top, so more then half was spiled out.Shame!!!So for that money I would buy a better brend in perfect shape...  :((</li>
    <li> Amazing is all I can say.  I love this perfume.  I was buying it at the Dollar General Store but I can&#x27;t find it anymore  (One Christmas only).  I like the smell.  Not too over powering but just enough sent to smell good and pretty.</li>
    <li> I had a friend come over one day, loved the smell of her perfume.  So I took a chance and it was on amazon..  bought it love it</li>
