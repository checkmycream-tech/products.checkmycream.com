      <li>The curls by my forehead become limp and stringy from sweat, and unless I shower right after a workout, your curls tend to not look their best all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(I try not to was my hair too many times during the week, as I found my curls in better condition when I only wash them 1-2 times a week)</li>
      <li>Quick Cleanser really helps to freshen your hair and has a lovely fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use before going out at night, just as a quick refresher to give your curls a little lift and bounce at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This product line makes my hair low maintanece and looking amazing every time I style my</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>As low maintenance as my hair is, any curly girl that goes to the gym or does any sort of physical activities knows that sweat and curls don&#x27;t always have an ideal mix.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>This actually made my hair more greasy.  </li>
      <li>After each workout, I just spray the No-Poo Quick Cleanser directly on my scalp, and Voila, I get the curls that I have right after my hair dries after a wash and</li>
      <li>It recommends spraying the scalp in certain areas.</li>
      <li>On the bright side it took only one day for the Dry Shampoo to arrive at my house.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect dry shampoo for curly/wavy and thick hair.</li>
      <li>This was on the free standard shipping,</li>

      <li>Then I gently scrunch my fingers through my hair to distribute it.</li>
      <li>In the few days that I had the No-Poo Quick cleanser, I can happily report that I can have my Zumba class and my pilates without worrying about limp curls afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really super present in the No-Poo.</li>
      <li>and I disagree for my own hair but two striaght/thin haired friends of mine used it and found it made their hair greasier, so I truly believe this product was designed for thick and curly hair.</li>
      <li>Before I first sprayed my roots with water and then gave them a lift with pins and then sprayed hair gel to get the bounce and lift back.</li>
      <li>started working out once a day on average, and I can only wash my hair so many times a week.</li>
      <li>I expected this to work more like a dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>One of the key ingredients in the No-Poo Quick Cleanser that no other dry shampoo (at least the ones I tried) is Macadamia Nut Oil, which has amazing moisturizing properties.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on 2nd and 3rd day hair, even after exercising. It freshens my hair without drying it out or &amp;#34;gooping&amp;#34; it up like other sprays. Hair smells nice and scalp feels clean. It has been a game changer for me since my curly hair is so dry I can&#x27;t wash it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: I don&#x27;t saturate my whole head with it. It recommends spraying the scalp in certain areas. Then I gently scrunch my fingers through my hair to distribute it. That way it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair stringy and greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect dry shampoo for curly/wavy and thick hair. My hair is wavy and I tend to wash my hair 2-3 times a week. This product gives me an extra day (or two!!) I&#x27;ve seen the greasy reviews and I disagree for my own hair but two striaght/thin haired friends of mine used it and found it made their hair greasier, so I truly believe this product was designed for thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does seem to work quite well. Also adds great volume. The BIG issue, however, is the smell. It STINKS, which makes me the no twice before using it. Pretty great otherwise though.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> Great for a quick pick me up for your curls. I use this all of the time in the morning when I am on the go.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but really didn&#x27;t clean. Not effective at all.  I would not recommend this product. Drugstore brands are better</li>
    <li> I like this better than any other dry cleaner I&#x27;ve used as it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  It also smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t feel cleaner after using this.  I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair a lot because it&#x27;s fragile.  I straighten my curls sometimes and this definitely did nothing to the oiliness of my hair after a few days without washing it when it was straight.  I haven&#x27;t really used it with my curls, though.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! It sprays on quite nicely and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily. I shower every other day and I use this in between showers. I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>

    <li> I expected this to work more like a dry shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It made my hair appear more oily than it did originally. Its a bit mis-leading I think.</li>
    <li> My husband hates the way it smells. I think it&#x27;s ok. It does what it says, but I will be trying another product next, hopefully that does what it claims AND smells yummy.</li>
    <li> This product has a very pleasant smell, but I could not tell what function it performed.  Seemed to have no effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I over slept and didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, I followed the directions sprayed my roots and it was amazing!  I&#x27;m always playing with my hair or pushing it out of my face and it felt wonderful and smelled great, so I was told.</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the advice from the comments on this product because the smell is a little funky ... Unfortunately, I had already ordered it. On the bright side it took only one day for the Dry Shampoo to arrive at my house. This was on the free standard shipping, too.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, my curls look better. But, the smell..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, at least that&#x27;s what I told myself until a student at my school commented on the &amp;#34;putrid, chemical&amp;#34; smell coming from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hesitant to use this again, or at least the next time I use I&#x27;m covering it with my nice smelling, lavender spray from Deva Curl.</li>
    <li> Look, I am a HUGE Deva Curl fan. I swear by their Low Poo and the conditioners and i use the No-Poo despite the heavy fragrance. But that&#x27;s just it. They&#x27;ve got this signature fragrance thing going on - smells like lemon grass and something else slightly chemically I can&#x27;t identify. It&#x27;s really super present in the No-Poo. But you wash it off. So it&#x27;s bearable. But this? I mean there&#x27;s just no way. It&#x27;s like they were in a competition to make the strongest smelling product ever. You could almost pass out if you sprayed it in a small room with no windows. And it stays! Because it&#x27;s a dry shampoo so you don&#x27;t wash it out. Talk about disappointed. i tried it once, in case I was being silly, thinking maybe it would go away. After an hour (and two people asking me what the smell was) I had to go home and wash my hair. And give the product away to another product junkie friend of mine. Haven&#x27;t heard back from her yet.  Maybe there are people who aren&#x27;t sensitive to smells at all but you should know this is THE strongest thing I&#x27;ve ever smelt. And it ain&#x27;t roses.</li>
    <li> It made my hair greasier.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect additional to my collection of DevaCurl products.  Quick Cleanser really helps to freshen your hair and has a lovely fresh scent.  There was a little hic-up in my order, however the seller got everything fixed in a jiffy.  Great Seller Great Product</li>
    <li> I use this on the day I don&#x27;t wash my curly hair and it works well. Love the DevaCurl products ... This gives a nice, quick cleansing.</li>
    <li> Smells too strong and doesn&#x27;t really clean</li>
