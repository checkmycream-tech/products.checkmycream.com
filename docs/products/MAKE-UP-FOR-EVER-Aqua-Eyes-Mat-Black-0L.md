    <li> This is EXCELLENT. I don&#x27;t wear pencil liner every day- I use it mostly when I want to &amp;#34;tightline&amp;#34; (put on inner rims) and go very dramatic. But this stuff stays put and lasts forever. Very well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love it, makes my waterline really pop.  Long wear - i was used to drug store mascara and I love it</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly but definitely not waterproof</li>
    <li> This is the only eye pencil I use....and I have tried many. I have found this the only liner to stay on while I am diving! I know, some of us girls must be prepared for that underwater photo!?!?  Seriously, this Blk Mat 0L is my favorite. I only wish it came in a coffee brown.</li>
    <li> This ended up smearing after about 4-5 hours. I can&#x27;t figure out if I&#x27;m supposed to sharpen this with a pencil sharpener or if I have a defective roller in it.</li>
    <li> This is the first eyeliner out of all the eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used -in my almost 30 years - that has NEVER smudged! I don&#x27;t use primer either! I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many I&#x27;ve tried that have all claimed to be &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34;, but, gave me raccoon eyes anyway. As far as pencil eyeliners go, I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand except for this one ever again. It sharpens well, too - just dont be aggressive when doing so. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> For some reason, this eyeliner is incredibly easy for me to apply exactly where I want it.  It is creamy and goes on very smoothly...no pulling my skin at all.  It stays on all day, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with smearing or smudging.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not that good I expat it that it will be for long time in my eyes so I hope you bring bast than that</li>
    <li> good product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this item.  The first delivery to me went astray (probably stolen), and Sephora sent out a second package right after I notified them.  I didn&#x27;t have to pay any extra.    I got the second package and the product is really great!  Thank you again for all your help.  I will definitely use Amazon &amp; Sephora again.

    <li> I was hoping that this eyeliner would end the search. It will do but I wish there was some kind of eyeliner that was more permanent without getting permanent makeup. ;) That being said, it&#x27;s up there with the best I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
    <li> was hoping it would last through my workout but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> was not crazy about the price but glad i decided to purchase it wears well not much smudging easy to put on purchased the black now looking forward to more colors overall a great buy</li>
    <li> Very minor smudging: outlasts everything else that I&#x27;ve ever tried in eyeliner pencils! Maybe needs a touch-up on a 12-hour shift.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this eyeliner when watching the an Olympic Aqua-aerobics competition. It really stays on until you take it off! The pencil goes on smooth and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on like I had hoped.</li>
    <li> It is ok eye pencil, not so great, I will not repurchase. There are way better and cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!  The only improvement would be to make it a twist up... You have to push a q-tip into it to make the eyeliner come up.</li>
    <li> Pencil is soft enough to glide on easily but hard enough to sharpen.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily but doesn&#x27;t look harsh.</li>
    <li> I first bought this eyeliner at a Sephora store. I went in looking for a good eyeliner pencil. I asked one of the sales ladies for a suggestion, and she suggested Aqua eyes. I have to say that it&#x27;s truly waterproof, it can withstand watery eyes from allergies. Even though it&#x27;s waterproof, it does smudge when applied to lower lid. Overall, this liner is my favorite.</li>
    <li> So disappointed..I thought I would not have raccoon eyes but I did after just a few hours.. so back to liquid eyeliner for me..</li>
    <li> It smeared, didn&#x27;t last very long. Very dissapointed. Thought if I paid more I would get good quality. I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Anytime I can NOT go to the mall, life is good! Love love love this eyeliner. Stays..well, forever. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> After looking at reviews I expected too much from this I guess. I wasnt impressed. It doesnt stay on that long and smears a bit.. I&#x27;ll stick to my loreal pencil for 7 bucks.</li>
