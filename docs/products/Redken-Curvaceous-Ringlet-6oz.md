      <li>I do love the curls I have now though</li>
      <li>I just love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found nothing that works any better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used too many products to list</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>If you have used Redkin&#x27;s Ringlet 07 and love it</li>
      <li>I love this product, but since it seems to contain phosphates and sulphates (Im no chemist)</li>
      <li>Just like what I purchase at the salon :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Redken Curvaceous Ringlet (along with the Curvaceous conditioner) for over a year now, and I love the products.  </li>
      <li>This was ok</li>
      <li>LOVE how it is easily applied to my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s clean stuff!</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to be able to purchace the large quantity.  </li>
      <li>As a woman with waist-length naturally curly hair, finding a product that helps keep your curls looking great all day can be quite a task.  </li>
      <li>Together, they create a really nice, easily absorbed, anti-frizz product for those who have curly hair that gets out of control when moisture comes around.  </li>
      <li>It definitely helps to boost your curls and keep them looking beautiful all day.  </li>
      <li>Makes your hair look wonderful without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>The product works well in my hair, makes it smooth and define my curly ...</li>
      <li>Smooth curls that stay its curl.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really smooth and shiny</li>
      <li>Curls that are actually smooth not frizzy ringlets?  </li>
      <li>Her hair is in a short style and this works great for her.  </li>
      <li>, it leaves my hair with soft defined curls and good volume.  </li>
      <li>Its very light weight and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>Works so well and smells fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>As for REAL Redken Ringlet - I love it and would give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>My curls have been very defined and to make matters better</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for encouraging curl without making my hair look either greasy or crunchy, and for reducing frizz.</li>
      <li>Not the clean fresh scent of the original.  </li>
      <li>I recently, many many years later, decided to get a spiral perm  </li>
      <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll have to deal with the new crunchy and more frizzy look.</li>
      <li>The ringlets you can create end up soft, easily pulled apart to soften the look yet remain smooth during the day and night.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this product makes my hair feel, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Please, someone direct me to a truly comparable product. :)</li>
      <li>I have short natural curly hair and this product works great.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price it is sold for.</li>
      <li>Using Curvaceous my hair is still better then if i put nothing on it at all, but at $20+ per 6 oz i really need the magic back.</li>
      <li>A good thing about it however, is it doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some other curl products.  </li>
      <li>After recently running out of Ringlet, I turned to Amazon to place a quick order for more.  </li>
      <li>It comes in handy on dry days.</li>
      <li>can add curl to very straight hair</li>
      <li>I bought this product last weekend and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Lasts overnight too - spritz and it kicks it back into a better form.  </li>
      <li>It is more like a cream moisturizer than a gel or mousse, while doing the same thing they do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight and really does a nice job holding my waves the entire day.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the overpowering smell.  </li>
      <li>#34;Full Swirl&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>I typically do not write reviews (even though I&#x27;m constantly reading reviews before I make purchases); however, I just bought this a week ago and have fallen in love with this product!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had used Ringlet 07 for 10+ years and it worked wonders on my hair. For some reason, Redken decided to discontinue it and release this instead. My guess is their 75% margins on the other product weren&#x27;t high enough so they removed a couple of key ingredients to get the margins closer to 80% because this product absolutely sucks in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found nothing that works any better so I guess I&#x27;ll have to deal with the new crunchy and more frizzy look.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have very long curly hair. Its colored, dry and damaged and my curls are frizzy and hard to manage. I&#x27;ve used too many products to list but I&#x27;m blown away by this one! Its very light weight and does exactly what it claims to do. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review on here but this time I had to. If you&#x27;re considering buying this product, give it a chance.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, tames my lioness hair!!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for encouraging curl without making my hair look either greasy or crunchy, and for reducing frizz. The frizz issue is really why I got it. I started off with a salon product and was looking for an &amp;#34;OTC&amp;#34; substitute. Tried about five different brands with wide price differential. This was the best one. I&#x27;ll keep using this till it stops working or they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It says its a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for your hair, but I used it and it did do anything. There was like no noticeable difference after using this stuff. I don&#x27;t really get it.</li>
    <li> My wife started using this product because her sister gave her some to try.  She is delighted with the results she can obtain with the Redken products.</li>
    <li> The lotion is very thin, and I don&#x27;t think it works as well as some of the other Redken products for curls.  I does not help with frizz.  A good thing about it however, is it doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some other curl products.  Maybe it would be a good thing for someone with thin to medium thickness hair, but on my thick hair it doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to.</li>
    <li> If they ever stop making this product I&#x27;m in trouble. Love it</li>
    <li> I really liked the product. End result was soft, pretty curls. No issues.</li>
    <li> Great &#x27;taming&#x27; product for my thick curly hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my long curls and its hard to find now because I think they have changed the product.  I was very pleased to be able to purchace the large quantity.  It should last me a good long time.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily right after using Redken Anti-Snap Leave-In Conditioner.  I have short hair and this product helps add some curl and prevents my hair from being fly-away.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and am very happy with it.  It works best in a humid environment but even here in Alaska, it helps my hair look healthy and styled.</li>
    <li> I use Ringlet after washing my hair.  It helps to control frizziness and define curls.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Bought this after a stylist used this with Redken Curvaceous Cream Serum.  Together, they create a really nice, easily absorbed, anti-frizz product for those who have curly hair that gets out of control when moisture comes around.  The ringlets you can create end up soft, easily pulled apart to soften the look yet remain smooth during the day and night.  Lasts overnight too - spritz and it kicks it back into a better form.  May be pricey but this will last a long time.  I will buy both again</li>
    <li> This was ok but, It didn&#x27;t work on my hair very well.  I have very wavy curly hair and it just didn&#x27;t do what they said it would do.  Don&#x27;t spend your money it is a waste!</li>
    <li> I used this on curly hair and straight hair, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  You can revive it during the day just by wetting your hands and passing them through your hair.  That&#x27;s clean stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for encouraging your hair to follow it&#x27;s natural curl.  I adore the scent of this product, too!</li>
    <li> I have had the opposite experience than other reviewers. I love this product, but since it seems to contain phosphates and sulphates (Im no chemist) I switch off with Ouidad Whipped Curls. It comes out like thick whipped cream and tames and defines while conditioning. I have the old and the new Ringlet in front of me and the ingredients are almost the same. The new has Moringa oil. My stylist gave the 07 to me and said they changed the bottle. He has worked on some formulas with Redken so I think he knows how effective/ineffective  some ingredients can be. I always follow his advice to rotate my products for best results and thats what I do when I feel there is more frizz happening then normal or my curls aren&#x27;t as defined and bouncy and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s color treated and frizzy. I usually use heavier styling products to keep it smooth and less frizzy, however it usually weighs down the curls. My hair loves this stuff, makes my hair very curly yet keeps it soft. As far as the frizzies go, I still have some frizz but living in a humid climate I don&#x27;t think I can avoid it. I do love the curls I have now though, I would recommend this to others. I also use other products in the same line.</li>
    <li> This works about the same as the old version but the smell is very overpowering.  Not the clean fresh scent of the original.  This smell is very perfumy and overpowering at least for the first few hours you use it.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to post anything but i really recommend this product to those people that are suffering of tiny, dry and fallen hair.&lt;br /&gt;it has helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and it is not good for body but it is nice for very subtle curls.</li>
    <li> Great product! I enjoy this!! thank you</li>
    <li> It works for my hair.. and if something works.. I tend to seek it out.  I would normally just go into a salon that sells Redken products and pick it up.. but apparently the salons are selling it pretty quick also.</li>
    <li> Horrible product....after using It my hair looks as if I didn&#x27;t add anything to it. It was still frizzy and did not make it curl. Waste of money!! As pricey as this little bottle was, I was expecting better results. In the past I used real control (the purple Redken products) and that did a waaaaay better job at controlling frizz. My hair is not chemically damaged it is just naturally really frizzy and curly but the Real Control leave In lotion works really good on my hair.</li>
    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t work well for my regular thickness wavy/curly hair (2 stars in my hair), it works wonders for my husband&#x27;s coarse/thick curly hair (5 stars in his hair).  I now buy it for him to use.  How well it works really depends on the texture of your hair.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girl friend along with that shampoo and conditioner and she says they all work wonderful, she really likes these products</li>
    <li> I cannot use this product, it sets off my asthma.  Didn&#x27;t know it was scented or would not have purchased</li>
    <li> Love how it smells and makes my curls look.&lt;br /&gt;Takes away a lot of the frizz and makes my curls look great!</li>
    <li> can add curl to very straight hair</li>
    <li> Anyone who can want&#x27;s to &#x27;Pop&amp;#34; or highlight their curl&#x27;s, this product can really help.  It is great to hold&lt;br /&gt;curl&#x27;s in place and give a soft appearance.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have very curly hair.  Her hair is in a short style and this works great for her.  Not much is needed. keeps the curls defined with less frizz.  She used Redken Full Swirl Curvaceous for a long time which is good, but left some residue behind, she liked this a little better.</li>
    <li> great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> Even the fragrance is different. Does not have the same slip. Please, someone direct me to a truly comparable product. :)</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel, soft and shiny. But the SMELL! It&#x27;s a strong, musky smell that smells kind of like SWEAT. I hope the smell dissipates during the day, but I can still catch a whiff of it now and then. I hope my co-workers don&#x27;t think I need to take a shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redken Curvaceous Ringlet (along with the Curvaceous conditioner) for over a year now, and I love the products.  They work great for my curls.  After recently running out of Ringlet, I turned to Amazon to place a quick order for more.  It looks to be the same, but it definitely is not.  The first thing I noticed was the overpowering smell.  I even pulled my empty bottle of Ringlet out of the trash to compare, and my old bottle did NOT smell like this product.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t tame my frizz and define my curls as well as my previous bottle of Ringlet did.  I am not sure that this is a legitimate Redken product.  As for REAL Redken Ringlet - I love it and would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This curl lotion cuts down frizz and nicely defines the curl. Would re-purchase. Expensive but a small bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair. Used it for years.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have fine loose cork-screw type curls &amp; have tried just about every curly product out there.  Usually I&#x27;m a fan of Deva Curl, but tried this on a recommendation from a friend.  It really works well, it leaves my hair with soft defined curls and good volume.  Ladies, there is nothing worse than a crunchy head, so I appreciate that this leave my hair very natural looking without the friz!  As other reviews mention, the scent is pretty obnoxious.  But once my hair dries, I can barely smell anything, so I wouldn&#x27;t let ti deter you from buying it.</li>
    <li> It keep the ringlets of your hair soft unlike other gel or mousse.  Yet, it eliminate the frizz. I just love this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but not as good as the Ringlet that this replaced.</li>
    <li> I have short natural curly hair and this product works great.  It is silky feeling and moisturizers the hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> Keeps the curls in shape and protects from frizzes. Love this line of products. Makes your hair look wonderful without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get to use it because it was broken when I got it but I am thankful for my refund...</li>
    <li> Just like what I purchase at the salon :)</li>
    <li> If you have used Redkin&#x27;s Ringlet 07 and love it you should know...this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it was a re-branding but its not. The smell is overpowering. I put it on after my shower at night and the smell kept waking me up.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is gone by morning i think.&lt;br /&gt;With Ringlet 07 i put it in my hair right after my shower and wake up with soft, defined, frizzless curls. My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel like there is product on it. It was magic.&lt;br /&gt;Using the exact same method using curvaceous my curls are not as defined and i can feel the crunchiness of product. Using Curvaceous my hair is still better then if i put nothing on it at all, but at $20+ per 6 oz i really need the magic back. I will be looking into other products. :( Redken missed the mark on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product for permed hair that i have ever tried. I had permed hair once when I was in high school and i used mousse to keep it from frizzing out. But it gave a wet look I did not like and dried out my hair from all the alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;So I recently, many many years later, decided to get a spiral perm  and this is the product my hairstylist used. It does not give a wet look while still keeping your hair organized in ringlets. I am so grateful for this product it is so great for curly hair! It is more like a cream moisturizer than a gel or mousse, while doing the same thing they do. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really gives me thick, frizzless finger curls and I have frizzy hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> They changed the smell! I want the old Redken Ringlet lotion back!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair yesterday, and I had the look I&#x27;ve always wanted.  Nice, easy curls, no stickyness.  I &#x27;liked&#x27; Ringlet before, this is just much nicer, perfect for my hair.  I don&#x27;t like gel, and the beachy waves sprays don&#x27;t work for me.  This is nice.  It works professionally and casually, and scent is upgraded.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair and this product makes them stay in place, formed and soft! I love it! Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Works so well and smells fresh and clean! You only have to use a tiny bit and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Sticky and gooey.  Would not purchase again or recommend.  Just made my hair sticky, and flat, basically it was just useless.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY MY CURLS LOOK WITH RINGLET.  THEY ARE BOUNCY AND WELL DEFINED YET DON&#x27;T LOOK PLASTERED IN PLACE.</li>
    <li> I prefer the old formula and probably will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It works well for my hair in humid climate. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> As a woman with waist-length naturally curly hair, finding a product that helps keep your curls looking great all day can be quite a task.  I&#x27;ve been using Redken&#x27;s Curvaceous line (shampoo, conditioner, and Curl Dive treatment) for a while.  I even tried another of their curl products (I believe it is called &amp;#34;Full Swirl&amp;#34;).  The Full Swirl tends to leave my hair feeling a bit stiff and tacky, and the next day it just winds up essentially flaking and making me look like a dandruff factory.  (And since folks with curly hair usually know better than to wash it every day, that&#x27;s not fun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ringlet Protection Lotion works really well.  It offers a bit of hold, but nothing you can feel in your hair after it&#x27;s dry.  It definitely helps to boost your curls and keep them looking beautiful all day.  If you rinse your hair the second and third day (but don&#x27;t shampoo it!) it will help you to scrunch your curls up and not have to add any more product to the hair.  Just scrunch or twist your curls back into shape, and either blow-dry or let it air dry.  Either way, your curls will look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a pump and a half of this product on my very thick, waist-length, wavy and curly hair.  My curls and waves range from tight ringlets to beachy loose waves throughout, and this helps to keep them looking good.  I highly recommend emulsifying (blending in your hands by putting both products in your hand at once, then rubbing hands together to mix the products) this with several drops of Redken Diamond Oil to add shine, softness and moisture without causing frizz.</li>
    <li> Redken Ringlet 07 has been discontinued and this is supposedly the equivalent. It is nothing like Ringlet, unfortunately. It does not tame frizz, define curls, or add shine. I really can&#x27;t think of anything positive about it at all. I even had multiple comments about the smell. Not good. Please bring Ringlet back, Redken. This product is worthless.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair. I wanted a product that would create ringlets for me, not the messy mousse look. This works. It does create ringlets at least 80% of the way. It is non sticky non goopy. Really smooth and shiny and you don&#x27;t mind running your fingers through your hair when this dries. Best attribute is its fragrance. For travelling, I would take this over my anti-frizz plus blow dry curling brush.</li>
    <li> Nothing special with no special ingredients that make my curl do anything better then any other lotion or creme would do. I&#x27;ll stick with my usual product. I had high hopes for this, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very frizzy, dry hair and have bounced from product to product in search of one that will work. I bought this product last weekend and am extremely satisfied with my purchase. To put it simple, this stuff works! My curls have been very defined and to make matters better it smells great. It&#x27;s actually a lotion instead of a gel so it leaves your hair feeling soft instead of crunchy (like some mousses/gels tend to do). I was hesitant to spend so much money on this little bottle but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price it is sold for. I recommend to any curly-haired person who wants better-defined curls.</li>
    <li> A very good product for a curly hair. The product works well in my hair, makes it smooth and define my curly ...</li>
    <li> I use this with other products.  I love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE how it is easily applied to my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue. However, the next day my curls are not as alive and I have to use something to add bounce. This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but it doesn&#x27;t help my curls look ALIVE!</li>
    <li> Bought this in the hopes it was the replacement for ringlet 07. I can assure you it is not. :(. Doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I can re-activate the curl just by getting it a little wet.  It comes in handy on dry days.</li>
    <li> Es un producto que le da cuerpo al cabello rizo, y lo mantiene en forma por mucho mas tiempo del esperado</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Ringlet thinking that they had just changed the package and updated the name. I used the product ONE time. I didn&#x27;t feel that the product worked as well as the Ringlet 07, but the worst thing about was the scent! It is very strong and it would overpower any perfume if I chose to wear it. The smell does not dissipate over time, either. I wrote to Redken and asked if they would consider offering the Ringlet product in a scent-free version. They responded that they would forward my suggestion to the proper channel. Hmmm. So today, I ordered two bottles of the Ringlet 07 from Amazon at twice the price of this product. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll be trying to &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; out a different product line until Redken comes to it&#x27;s senses.</li>
    <li> This hair creme works really well with my curly hair during the winter/spring.  Not sure how it will handle the humidity but I am hopefully it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Use this for soft, loose curls.</li>
    <li> Works great for my curly girl hair.  I have always struggled with my Irish curls.  They look frizzy, dull, fall out in places, etc., etc.  All that until my hair dresser suggested Redken Curvaceous.  Now, my hair has never looked so great, so easily.  Seriously.  Curvaceous has brought control to the curls without leaving that all day &#x27;wet&#x27; look, but crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply, squish/scrunch into your curls, then dry. Air or blow dry.  Then scrunch out the crunches if you have any.  Voila!  Smooth curls that stay its curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re looking for?  Curls that are actually smooth not frizzy ringlets?  That&#x27;s what I get with Redken Curvaceous.</li>
    <li> Love the Ringlet and it&#x27;s half the price of what I&#x27;d pay at the mall. An excellent product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I typically do not write reviews (even though I&#x27;m constantly reading reviews before I make purchases); however, I just bought this a week ago and have fallen in love with this product!  I have wavy/curly hair and have tried EVERY styling product out there, but never liked anything because no matter how little I put in to help hold the curl, it would make my hair sticky/crunchy.  This product is completely different!!!!  It&#x27;s very light-weight and really does a nice job holding my waves the entire day.  And on top of that it smells so nice!  I definitely recommend purchasing this product!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great for moisturizing and adding body to curly hair. One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product and love it! After washing my hair, while it&#x27;s still damp I put some on and presto...my curls are perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Very good light weight product. Great scent. One of my favorites. Brings my curls alive.</li>
