      <li>Great facial cleanser.</li>

      <li>If your considering it, go for it, it&#x27;s worth the expense!</li>

      <li>Clean.</li>
      <li>Overall its a good product.</li>
      <li>Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times.</li>
      <li>dermalogica is the only cleanser ive been using for the last three years, my friends asking what happend with my skin, its perfect!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect, wash my face in the morning with it, and then used the handy pump to fill up my smaller bottle that I keep in the shower-so had a dual &amp;#34;purpose&amp;#34; and it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It works well for dry skin, and does a great job of cleansing the skin, leaving your skin feeling soft &amp; clean to the touch.</li>
      <li>my fave skin care for the most sensitive skin</li>
      <li>When I 1st tried this, it completely changed my skin for the better.  </li>
      <li>However, after using this twice a day my skin cleared right up.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll ever be able to go to a different cleanser, this is tops!</li>
      <li>I like the essential cleansing solution the most.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have bought it online</li>
      <li>Still using it and love the product, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s old or the smell is normal.  </li>
      <li>I am a BIG fan of Dermalogica and use many of their products.</li>
      <li>I accidentally ordered this rather than the ultra calming cleanser, and actually ended up liking this better.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my face clean and clear .....</li>
      <li>Love it on my dry skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle</li>
      <li>I was a child struggling with acne and it got better as I got older but still not completely gone.  </li>
      <li>It really does make my skin feel well cleansed and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It works very well in fighting the ageing process.</li>
      <li>So much for a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; saving me money.</li>
      <li>She never like using skin care products as she thinks that the process of cleansing etc is very time consuming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get really oily on my forehead and T-zone</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that leaves my face feeling and looking youthful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She started using it and really like it.</li>
      <li>, I bought clean and clear for sensitive skin to replace dermalogica, and my skin is looking the way it did before!  </li>
      <li>It is rich and cleansing at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I still have it hanging out in my shower, so I use it to clean my back and ears instead of my face.</li>
      <li>It leaves your face clean but does strip it, so you don&#x27;t have oily rebound later.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it brings the impurities/zits to the surface and then helps eliminate them.</li>
      <li>This is suitable for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I wear less makeup and feel better about myself :</li>
      <li>Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box</li>
      <li>I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A soft, gentle cleansing liquid.  </li>
      <li>By far my favorite facial cleanser for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, thick cleansing solution that works well and still leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>The price is truly worth it if you consider that it lasts so long</li>
      <li>Dermological products calm my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open</li>
      <li>I &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; a filler to reach a certain financial</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>They feel so natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use the product daily.  Dissolves make up easily even mascara.  For something extra I use it with my Clairisonic.  Leaves my skin soft and hydrated.  Can&#x27;t imagine using another cleanser.</li>
    <li> Everything it promises. Great facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> The product I received was oozing in the packaging.  The top had twisted and opened.  There was a seal on the pump, but not the top of the container.</li>
    <li> A soft, gentle cleansing liquid.  Love it on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It gives the face a youthful glow after cleansing.</li>
    <li> Not actually sure how to rate this. I have been using dermologica for YEARS and I love the product. This is the first time I have bought it online and I am skeptical if it is legit. There was no silver seal as the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; dermologica product does and it did not come in a box. I will try it and see if it works and is the same thing, but buyer beware...</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;Dermalogica Essential Cleansing Solution, 16.9 Fluid Ounce&amp;#34; but I received &amp;#34;Clearing Skin Wash, 16.9 Fluid Ounce&amp;#34; Sold by DAY STAR, I was not happy with it, but after contacting Amazon, they agree to refund me and I don&#x27;t have to return the item back to them, I am very happy that I can rely on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2008. It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that leaves my face feeling and looking youthful.</li>
    <li> the cap was loose and split all over the box and bottle when it arrived.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and its totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> Made my face itch. Made me break out. Returning the rest of the bottle if they let me. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box&lt;br /&gt;2. Silver stay-fresh seal on the opening of the tube, same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle&lt;br /&gt;3. If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These barcode stickers and seals are only put on by the dermalogica company. If your product does not have them YOU ARE GETTING A TAMPERED WITH, EXPIRED, or KNOCK-OFF PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please list the seller who sold the inferior product so we can avoid them! I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy these on amazon and ended up chickening out and paid the extra from a legitimate salon company because I didn&#x27;t want to get screwed over. Now I&#x27;m glad I did as I hope this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; even removes eye makeup. Dermalogica is by far, the best brand of skincare out there. This cleanser cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this rather than the ultra calming cleanser, and actually ended up liking this better.  It works well for dry skin, and does a great job of cleansing the skin, leaving your skin feeling soft &amp; clean to the touch.</li>
    <li> Living at the coast and being on the beach daily, my skin has been subjected to harch weather conditions my whole life.  At the age of 60 My skin show very little signs of aging and I can assure you the reason is that I have used Dermalogica products for many years.  If you think the product is pricy, remember,  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Product works well for me. We live in a dry Colorado climate and this product doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of all moisture and oils.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  It cleans and keeps my skin moist.  Have not found another product that I like better.</li>
    <li> love dermalogica usually, but the smell of this is a little weird. Still using it and love the product, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s old or the smell is normal.  I&#x27;ve used this before and don&#x27;t remember the odor..maybe this supply was a little old?  No skin problems or anything.</li>
    <li> This was recommended for me by my esthetician. I use it every day. Lasts a long time. Do I look better? I don&#x27;t know. But my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> Have been a user of Derma for many years. It keeps my face clean and clear ..... Go but it now.</li>
    <li> i have always used this cleanser and it will be hard to get me to switch to something else. a magnificent cleanser with no harsh ingredients. i have seen a dramatic change on my face in the past 3 years of using the age smart. i do however prefer this cleanser with my other age smart products.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  I used to use the Ultracalming Cleanser and loved it...this is even better.  Like a milk bath for your face!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it brings the impurities/zits to the surface and then helps eliminate them.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my sister. She never like using skin care products as she thinks that the process of cleansing etc is very time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll... I force her to use this and she simply loves it.  It cleans the face easily and the cleanser can be washed off easily. No fuss at all !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important note is that I was quite surprised at the different pricing from other sellers.  I chose to buy from Amazon as this is a well established company and I know that I will not be scammed.</li>
    <li> Been using for years, perfect cleanser for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! The only cleanser I can use on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing solution. I have been using it for years. Cleans without making your face feel dry. Nice clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I still have it hanging out in my shower, so I use it to clean my back and ears instead of my face. I&#x27;m sure it works for others. I have to say though, I do like the PreCleanse (this product&#x27;s partner) and will purchase that again.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite facial cleanser for my dry skin.  When I 1st tried this, it completely changed my skin for the better.  I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll ever be able to go to a different cleanser, this is tops!</li>
    <li> I love these products.  They feel so natural.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the big brands and all the little brands.  This one I always go back to.  It leaves your face clean but does strip it, so you don&#x27;t have oily rebound later.  LOVE this.</li>
    <li> Be sure all the tamper-proof seals are on your bottle.  I thought my product smelled/felt differently than I remembered.  I compared it to a bottle I bought from a local retailer and indeed the smell from the Amazon bottle smelled diluted. There was a hint of the original product but it also smelled like someone diluted it with body lotion or something nasty like that.</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica products but they ARE pricey!  This large size was VERY affordable, quite a bit less than regular retail.  Not sure how they do that???  Was worried they may have removed some of the product and replaced with some type of cream.  Don&#x27;t know how to tell.  Anyone?</li>
    <li> This is really a great product! I noticed a difference almost immediately. I was told to use a product that didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in the ingredients.  Very happy with it. I plan on purchasing their other products as well.</li>
    <li> well received in the mail. Great produce at a great price. This is suitable for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent! It is a genuine product, came in a box with the silver sticker. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because it was on sale and I &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; a filler to reach a certain financial plateau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She started using it and really like it. She told me it was light on her skin, but did the job, I guess I got myself&lt;br /&gt;into a situation where we will be buying this again. So much for a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; saving me money.</li>
    <li> This is the only cleaner I will use on my face. I was a child struggling with acne and it got better as I got older but still not completely gone.  Dermological products calm my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, thick cleansing solution that works well and still leaves skin feeling soft. Even when rinsing with water my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after use.</li>
    <li> One of the best skin care products I have used.</li>
    <li> dermalogica is the only cleanser ive been using for the last three years, my friends asking what happend with my skin, its perfect!!! healthy!! before i tried Dermalogica cleanser, i tried EVERYTHING!, had pimples all over my face! NOT ANYMORE :) thank you dermalogica! i use cleanser and moisturizer am and pm, and rice powder twice a week!</li>
    <li> I love dermalogica products because they are good for oily skin.  I like the essential cleansing solution the most.  It was recommended to me by my facial lady.  I tried another dermalogica face wash that was clay based and that one dried my skin out. That product would be great for very oily skin.  I get really oily on my forehead and T-zone so the essential cleansing solution really helps with this problem.</li>
    <li> I love Dermalogica cleaning products.  I use this and then afterwards do an exfoliate and feel so clean.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used for years, love it!</li>
    <li> Clean. Non-allergenic. Refreshing. I am a BIG fan of Dermalogica and use many of their products. It&#x27;s not toxic, feels good and gets the job done. Get it!</li>
    <li> Great Product- Fast Shipment</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect, wash my face in the morning with it, and then used the handy pump to fill up my smaller bottle that I keep in the shower-so had a dual &amp;#34;purpose&amp;#34; and it will last a long time.  thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product for combination skin! It lasts a long time. Same as at ulta. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product remains in my shower where I use it with my Clarisonic facial brush.  It really does make my skin feel well cleansed and hydrated.  I take it in a small bottle on all my trips because I need to keep that &amp;#34;fresh from the facial&amp;#34; skin condition.</li>
    <li> my fave skin care for the most sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two years. i have combination/dry/acne prone skin and this is the only cleanser that somewhat hydrates my skin. I&#x27;ve tried the Cetiphil because i heard that its comparable to this, but for me there was no comparison. The dermalogica essential cleanser is a very thick cream, whereas Cetiphil is a little more watery. I recommend this to those with dry skin, it does the job. Overall its a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works very well in fighting the ageing process.</li>
    <li> i used the ultra calming cleanser for years and my husband ordered this for me by mistake. It is rich and cleansing at the same time.  My skin never feels dry after using using it.  Will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product and in a timely manner</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by this</li>
    <li> Did not feel like the same product I purchased at my local salon. It left my face feeling slimey and gross, not clean. After a week I threw the bottle out.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE USES THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME</li>
    <li> Love the product. Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times. Thank you and have a great holiday.</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my life!! My skin looks amazing. If your considering it, go for it, it&#x27;s worth the expense! Does not lather well, but I don&#x27;t have any blemishes anymore and my skin is so conditioned I could probably get away without makeup.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and after I had a facial the dermatologist recommended that I try this product out.  It worked miracles!  Prior to using this product, I would have at least a few tiny pimples at a time around my chin area (that I always blamed on hormones).  However, after using this twice a day my skin cleared right up.  I wear less makeup and feel better about myself :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a broke graduate student so when my bottle FINALLY ran out (it lasted me for over a year), I bought clean and clear for sensitive skin to replace dermalogica, and my skin is looking the way it did before!  Needless to say, I just ordered a bottle.  The price is truly worth it if you consider that it lasts so long and you spend less money on makeup!</li>
