<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not bad wish it worked better and/or faster didn&#x27;t see a change. It does dry skin just moisture well after</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I only noticed a huge difference after I&#x27;d stopped using for about 6 weeks. I ran out and just hadn&#x27;t gotten around to reordering. I&#x27;ve reordered and I&#x27;m using every day.</li>
    <li> This soap works great I&#x27;ve been using it God about a month and it has visibly cleared my acne scars. It burns if you leave it on too long but other than that it&#x27;s great. I will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I rated it 5 stars because it works. It faded dark spots and helped tremendously with my KP (keratosis Pilaris). I have it on my legs and elbows and it&#x27;s not totally clear yet but I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement and with continued use it has gotten better. When applying it on my body I use an exfoliating glove, on my face I use my hands. The soap lifts layers of dead skin off so expect to look just a little lighter, it&#x27;s nothing major. You may experience peeling/micro peeling, that&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s just dead skin.  I would also recommend using a sunscreen to cut down on any possible sun burn. I know kojic acid is natural but it&#x27;s still an acid and can burn you just like glycolic and salicylic acids. I burned my décolletage a little. If you do burn yourself, I would recommend not applying it to the affected area for about 3 days. After that it should be fine but wait the length of time that feels good for you. After 3 days I cautiously apply the soap to the burned area and after a few days it began to fade. I would also recommend using a good moisturizer after showering.   The bars are kind of small. I use it once a day on my body and twice (morning and night) on my face and one bars lasts me about 4/5 days. Once a bar is small enough I just press it into the new bar and that way I don&#x27;t lose any.  This is my second order (six bars come in each order) and I will definitely continue to use this soap, it&#x27;s been a great help in clearing up my embarrassing skin condition and improved the overall look of my skin.  P.S. The merchant is very diligent in orders out in a timely manner. It ships super fast, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I am an African-American woman who likes to lighten my skin... I&#x27;ve seen changes in a couple weeks already... I won&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> Great soap....my clients love it!</li>
    <li> love this soap, could see difference skin tone within 3 to 4 days I apply to my face and allow it to sit there until I finish showering about 5 minutes give or take, experiencing a little sting not bad, did not exfoliated skin before using soap,  when drying off notice dead skin coming off yea! My skin was soft and before using soap don&#x27;t notice a differences there, make sure you do not using soap vagina area remember it is acid soap&amp;#34; IJS&amp;#34; hands were lighter the first time using 1 bar last about 16 days hard water in Houston. Not trying to bleach my skin this soap have even out my tone Black American chick brown skin tone. Oh! my knees and elbows I made a paste soap, lemon, and baking soap worked really  too fast, do not apply this to your face it will  burn. Good Luck</li>
    <li> Fast shipment,soap work so far so good.</li>
    <li> THESE SOAPS ARE GREAT, BUT DO NOT LAST LONG. THEY ARE VERY SMALL.</li>
    <li> This soap works great seen results couple of days using.  Works perfect, the only thing you have to moisturize &amp; shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> my wife likes this product. definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap. I use it to even my complexion, especially in summer</li>
    <li> I like it it help alot with my skin thank you !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Man idk if these reviews are fake or not ....</li>
    <li> I have no idea. My sister suggested to buy this bar soup.The result of using your product, is decent but not huge improvement.</li>
    <li> My wife ask me to order this product for her.She is asian.She wants to try this product since she is came from the Philippines.She has delicate and sensitive skin so I tell her be careful using different product.I don&#x27;t want you to be in trouble.More than a months now.I don&#x27;t observe any product reaction to her skin especially she use this for all her body specially to her face.The product was excellent.She really loved it.She said she would best recommend this to those who have tried looking for a great product that has senstive skin and to those who wants to get fairer skin.The price is worth it and it&#x27;s not so quick to melt. So by the time she will running out of stock I know where to buy placed my order.Visit at Amazon and hurry to purchase yours too.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Yes, you may get some blemishes for a few days, but nothing major.  It&#x27;s helped a lot with my mosquito bites and with mild acne that I get when my period arrives.  Skin feels majorly soft and shiny too.  I usually have really dry skin.  It does itch a little bit, but nothing too extreme.  As far as brightening, it will take time.  I&#x27;ve noticed lighter skin, but nothing major like going from dark to white.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now.</li>
    <li> Works well but it finishes fast if used daily. Smells great and loved how soft it leaves your skin</li>
    <li> I TRULY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.. IT LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING LIKE SILK. IT HAS HELPED WITH MY ACNE, I JUST LOVE THIS SOAP I WILL KEEP BUYING..</li>
    <li> Fast ship.  Nice scented soap.  Lightening takes consistent use for several weeks to really see the results.  Overall, I am happy with it!  Although, using other products combined with it, it is tough to tell what actually helped...lol</li>
    <li> Not one pimple on my face since using this soap.  The soaps do dissolve extremely fast in the shower so use a travel soap container or baggy. Overall great product and I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this soap for sometime now &amp; its very effective being that im a person of a darker skin complexion its also good for removing dirt &amp; oil off the skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a long time. I love it. It smells nice and light, it lathers up well, I can use it on my face without it giving me that gross bar-soap feeling. Most importantly, it&#x27;s effective in maintaining bright skin.</li>
    <li> Thanks.. Next time again</li>
    <li> This is a soap that really works. My brown spots were from having shingles after hip surgery. Once the blisters  finally cleared they left brown spots I was desperate to find some way to get rid of them. I found some cream to help but I wanted more. I went on-line and found this soap. It is orange like glycerin would look. I always take the little pieces of any soap and put them a container with water and render them down so I don&#x27;t waste any. Well I took this soap and put it in water and it rendered down to a liquid and I put it in a pump bottle I and became a sudsy, metered way to extend the length of time the soap would last. It works just as well and you don&#x27;t waste a drop.  It is a reasonably priced and I received it quickly.  It does not dry out my skin at all. The spots began getting lighter within a week.  This soap is worth every penny you didn&#x27;t have to spend (if you catch my drift). I use it with my liquid exfoliant and my skin is looking so much better.  I am so happy because its getting close to summer and shingle spots are much more difficult to lighten.  Now I can wear my summer clothes with confidence,  Something I really look forward to.  Thanks Kojie San I love  your soap and would recommend it highly to anyone who has spots they want to lighten up and say good bye to.</li>
    <li> Does as said! Ended up selling to some ladies in my office as well and they were as happy with it as I was.</li>
    <li> surpassed my expectations, yes, yes, yes.</li>
    <li> Works in only 2 weeks of use. Skin is brighter</li>
    <li> Received on time. All items as what was described!</li>
    <li> It really works, if you want to lighting your skin then this soap is for you. Drake area on your face  and around the neck in fact every part of your body it will do the job for you. You start seeing the difference in a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m yet to see results diem this product. .. but still using it every other  week hopefully I will see some changes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product plus retin A for almost 2 years now. This has been an absolute God send for my acne. My skin is so smooth and gorgeous.  I always get complements on my skin. I am an AA female with a redish brown skin tone. I originally bought this product to fade my acne scars. This soap faded my acne scars and more. My skin just looks so much better than what it used to look like. My pores are much smaller and my skin just had this glow. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this soap with retin A if you have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I have super oil skin. I believe that is the reason my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out using both KS and Retin A. My skin is still super oil. I need to figure out how to control that but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
    <li> Hope this works on my hyperpigmentation.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> Very drying but it give ur skin a nice glow. Exfoliate and keep you along moisturized. Always wear SPF when using this it makes your skin sensitive to the sun.</li>
    <li> Ordered 03/08/15- This is my second time ordering this product. I first ordered a two pack, just to try it out. I really love it. It is gradually lightening the dark spots on my skin. I specifically ordered this to try to lighten my neck, elbows, knees, and my legs right under my bum. I am a black female in my twenties and it has been hard to find a product I can use daily, that is not harsh, and actually provides results, for a reasonable price. Again, it is a gradual change, but I can definitely see it. Not only have the dark spots started to fade, but my skin is brighter and much softer.</li>
    <li> This soap is absolutely amazing and does brighten skin and fade dark spots! Will continue to buy from now on give it a try. I am a medium to golden brown skin tone with orangy to yellow undertones and this soap is gradually fading these five year plus acne marks. It is just amazing an unexpected from a bar of soap. Oh and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I waited to see how this product works before I wrote a review.  It is the best product for my acne treatment. My dark spots are disappearing little by little as the peeling process continues.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that worked better than expected. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for couple months for the purpose of acne. It faded my blemishes an haven&#x27;t had a pimple in over a month. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> Used consistently for a month+. Didn&#x27;t even remotely work.</li>
    <li> Its really a good product results was really  good</li>
    <li> This soap lasts so long. One bar lasts about 2 months. I use the soap everyday. It has cleared up my skin &amp; fixed a lot of hyper pigmentation I had during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Amazing product it actually works</li>
    <li> Works well.Its a little drying but it delivers on its promise of a lovely skin.</li>
    <li> i have been using this soap for two 9 weeks now and it works, clear skin, reduction of pimples and soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;this is my second time ordering</li>
    <li> IT WORKS !! Just make sure u have a good moisturizer !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less then a month.  I am still waiting for the result.</li>
    <li> My skin has cleared up so I consider this soap to be a good product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap and the price. It really work well on aged spots.</li>
    <li> Does not work i been using it for two months havent seen any changes</li>
</ol>
