<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and this product makes it look weighted down and a little greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to protect it from the heat.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product before ironing your hair.  It provides wonderful shine and softness, without taking away body.  Wash and dry hair, spray shine on lightly and comb through the hair.  Then section and use your iron.  You will live the results.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for your hair and thus the 5 stars but I really think it is a really small bottle that they offer for the price I paid. Buyers beware, before buying this product please make sure that you are buying a larger bottle than this and your hair will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the oil that Keration has.I am a (black female) very little shine  But all other Keratin products shampoo and cond. LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reviews I read on the web. We received the shipment promptly. I was a bit surprised at how SMALL the can was. My 17 year old daughter, shoulder length blond thinnish hair said she found it made her hair greasy. I told her that perhaps she put too much of the product on her hair. I MYSELF tried it using a very small amount. I found it made by thickish brown hair greasy also.  I WILL however say my hair did not feel so &#x27;hot&#x27; after pulling it through the flat iron. (The parts of my hair that only had a teeny tiny amount of the product on it that is. The majority of my hair was limply greasy so I couldn&#x27;t really judge about the heat there).  Perhaps the trick is to use HALF a pea size amount and rub it between your palms so that you barely have any on your hands, THEN try to work it down your hair shafts by running your palms down your hair. Also, it DID make the parts of my hair that only had that teeny tiny amount on it...shine.  The parts of both our hair that had even more than a tad of product on it was greasy greasy greasy.  We will both give it another try. Too expensive not to.</li>
    <li> The photo shown in your ad clearly shows the Coppolla Brand on it. The product I received does not have the Coppolla Name on it..</li>
    <li> This spray is great for using after you straight iron your hair. It moisturizes and keeps hair from getimg frizzy. You can also use it before styling curly hair. For curly hair, I usually spray the Keratin in my hair after a shower, then comb my hair, and use mouse to style. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now and intend to continue using it. My hair is naturally wavy and frizzy. I cannot get out of the shower brush my hair and go. I like to straighten my hair, but if I straighten it without putting a product in it, it turns out very frizzy. If I apply this product to my hair while it&#x27;s wet and then blow dry my hair, my hair turns out silky smooth and no frizzies! It also makes my hair shine!</li>
    <li> Smells super yummy and adds lots of shine. I gave it four stars bc it is more of a pump and not an aerosol spray. That would make it a five star product.</li>
    <li> The Coppola Keratin Complex Thermo-shine is the best way to give your hair that polished finish look. Especially formulated for flat ironing. Your iron will easily glides through the hair leaving behind smooth shiny healthy looking hair. Unique blend of keratin protein oils and silicone compounds protects against thermal damage as it smooths, conditions and seals the hair with great luster.  Pump spray nozzle releases a fine mist. This is the 2.5 ounce spray, but you can also try the smaller version -[[ASIN:B0025DDDOA COPPOLA by Coppola: KERATIN COMPLEX SHINE 1.7 OZ]]. It might cost more than the average flat iron sprays and it might be small in size but a little bit goes a very long, long ways.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use before high temp to hair (eg blow drying and curling iron). Great smell and adds great shine.</li>
    <li> this was not what i receive</li>
    <li> Adds shine and smoothness to my keratin express blowout hair. I use it with blow drying and/or with flat ironing  or just to add a little shine in between washes. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> This product works great with my medium thick, chin length hair that is frizzy and dry. When my hair dries after shampooing, a spritz or two per 2-inch strand just before running a hot flat iron through it gives my hair a sleek, shiny look. I use this after every shampoo and the smoothing effect lasts for days. I order 3 bottles at a time. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its fine.  For unrelaxed African American hair?  If you got the time...its great.  The product is also a bonus for travel purposes.</li>
    <li> leaves hair smooth and protects drom damage during flat ironing.  nice scent.</li>
    <li> I blow dry my colour treated hair a lot, and this is the only product so far I&#x27;ve found to do the best job de-frizzing.</li>
    <li> Two sprays of this fine keratin complex on my damp hair leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Just use a little, hair shiny and soft. Love it. A must have for us flat iron addicts.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, is the best thing for your hair when blow drying or ironing hair. As well as when air drying only</li>
    <li> Exactly what the description stated. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this product works very well. Hair shines and is soft and manageable. Initially I used a leave-in conditioner with this product and my hair felt greasy and heavy.  Now I use the shine spray only after washing my hair and towel drying.</li>
    <li> I think all buyers need to be aware that the product you will receive is expired.  The bottle I received expired in December 2012 and I purchased it here on Amazon in September 2013 not knowing it&#x27;s an expired product.  I don&#x27;t know if using the expired product will damage your hair but I&#x27;m not about to find out. If you want to take that risk then go right ahead.</li>
    <li> I use this with my flat iron  and my hair looks shine and totally straight. I don&#x27;t need to use anything else and smells wonderful...I totally recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  The only spray-on that really works on my hair.  It even works on dry extension hair chip-ins or wig pieces.  Excellent product.  Hope they continue to make it forever!</li>
    <li> I like this product because when I iron my hair don&#x27;t get damage in a looks wonderful I really love it all the people have to try it just one&#x27;s in thiy well love it</li>
    <li> I received this product in June of 2013.  The product expired in December of 2012, which means it is no longer effective.</li>
    <li> I love this this stuff! It is very fine and quite oily so you don&#x27;t need much at all or you&#x27;ll end up with a greasy looking head for sure. A little goes a long way and I just love it; I always buy the liquid serum for these type of products as I know they last a long time. With this product I get the same results if not better and don&#x27;t have to get my hands greasy/dirty one extra time while getting ready! Best thing to me is the SMELL!Is SO AWESOME! I will continue to buy all the coppola products if I continue to get my hair treatment t the salon that goes with them; however it&#x27;s a very expensive treatment($350+tip) and then the products aren&#x27;t the cheapest either, but some are at least quite reasonable prices for such good product. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Incredibly impressed by this product!  I ordered several items from this line but this was the first one to arrived and I noticed an immediate effect even though I had washed and blowed dried my hair with different products.  Utilizing this item with hot iron to get that sleek look was perfect.  I have really curly, spanish hair and this product did not only provide a sleek, shiny, healthy look, but it prevented the frizz.  I live in the southeastern part of the US, where there is lots of humidity and this product withstood the test.  I have spent so much money on other stuff throughout the years and I could not believe it.  It&#x27;s a must!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny. The flat iron just glides through my hair. The first time I used it, several people thought I&#x27;d gotten my hair professionally done. I still get lots of compliments on how shiny my hair is. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It works really well. I use it my daughter and I and it makes a big difference because of the flat ironing and blow drying.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much of this spray, your hair will be greasy.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> After reviewing another review, I checked my product that I bought back in Sept and saw too that it had an exp of Dec 2012. That is NOT acceptable. Will not be doing business again.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  It&#x27;s a different bottle of the one I used previously, but exactly the same content and results.  I love Coppola products!&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this product is to be primarily used for curly hair, thick or unruly hair before flat ironing. Don&#x27;t use too much as you will get very oily results.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product to be used on blond or thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok... Too oily and greasy, it made my hair heavy and oily...&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to a friemd...</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair which is coarse and wavy.I use a flat iron next.I spray the Thermo-Shine on the ends and lightly all over .My hair comes out smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Please see the extensive proof cited below about how this company has knowingly put customers at risk.  The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products. Please do not purchase Coppola product until you at least look at this link.    REAL STORIES OF WOMEN BALDING BECAUSE OF COPPOLA KERATIN PRODUCTS:  [...]  Please see this link of Coppola knowingly putting customers at risk and the very same products  being recalled in other countries:  [...]  Please see Coppola (AKA Copomon) cited for violation of OSHA guidelines:  [...]</li>
    <li> this is my favorite, I use on my wet hair before I blow dry.. it gives a good shine</li>
    <li> I have been using Keratin Complex products for over a year now and I am very pleased with the results.  My hair is healthy, manageable and fabulous!!.  The shine spray may not be good for thin hair but great for thick, spongy, black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rusk thermal shine is a great product too.</li>
    <li> Hair so soft, smells great and is a pump bottle so environment friendly. I bought this to use with my straightener but so far have just used with my drier. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the only straight ironing product that I will use. It not only helps the iron glide through your hair really smoothly, but it makes my hair look really sleek, soft and not greasy. I have used other products that work alright, but none work nearly as well with my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first spray I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t feel wet after using it and if you use it sparingly it won&#x27;t make your hair greasy. I have thick hair that&#x27;s naturally curly. When I&#x27;m done using this with a flat iron my hair looks like a commercial. It looks healthy straight and bouncy. Only gave 4 stars because I wish 3oz didn&#x27;t cost $12.</li>
    <li> helps straighten hair, makes hair very silky and smooth.  I really the smell as well and stayed for a few days</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair.  Love love love thermoshine.  Bi-racial hair needs extra protection and shine.  Use on wet or dry hair -- I do both.</li>
    <li> If you want shiny, glossy hair, this will do it.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but only need to use a little...just a quick spray.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this spray is wonderful for straightening!  After I dry my hair I spray this as I use the flattening iron.  Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. My hair looks puffy and unruly after blow drying. My keratin spray and my tourmaline iron and presto beautiful shiny straight hair !!!  It lasts through the next shampoo and my hair never feels weighed down or greasy. I have used tons of different products, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine-ish, dark brown &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; hair that has been recently highlighted/ombre-d, which as we all know is pretty tough on hair. The processing left the very blonde parts fried and &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34;. I do flatiron and blow dry my hair on occasion, so wanted to try a keratin spray to protect it. I tried the RENPURE 4-day straight, which did straighten nicely and protect, but it left my locks dry to the touch and not as shiny as I would have liked. Also a bit stiff and crunchy--NOT a good look. I remembered the Coppola line of keratin products so I decided to give this shine spray a try.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW. Despite all the processing and styling and heat and ironing, my hair is shiny, glossy, straight, and HEALTHY looking, even the fried parts. You spray it in lightly in sections before styling. I added a little extra before ironing too, which really gave it extra shine. There is no stiffness or crunchy texture either, just straight glossy hair that looks and feels healthy and natural.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this by the truckload.</li>
    <li> Great Product, exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Love it! Only by applying this product i was able to hide burned bleached hair. Simply life saver!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to straighten my hair with I have very curly thick hair I am spanish this work wonders with out burning my hair its a light oil based mist.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need much of this nor do I use it every time I wash my hair. But it was one of those hair products that you see an instant difference. Most hair products you use, you have to look hard to see if there really was any positive change. But this product brings instant shine and smoothing. I use very little of it. Spritz not on my roots but from the middle of hair to the ends before I flatiron it. I have extensions and my hair goes from looking dry to shiny and Hollywood. And its scent is addictive and heady.</li>
    <li> Keratin Complex Thermo-Shine spray works very well to smooth and impart lots of shine and manageability to my hair. I use a clipless curling iron rather than a flat iron because I don&#x27;t want my hair to be flat but I do want it straight. I use the spray before so I don&#x27;t fry my hair and after to tame it a bit more (my hair naturally is super frizzy and curly too). Used in conjunction with Keratin Complex Color Care shampoo and conditioner, I get great results! This has keratin in it, too, so it&#x27;s also beneficial to your hair, unlike the many shine sprays on the market.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0043KSE5Q Keratin Complex Thermo Shine Spray By Coppola 2.5oz]]</li>
