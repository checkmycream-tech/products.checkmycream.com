      <li>I bought this product thinking that chemical free would be good for my hair.  </li>

      <li>I did warn them it smelled strong, but I liked the way my hair turned out with it.</li>

      <li>But, I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>

      <li>Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair looks &amp; feels</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and have not been that impressed.  </li>
      <li>and it is looking better every week.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>This Fundamental Earth Shampoo and Conditioner is OKAY.</li>
      <li>I do LOVE the shampoo though.</li>
      <li>It feels ok in the shower,</li>
      <li>Love the smell of lavender in this product.</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed using this conditioner (and shampoo).</li>
      <li>But for my daughter it seems to work better</li>
      <li>Seems to rinse very clean.  </li>
      <li>no sulfates, made in USA, natural ingredietns and cleans/conditions my hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>The smell was too strong for me, I typically love lavender scent, I read the reviews, about the smell being strong, but thought I would give it a try any way.</li>
      <li>And I LOVE that the shampoo is truly chemical free.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t linger, so even if I wasn&#x27;t loving the smell, it would be ok because it fades pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>, I have fine wavy hair that is prone to frizz.</li>
      <li>I think for guys hair, this would be fine, though.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>this product is cruelty free.</li>
      <li>And the fact that it is alcohol free.</li>
      <li>Like using cheap lotion as conditioner.</li>
      <li>It a good natural product</li>
      <li>So far so good for me.</li>
      <li>I wish the manufacturer could be more environmentally responsible, perhaps use bio-degradable peanuts?!  </li>
      <li>I think that the ingredients were pretty safe (see the website by the Environmental Working Group)</li>
      <li>This is great for dry hair.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is great, if you have dry hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I leave it in for the full 2 minutes</li>
      <li>My hair was full of split ends, but since using this shampoo the amount of them has reduced drastically.</li>
      <li>Not a bad smell</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, and it is very straight.</li>
      <li>Wife is pregnant and she enjoys the scent.</li>
      <li>I bought 6 bottles, but each one of the bottle comes in its own plastic wrap on top of other plastic bubbles in the box.  </li>
      <li>Used in on my son&#x27;s hair who has been swimming a lot and really helped make it less fly away, smooth and shiny as well.</li>
      <li>I tried a few shampoos with varying levels of success but wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
      <li>It is true that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well</li>
      <li>I have tried other natural products and like this one the best by far.</li>
      <li>detangles well, and my hair is soft and shiny after drying, but the conditioner has a strong plastic smell.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I do when I get in the shower, I take a good amount to really coat my wet hair, massage it through well, and let it sit for the rest of my shower.  </li>
      <li>I have recently decided to try and cut out chemicals in almost everything I can, and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>I try a ton of organic shampoos because my skin is really sensitive and this one didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
      <li>and my hair ends up with a really light, barely there, lavender scent) and the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients, especially the aloe being so high on the list.</li>
      <li>This product put my hair more dry.</li>
      <li>Because these products lack drying ingredients, it&#x27;s just pure moisture, so</li>
      <li>Other than that, they are decent and better than a lot of other brands that claim to be more on the natural and chemical free side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really like the way it makes my hair smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched for hair care products that are petro-chemical free and multiple allergen-free for my situation.</li>
      <li>I really like</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really for my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really liking this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t have to use much of the conditioner --</li>
      <li>and I have used the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>I have searched, and searched for a chemical free shampoo and this was the only one that was real natural product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
      <li>Price is a little high for the amount of product, it takes more conditioner than I&#x27;m used to using - maybe a high water content?</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling clean without leaving it dry or straw like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient is missing, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t keep your hair soft. I tried using it as hand lotion instead, but it&#x27;s n ot good as that either.</li>
    <li> I think that the ingredients were pretty safe (see the website by the Environmental Working Group) and I have used the whole bottle. My scalp is in good condition and I enjoyed using this conditioner (and shampoo).</li>
    <li> It is a good condition for a hair without any treatment but it is not for my hair because I had Keratine and brazilian treatment in the past and I have very damaged hair. This product put my hair more dry. My husband is using it and it is very good for him.</li>
    <li> I was using another organic conditioner and liked it but wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied so I bought this shampoo and conditioner and I love it.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Leaves hair nice and shiny and has a nice smell to it. It is a bit expensive, though.</li>
    <li> Always love this!  No chemicals!  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I bought 6 bottles, but each one of the bottle comes in its own plastic wrap on top of other plastic bubbles in the box.  It is very disappointing to purchase something that is supposed to better for us and the environment, but actually ends on with a bunch of useless trash that is bad for the environment.  I wish the manufacturer could be more environmentally responsible, perhaps use bio-degradable peanuts?!  Otherwise the conditioner is great.  But the seal cap is VERY VERY hard to tear open.</li>
    <li> I wrote another review for the travel size.  But, I&#x27;ll repeat myself.  Use a small amount (about the size of a pea) and it&#x27;s a great product.  For someone with fine hair and sensitive skin, this is the best.  My hair and skin loves what it&#x27;s done for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Did the job, but left my hair really dry. I try a ton of organic shampoos because my skin is really sensitive and this one didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair very soft yet manageable.  It isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  I have very fine hair, so it is hard to find a conditioner that works well.</li>
    <li> no sulfates, made in USA, natural ingredietns and cleans/conditions my hair beautifully. great product</li>
    <li> This is great for dry hair.  I have naturally dry hair.  My hair has an unreal ability to pick up moisture while using this products.  After moisturizing an sealing on wash day my hair is soft and fluffy.  Never putting this product down again.</li>
    <li> Just used the conditioner. Really like the way it makes my hair smell and it makes my hair feel good too. Before I have been using the Wen system, but I wanted to find something without alcohol in it. I found it here. I use just the conditioner and no shampoo. And I don&#x27;t have to use much of the conditioner -- a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll probably be a repeat buyer. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel. Leaves hair feeling clean without leaving it dry or straw like. Not too fond of the smell but it is not so horrible that I wouldn&#x27;t use the product.  I have tried other natural products and like this one the best by far.</li>
    <li> It is true that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well and it doesn&#x27;t help with detangling hair, but it does help with split ends. My hair was full of split ends, but since using this shampoo the amount of them has reduced drastically. And I LOVE that the shampoo is truly chemical free. I have searched, and searched for a chemical free shampoo and this was the only one that was real natural product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of lavender in this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo from this line (I&#x27;ll write a separate review for that).  But, this conditioner cleanses beautifully.  The first thing I do when I get in the shower, I take a good amount to really coat my wet hair, massage it through well, and let it sit for the rest of my shower.  It rinses out well.  I let my hair dry naturally, and it feels like I have shampooed and conditioned it.  It looks great!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is lavender, but natural - not the commercial smell I am use to.  But, I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t linger, so even if I wasn&#x27;t loving the smell, it would be ok because it fades pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is all natural, and leaves my hair shiny and non-oily.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the chemical-filled conditioners, but I think it does the job.</li>
    <li> Good product. The short ingredients list is a plus. Price is a little high for the amount of product, it takes more conditioner than I&#x27;m used to using - maybe a high water content? But very nice.</li>
    <li> I use both the shampoo (which does has a different smell from the conditioner, as another reviewer mentioned, but I like both and my hair ends up with a really light, barely there, lavender scent) and the conditioner. The conditioner is great. I leave it in for the full 2 minutes and I use quite a bit--a little larger than a quarter for my below the shoulders length hair. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, and it is very straight. The conditioner makes it easy to comb through (I comb through it in the shower) and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I love the way my hair looks &amp; feels and I&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioner for about a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and have not been that impressed.  I&#x27;m really liking this conditioner.  My hair is soft and shiny but I don&#x27;t feel like there is residual &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on my hair to make it that way.  Seems to rinse very clean.  Used in on my son&#x27;s hair who has been swimming a lot and really helped make it less fly away, smooth and shiny as well.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again.  It leaves my hair so silky and smooth.  The reason I gave a 4 star rather than a 5 is because of the smell.  Not a bad smell but I am not a fan of it.</li>
    <li> So far so good for me. I&#x27;ve searched for hair care products that are petro-chemical free and multiple allergen-free for my situation. It&#x27;s now over two weeks of use and no rash. It&#x27;s actually soothing. I enjoy the scent. My hair is chin length so a tiny dab is all I need. I really like this product is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great. When I switched from a conventional chemical-laiden shampoo to this one, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair at all ... I was very worried my hair would look flat or greasy, but there is no negative change with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great, if you have dry hair. Because these products lack drying ingredients, it&#x27;s just pure moisture, so if you have oily hair or even normal hair, you probably don&#x27;t need this. It&#x27;s so gentle though that I can use it as a base to shave instead! I can feel the moisture even in the shower and throughout the week. Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that chemical free would be good for my hair.  I was wrong.  My hair is drier than before.  Returning it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this natural conditioner because it is chemical-free (and made in the US a plus, too).  It feels ok in the shower, detangles well, and my hair is soft and shiny after drying, but the conditioner has a strong plastic smell.  Not sure what argon oil smells like, so maybe that is what I detect, but it sure isn&#x27;t lavender!</li>
    <li> It a good natural product but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really for my hair. Tends to dry it out a little more then I like. (I have thick curly hair). But for my daughter it seems to work better (she has wavy hair) Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but would suggest it to someone who have greasier then normal hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 6 months now and love the results.  My hair became very dull with age and processing.  This product brought my hair back to life.  The only problem I have is the availability of this product.  It seems to always be sold out.</li>
    <li> This Fundamental Earth Shampoo and Conditioner is OKAY. The shampoo is very thin compared to normal shampoo and doesnt really lather. For short hair you may get away with using a tablespoon or two, but for long hair you will fill your entire hand and still probably have to go back for more. Same deal with the conditioner. Other than that, they are decent and better than a lot of other brands that claim to be more on the natural and chemical free side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also want to be selective about what other items you order along with this. Our bottles were shipped with other items and they were simply tossed into the shipping box. The pop top lid opened and the contents leaked all over, but amazon took care of that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t care for it, but others may feel differently.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, and have had the worst time trying to find a product that I really like. I have recently decided to try and cut out chemicals in almost everything I can, and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this. I have to say I&#x27;m impressed. My hair feels very clean, and smells wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t lather like chemical shampoo (it has no sodium laurel sulfate) so if you&#x27;re used to lather, it&#x27;s a bit different. I am going to use this on my 2 year old daughter as well. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I started the no poo method 3 months ago and waited for my hair to get through transition. And waited while my hair seemed to turn to straw. I wasn&#x27;t using the baking soda + ACV method but other no poo shampoos. I finally decided enough was enough and decided to try low poo.  I tried a few shampoos with varying levels of success but wasn&#x27;t happy. Then, I tried this conditioner instead of my other natural conditioners. It is just what my hair needs. It moisturizers without leaving any gunk behind. I wash my hair every 3 days and let it air dry and it is looking better every week.&lt;br /&gt;For informational purposes, I have fine wavy hair that is prone to frizz. But, my hair seems to drink up the moisture in this conditioner. I love the ingredients, especially the aloe being so high on the list. And the fact that it is alcohol free. My hair is seeming to go back to the way it was when I was younger and only washed once or twice a week and never blow dried.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how my hair felt dry and didn&#x27;t want to comb out after using this and their conditioner. I am open to trying other products of theirs but not these again. I think for guys hair, this would be fine, though. No worry about snarls. :))</li>
    <li> Not detangling enough for my curly hair.  I do LOVE the shampoo though.</li>
    <li> I bought it together with the shampoo and that&#x27;s one of the best decisions I ever made. My hair smells and feels great. It doesn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as it used to, therefore I wash my hair less often now. I feel that I don&#x27;t even need to use leave-in conditioners anymore. It&#x27;s really great!!</li>
    <li> My wife has brought home hippie shampoo before and I did not like them.  This stuff is great.  Wife is pregnant and she enjoys the scent.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Wonderful fragrance too..Leaves my hair shiny and with good volume. Would use nothing else on my hair.</li>
    <li> Like using cheap lotion as conditioner.</li>
    <li> The smell was too strong for me, I typically love lavender scent, I read the reviews, about the smell being strong, but thought I would give it a try any way. Well, I anded up giving it away to a friend. Hope they remain friends,lol! I did warn them it smelled strong, but I liked the way my hair turned out with it.</li>
    <li> Just okay...had problems still with chemical but ,any just be me...buy at your own risk... Way over priced though..sorry thanks</li>
</ol>
