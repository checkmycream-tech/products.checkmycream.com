      <li>Nice picks but</li>
      <li>this set came in a nice pouch and had all the pieces nicely oriented inside.</li>
      <li>Handy item to have on hand.</li>
      <li>All have fine points, would have liked a scraper included.  </li>
      <li>but I have had a better set but can&#x27;t remember where I purchased them.  </li>
      <li>Overall great item!</li>
      <li>I use these as industrial tools (not as dental tools), mostly when working with printed circuit boards, and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure these are softer than what you are cleaning.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
      <li>They are made of a good grade stainless steel that is strong, and have resisted flaking and rust.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sharpened the business end on them a couple of times and they come out as good as new.  </li>
      <li>Recommend for fine point work and removing bits of plaque.</li>
      <li>You can get the same results using a Phillips screw driver lol.</li>
      <li>(That, and at the time of this writing are still being shipped for free).</li>
      <li>Rust free after years.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive, yet cheaply made.</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend the product -- they are nice quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Very much recommended... : )</li>
      <li>I got these to clean my dogs teeth</li>
      <li>my kitty would not stand still for me to clean his teeth.</li>
      <li>Good little variety of good quality gum-jabbers and crown-decrusters ;)</li>
      <li>They work great, but be careful because they may scratch the surface.  </li>
      <li>good enough for my purposes.</li>
      <li>Also was delivered quickly</li>
      <li>I bought the tools for cleaning machinery, and they are adequate for the task.</li>
      <li>I use these to clean the hard to reach places and it works great, I gave it 4 stars because one of them broke on the first use, but I was using it under more stressful situation than for which it was made.</li>
      <li>The packaging was a little &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; looking, so I don&#x27;t know how comfortable I&#x27;d be using them on someone&#x27;s teeth, but as a general pick they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
      <li>There are much better quality picks available for the same price.  </li>
      <li>I use them to clean the tartar off my dog&#x27;s teeth and my neighbors when she talks to much.  .  </li>
      <li>Great little tooth pickin doodads!  </li>
      <li>They work great for small crafts.</li>
      <li>The rest have ends with various shapes that might be handy for certain craft projects...</li>
      <li>The picks had little rubber covers on each end (perfect for protecting fingers when the picks are removed from the individual pockets in which they are stored).  </li>
      <li>Though it is not recommended you use these kind of tools unless you are a specialist, I still do gentle cleaning with them in places I can&#x27;t reach or places my toothbrush just can&#x27;t do enough work in.</li>
      <li>Got it super fast.</li>
      <li>It might be okay for a hobby purpose, but DEFINITELY NOT as a dental probe.</li>
      <li>They may come in handy if I drop something down into my car engine or something....</li>
      <li>Solid and do not bend easy</li>
      <li>The tips are very fine and sharp.</li>
      <li>it comes in a whole set</li>
      <li>I admit I didn&#x27;t shop around much.  </li>
      <li>But these kind of dental picks I use for the very finest of work, the really small stuff that can&#x27;t be handled by much else.  </li>
      <li>Never need to by toothpicks or floss for personal use, pays for it self rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Using this for getting into tight spots to clean, Pretty neat set for the price.</li>
      <li>You get a complete set of different shapes that for me make it possible to finely hone any irregular piece I have come across in my models.  </li>
      <li>Fall apart easily, but they work well for a little while.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also since used them to clean handguns after range time, and some other things.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these picks.  </li>
      <li>The tips are a little dull (which is great for my use), most other picks are sharp.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty rough.  </li>
      <li>One other oddity is that they smell funny.  </li>
      <li>Other small tools like scalpels, tweezers, and pliers are all part of the effort for sure.  </li>
      <li>I build model wooden ships, and many of the pieces are very finely crafted wooden and plastic parts that can be very difficult to put together if there is just a small imperfection in them.  </li>
      <li>why there is no flat tipped ones?</li>
</ol>

<li> why there is no flat tipped ones?</li>
<li> They all were still raw, square ends that would be much too large and harsh to use in your gums.</li>
<li> I would prefer then to have a flat tip so that you could actually scrape off the stuff from your teeth.</li>
<li> quality item, but...meh..just a long bent nail..</li>
<li> The metal of the actual pick is very rough, not well suited to any activity that may involve bacterial contamination.  </li>
<li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
<li> Very minimal quality.</li>
<li> Packaging was a little sketchy if you want to store it you have to be careful taking it out</li>
<li> Not very smooth.</li>
<li> The ends of all of the picks were not even machined or sharpened down to a point.</li>
<li> I purchased these for use in my shop for positioning springs and other small parts -- and for that, they&#x27;re just what the doctor ordered.</li>
<li> This pick set is useless as far as being in your mouth is concerned.</li>
<li> I use them for cleaning small metal parts and for cleaning rifles in hard to reach places.  </li>
<li> These are round tip, hence not exactly good for cleaning off the hard deposit on your teeth.</li>
<li> These dental tools are very difficult to find in stores, and usually only come one at a time when you do.  </li>
<li> the only thing bad was the package the picks came in very hard to remove, had to cut out the pieces</li>
<li> These were very poor quality tools.  </li>
<li> Very poor finish on the picks and bits of metal flake off when I touch it.</li>
<li> very poor quality...</li>
<li> Terrible purchase!!!!!!!!! :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use them to fix my scuba gear. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use them on actual teeth. good enough for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Packaging was a little sketchy if you want to store it you have to be careful taking it out but the picks itself are great and no complaints. Solid and do not bend easy so its a good product.</li>
    <li> I needed the find points on these.  I received a set of wax sculpting tools that did not have the points I needed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good packaging. These are not dental office quality, but I&#x27;m not a dentist. I purchased these for use in my shop for positioning springs and other small parts -- and for that, they&#x27;re just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> These are round tip, hence not exactly good for cleaning off the hard deposit on your teeth. I would prefer then to have a flat tip so that you could actually scrape off the stuff from your teeth.</li>
    <li> I received about a dozen instruments but only 1 was somewhat like the 4 pictured.  The rest have ends with various shapes that might be handy for certain craft projects...so, for the price I&#x27;ll keep them, but what I got was not 4 pieces of the items shown</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Inexpensive, yet cheaply made. Very minimal quality. Excellent when woking with marshmallows or whip creme.</li>
    <li> this set came in a nice pouch and had all the pieces nicely oriented inside. Very happy customer. This goes in my bugout bag with my medical gear for emergencies: are you prepared?</li>
    <li> I purchased these to add to my gun cleaning kit.  They work great, but be careful because they may scratch the surface.  Make sure these are softer than what you are cleaning.  Overall great item!</li>
    <li> Built solid but they hurt your teeth. Not very smooth.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean the hard to reach places and it works great, I gave it 4 stars because one of them broke on the first use, but I was using it under more stressful situation than for which it was made.</li>
    <li> I like these things... it comes in a whole set so you can use one for cleaning teeth, one for something else... etc...</li>
    <li> These picks will be perfect for the fine detail  work in some of my crafts.  The tips are very fine and sharp.</li>
    <li> I use these as industrial tools (not as dental tools), mostly when working with printed circuit boards, and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> These are pretty rough.  I use them for cleaning small metal parts and for cleaning rifles in hard to reach places.  The tips are a little dull (which is great for my use), most other picks are sharp.  The metal of the actual pick is very rough, not well suited to any activity that may involve bacterial contamination.  There are much better quality picks available for the same price.  One other oddity is that they smell funny.  Makes you wonder what chemicals they used to treat them.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great little tooth pickin doodads!  Got the plaquey crusties outta my dental grooves very nicely. Good little variety of good quality gum-jabbers and crown-decrusters ;)</li>
    <li> These were very poor quality tools.  But what did I expect for the price?  The tools arrived with a sticker warning that they contain a substance known by the state of California to cause cancer.  I would not advise putting these dental tools in anyone&#x27;s mouth.  I bought the tools for cleaning machinery, and they are adequate for the task.</li>
    <li> Fall apart easily, but they work well for a little while.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest tools.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these picks.  The picks had little rubber covers on each end (perfect for protecting fingers when the picks are removed from the individual pockets in which they are stored).  Very nicely packaged and very good workmanship.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected. They work great for small crafts. However they are not rounded. The pick part itself has angles of where it was cut and not buffed. Plus the tips are much larger than the ones they use at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a swimming pool service tech in Arizona and I use these to unclog the impellars of pool motors when they get debri in them. Does the trick. Also was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this set to use for cleaning out the seal grooves on a motorcycle brake caliper.  For that purpose, they were perfect.  I&#x27;ve also since used them to clean handguns after range time, and some other things.  The packaging was a little &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; looking, so I don&#x27;t know how comfortable I&#x27;d be using them on someone&#x27;s teeth, but as a general pick they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> the only thing bad was the package the picks came in very hard to remove, had to cut out the pieces</li>
    <li> These will be good to have in our emergency kit.......just in case......however, I hope we never have to use them.</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with these tools. Though it is not recommended you use these kind of tools unless you are a specialist, I still do gentle cleaning with them in places I can&#x27;t reach or places my toothbrush just can&#x27;t do enough work in.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like flossing and toothpicks just don&#x27;t cut it. I have learned to use these picks carefully enough for personal use and they work wonders. Never need to by toothpicks or floss for personal use, pays for it self rather quickly.</li>
    <li> As advertised and solid construction.  All have fine points, would have liked a scraper included.  Recommend for fine point work and removing bits of plaque.</li>
    <li> Using this for getting into tight spots to clean, Pretty neat set for the price. Got it super fast. Handy item to have on hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I have had a better set but can&#x27;t remember where I purchased them.  I have that set at another location.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a dental probe or something similar, please save your $ and look somewhere else.  This item is nothing close to what a dentist uses.  It might be okay for a hobby purpose, but DEFINITELY NOT as a dental probe.</li>
    <li> very poor quality...You can get the same results using a Phillips screw driver lol. I would try a different  brand</li>
    <li> This pick set is useless as far as being in your mouth is concerned. The ends of all of the picks were not even machined or sharpened down to a point. They all were still raw, square ends that would be much too large and harsh to use in your gums. Your mouth would be dripping with blood if you used these in your mouth. They may come in handy if I drop something down into my car engine or something....that&#x27;s about all I can say for these picks. Terrible purchase!!!!!!!!! :(</li>
    <li> I got these to clean my dogs teeth and they work great. I would highly recommend the product -- they are nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> instead of having 4 pairs, it would be enough to have just 1. all the tips are pointy. why there is no flat tipped ones? to scrap on the tooth? no color difference. so, you cannot assign/distinguish one separately for each family member. quality item, but...meh..just a long bent nail.. thats all.</li>
    <li> Bought these for weapon cleaning. Work great. Rust free after years.</li>
    <li> I have used dental tools for working with my wooden models for years.  I build model wooden ships, and many of the pieces are very finely crafted wooden and plastic parts that can be very difficult to put together if there is just a small imperfection in them.  Other small tools like scalpels, tweezers, and pliers are all part of the effort for sure.  But these kind of dental picks I use for the very finest of work, the really small stuff that can&#x27;t be handled by much else.  When I bought this set I admit I didn&#x27;t shop around much.  They were one of the cheapest sets at the time here on  Amazon, and I ordered them based strictly on that. (That, and at the time of this writing are still being shipped for free). Fortunately they have turned out to be of excellent quality for the price.  They are made of a good grade stainless steel that is strong, and have resisted flaking and rust.  I&#x27;ve sharpened the business end on them a couple of times and they come out as good as new.  These dental tools are very difficult to find in stores, and usually only come one at a time when you do.  You get a complete set of different shapes that for me make it possible to finely hone any irregular piece I have come across in my models.  Very much recommended... : )</li>
    <li> I use them to clean the tartar off my dog&#x27;s teeth and my neighbors when she talks to much.  .  Hey, how do they make tartar sauce?</li>
    <li> Great for my purpose (cleaning tiny details of metal pieces I restore) but I would NOT use these in my mouth. Very poor finish on the picks and bits of metal flake off when I touch it. Also made of toxic low grade steel. Don&#x27;t use for its intended purpose!</li>
    <li> Nice picks but my kitty would not stand still for me to clean his teeth.</li>
