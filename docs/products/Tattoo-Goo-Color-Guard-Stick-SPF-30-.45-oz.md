      <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out!!!!</li>
      <li>I have many tattoos and some with a lot of color.  </li>
      <li>This smells good and it&#x27;s still winter right now</li>
      <li>Not a bad smell, just kind of a coconutty sunblock smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and protected my tattoo even when the rest of my body got sunburned.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I like this &amp;#34;giant chapstick&amp;#34; idea, you can SPF just your tattoos very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Only used it once, but it was great</li>
      <li>I can not wait to see if it really works!!!</li>
      <li>I have used this in the past and this was perfect for my cruise.</li>
      <li>Protected my fresh tattoo!</li>
      <li>This really works really well!!!!</li>
      <li>This product is Very small, but it suresure smells awesome!</li>
      <li>I love it and recommend it highly.</li>

      <li>Simple to use, cheap, and lasts a lonnng time.</li>
      <li>Spent most of today in the sun today and burned everywhere</li>
      <li>and they look really vibrant when I use the stick on them.</li>
      <li>The application area is bigger than a lip balm, which does make it difficult to apply perfectly.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s compact enough to keep handy when that ol&#x27; sun tries and come out to fade my ink.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but it&#x27;s not really much better than a regular cream SPF 30 sunblock.</li>
      <li>I should have taken a picture of my sunburn, and the contrast between it and the area surrounding my new tattoo.  </li>
      <li>If you have tats and want to keep them like new in the sun or even if you go to a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I have a name tattooed near my wrist</li>
      <li>product was fine, other than the fact that I ordered 2 and only received one.</li>
      <li>I was trying to cover cursive writing and application would be easier on a large solid area.  </li>
      <li>This will last me a long time because I don&#x27;t go out much.</li>

    <li> This product is Very small, but it suresure smells awesome! I can not wait to see if it really works!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and the order/delivery was great</li>
    <li> I really like this Tattoo Color Guard. It does what it suppose to do. When I tanned it kept my tattoos from fading. They are still nice and bright andd there is no signs of fading. They are just as brite as the day when I got them. 2 Thumbs up on this product. 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, smells nice. And best of it worked well for on a trip to Costa Rica.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love how convenient this is!  I keep it in my purse and use it very day.  I have a name tattooed near my wrist and I don&#x27;t want it to fade or smear.  I was told by my tattoo artist to not let the tattoo tan.  This works great!</li>
    <li> Had to replenish my supply and it was a good price. I love it and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. stays on and protects under extreme conditions.I use it while doing yard work during the brightest and hottest hours of the day. stays on even when sweating or wet from water.</li>
    <li> product was fine, other than the fact that I ordered 2 and only received one.</li>
    <li> Living in South Florida and being out in the sun all day this works great.  I have many tattoos and some with a lot of color.  People always ask me how do you keep your tats so bright brother.  This is the answer.  If you have tats and want to keep them like new in the sun or even if you go to a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I use it on my tattoos when I go tanning and it keeps them bright and colorful! It also smells great and is easy to use!</li>
    <li> Smells like teen spirit! No, no, no more like coconut but stuff goes on great and it&#x27;s compact enough to keep handy when that ol&#x27; sun tries and come out to fade my ink.</li>
    <li> The package is deceiving - this stuff is great!  Spent most of today in the sun today and burned everywhere but may tat&#x27;s were nice and protected.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Expected delivery date was the 8th-23rd of April and I got it on the 6th. Keeps my blacks black and colors bright.</li>
    <li> Could not believe how well this worked!  I should have taken a picture of my sunburn, and the contrast between it and the area surrounding my new tattoo.  The application area is bigger than a lip balm, which does make it difficult to apply perfectly.  I was trying to cover cursive writing and application would be easier on a large solid area.  However, no disputing that this works in the sunscreen department!</li>
    <li> Nothing special…just use regular SPF sticks.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Worked so well on the dream catcher on my shoulder, that I tanned around where it was applied, and got absolutely no sun or damage on my tattoo. Lord knows you don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on something and then allow the sun to damage it! I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff!</li>
    <li> Went to Australia where the sun beats down hard, and this stick did exactly as advertised. My only complaint is the size of the container.... It&#x27;s tiny.</li>
    <li> Great Product , very fast shipping would definately buy again from this seller A++++**</li>
    <li> Smells good, but it&#x27;s not really much better than a regular cream SPF 30 sunblock. Tube is surprisingly small for the price.</li>
    <li> This absolutely smells divine.  Don&#x27;t have a clue if it&#x27;s working or not since my flower tattoo is on the back of my neck.  But it gives me peace of mind that i&#x27;m protecting the color with this.  The smell is just awesome.</li>
    <li> Color Guard is a must have item for the summer if you have tattoos.  Always works good in and out of the water.</li>
    <li> Only used it once, but it was great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and protected my tattoo even when the rest of my body got sunburned. I really love this product and will use it again, it also seems like it&#x27;ll go a long way.</li>
    <li> This really works really well!!!! it brightens up the colors but the only problem is it leaves white marks around the tattoo if you get it on your skin that isnt actually tattooed</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and this was perfect for my cruise. Protected my fresh tattoo!</li>
    <li> This smells good and it&#x27;s still winter right now but I thought it will be good for my tattoos if I do end up going to the beach in the summer. This will last me a long time because I don&#x27;t go out much.</li>
    <li> Works great!! You can tell exactly where you put it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stick. I waited to review it till after I got to spend a while using the product and see my results. My tattoos were covered and you could visibly see where the stick went around my skin, so I could definitely tell they were being protected. After the summer months, plenty of tanning, and beach trips, my tattoos look just as good as before and they look really vibrant when I use the stick on them. Would definitely reccommend to anyone with tattoos! Simple to use, cheap, and lasts a lonnng time.</li>
    <li> I use this in the tanning bed. My tattoo is smaller and there is a white ring around it but not too noticable. Id rather have a white spot than it not protecting my tattoo</li>
    <li> I like this &amp;#34;giant chapstick&amp;#34; idea, you can SPF just your tattoos very quickly.  Seems moisturizing and not greasy. However, I think it&#x27;s too smelly.  Not a bad smell, just kind of a coconutty sunblock smell.</li>
    <li> Recieved this saturday and used it today at the tanning salon! Loved it! You could tell where you put in to so you wont miss a spot and your entire tattoo will be protected!!! I will definitely be buying more when I run out!!!!</li>
    <li> be good to your tattoos! Only bummer about this is you will now have an outline around your tattoo where you don&#x27;t tan, which is annoying when you&#x27;re as pale as me!</li>
    <li> I bought this Tattoo Goo for a trip to Jamaica and used it in conjunction with spray sunscreen and lotion sunscreen on my tattoos. I didn&#x27;t burn at all and they&#x27;re still looking bright! I will continue to use Tattoo Goo!&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the company about the product and got a very quick, helpful response back.</li>
