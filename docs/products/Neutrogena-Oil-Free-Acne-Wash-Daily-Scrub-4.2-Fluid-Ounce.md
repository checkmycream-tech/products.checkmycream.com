      <li>I love the tingly feeling while it&#x27;s on.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>AND - it&#x27;s as smooth as glass!  </li>
      <li>Both of my sons have been used it for more than one year.</li>
      <li>so I use this product concurrently with my [[ASIN:B012BM7JFI TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], which serves as my exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>My acne has improved quite a bit, I am extremely pleased with this buy.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>If you get this - I hope it works better on you than it did on me.</li>
      <li>I love using this face wash, but I find that the scrub aspect isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel clean!</li>
      <li>This is a great product to use with the Neutrogena, as the acne wash cleans your skin really well, and gets rid of all the dirt of the day, excess make-up, and provides a clean slate of skin for the exfoliant to work on.</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this product for a long time, and I know that the quality is very good!</li>
      <li>This product is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Ok, but nothing special</li>
      <li>This stuff works fine.</li>
      <li>so it does not spread across the face so freely.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried everything to get rid of it: ProActiv, Acne Free, prescription creams and medication.</li>
      <li>Follow with an oil free moisturizer.</li>

      <li>Works great on my face and it better than the other scrub I was using for the longest time!</li>
      <li>I find myself rinsing 2 or 3 times just so my face will feel clean.</li>
      <li>It also makes my skin feel clean.</li>
      <li>I noticed more frequent and more severe acne with this soap</li>
      <li>I like this daily-face cleaner because it&#x27;s not too strong and gives you a fresh feeling while using it.</li>
      <li>&#x27;n there but not as much as before I used this.. :)</li>
      <li>It really wakes me up and leaves my skin smooth!</li>
      <li>Glad I made this purchase by accident haha</li>
      <li>Nice smell and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>I like scrubs better than regular face wash because I feel the microbeads clean your face better.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to keep my face smooth and clean</li>
      <li>And I know of no other way to more accurately describe this product or warn people what it is.</li>
      <li>I really love this product, it leaves your face soft and no acne at all!</li>
      <li>GENTLY!!</li>
      <li>After first use I got results!</li>
      <li>The first day I tried it out, my face felt really clean, not oily, and fresh.</li>
      <li>If you can use heavy cream cleansers on your acne, great.</li>
      <li>In conjunction with an acne spot lotion, I am golden.</li>
      <li>Use it every other day and feel good on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out your skin and it leaves your skin smooth and acne free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s main purpose is to clean and reduce Acne.</li>
      <li>And the price is very reasonable considering</li>
      <li>I was hoping this was more similar to apricot scrub</li>
      <li>For that deep cleaning of your pores, I don&#x27;t think there is a better cleaser then this acne scrub.  </li>
      <li>so i, who have acne-prone skin, lived my teenage years virtually zit-free :)</li>
      <li>The price is not bad compared to similar products and free shipping is always a plus.</li>
      <li>This is good to use as an everyday scrub.</li>
      <li>Keeps my face exfoliated, clean and clear.</li>
      <li>This wash itself has a really odd smell to it kind of like glue, and it feels like glue with sand in it..</li>
      <li>It seems to do a decent job of controlling the rare occasions that I actually get acne, but it doesn&#x27;t really leave my face feeling clean after a shower.</li>
      <li>I still use it every so often now, but feel that it&#x27;s not doing much anymore.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care or anything, but should be noted.</li>
      <li>this never happened before, the truth was very scared</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work very well for me.</li>
      <li>It cleared his face up VERY well.</li>
      <li>The price is a dollar or more than other stores so why not buy these on amazon.</li>
      <li>I use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and also use Neutrogena 3-1 Acne treatment twice a day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad enough to keep you from using it, IF you want an acne cleanser in this formula.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t do it for my face. I have very fair skin and it was too rough for me. But my boyfriend loves it. It cleared his face up VERY well. If you are like me and have fair/sensitive skin you may want to try something else. I use Neutrogena Grapefruit.</li>
    <li> This stuff works fine. I like the brand, I use their cosmetics and sunscreen... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better or worse than others, but it didn&#x27;t cost very much. There are microbeads that helps with exfoliating, but it&#x27;s not as hard as St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub though. This is good to use as an everyday scrub.</li>
    <li> i bought it while ago but has not made any difference to my acne. i m still having problem so i had to buy other product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for the past 7 years and it originally helped a bunch with my teen acne and slightly oily face (granted it was the first face wash I&#x27;d ever used). I still use it every so often now, but feel that it&#x27;s not doing much anymore. I have normal/combination skin and I don&#x27;t break out often but when I use this face wash, it feels like my face gets oily after a while. It doesn&#x27;t feel as though it completely cleans my face. I got a sample of the Nourish Organics in an Ipsy subscription bag and started using that instead. Overall, this is an ok face wash, but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
    <li> Good product in fighting acne</li>
    <li> my wife using it or maybe 4 nights.  but she complaint the pain on her face drying up and panicked!!!! she immediately brought face lotion or something like that to reverse the effects.</li>
    <li> I have used it for more than 2 weeks now.  My breakouts are almost gone, and skin feels much better.  I only use it at night to avoid dryness.  I use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and also use Neutrogena 3-1 Acne treatment twice a day.  I think I will keep using these products.</li>
    <li> I love this product on subscribe and save. I can find it on sale locally, but subscribe and save saves me the trouble of thinking about it. Good deal. Would buy locally if it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The picture you have of the 60 second mask scrub is the wrong product to what is being sold!  I ended up with something different to what I bought and now I have to hassle with returning it. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture. Thats not what you will be purchasing.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly. It works very good. You can use this to scrap not just your face, but also your neck.</li>
    <li> My daily face wash for the past 5 years - not harsh at all and does not leave my face feeling dry</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me.I have been using it for about two weeks now, it did not keep me from breaking out at all. So I think I&#x27;m going back with my clearasil. Although it does leave your skin with a feel of smoothness but that&#x27;s all. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my face feel clean!</li>
    <li> Excelent product, I am buying more of this, perfect to clean the face for teenagers, and you feel the face clear ,,is also nice to use it before going out</li>
    <li> love this company, works great on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various face washes to replace the cetaphil I&#x27;ve used for years, and so far this is probably my least favorite. It&#x27;s main purpose is to clean and reduce Acne. I noticed more frequent and more severe acne with this soap then I&#x27;ve had with any other yet. It also did nothing to acne once it had surfaced - it would last for days and weeks. It was as if I was just washing with water. This wash itself has a really odd smell to it kind of like glue, and it feels like glue with sand in it.. I don&#x27;t really care or anything, but should be noted. If you get this - I hope it works better on you than it did on me.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was more similar to apricot scrub but the microbeads are much smaller and less noticeable.  Soap has a nice sent and almost a menthol type freshness after using.  Will be going back to a differ facial scrub once this is done. I prefer st ives apricot scrub personally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to be nice about it, but there&#x27;s just no way to do that. And I know of no other way to more accurately describe this product or warn people what it is. It is basically the stuff from inside the Pond&#x27;s jar from your great-grandma&#x27;s dressing table from 1937-ish. It also has ragged, uneven, ground-up bits of fruit-pits in it that scratch and scrape your skin instead of exfoliating it, as well as clogging every pore that isn&#x27;t microscopic. It has a less-than-pleasant odor, but it&#x27;s not too off-putting. It&#x27;s not bad enough to keep you from using it, IF you want an acne cleanser in this formula. All the salicylic acid in the world will not rescue your face from the breakout that is just waiting for you in this tube. If you can use heavy cream cleansers on your acne, great. This might be for you. If not, and I suspect most can&#x27;t, then stay away from this like the plague.</li>
    <li> I am still carded 90% of the time I buy alcohol, I like to think it is my Asian genes that make me look young, but sometimes I wonder if it is because I still get pimples as an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does the job.  It has little scrubbing bubbles that make you feel like you are getting your face cleaner, although it probably is some type of placebo effect, but that&#x27;s beside the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that I use this twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like other cleaners do.  Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t contain benzene peroxide so my towels don&#x27;t become tye-dye.  In conjunction with an acne spot lotion, I am golden.</li>
    <li> It seems to do a decent job of controlling the rare occasions that I actually get acne, but it doesn&#x27;t really leave my face feeling clean after a shower.</li>
    <li> Both of my sons have been used it for more than one year. My older son doesn&#x27;t use it anymore because his Acne is gone, but the younger one still needs to wash and scrub his face with acne wash and it really works. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  An older guy.  I could care less about the anti-acne properties of this product.  However, I do have wicked bad ingrown hairs.  Gross, I know, but what are ya gonna do?  Well, use this stuff.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good face scrub product that actually SCRUBS.  I should be using lava soap - do you know what that stuff is?  Anyhow, I really wanna scrub my face, and CVS doesn&#x27;t sell their old one I used to buy, so I bought this instead.  It is now part of my daily routine.  Before I shave every morning, I use this - I give my face a nice wash and scrub.  And I tell you, I cut myself far less when shaving AND - it&#x27;s as smooth as glass!  Less razor burn, less bleeding like a stuck pig, and a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.... well, you know.</li>
    <li> It really wakes me up and leaves my skin smooth! its a really great exfoliater</li>
    <li> I have always had acne and I have tried everything to get rid of it: ProActiv, Acne Free, prescription creams and medication. The only thing that has ever worked for me is this product!! It does not dry out your skin and it leaves your skin smooth and acne free. It is the best!!</li>
    <li> This scrub works well for body breakouts-especially with a soft manual long handled scrub brush to reach all body surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable improvement after one application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a large variety of face wash brands over the past 15 or so years.  I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Daily Scrub for about two years now and find that it&#x27;s the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  I like scrubs better than regular face wash because I feel the microbeads clean your face better.  The scent is nice and neutral (not girly).  And the price is very reasonable considering one bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week. It takes just a little bit to cleanse the entire face. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> About the same as the other Neutrogenia.  Ok, but nothing special</li>
    <li> within three days of daily use my face began to suffer a series of uncontrollable eruptions. this never happened before, the truth was very scared so I decided to stop using. if it was not for my skin type or reaaci&amp;oacute;n was due to some allergic to one of the compounds of the product, but it was a very bad experience.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for some time now.  I have used it daily and sometimes just once a week.  It really helps to keep my face smooth and clean</li>
    <li> works well, good price</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use. I dont have any acne anymore. I used it twice a day. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product works for me; I have oily sensitive skin, male African-American.  If I over apply it, my skin gets irritated; therefore, I wash with it every other night.  Lately, I wash it off with facial soap to remove excess residue.</li>
    <li> For that deep cleaning of your pores, I don&#x27;t think there is a better cleaser then this acne scrub.  Only a little is needed to do the job.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. It didn&#x27;t really work very well for me. I didn&#x27;t like the smell or consistency. I like the grapefruit one better.</li>
    <li> I had really bad break outs in eighth grade, but that ended after i picked this one up. I use only a pearl sized amount for my whole face - that&#x27;s key - don&#x27;t over dry your face! I massage this stuff into my face for a good 1-3 minutes... GENTLY!! Then, i leave it on as a mask as i brush my teeth, and then i rinse it all off. I love the tingly feeling while it&#x27;s on. It&#x27;s not gonna clear your face up over night but it will eventually. Follow with an oil free moisturizer. (i used neutrogena&#x27;s healthy skin with spf)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is gentle enough for everyday use My skin was clear and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so i, who have acne-prone skin, lived my teenage years virtually zit-free :)</li>
    <li> This face wash works wonders on my face! It has lots of tiny beads that exfoliate your skin. I have a mix of both oily and dry skin and this face wash works great for both parts. It also takes off makeup very nicely so I do not need any kind of makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena products for nearly my whole adult life, and I have no plans to stop anytime soon. I love using this face wash, but I find that the scrub aspect isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like so I use this product concurrently with my [[ASIN:B012BM7JFI TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], which serves as my exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a great product to use with the Neutrogena, as the acne wash cleans your skin really well, and gets rid of all the dirt of the day, excess make-up, and provides a clean slate of skin for the exfoliant to work on. Then, the exfoliant cleans even deeper into your pores, preventing future break outs, shrinking existing acne, and for me at least, leaves your skin feeling so much tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with my [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]]  as a spot cleaner and moisturizer. The antibacterial qualities of the tea tree oil prevent more bacteria from getting in to your pores, and the oil moisturizes without being too oily. I definitely recommend this face wash, as well as the other products I mentioned, if you&#x27;re looking for clear skin and a smooth face!</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent and it&#x27;s a pretty fair price but I didn&#x27;t notice any effects in terms of oil control or acne. It&#x27;s nice to use 2-3 times a week to exfoliate but I don&#x27;t see myself repurchasing after it runs out</li>
    <li> gets the dirt and make up out and is great for pimples and shrinking pores. will def. con&#x27;t to buy. great price compared to drug stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. Keeps my face exfoliated, clean and clear. The price is not bad compared to similar products and free shipping is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the cream on my face. My face feels softer.</li>
    <li> I like this daily-face cleaner because it&#x27;s not too strong and gives you a fresh feeling while using it. Remind me a bit of menthol. Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have subscribed to these. They are a great face washing product, wash your face in the shower and unless you have a bad case of acne that all you have to do. The price is a dollar or more than other stores so why not buy these on amazon. With prime you&#x27;re saving time and money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this for over 3 years now and I mix it with my apricot scrub &amp; they both work well together and with astringent &amp; my olay lotion with spf for my face, may get a few zits here &#x27;n there but not as much as before I used this.. :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he loves using it.</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;acne proned\\&quot; skin, so I bought this at target based off all the good reviews I read. The first day I tried it out, my face felt really clean, not oily, and fresh. But it also made my acne even more noticeable and red directly after washing (I may just have really sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t know), but the next day I already saw a difference in how noticeable and not oily my face was. My acne has improved quite a bit, I am extremely pleased with this buy. I would recommend it to anyone with acne proned skin, or anyone like me who stresses too much and gets acne the next day.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because not only is the price right the product is excellant, my skin just keeps on glowing, I suggest if u have not tried this product I can honestly tell you when you do you will not be dissatified,  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell you how I felt about this product,</li>
    <li> a wonderful scrub, not harsh on skin and smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is just an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product. I have dry/average skin and this face wash seems to leave a film of sorts that isn&#x27;t very easy to rinse off. I find myself rinsing 2 or 3 times just so my face will feel clean.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have sensitive facial skin, so I&#x27;ve used products that make my skin super irritated. This is one of the only facial scrubs that doesn&#x27;t do that. It also makes my skin feel clean. But I try not to use it every day because it can dry my skin out. And I recommend a good moisturizer with it!</li>
    <li> Nice smell and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> Not too much smell, lots of scrubbing grit, not much lather so it does not spread across the face so freely.  Similar to other scrubs I have used, it does not really clean out deeper blackheads, but can leave face less oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with this product for a long time, and I know that the quality is very good! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I tried the cream cleanser and liked so i tried this and like it too.  glad i did, its good.</li>
    <li> I started using this twice daily. It soothes my skin and makes me feel like the dirt and oil are being scrubbed away. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, good delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning system and I have great results with my mild acne. Will order again</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it leaves your face soft and no acne at all! After first use I got results! You can use it daily and it feels like fresh when you have it on. Is a little bit hard to remove with water, you have to try hard a little bit.</li>
    <li> Works great on my face and it better than the other scrub I was using for the longest time! Glad I made this purchase by accident haha</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my face every night before going to bed, I will wake up to find a new zit somewhere on my face. Been this way since high school. I like the face wash because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like some other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I use to use the Proactive face wash along with their other products. It helped with acne somewhat, but did dry my face out big time. I&#x27;ve since been using Neutrogena every night along with vitamin pills for acne ([[ASIN:B00QU3EFXO Acne Treatment Supplement: Top Rated Acne Pills for Women, Men, and Teens - 29 Powerful Acne Fighting Ingredients]]) and my skin is probably one the clearest its been.  This is what worked for me!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Use it every other day and feel good on the skin.  Not too dry and not too oily either.  I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin condition changes, but I can feel that it is improved with less pores.</li>
