<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This eye brush set by Bella and Bear are excellent! Has all the eye brushes you need. Came in a very cute box to storage. Perfect for a gift. All the brushes are made very well and are high quality. I like the very soft feeling in my face when I use them. Very professional. Very easy to clean. Included a guide with information on each brush and how to care them. I recommend it for all professional makeup artist and any woman who&#x27;s looking for a  high quality eye brush set.</li>
    <li> OKay, so I was drawn to this brand for so many reasons.  The boxes and designs they use is just so shabby chic!!  It just screams old, romantic and beauty.  Then they pair the two kitties, Bella and Bear... SOLD!!!  I love it from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I only use makeup brushes for my eyes and I am always on the lookout for good ones that not only help me achieve a nice application, but will hold up over time.  I have found both in this brush set.  Although, these are new to me, I can see that I will get a lot of use out of them.  I had no shedding of the brushes of any kind and I used that blender brush quite well.  Each one of the brushes was full, as they should be and worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the classic look(once again) of the brush itself with the black on silver with gold lettering. Each brush has it&#x27;s own Bella and Bear name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Iromote - your shader for all over coverage&lt;br /&gt;2)Pampas Cat - your blender&lt;br /&gt;3)Leopard Cat - your smudger&lt;br /&gt;4)Black Footed Cat - angled brow/crease&lt;br /&gt;5&amp;6)Iberian Lynx - spoolie and fine angled for brows or liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard for me to choose my fave out of these.  I found them all to do excellent jobs and together worked perfectly!  I love this set and it&#x27;s at a fantastic price, too hard to resist.  This set is a great gift set or something extra special for yourself.  Treat yourself...you deserve it!</li>
    <li> Only 3 out of the 5 eye brushes are nice.  The brush called Pampas Cat (blending brush) sheds like a cat.  The brush called Leopard Cat (pencil brush) is not soft at all and actually kind irritating when used in the eye area.  It also has practically no point at the tip, so I&#x27;m not sure why it is described as a pencil brush.  I bought two sets of these as they were on sale.  I tried all the brushes from both boxes and it wasn&#x27;t a fluke.  Pampas Cat and Leopard Cat brushes are not worth getting.</li>
    <li> Bought the set for the brow brush, but all of the brushes are great :) definitely a great buy for the price</li>
    <li> I have been using my Cat Eye brush set for a little while now and they are some of my favorite brushes to use when applying my eye makeup.  Great quality and I have not had any shedding of the brushes.  Always make sure you wash your brushes before using them, it makes a big difference in how they feel.  These brushes are soft and are great at picking up product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted these to be great. The price was amazing and the packaging was beautiful. However, the Pampas Cat blending brush sheds so badly, that I wouldn&#x27;t use it anywhere near my eyes. That was the brush I was most looking forward to in the set. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged and exceeded my expectations! My girls will love them,</li>
    <li> The brushes are absolutely horrible!!!! Not a single brush was worth keeping some of them were shedding and uneven not worth buying! Take my word I wouldn&#x27;t even take them if they were free</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> So pleased with my brush set! I&#x27;ve never herd of Bella and Bear tell I made this purchase, I was originally looking for only a double sided spoolie when I came across this set. The quality is superb. Every brush does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Every makeup artist needs a set in there kit, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> For the price there are good brushes ! Love them I will continue to buy this brand</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They are super soft. I love how they each brush comes with a description of what its use is. Most importantly, the price is amazing!!! $12 for this set is such a steal. Fast shipping. Love them!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are of good quality and I was amazed at how quickly they came to my house.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Wold buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> They can in early in such a cute package and had instructions on which brush was which and what they are used for which is great if your a beginner like me. The brushes are so soft and well putt together my makeup looked wonderful! Only thing is that it does smell very funny when you open it... Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Just can&#x27;t beat the quality of Bella &amp; Bear items. I got mine free to review but I have bought from them before and I am never disappointed. I love this Cat Eyes set - it has everything you need to do perfect eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;I was even able to use eyeshadow as a liner using the Black Footed Cat brush in the set and the brow brush is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The brow bush - the Lberian Lynx is prefect for really getting in there and fluffing up the eyebrows and shaping them.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite in this set is the Leopard Cat because it really helps me with that smokey eye look.&lt;br /&gt;Great set!</li>
    <li> This eye brush set by Bella and Bear is the best tool to create a quick go-to look day everyday&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so sure on this set but once giving it a go made me stop using other eye brushes as it contains&lt;br /&gt;all the brushes needed to create your desired look. This is the first time using eye brush set by Bella and Bear&lt;br /&gt;and wasn&#x27;t so sure if it was worth buying this item or if did the job but once trying it out blew my mind furthermore&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great price and not as expensive as I thought. Definitely will repurchase! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This set of eye makeup brushes has every type of brush you need to create beautiful looks. This set comes with 5 full size brushes. This includes the  Iberian Lynx brush, which is used for your brows and lashes. The Leopard Cat brush, this one I found to be great for smudging out my liner, and for adding small amounts of color to add to a look. Next up is the Iromote brush which I use for adding color to my lid, and it works wonderfully with cream eye shadows! Then we have the Pampas Cat brush which is the perfect blending brush. And last but not least is the Black Footed Cat, which is a slanted fluffy brush that is great for working in corners, and on the brow bone area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using all of these brushes over the past 2 weeks and I have had the chance to try them out with all sorts of different products. I have to say that I am quite pleased with this set! The brushes are easy to work with, and do exactly what they are suppose to do. 3 out of the 5 brushes in this set are very soft and easy on the skin. However 2 of them, the Pampas Cat brush, and the Leopard Cat brush are kinda scratchy, a little more rough feeling. I think that I would prefer different fibers to be used for these 2 brushes. Cleaning these brushes was very simple, and I didn&#x27;t have hardly any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> First time ordering this brand and so far I love them!  They arrived on time and are as exactly as described by seller.  I&#x27;ve used them a few times and so far I&#x27;m pleased with them.  The bristles are very soft and hold makeup well.  The box they came in is really beautiful and has a molded foam insert to hold each brush in place.  I&#x27;ve repurposed the box to hold jewelry and tiny trinkets.  I thought the price was very good for what you get.  This company has other items I&#x27;m sure I will add to my collection.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> As with all Bella and Bear products, very good and nice quality. I love the softness of these brushes, makes it nice to put on eyeshadow. They transfer the shadow very well onto your lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing keeping from 5 star, when I received package all the brushes were popped out of the foam and squished in the corner (also the foam/box smelled bad, like very artificial and plastic-y)</li>
    <li> First off the packaging is adorable, each brush fits nicely in its own section, the set includes a double ended eyebrow brush, a soft blending brush, a eyeliner brush, a medium angled shading brush and a spoolie. These one of a kind brushes are made with both synthetic fibers and natural goat hair. This is a great starter kit for your upcoming aspiring makeup artists or even for someone who does not apply makeup very much.</li>
