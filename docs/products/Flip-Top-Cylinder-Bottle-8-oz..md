    <li> These came/come in handy when I am mixing my hair oils together.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these to put in my gym bag. After some mix-ups with shipping, I finally received them. They&#x27;re a great size to hold shampoo and body wash and they seem to be leak-proof. They&#x27;re the perfect size to keep in my gym bag - not too big to be bulky but not so small that I need to refill them constantly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find bottles like this that are good quality plastic, stay closed, and don&#x27;t leak.  But this one fits the bill.  I haven&#x27;t tried taking it on an airplane, but it&#x27;s been fine traveling in my gym bag for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Although a little smaller that what I needed, the 8 oz bottles are fine.  No problems.  A decent product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough. Does the job.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to put to oil my scalp, doesn&#x27;t leak when closed and rips slowly when open.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the gym bag. Mine get knocked around in my duffle bag between the car and the gym locker and so far they&#x27;ve done the job. Well made, don&#x27;t leak. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> We purchased these and love the fact that they were able to be used so many ways we use them for the kids to play in the snow to see how it melts and how we can use food coloring and water to draw in the snow but I also used them to store makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This was purchased so that a leave in conditioner can be utilized in the best of ways...This fit the bill exactly ..Nice bottle ..~!~</li>
    <li> Flow is slow but good size for the gym and holds a lot and won&#x27;t spill</li>

    <li> Olive oil, castor oil.  Rub on face.  Then steam face with hot wash cloth for 1 minute.  You&#x27;ll be surprised how clean your skin is.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some durable, plastic bottles to hold my shampoo/conditioner/body soap for my trips to the gym. I had recently purchased some from the grocery store that were rigid and stiff-- I wanted something soft and flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are AWESOME. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaking, they don&#x27;t come open in my gym bag, they&#x27;re easy to squeeze. The only thing that may bother other people (but doesn&#x27;t bother me) is how small the hole in the lid is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8 oz. bottles are great if you have a locker at the gym you can keep them in. If you have to carry the bottles with you every day, however, I&#x27;d recommend a slightly smaller size like the 4 oz.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an 8 oz bottle. Product as described. quick shipping. It&#x27;s just the best bottle a massage therapist can ask for!...j/k</li>
    <li> About what I expected. No leaks, which is nice, but they are A LITTLE hard to squeeze.

    <li> fast shipping. this bottle is just wjat I was looking for in my makeup collection. Thinking about reordering two more of the 8oz sizes. great for travel as well.</li>
