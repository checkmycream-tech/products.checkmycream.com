### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>they may be bulky, but they are superb.  </li>
      <li>The cast is sturdy with excellent shock absorption.</li>
      <li>Awesome for a metatarsal 4 &amp; 5 break.</li>
      <li>All in all she said that it is the best boot she has tried.</li>
      <li>She said of the three boots she has had now this one is the best comfort wise.  </li>
      <li>This has been a great help for my daughter who has torn some ligaments/tendons in her foot.</li>
      <li>The protective toe is a great feature.</li>
      <li>Customer Service Was Great, They Replaced The Boot.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Amazon was very nice and immediately sent a replacement.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, arrived as indicated, works great!</li>
      <li>but I will be returning because my toes touch the front rim of the walker which is surprising since I wear a Woman&#x27;s size</li>
      <li>but it fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Still, this is a good boot.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the height of the boot was good for me.</li>
      <li>This is a superior boot for post surgery or injury.</li>
      <li>Also, the toe cap at the front seems like a good idea, but anything that gets in doesn&#x27;t come out without removing the boot.</li>
      <li>Good luck in your recovery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good for around the house use also.</li>
      <li>It worked great for her needs as it provided the comfort she needed and alleviated her pain.  </li>
      <li>The liner is good, it&#x27;s pretty comfy, and the bladder setup is very good when it was inflated.</li>
      <li>You may need an arch support depending on the height of your arch, I have a very high arch and with the support it was perfect.  </li>
      <li>Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic construction is great and light weight</li>
      <li>Everyone has to make their own decisions.</li>
      <li>you can easily cut blood supply to your foot!  </li>
      <li>I recently had surgery on one ankle and wore the tall version of this boot, and it worked great - provided great support for my ankle during recovery after surgery.</li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t able to release the air to lessen the compression.</li>
      <li>Better than paying your insurance to get you one.</li>
      <li>And the price is better than any I could buy in Canada.  </li>
      <li>I love the ability to pump up the compression as needed.  </li>
      <li>The fracture is on top of her foot.  </li>
      <li>Notice how the top inserts around the foot.</li>
      <li>I have Tendonitis and the pain and swelling of the ankle is unbearable, with the boot I am able to walk and work.</li>
      <li>When I think back, it was old-fashioned treatment that worked best:</li>
      <li>The built in pump is so much better than the the type that has a separate air bulb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable and the inflation setup is simpler and works.</li>
      <li>I was able to push the rubber button on top to inflate the soft boot for good compression.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and good design Ossur.</li>
      <li>The Aircast SP was better, more comfortable and effective, but not by much.</li>
      <li>It fits easily into suitcase.</li>
      <li>fit is great.super comfortable, love the foot protection at work.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, incredibly strong, comfortable.</li>
      <li>The air chambers helped to hold my foot in the correct position for pain free walking.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It is extremely comfortable inside.</li>
      <li>and it fit me too.  </li>
      <li>My husband had to wear this for a couple weeks, and he thought it fit and wore it well.</li>
      <li>this should fit up to a size 8.  </li>
      <li>Soon As I Tried It On, My Foot Felt Comfortable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>but once I did I was able to really get around much better using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally had a sprain, or so the hospital said.</li>
      <li>This shorter version is much more comfortable, and seems to feature an updated design, with better lining, and a more careful fit.</li>
      <li>Cool</li>
      <li>I really appreciated the top plate on the foot.</li>
      <li>and i had a true to size medium boot.</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>I worked with this boot some and found that if I secured the boot better around my ankle it keeps my foot away from the toe area so this size might work out, but just an inch to spare without walking much.  </li>
      <li>The Ossur Rebound Low Top Air Walker boot held together and served its purpose better than the boot perscribed by my podiatrist.</li>
      <li>Thank you for accommodating the quick delivery</li>
      <li>The Ossur allows for better walking and better support overall.</li>
      <li>I had a spontaneous fracture of my second metatarsal bone in my right foot so to drive</li>
      <li>I received the high top, now I have to wait to get the low top.</li>
      <li>If the size was right would have kept this walker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I know I made the right choice.</li>
      <li>They were just the right height, so I didn&#x27;t experience hip problems from being off balance.</li>
      <li>You can tell it&#x27;s a high quality product from fit and material.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use this great Ossur Low-Top as a relief boot for short periods of time, or for when I do moderate exercise.</li>
      <li>It really hurt the top part of my leg near the front by my foot.</li>
      <li>This obviously does not provide the level of support of the tall boot, but it works great for when I need some extra support.</li>
      <li>The doc wanted to charge me 240 bucks for this exact boot.</li>
      <li>I really liked the closed shoe look and feel, I did not have to worry about my toes.  </li>
      <li>She wears size 8.5 shoe and first got this in medium.  </li>
      <li>I did not receive the low top walker.</li>
      <li>I bought three air-type walkers to try and this one was the lightest and it has a neutral gait, which I like (heel isn&#x27;t higher)</li>
      <li>Plus It Looks Pretty</li>
      <li>I pulled out the insole and covered the adhesive in paper, the toe squeak is fixed but the main sound of the squeak appears to come from the heel where the tread attaches to the boot, but I&#x27;m not going to try to peel that apart and see what is causing it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The entire thing is easy to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a high quality boot!  </li>
      <li>fact that it covers your whole foot is also great&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>In It, Walking Was Much Easier With This Model</li>
      <li>I love the closed toe that works well to keep debris out of the boot.</li>
      <li>It works better than I expected.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is so lightweight really makes getting around soooo much easier.</li>
      <li>Nearly As Much,</li>
      <li>I was able to wear this with a hiking boot on my other foot to even out the elevation.</li>
      <li>i finally am without pain, for i have suffered greatly for the past 12 months.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the main reason why I ordered this particular boot cast.</li>
      <li>This boot is similar in design and appears to be better made, but has the same issues.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the Ossur feels cozy when worn during the winter months.</li>
      <li>Her foot still not healing with the new boot.  </li>
      <li>Obamacare is bringing down the cost of healthcare just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called around to various places locally and was quoted anywhere from $100 up to $300 for pretty much the exact same product as this, and in a few cases they wanted to charge me a fitting fee.</li>
      <li>#34;That&#x27;s perfect!&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d give this at least a good think before you slap down a hundred bucks or more at a specialty place for something that is likely to be the same product with a different label on it.</li>
      <li>This air walker was not as heavy as a lot of these boots can be, was decently priced, and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>When the boot arrived the packaging was clean and the boot was wrapped in a heavy duty clear plastic bag.</li>
      <li>Contacted seller for exchange and they will only accept return or exchange if it is brand new &amp; unopened.</li>
      <li>It really helped alleviate the pain in my foot while walking, I do recommend wearing a similar height shoe on the other foot.</li>
      <li>The biggest complaint I have is that the plastic outer cover is supposed to go over the inflation and deflation bulbs that are built into the liner, but the smaller deflation bulb would slip under the cover and was constantly getting pressed by the cover as it shifted, thus deflating the air bladders and causing the boot to fit loosely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I rolled my ankle a few months ago really badly and couldn&#x27;t walk on it at all. I was on crutches until I decided to get this boot and try it out. What a lifesaver it was. It took a little bit of time to get used to it but once I did I was able to really get around much better using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called around to various places locally and was quoted anywhere from $100 up to $300 for pretty much the exact same product as this, and in a few cases they wanted to charge me a fitting fee. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not a doctor - I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;prescribe&amp;#34; this thing for you. Everyone has to make their own decisions. But I can tell you I took this in and showed it to my doctor and he said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s perfect!&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d give this at least a good think before you slap down a hundred bucks or more at a specialty place for something that is likely to be the same product with a different label on it.</li>
    <li> My husband had to wear this for a couple weeks, and he thought it fit and wore it well. Thank you for accommodating the quick delivery</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic construction is great and light weight&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that it covers your whole foot is also great&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Squeaks like crazy each time you step. the insole is attached with double sided tape to the inside of the boot, since the inside of the boot has plastic ribs in it to reduce weight, the adhesive pulls away each time you step down so it causes it to make a stick noise. I pulled out the insole and covered the adhesive in paper, the toe squeak is fixed but the main sound of the squeak appears to come from the heel where the tread attaches to the boot, but I&#x27;m not going to try to peel that apart and see what is causing it.&lt;br /&gt;-The air cushion does not hold any sort of pressure, as soon as you pump it up it goes flat again within a second or two.&lt;br /&gt;-The rubber part on the toe cover is starting to tear like other people have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The boot helped alot with the pain of a torn Plantar Facia.  However the upper strap broke after about 3 weeks of wear.  Hence the 3 stars.  My Doctor charged my insurance $501 for this item.  Obamacare is bringing down the cost of healthcare just fine.</li>
    <li> All other boots have too many pieces and are difficult to put on and take off. I had a spontaneous fracture of my second metatarsal bone in my right foot so to drive I had to switch to a surgical shoe and but the boot on before I got in and out of my care. The ease of putting this boot on and off helps to ensure using it.</li>
    <li> Needed this for Plantar Fasciitis.  I really liked the closed shoe look and feel, I did not have to worry about my toes.  It really helped alleviate the pain in my foot while walking, I do recommend wearing a similar height shoe on the other foot. You may need an arch support depending on the height of your arch, I have a very high arch and with the support it was perfect.  The air chambers helped to hold my foot in the correct position for pain free walking.</li>
    <li> I used a Breg brace before this one. The Ossur allows for better walking and better support overall. Easier adjustment than the Breg. The entire thing is easy to use. I really appreciated the top plate on the foot. Be careful not to over tighten any of the straps you can easily cut blood supply to your foot!  I originally had a sprain, or so the hospital said. (Montana hospitals suck). But turns out I had a torn peroneal tendon. I had to use this boot for 6 weeks because I re-damaged or injured the ankle. I was able to wear this with a hiking boot on my other foot to even out the elevation. You can tell it&#x27;s a high quality product from fit and material.</li>
    <li> fit is great.super comfortable, love the foot protection at work. Im 6 mo post op so some movement at ankle is alowed. I do have flexion at ankle with this boot.</li>
    <li> This was the fourth (and last) walking boot that I had in three months. The Aircast SP was better, more comfortable and effective, but not by much. This boot is similar in design and appears to be better made, but has the same issues. The biggest complaint I have is that the plastic outer cover is supposed to go over the inflation and deflation bulbs that are built into the liner, but the smaller deflation bulb would slip under the cover and was constantly getting pressed by the cover as it shifted, thus deflating the air bladders and causing the boot to fit loosely. Also, the toe cap at the front seems like a good idea, but anything that gets in doesn&#x27;t come out without removing the boot. After three weeks of use, the rubber that holds the plastic outer cover together had broken and the ankle strap was giving out. Still, this is a good boot. The liner is good, it&#x27;s pretty comfy, and the bladder setup is very good when it was inflated. I just prefer the Aircast SP. It&#x27;s more comfortable and the inflation setup is simpler and works.</li>
    <li> I got one for my cousin but the front plastic part was missing and her foot moved around.  Foot fracture was not healing.  Her doctor said the front part is missing.  Amazon was very nice and immediately sent a replacement.  Her foot still not healing with the new boot.  The fracture is on top of her foot.  She goes back to doctor soon.  She said of the three boots she has had now this one is the best comfort wise.  She wears size 8.5 shoe and first got this in medium.  Not only was piece missing but it was too big.  The replacement she got in small per doctor&#x27;s suggestion.  The small was much better and not too small at all.  So their sizing is not accurate.  I wear a size 9 womens and I tried it on and it fit me too.  The air pump inflates the leg ankle area and not top of foot. The air pump button is hard to align with the hole at times and does not stay.  All in all she said that it is the best boot she has tried.</li>
    <li> It really hurt the top part of my leg near the front by my foot.</li>
    <li> I received the boot 2 days before it was initially. Due. Only thing is when you are it from the company just know that they have to order it so you won&#x27;t get any tracking information for a couple days 2 at the max. When the boot arrived the packaging was clean and the boot was wrapped in a heavy duty clear plastic bag. I opened that up and i had a true to size medium boot. I wear size 10 in women&#x27;s and i was a little afraid that the medium would be too small but it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought three air-type walkers to try and this one was the lightest and it has a neutral gait, which I like (heel isn&#x27;t higher) but I will be returning because my toes touch the front rim of the walker which is surprising since I wear a Woman&#x27;s size 6 1/2 barefoot and 7 with socks and according to chart this should fit up to a size 8.  Double checked the size marked in the shoe and does say S so not sure why it is so short.  Toes rub on front lip.  Definately noone with a size 8 could wear these unless mine were missized by manufacturer.  If the size was right would have kept this walker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I worked with this boot some and found that if I secured the boot better around my ankle it keeps my foot away from the toe area so this size might work out, but just an inch to spare without walking much.  I wouldn&#x27;t take a change if you are a size 7-1/2 or 8 though.  Also the toe guard is trimmable so perhaps trimming it down might help.  Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> Item as described - saved money!</li>
    <li> The CAM Walker My Podiatrist Gave Me Bruised My Foot Where The Middle Strap Was, And It Just Felt Awkward, I Have To Wear A Walker For 6 Weeks, So I Ordered This One Hoping For The Best.&lt;br /&gt;As Soon As I Tried It On, My Foot Felt Comfortable In It, Walking Was Much Easier With This Model Compared To The One I Had, Now I Won&#x27;t Mind Needing A Walker Nearly As Much, Plus It Looks Pretty Cool Too!&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;***So 5 Days After Receiving This Item The Rubber Part That Holds The 2 Pieces Of molding That Go Over Your Foot Is Starting To Tear,&lt;br /&gt;This Is Unacceptable, I Contacted The Seller GenieCure Hopefully It Can Be Resolved.&lt;br /&gt;GenieCure Customer Service Was Great, They Replaced The Boot.&lt;br /&gt;The Replacement Boot Also Started Tearing, Would NOT Recommend This Product!</li>
    <li> I wore this Ossur Rebound Low Top Air Walker for 4 weeks while recovering from a bad peroneal tendon sprain. The cast is sturdy with excellent shock absorption. I was able to push the rubber button on top to inflate the soft boot for good compression. However, I wasn&#x27;t able to release the air to lessen the compression. Anyway, the height of the boot was good for me. I wore Dansko clogs while wearing the boot. They were just the right height, so I didn&#x27;t experience hip problems from being off balance. The protective toe is a great feature. That&#x27;s the main reason why I ordered this particular boot cast. I have to say, the cast was miserable to wear on really hot days...I guess, that to be expected from any protective air cast during the summer months....I&#x27;m sure the Ossur feels cozy when worn during the winter months. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results. Thankfully, my ankle is healed and I&#x27;m back on the road. The Ossur did the job.</li>
    <li> This has been a great help for my daughter who has torn some ligaments/tendons in her foot. It&#x27;s protected her foot from getting any worse and hopefully soon, she will be out of it all together.</li>
    <li> I wore this for about a week when it started to squeak loudly with every step and the rubber on the front panel started to tear in half. Contacted seller for exchange and they will only accept return or exchange if it is brand new &amp; unopened. So if you have any issues be prepared to just throw it away and waste the expensive cost of this boot. Or buy it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I needed this boot to keep my swelling down and to support my exploded ankle. It works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the low top walker. I received the high top, now I have to wait to get the low top. Very annoying</li>
    <li> Better than paying your insurance to get you one.</li>
    <li> they may be bulky, but they are superb.  i finally am without pain, for i have suffered greatly for the past 12 months.  comfort before beauty.</li>
    <li> I saw a similar product at a local drugstore for almost $200.00.  Saw this online and decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s comfortable and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The Ossur Rebound Low Top Air Walker boot held together and served its purpose better than the boot perscribed by my podiatrist.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on, incredibly strong, comfortable. recommended by my surgeon</li>
    <li> Hope you don&#x27;t have to purchase this air cast, but if you do...it&#x27;s a high quality boot!  Easy to use, arrived as indicated, works great! The built in pump is so much better than the the type that has a separate air bulb. Everything is always at your finger tips! Great price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy..Rubber over arch cracks. Only 30 day guarantee.Others have had the same problem.</li>
    <li> This is a superior boot for post surgery or injury. It is extremely comfortable inside. I love the ability to pump up the compression as needed.  The fact that it is so lightweight really makes getting around soooo much easier. And the price is better than any I could buy in Canada.  I tried a few before buying this and I know I made the right choice. I highly recommend it!  *****</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easier to walk in a Rebound Tall boot but I bought this one to take on trips. It fits easily into suitcase. Good for around the house use also.</li>
    <li> This boot allows me to work without pain. I have Tendonitis and the pain and swelling of the ankle is unbearable, with the boot I am able to walk and work.</li>
    <li> I recently had surgery on one ankle and wore the tall version of this boot, and it worked great - provided great support for my ankle during recovery after surgery. But I still have persistent ankle issues (could be tendonitis or gout or just weak ankles) and wanted something lighter and easier for when an ankle flares up and needs some support. This obviously does not provide the level of support of the tall boot, but it works great for when I need some extra support. I love the closed toe that works well to keep debris out of the boot. Some might prefer an open toe boot for the summer.</li>
    <li> Awesome for a metatarsal 4 &amp; 5 break.</li>
    <li> Bought because I broke my 5th metatarsal. The doc wanted to charge me 240 bucks for this exact boot. I got it for 85 bucks including tax and next day air shipping. My foot is now healed. Thanks Amazon and good design Ossur.</li>
    <li> I have the tall version of this boot, but found that the strap over the instep for extended periods of time is painful. And the tall version can be a bit difficult to adjust (especially after the air is inflated); there isn&#x27;t much room for adjustments with the way the pump fits the outer hull. This shorter version is much more comfortable, and seems to feature an updated design, with better lining, and a more careful fit. Notice how the top inserts around the foot. But keep in mind this version doesn&#x27;t offer quite as much support for serious ankle injuries, such as mine. I&#x27;ll use this great Ossur Low-Top as a relief boot for short periods of time, or for when I do moderate exercise. Good luck in your recovery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If you have just twisted your ankle, your doc may suggest a boot. I am not a doctor, but my advice, after serious sprains and 2 surgeries by a highly regarded specialist who just wants to operate a 3rd time (after being clueless when I came in with a sprain on the damaged ankle; he seems to have forgotten how to properly treat injuries to heal them &amp; prevent surgery) is: try at least 2-3 weeks on crutches, with your ankle in a boot or ace-bandages. Then slow rehab. When I think back, it was old-fashioned treatment that worked best: ice, elevation, wrapping, and crutches did the trick. Nowadays, docs just want to cut. Beware!</li>
    <li> Would&#x27;t allow returns.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this boot after injuring her foot in the bathtub. It worked great for her needs as it provided the comfort she needed and alleviated her pain.  This air walker was not as heavy as a lot of these boots can be, was decently priced, and arrived quickly. Overall, this was a good purchase.</li>
