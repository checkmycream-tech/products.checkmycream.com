<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very happy with the purchase of the hair bow clips.  They come in so many different colors that you have a bow to match just about every outfit.  And the price was perfect!  At the local store, I would have only gotten two bows for the price I paid for 12 bows!!</li>
    <li> Love these we use them daily</li>
    <li> Great quality and great colors.  My daughter wants to wear a bow every day. These bows are perfect size for a pony in the back/side or a half pony.</li>
    <li> Bummer. I really want to like these bows. I ordered the 12 piece 4&amp;#34; bows in (what I thought was) solids and polka dots. I received several solids, several polka dots, cheetah, zebra and Eiffel Tower prints. Not what I wanted. The quality is good but the prints are a disappointment.</li>
    <li> These bows were very good quality. I did not expect them to be so nice for such a great price. Even the packaging was pretty!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Bows.Good Quality And I Am Hard To Please. Would Definitely Recommend. My Two Year Old Loves Them. Not To Big Not To Small Just Perfect. Love The Hair Clips On The Bows. Would Definitely Order From This Company Again. And The Package Arrived Exactly When It Said.</li>
    <li> Great quality bows for the price!! Very pleased with my purchase. Ribbon is thick and bows are well constructed.  Colors are very pretty.</li>
    <li> I love this !! Is a good size for toddlers, and the clip is good and recovered whit the same material, this not fall down !!!  Great !!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my 3 year old.  The bows are the perfect size, great color and quality.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this lot.</li>
    <li> These bows are very cute, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t hold up well.  All but about 2 have unravelled and come undone (making them not so cute anymore).  But we did find the clip on the back works much better than the pinch clips.</li>
    <li> it took a little while to come in but once i received them they looked nice just a little small</li>
    <li> I ordered these bows as favors for my daughter&#x27;s Minnie Mouse birthday party. They are the perfect size…. nice and big.  The quality is great!  They are very well made.  The bow is perfectly proportioned and angled.  The clips are nice and strong and lined with high quality ribbon.  I am super happy.</li>
    <li> Lovely bows for young girls hair.  Looks wonderful and all the colors will match everything she has for school and play.</li>
    <li> These are more than enough, back to get the solid set!</li>
    <li> These bows are a perfect &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; size.  Good for toddlers and young girls who want a big bow, but not a giant bow.  Have purchased at craft fairs and boutiques for twice the price - I will never do that again!</li>
    <li> Hipgirl&#x27;s bows are my preferred bows for my 2.5 yr old daughter. Well made, never see any glue/fraying ,etc. Nice color selection and size also.</li>
    <li> I just love this. They are sooo cute !!! The colors are just like the picture. Go with lots of outfits. Perfect ;-)</li>
    <li> I thought that the bows were very pretty. However, I was a bit disappointed by the colors. Well, more the fact that I received eight out of twelve bows polkadotted. I like polkadots, but as I wanted them to go with more of my outfits, I wear my hair in a braid with a bow at the top every day, solid colors are MUCH more desirable. They arrived in an adorable little display box which will definitably stick around for storage. My only other grievance was the size. I know this sounds silly as they are marked as 3.5&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34; bows in the title, but I suppose that I just imagined them a bit bigger. However, all in all, they are beautiful, well-made, hair bows, perfect for babies and teens alike.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried before ordering because of previous reviews saying the colors were different than pictured, too many polka dots, etc.  I received exactly the bows shown (colors and prints), no deviation what so ever.  The clips are fabric covered also and stay put all day, even through PE and dance classes.  They are exceptional quality.  I will order from this vendor again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love them. Perfect size for my 3 year old. Can&#x27;t find bows like this in stores. I just wish they came in more colors like olive green, mustard yellow, pastels, etc. No issues with them falling out of hair or falling apart.</li>
    <li> super cute! good quality. my almost 2 year old daughter now has a bow for every outfit imaginable. she has a lot of hair and these are adorable.</li>
    <li> This are the best bows that I have ever seen on the market for an excellent price.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with any of here products.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday along with http://prntscr.com/3yvtve, she loves them both.</li>
    <li> My girls love, love, love their bows! They considered them as a present. Every day I have to pick a bow and it doesn&#x27;t come off till I pull it off at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get tangled in her waist long hair and just to note we are african american.&lt;br /&gt;I also put them in my 12 month old granddaughter hair and it stays put on her short curls. (At least if she doesn&#x27;t decide to yank it out)&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I could have matching pair.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the fact that I may not get what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll toss the dice and try anyway.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality for the price and a great selection of colors. A year later and my now 3 year old still wears one almost daily!</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this and they are beautiful! Very worth it and pleased with the order.  Will order more for my nieces</li>
    <li> The bows are for my 6 year old and they are a perfect size! They are so colorful and pretty and the clips are metal and easy to get in her hair. Love them!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and well made. Well made bows and quality clip as well.</li>
    <li> The set comes in a box, which was pretty neat, though I&#x27;m giving it three stars because of the colour of the bows that I had received.&lt;br /&gt;The preview image had no greens, yellows or purples, and majorly consisted of &#x27;girlish&#x27; colours, which was mainly the reason I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;What I received was NOT the colours of the bows displayed.&lt;br /&gt;I got greens and yellows and other colours that weren&#x27;t in the display pictures, which was a huge let down.</li>
    <li> I love the hair bows. They are a perfect size for my 30 months old daughter and she can match the bows with her outfit. They came in a nice box and we use it to keep the bows organized.</li>
    <li> These bows are adorable! They were slightly different than the colors in the picture, but the product description says that. I got most, pink, green, blue, red.. etc. They are in great shape and hook to a clip so they actually stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Love them!</li>
    <li> bought these as stocking stuffers for Christmas for my two daughter and ended up splitting them with my grand-daughter also...they are very cute and stylish and appear to be well made.</li>
    <li> Packaging is very simple but cute. The options of bows are perfect for all outfits. Quality and price perfect. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> The display picture does not only show how the bows should look, but it gives you the exact colors you will be getting. They were delivered right on time. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for hair bows for my toddler daughter.  These bows are high quality and they have ribbon lined alligator clips so they are not hard on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lots of hair she can&#x27;t see unless has a bow in her hair.  However, many that I purchased in the past were expensive ($8-$12 for a 4&amp;#34; grosgrain).  That price it too much considering she often loses them and they get dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any parent looking for a set of beautiful bows.</li>
    <li> I LOVE putting bows on my daughter (shes a year and a half) and these are GORGEOUS! she gets compliments all the time--at the grocery store, at the hardware store, at church, everywhere lol--people gush about her bows and how cute she looks all dolled up. i looked for the perfect bows everywhere and when i saw these i knew these were IT--I wasn&#x27;t wrong. everybody loves them &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> They are done beautifully nice colors,good quality and good packaging.they are very good quality.the best bows I ever got for my 2 year old</li>
    <li> Bows were perfect size, bought for a baby shower and they were very happy. These bows ar every nice size they are not big they are a med. size so perfect for the little ones.</li>
    <li> They came in the mail last weekend and my daughters have spent hours playing dress up and matching the bows to their outfits. They are on the larger side, I never would have picked them out if I&#x27;d seen them in person but they are adorable. The kids love them and have received many compliments while out and about, so that&#x27;s all that matters to them.</li>
    <li> These bows are great for my 2 year old daughter.  They were a little larger than I was expecting, but they still look very cute.  Every time she wears one she fields at least one compliment from a stranger.  Each of these bows is well made and looks more expensive than it is.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Love these bows! They are well made with wide ribbon. They are so classic and fuller than those found in boutiques that cost much much more.</li>
    <li> Box is super cute if you want to give it for a gift.  It looks like the bows pictured.  My daughter loves them.  They were shipped really quick too!</li>
    <li> My daughter wears a hair bow every day, and her favorite part is picking one to match her outfit.  These bows were well made and I would buy more from this company without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I received these bows today (super fast shipping), and I could not be happier! What an amazing price for such quality bows. Love all of the colors- they are so vibrant!</li>
    <li> I am a thirty-something lover of bows and buns in my hair, so I love the VARIETY I received. I can never have enough bows!</li>
    <li> They were just as I expected them to be. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I loved the bows for my 2 year old.  They&#x27;re not too big, but not too small - I like them because they make a statement.  I got a few different bows than pictured, but I got the main ones I was looking for (solid pinks, green, orange, red, blues, etc) and then a white/soft pink polka dot bow, a pink/black Paris-themed bow, and a zebra print bow.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these bows...my baby girl had been wearing the big flower, but these are SO much cuter :)  Thinking about ordering another set so she can have 2 of each for when she enough hair for pig tails!</li>
    <li> These were beautiful. Very satisfied. Nice bows.</li>
    <li> I bought this collection sight unseen and had it shipped directly to my grand daughter 400 miles away. It arrived quickly and I am told the bows were a delightful and popular present - she wears a different one daily to school. Thank you for offering this helpful and pretty item!</li>
    <li> I like how it looks on my daughter (vibrant colours and good size of bows) and she always gets compliments. But my only big remark that they are have to be bigger in a metal part I think barrette is too short compared with a bow. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t hold her hair well and slide off all the time.</li>
    <li> I think my daughter thought these would come all tied pretty into bows, but she still likes them.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets because my daughters wears pigtails as well as ponytails. I was worried buying two sets for fear that the ribbons would not match each other, but they do and they look great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> so cute! great price!! love them!</li>
    <li> The bows arrived earlier than expected in a sturdy box where you can store them, with a receipt and a business card (nice touch!). They are beautiful, well done, and the colors just as described. They are a little big on my 13 month old daughter but she&#x27;ll grow into them. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a quality product without breaking the bank.</li>
