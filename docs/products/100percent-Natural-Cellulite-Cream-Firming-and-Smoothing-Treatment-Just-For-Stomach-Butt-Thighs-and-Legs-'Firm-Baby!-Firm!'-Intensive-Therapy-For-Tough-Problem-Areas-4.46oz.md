      <li>This product is really good.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give this product a good 2 months of use before I reviewed it to determine the results, if any.</li>
      <li>Felt good but didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do.</li>
      <li>great smell and applies easy!</li>
      <li>If so I will be sure to keep this review updated !</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I wrote this honest review in exchange for the product.</li>
      <li>a lotion hoarder and have bottles of every kind everywhere in my house.</li>
      <li>It did reduce some of the flab, but not to the point that I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>and I liked what I smelled.  </li>
      <li>I liked:  </li>
      <li>I honestly purchased it thinking that it - like all the rest - will not work, but I had to give it a shot, JUST INCASE</li>
      <li>When I was asked to honestly review this, I did so hoping that it may work on my arms.</li>
      <li>My opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>Loving this - I hope I&#x27;m not seeing things</li>
      <li>It will make them feel tingly and warm, also I don&#x27;t think you would want to accidentally rub your eye with the residue on your fingers.</li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m more than thrilled</li>
      <li>It does leave you feeling warm for sure</li>
      <li>I received an email from a very nice lady asking if I would be interested in reviewing a couple of products from Vi-Tae.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate that even more than in being made in the USA (which it also is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>We will update once the product has time to show more results.</li>
      <li>I will be using it and hopefully see more results</li>
      <li>But what, I am not too sure.</li>
      <li>We shall see about that.  :-)</li>
      <li>I only wish that I could post a picture, because it&#x27;s been working GREAT!  </li>
      <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>more you use it, the more your skin will get use to it.</li>
      <li>Vi-Tae is doing its part, I must contribute more.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that even more than in being made in the USA (which it also is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewce creams, hand lotions, body butters, brightening creams, tanning lotions, firming creams, etc.</li>
      <li>As to what the cream does, I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
      <li>This is of course subjective and many may like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but maybe the company could be more informative about the amount to use.  </li>
      <li>She will continue to use it and may see greater results.  </li>
      <li>We will continue using it since she does like it, and I will update this review if we see more results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>repelling insects better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to wash your hands.</li>
      <li>and I was very excited to see it in the mail.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>It was super easy to apply and gave a tingly feeling after it was on my legs (kind of like the tingle lotion at tanning salons)</li>
      <li>This product smells good (but is very stong), like patchouli</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell, goes on creamy and soaks right into the skin.</li>
      <li>is easy to understand.</li>
      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs easily</li>
      <li>it does have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>the stench is so strong</li>
      <li>completely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give this company the benefit of the doubt, because their salts are SIMPLY AMAZING and do EXACTLY what they claim.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely going to keep using this and hope that with time the results are greater!</li>
      <li>BUT -  I am noticing a HUGE difference in my pictures.  </li>
      <li>But, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Item was received for free for the purpose of a review.</li>
      <li>Light coverage, rub it in?</li>
      <li>I would imagine it takes several weeks to see great results.  </li>
      <li>The cream has an herbal scent to it, so If you are looking for a fragrance free cellulite cream, this one is not for you.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Tight may not be the best description, but it aptly describes what we&#x27;re seeing so far.</li>
      <li>I will purchase again and then give a full detailed review of my results</li>
      <li>That goes away quickly but be sure to wash your hands right away after application.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels clean but pore size unchanged.</li>
      <li>That way you can see just how much burn you will end up feeling, and know if that&#x27;s something you can handle sitting on for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice for fragrance is interesting.</li>
      <li>This cream has a mild \\&quot;spa smell\\&quot; and is a bit aroma-therapeutic to me.</li>
      <li>is a good thing be consistent with this product and your exercise routine, and you will definitely see results while using this product.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty excited when I got the box</li>
      <li>This will be in my checked luggage to Aruba next month for sure!</li>
      <li>It is not \\&quot;dig your flesh to relieve the itch\\&quot; sort of thing, it is just an itchiness that is noticeable and gently rubbing, massaging or LIGHT</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin I would recommend applying a test on the outer thigh to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bother you outright.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this product so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nowhere near smooth and cottage cheese free, but I&#x27;ve noticed, as has a friend/observer, a bit of tightening.</li>
      <li>It even turns red and gets warm like a burn.</li>
      <li>The tingle factor in a lotion sounds mild, but the first time someone would use it, they&#x27;d be in for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to wash it off right away.</li>
      <li>and so far I noticed that my thighs and butt&#x27;s skin does feel softer, the herbal smell is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I kind of like the herby, menthol essential oil type of scent, I asked people at work if I smelled &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; and everybody said no, I&#x27;m going to start using it at night</li>
      <li>It smells quite nice to me.. like  essential oils, and the ingredients are pure.</li>
      <li>This product certainly does something!</li>
      <li>After the first use I could tell a difference right away.</li>
      <li>Seems to firm up skin, but I have fallen in love with the scent of this product - fantastic!</li>
      <li>and since I have very sensitive skinn and a pain disorder that causes my nervous system to interpret non pain signals as pain, I decided to give the free sample of this I received to my daughter.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast</li>
      <li>The product has definitely changed  the feel of my skin, it feels more moist but I cant see a difference.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it did not have any adverse reaction then I stopped using it for a week</li>
      <li>I tried again two more times and with a much smaller portion of skin.</li>
      <li>Like most woman, I have cellulite on the back of my legs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest trying it out on a spot on your arm first, before putting it all over your legs an rear.</li>
      <li>No uncomfortable sensations.</li>
      <li>However, I am purchasing now my fourth bottle because it has an interesting side effect--</li>
      <li>you first apply it</li>
      <li>but I would much rather feel this burn than the one you feel for daysssss after doing squats!</li>
      <li>It was too much patchouli for me!</li>
      <li>I purchased my first bottle of this to try on cellulite.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just tried this product for the first time last night and will continue to use it nightly. It was super easy to apply and gave a tingly feeling after it was on my legs (kind of like the tingle lotion at tanning salons) I don&#x27;t mind that feeling-it actually makes me feel like the product is working and makes me want to keep using it. I will give an updated review once I have used to the product long enough to see some progress but so far I love it. great smell and applies easy!</li>
    <li> Loving this - I hope I&#x27;m not seeing things BUT THIS LOOKS LIKEBITS WORKING IN JUST 3 days!</li>
    <li> Like most woman, I have cellulite on the back of my legs. To me, my biggest problems are my upper arms. When I was asked to honestly review this, I did so hoping that it may work on my arms. It did reduce some of the flab, but not to the point that I would&#x27;ve liked. I&#x27;m not a big person at all, but I hate the flab when I hold out my arms. Guess I just have to keep wearing longer sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, goes on creamy and soaks right into the skin. But, that&#x27;s all that it did. To give it the benefit of the doubt, I used it on my cellulite. I saw no difference. Everyone is different. I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work for you, but did nothing for me! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it did not have any adverse reaction then I stopped using it for a week and when I used it again it left a burning, itching red rash and hives it disappeared after I stopped. I am not sure if I applied it wrong since the first time I used it I did not have a reaction, it was when I went back to use it again that the allergy started.</li>
    <li> The cream has an herbal scent to it, so If you are looking for a fragrance free cellulite cream, this one is not for you. If you don&#x27;t mind a scented cream, this one actually feels like it is doing something.  About 15-30 seconds after you rub it on you can feel a tingling and almost itching sensation. That goes away quickly but be sure to wash your hands right away after application.  It will make them feel tingly and warm, also I don&#x27;t think you would want to accidentally rub your eye with the residue on your fingers. Also people with very sensitive skin may want to try a test area before slathering it all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in fast. I don&#x27;t see any lessening of cellulite yet but you can feel it working</li>
    <li> I received this within a couple days of ordering and have definitely seen improvement over the couple days I&#x27;ve had it, there is a warming sensation shortly after application and you can tell your skin is reacting the way intended, there is a pink tinge where it is applied that quickly goes away. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend applying a test on the outer thigh to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bother you outright.  However I would definitely recommend to others. I spent a decent portion of my Christmas dinner telling my mother and sisters how awesome this product is. It would make an awesome gift. :)</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product so far. I&#x27;m still looking for results but the product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I only started using this product 5 days ago, i havent seen any results yet. I agree with other customers, first time i used it, my skin burned a bit and turned brought red, sort of like being sun burned. However, its not burning any more and redness isnt as bad. I do like the smell, thats a personal preference though. Im hoping to eventually see results and will give an update in a few wks.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no difference.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell couldn&#x27;t get past even one use had to shower it off !!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works or not.... I could not stand the smell.  It reminded me of my grandmothers rest home.  Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but I could not continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great, I can feel it firming.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I noticed a difference in the appearance of my stomach in about a week. It was smoother and a little tighter. The other reviewers are spot on with the red and burning sensation it&#x27;s almost like a sunburn, but once you get over the initial shock of seeing your skin get beet red, the sensation is not terrible and only lasts a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I live in FL, and am constantly in my bathing suits.  I unfortunately have a fair amount of cellulite to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews that I read, people are on their 4th or 5th different brand type trying to find a cellulite product that works, so I was cautiously hopeful when I purchased Firm Baby Firm (I love that name!).  This was my 1st attempt at reducing my cellulite -  I committed to using 1 bottle, and see what happens...  I only wish that I could post a picture, because it&#x27;s been working GREAT!  It&#x27;s not a magic pill, I mean you can&#x27;t take serious cellulite and have it disappear in a week or anything....BUT -  I am noticing a HUGE difference in my pictures.  My thighs are much smoother, less bumpy looking, which I&#x27;m more than thrilled with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered my second bottle, and am continuing to take pictures.  I love that this product doesn&#x27;t just take away the bumps, it also leaves a little extra confidence in it&#x27;s place.  I now wear my bathing suit more care-free, and that is a great feeling!</li>
    <li> I could not use this product because it seems I am alergic to it... got really red and itchy and had to take a cold shower right away to remove it. Be careful</li>
    <li> I noticed a change in my arms and legs looking firmer</li>
    <li> Years ago I worked in a tanning salon, and anyone who&#x27;s been to one knows they not only sell tanning packages, but expensive tanning lotions. Some of the most expensive lotions had an ingredient in them that caused what they refer to as &amp;#34;tingle factor&amp;#34;. The tingle factor of these lotions helped in two ways. It helped skin absorb the tanning bed rays so people could achieve an even darker tan faster, and it would also help firm up the skin. The tingle factor in a lotion sounds mild, but the first time someone would use it, they&#x27;d be in for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied this Firm Baby Firm lotion by Vi-Tae, I was surprised to find that this lotion has the exact same effect on the skin as the $120 bottles of tanning/firming lotion I sold to people in the salon I worked at years ago. About 5 minutes after you apply it, you start to feel it. It begins as a little tingle, then gradually turns into a feeling of having a sun burn. It even turns red and gets warm like a burn. This is exactly what the expensive tanning/firming lotions do too. The feeling lasts between a half hour and an hour. Then goes away like it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more you use it, the more your skin will get use to it. The burn will last a shorter and shorter amount of time. The first time you apply this lotion, do so in a small amount in a location you can handle feeling some sting on for about an hour. I&#x27;d suggest trying it out on a spot on your arm first, before putting it all over your legs an rear. That way you can see just how much burn you will end up feeling, and know if that&#x27;s something you can handle sitting on for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice for fragrance is interesting. It has a medicinal smell to it, reminding me of topical medicines used to help with coughs and stuffy noses. After using this lotion for a while, I have learned to appreciate the choice in fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lotion hoarder and have bottles of every kind everywhere in my house. Face creams, hand lotions, body butters, brightening creams, tanning lotions, firming creams, etc. This is the only lotion I have with this strong sinuses opening type scent. One time I grabbed it, thinking it was one of my other lotions, and started to rub it into my hands that were feeling dry. As soon as I caught the scent, I realized I had grabbed the Vi-Tae firming cream. Without it&#x27;s strong fragrance, I could see someone grabbing the bottle thinking it was their face cream and end up with a burning red face for an hour. The fragrance warns you that this is your serious firming and burning cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle mentions that this product was not tested on animals. I&#x27;m glad to see Vi-tae has chosen not to partake in the unnecessary practice of cosmetic testing on animals. I appreciate that even more than in being made in the USA (which it also is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewce creams, hand lotions, body butters, brightening creams, tanning lotions, firming creams, etc. This is the only lotion I have with this strong sinuses opening type scent.

    <li> I purchased my first bottle of this to try on cellulite.  It did nothing for the cellulite and is very costly for the size of product you get. However, I am purchasing now my fourth bottle because it has an interesting side effect-- repelling insects better than anything I have ever used.  I use on my arms and bare legs once or twice a day in the summer and had not a single mosquito bite where it was applied.  It smells quite nice to me.. like  essential oils, and the ingredients are pure. So I am not sure what component is doing the work but I will continue to buy it for the repellant factor.</li>
    <li> Whoah! They weren’t kidding with that warning on the label! This stuff made my thighs flush pink and it burned for a good 15min at least – it was almost like I was yelling at them “Firm! Baby, Firm!” Well it looks like some tough love did them good, because as soon as the redness went away this product actually firmed my thighs! I am seriously in shock at how well this works! I honestly purchased it thinking that it - like all the rest - will not work, but I had to give it a shot, JUST INCASE there really was some natural ingredient that I hadn’t used before. Well, it looks like mother nature knows what she is doing because this stuff worked - I FELT it working!!  The only downside is the little burning sensation but I would much rather feel this burn than the one you feel for daysssss after doing squats! This will be in my checked luggage to Aruba next month for sure!</li>
    <li> This cream certainly does something... But what, I am not too sure. My guess is it is a good moisturizer, has some minor pain relief applications, and it does make the skin slightly tighter - but didn&#x27;t really get rid of the cellulite, not yet anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this to the areas where my wife said she had cellulite, her skin got red just moments after. She said she felt a slight burn and after a few weeks of daily use says her skin feel tighter, but the area I was monitoring did not really see any kind of cellulite  improvement. We will continue using it since she does like it, and I will update this review if we see more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I have is to not use a lot, as a little goes a loooooong way, offsetting the cost of this small bottle. The effect (red skin) still happens with only a few drops massaged into the selected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product definitely has some benefits. Her skin does look a bit better (not that it had issues in the first place), and certainly feels smoother (and slightly tighter). So take that for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helped her with a sore calf after running. I was going to draw a salt bath, but she didn&#x27;t want a soak - so I rubbed a bit of this into the muscle and the pain diminished (did not go away completely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give this company the benefit of the doubt, because their salts are SIMPLY AMAZING and do EXACTLY what they claim. Maybe we got a dud, since some of the other reviewers are rating this product so high, or maybe it isn&#x27;t optimal for my wife&#x27;s skin/body type.</li>
    <li> I like the product so far.  Think I&#x27;m seeing improvement after 2 once daily uses.  However, the packaging doesn&#x27;t really provide usage instructions.  Should I use it once a day? Twice a day? Light coverage, rub it in? Thick layer, let it sit?  Wrap it up? Let it breathe? Any advice is appreciated.</li>
    <li> My wife decided to try out this cream. It has an intense smell and it turned her skin red for around 15 minutes like the bottle warns. She has already noticed that her skin is smoother and much softer. We will update once the product has time to show more results.</li>
    <li> After a week I have noticed results , it does not completely disappear but as a fitness trainer it has helped smooth out those tough areas especially after having children. I will be using it and hopefully see more results If so I will be sure to keep this review updated !</li>
    <li> Another false promise. It does make your skin red but other than that nothing. I have used this product religiously for a month and zero results. Very disappointed for wasting my money.</li>
    <li> I like this firming cream.  It heats up but that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> While i have only had this product a few days, i do notice a bit of firming on my thighs. I would imagine it takes several weeks to see great results.  This product when applied creates a warming sensation. ..don&#x27;t be alarmed it goes away after 10-20 minutes. I will update my review when i have finished the bottle</li>
    <li> After the first use I could tell a difference right away. I used the product a little over a week. It does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to. I am going to try this product for a whole month to see if I get the same results as I did for the first time use and the week usage.</li>
    <li> After a week of using this product my skin is starting to improve! Smoother, firmer! I love it!  I&#x27;m absolutely going to keep using this and hope that with time the results are greater!</li>
    <li> This cream has a mild \\&quot;spa smell\\&quot; and is a bit aroma-therapeutic to me. Just a small amount covers the area and keeps it smooth and silky feeling for hours and hours.  In addition, I even took a hot shower approximately 20 minutes after applying the cream and my skin still is soft and has a mild flush look to it where I applied the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the very first application, I was apprehensive from what some other reviews said so I used very little on my thigh only. There was/is a slight sensation of tingling and warmth and the skin turns pink but it never hurts or burns.  It feels a little warm to me in the area applied and I see the flushing of the skin after about a minute of rubbing it in and it fully absorbs, but I do not experience any discomfort or \\&quot;burning\\&quot; whatsoever. For me, the overall redness and warm feeling only lasts a short while (about an hour or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product NOT as directed, I do experience an itching while the skin is flushing (but it is minor and goes away within minutes). It also gets a \\&quot;sun-burn\\&quot; redness which lasts a while. The product does not mention the use on the upper arms (triceps) but I have rubbed a dab on them. Word of advise if you try that: hold your arm away from the body until the cream completely absorbs into the skin.  It seriously only takes a few seconds (maybe 10-20) for it to completely absorb and then the skin flushes (like a sun-burn).  The skin feels super soft but I experience an itching sensation that lasts for several minutes. It is not \\&quot;dig your flesh to relieve the itch\\&quot; sort of thing, it is just an itchiness that is noticeable and gently rubbing, massaging or LIGHT scratching alleviates it. Also, that sun-burn reaction will occur on other body parts if it comes in contact with the skin so DO NOT touch your or other&#x27;s  face is my advise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps on how I apply the cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shake bottle (I thump it on the palm of one hand, that ketchup sort of action).&lt;br /&gt;2. Start farthest away for your hands to reach (example buttocks or back thigh).&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub a small amount into the area (works with a cellulite brush too). Use a SMALL Amount and do not double apply.&lt;br /&gt;4. Keep your arm AWAY from your body, do not let your forearm rub against the cream.  If you do, try to wash it off immediately or you may experience that \\&quot;sun-burn\\&quot; effect.&lt;br /&gt;5. Let it completely absorb before sitting down, covering it with clothing or touching other skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash your hands well after use so to avoid accidentally rubbing your eye or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** If you do feel itchy, do not \\&quot;dig\\&quot; at it, just rub or massage the area (I would recommend you wash it off it is unbearable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think 2 weeks is still too early to make public comparative photos, but I like how this cream feels and will keep using it until the bottle is gone. And who knows...maybe I will bravely post some Before and After pictures for you. We shall see about that.  :-)example buttocks or back thigh).  3.

    <li> I used this in combination with the Vitae Skinny Bod lotion every night for about a month.  After the first week I started seeing results.  While the results have not been drastic, I have noticed a reduction in cellulite.  Like any woman over 30, genetically predisposed to cellulite only major surgery will rid me of it completely, but this has helped enough that short skirts are no longer embarrassing.  Please keep in mind that this is a long term product.  I stopped using it for several days and could see a difference.  Maybe in six months I will be able to go from using it every night to every few days, but for now it is fine.  Another downside is the scent.  While it is not a bad smell you will smell basically like an herbal cold lozenge.  Another thing to watch out for is that they are serious about only getting the product on the upper/inner thigh and buttock areas of your body.  I accidently got some on my lower back and had to immediately wash it off.  While not serious it was not comfortable.  Even given these drawbacks I will continue to use this product as it does work and given their competitors is rather reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product everyday, twice a day, since mid August. I wanted to give this product a good 2 months of use before I reviewed it to determine the results, if any. Well, I gave  it 2 and a half months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply it you feel a burn in the area...because your thighs are visibly getting red. Some may think that this means it MUST be working. It MUST be doing something. But, other than my thighs burning and becoming red, I have seen no visible changes in my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants to believe that a cream will work on your cellulite. Maybe there will be one in the future. But, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Item was received for free for the purpose of a review. My opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Now, my skin is radiant and extremely soft; however, it is completely up to me to assist with the firming and tightening by walking more. Vi-Tae is doing its part, I must contribute more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I gained so much weight after giving birth and had problems with my thigh area. I am optimistic that when I finish using the entire bottle, my cellulite will be less visible or vanish. So far so good</li>
    <li> It took a little longer than expected to received the product but it was around the holidays so I think it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the cream for three days once a day in the morning and so far I noticed that my thighs and butt&#x27;s skin does feel softer, the herbal smell is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I kind of like the herby, menthol essential oil type of scent, I asked people at work if I smelled &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; and everybody said no, I&#x27;m going to start using it at night too.&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs easily and then you get a feeling of warmth and some tingling sensation (makes you feel is working).&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a couple of weeks to see if I actually see a difference and improvement, I took some pictures of my cellulitic legs ;) on day 1</li>
    <li> The product has definitely changed  the feel of my skin, it feels more moist but I cant see a difference. I only use the product at night bc the stench is so strong and I worry about coworkers smelling it.</li>
    <li> I think that this product helped firm up some looser skin, but I didn&#x27;t really like the scent. It was too much patchouli for me! It definitely lets you know that something is working because as other reviewers have stated (and the bottle warns you as well!) that you will become red, like lobster red, and warm. I would also recommend that you moisturize your skin when using this product. That really seemed to help me with itchy skin after the redness and heat went down. I would moisturize in the morning and use this product at night.</li>
    <li> Product is as explained. But it showed up 2 days late and was slightly damaged :(</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend testing this on a small patch of skin before your first use! The bottle says it may cause the skin to &amp;#34;flush&amp;#34; for up to several hours. That&#x27;s an understatement! My skin started burning and turning red almost immediately. After 5 minutes I had developed a rash and the burning was almost unbearable. I had to wash it off right away. I tried again two more times and with a much smaller portion of skin. I still can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m not sure if that means the product was working or not but it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
    <li> This product certainly does something! I ordered this thinking what the heck, I don&#x27;t have much to lose and my goodness. This product smells good (but is very stong), like patchouli and when you first apply is, your skin feels moisturized and soft but after a good 15 minutes it starts to heat up and give, what other reviewers have called, a burning sensation. It&#x27;s a bit irritating the first few times but I have a tolerance to it now. And when the directions say to wash your hands after applying it&#x27;s a great idea to wash them well. My skin does feel firmer but not totally smooth (yet). I personally like this product and would order from this company again. The shipping was very fast and I was very excited to see it in the mail. Two thumbs way up!</li>
    <li> This is a good product the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it reddins and stings a little when you first use it other than that it does what it says.</li>
    <li> This product causes a red flushing and a burn from the niacin contained in the lotion. There is a warning on the bottle alerting you that this may well occur and to proceed with caution especially if you are sensitive to niacin. That being said there are only so many things I am willing to do in the name of beauty and since I have very sensitive skinn and a pain disorder that causes my nervous system to interpret non pain signals as pain, I decided to give the free sample of this I received to my daughter. She tried it and has experienced quite a bit of burning as anticipated. Her skin is starting to tighten up a bit after about a week but I am sure given a long period of time her results will improve. I doubt it would work on severe issues but it is likely useful for slight cellulite problems.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and have noticed firming. it does have a strong smell. also i know some people said they felt like a like burning, but i haven&#x27;t experienced any of that.. i would buy it again</li>
    <li> Recommend to wear at night due to strong medicine smell but overall I have seen a big difference in cellulite.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this review, you have probably read some of the others and certainly the product description so I will not be redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:  My daughter has been using this product. She feels like it works.  Some signs of tightening after only 3 weeks of use.  This is a pretty good deal. She will continue to use it and may see greater results.  As far as doing what it claims, I will vote YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some minor burning and redness at the application site but this reminds me of the old adage &#x27;if you can&#x27;t feel it, it&#x27;s not working&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:  Two things - There is a tendency to overdo the product the first few times.  Moderation is the key here.  It is certainly a live and learn situation but maybe the company could be more informative about the amount to use.  Last - my daughter did not like the smell.  This is of course subjective and many may like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can heartily recommend this product.  I hope you find this review helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael L. Gooch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:</li>
    <li> Felt good but didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do. Skin feels clean but pore size unchanged. A bit too expensive.</li>
    <li> While this product does leave an intense feeling ( almost like a sunburn), I believe I can see a difference in the areas where I use it.  Just be sure to wash your hands.</li>
    <li> This product burned so much when I used it I couldn&#x27;t continue using it so I don&#x27;t even know if it would have had any results. Uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Seems to firm up skin, but I have fallen in love with the scent of this product - fantastic!</li>
    <li> I received an email from a very nice lady asking if I would be interested in reviewing a couple of products from Vi-Tae.  After looking at the product pages on Amazon, I went ahead and said sure and was sent out a box containing all of the items above.  Not sample amounts - full-sized amounts for me to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;  I was pretty excited when I got the box - I could smell the items through the outside of the box and I liked what I smelled.  (It smelled like walking into Whole Foods, a smell that I find very relaxing and intoxicating.)&lt;br /&gt;  All of the products from Vi-Tae are organic/natural products, plus they have a 100% money back guaranteed, which they have extended to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firm Baby, Firm is a cellulite cream, which helps firm and smooth your stomach, butt, thighs and legs.  I have been using it since I received it and I have to say, it has firmed up those areas quite a bit. I&#x27;m rather impressed because I have tried these kinds of things before and seen nothing, but with this I&#x27;ve seen some results and I plan to continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> This cream has an herby smell to it, so if you don&#x27;t like the smell of herbs, I suggest not buying this product. As to what the cream does, I&#x27;m not quite sure but I think it makes your stomach, butt or thighs firm and the product does make the area you put it on red and warm.</li>
    <li> This product is really good. It does leave you feeling warm for sure but it seems to tighten the skin and leaving my skin firm. I received the product as part of a promotion for testing but I am glad I did. It&#x27;s a really decent product.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product for 1 week. While I have enough for several more days, it doesn&#x27;t require a much per application, I plan to reorder. I received the product promptly, no surprises. The directions and product info. is easy to understand. I was told to expect some possible flushing and heat. I have noticed no pink or redness at the application sites. I have noticed, I think because I anticipated it, a slight warmth. I&#x27;ve used varying amounts of lotion. No uncomfortable sensations. Results? I have a lot of ground, cellulite to cover. I&#x27;m nowhere near smooth and cottage cheese free, but I&#x27;ve noticed, as has a friend/observer, a bit of tightening. The skin is soft like I want it. Tight may not be the best description, but it aptly describes what we&#x27;re seeing so far. I will return with an update in another week or two. For now, I&#x27;m satisfied with the short term results and hope with further use I can add the fifth star. I wrote this honest review in exchange for the product. I said I would follow up after further use, so here it is. The product can work. For me it meant using as instructed. You can&#x27;t expect this to work if you only use it periodically!  It is not a product, at least for me, that will firm handfuls of loose skin, say from extreme weight loss. It is a product that can help do what it advertises.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in December and have been using it 3-4 times per week, I love the texture of the product and how it absorbs without leaving any greasy or tacky film, this product will last a little goes a long way, I think with continued use this product will definitely tone and firm up the skin, I have very little cellulite so using this product on a consistent basis you will see results.  It is February 16, 2015 I will purchase again and then give a full detailed review of my results but so far so good. It does firm and smooth as far as getting rid of cellulite one must exercise on a consistent basis time is a good thing be consistent with this product and your exercise routine, and you will definitely see results while using this product.  I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
