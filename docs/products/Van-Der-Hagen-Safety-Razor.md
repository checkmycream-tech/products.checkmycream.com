      <li>Good entry level razor.</li>
      <li>I loved it, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry I can&#x27;t take the care it takes, so I decided to get a DE.  </li>
      <li>I loved their [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Considering the price this is a really good razor.  </li>
      <li>Good razor.  </li>
      <li>Things had changed in this world and there were dozens of great options out there, I used the hydro 5 by schick which was great and also started to use the dorco 6 blade razors which were cheap and very nice, dorco is the brand used in the dollar shave club.</li>

      <li>more mild blade exposure which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I like this kind of safety razor that opens with the twist of the handle.  </li>

      <li>I saw this and picked it up as I have been looking for a safety razor for while I travel and did not want to bring my nice one out with me.</li>
      <li>While they are both great razors and deservedly get tons of praise, the VDH razor is more forgiving if your technique isn&#x27;t as refined as someone with more experience.</li>
      <li>Good shave again :)</li>
      <li>I began shaving with a safety razor, and initially really liked it.  </li>
      <li>I use the $1.99 deluxe soap and have about 160 personna blades that I change every 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
      <li>B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]] is fantastic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Honestly, I get a faster closer shave with a no-frills two-blade disposable.</li>
      <li>I started with the blade that came with it, nice for my face.</li>
      <li>I own a Merkur 34C that I paid $50 for from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use good razor blades.  </li>
      <li>and my brother was quite appreciative.</li>
      <li>This razor gives me a nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>Nice razor for the price.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy, even though I found my dad&#x27;s old safety razor two days after buying this, lol!</li>
      <li>especially right outta</li>
      <li>Do not listen to the reviews of the shaving snobs who have more money than good sense who claim that you need to spend a bunch of money to get an outstanding shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on the lighter side, but is easy to control, grips fairly well, and the shave with the included blades has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This safety razor is also excellent at trimming, my goatee looks more even and straight.</li>
      <li>Changing the blade is very easy to do.</li>
      <li>The razor is really nice and the blades give a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>One blade is way more effective.</li>
      <li>I have been getting a good shave with it and find it comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>Love it shaves real smooth.  </li>
      <li>It functions beautifully, and gives me a close, smooth comfortable shave, not provided by today&#x27;s disposables.</li>
      <li>Which is good, but the blade moves easily in the top.</li>
      <li>This is a great first DE razor.</li>
      <li>The razor is sturdy construction made of chrome plated brass, its easy to load the blades and makes for a nice shave.</li>
      <li>Man, am I glad I tried them.  </li>
      <li>Many feel the shorter handle gives more control, myself included, and all my razors have the shorter handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product lives up to its mention!! :)</li>
      <li>Better shave at a cheaper price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better shave than I get with this razor.</li>
      <li>MORE YET-</li>
      <li>and it was one of my better investments.</li>
      <li>my husband loves this product, will buy more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Razor made in china, blades made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Skip to the bottom of this review for the BOTTOM LINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got into DE shaving a few weeks ago, I was leaning toward the popular Merkur 34C.  I did not want to spend a lot of money on a razor - my reason for looking into DE shaving in the first place was to stop throwing my money away, so I did not want a high-price boutique razor.  Well, like other reviewers, I found this razor at my local Target and decided to give it a try, especially since it had the butterfly loading, which I coveted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was awful.  I figured it was just my technique, since I was new to the DE thing.  But my second shave wasn&#x27;t much better.  I switched to a shaving soap and saw some improvement.  Then I bought a sample pack of blades, and that is when things really changed.  The blades included with this razor were evidently not meant for me.  I tried the Astras, which were a little better, then I tried the Gillette Blues, which were MUCH better.  I thought to myself, maybe my technique just improved.  So I popped in some Feathers, and wow were they bad.  They just pulled on my hair and chewed up my face... why does everyone say Feathers are the sharpest?  I don&#x27;t know.  I had no nicks or cuts, just irritated skin from all the pulling and tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I put in some Derbys.  I expected these to be bad budget blades, but wanted to try them once before going back to the Gillette Blues.  Man, am I glad I tried them.  What a revelation!  The Derbys were so gentle, even on my neck where my hair pattern swirls.  They cut the hair easily, and left my skin alone.  The pairing of this Van Der Hagen razor and the Derby Extras made for the best shave I have ever in my life had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;Get this razor and a sample blade pack, you will be pleased.  I suggest that you ditch your aerosol can of gel/foam, too.  You will have the best shave of your life for the lowest price of your life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to see DE razors making a legitimate push to get people away from the overpriced and ridiculous multiblade razors you see everywhere. Not only are they a ripoff but they really just aren&#x27;t good for your skin no matter what they tell you. This really is a fantastic razor. If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a DE razor it is a really good place to start. I actually have two others...a Merkur 34c and Edwin Jagger DE86. While they are both great razors and deservedly get tons of praise, the VDH razor is more forgiving if your technique isn&#x27;t as refined as someone with more experience. It is a very mild razor that will require a bit more work to get as close as the others I mentioned but you will be less likely to irritate your skin. Although it goes against the rules of using a safety razor, I have found that I have to use a little pressure to get a BBS shave because the razor is not as heavy as your typical 2 or 3 piece razor. Not that it is a piece of junk because it seems very well made and will last a long time but it just doesn&#x27;t have the weight to let the razor do all the work. Use a very sharp blade like a Feather or Astra and this razor will work great. If you don&#x27;t use one of the sharper brands of blades you may be disappointed.  If you stick to using higher quality blades then this razor will serve you well. I have very sensitive skin and pretty coarse stubble, pretty much the worst combination possible, and this razor worked great for me. But as they say...YMMV.</li>
    <li> Works very well with the bonus of actually being able to afford to shave.</li>
    <li> Finally a DE i like.  I tried the more expensive ones and although the craftmenship was better the blade placement was far too aggressive for a 20 year plus electric shaver guy.  The blade comes out just enough so that with the gentlest of pressure it will touch your skin. Very nice.  Still an electric shaver guy, but i dont mind breaking this out when i feel like a change.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for a bargain price.  There are many more expensive razors out there, but I find nothing wrong with this one.  Quality craftsmanship and a great shave.  I would definitely purchase again if the first one needs replaced.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver for the cost. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Butterfly mechanism died soon after receiving.  Buy a 3 piece and do yourself a favor.</li>
    <li> For the price, it definetely seems worth it.  I have been getting a good shave with it and find it comfortable to use.  Also, I shave daily and have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> This razor will be responsible for getting thousands of people back into DE shaving due to its accessibility. You find it everywhere and it&#x27;s possibly a Weishi. The entire &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; line of VDH is very functional so kudos to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nifty little razor that does the job well, but it really needs more sharp, aggressive blades to be effective because it&#x27;s a light-shaver. So toss the ones that come with it (probably Merkur) because they are not quite sharp enough. Although all faces are different, I think most would agree with this. This is a good razor to use to get into DE shaving and should keep you happy for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shorter handle is consistent with the more old-school DE razors from the past and has medium heft, but not like a true heavy weight. Many feel the shorter handle gives more control, myself included, and all my razors have the shorter handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try DE shaving, this is a good razor to start with. I think you&#x27;ll continue to use it if you don&#x27;t pass it on to a friend or family member to get them started too!</li>
    <li> Very good price for a double-edge razor and a few blades to get you started. My only complaint is that I wish the handle was a little longer. The operation and quality seem to be very good. Does not seem like it will corrode or break too easily. The safety</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandfather who dislikes the newer razors. he claims this to be of good quality and does not lock up after several uses.</li>
    <li> First off, my review is based on the fact that I&#x27;m not a shave snob and don&#x27;t own an arsenal of fancy DE razors. I&#x27;m just a guy on a budget; in search of a razor that doesn&#x27;t cause razor burn. I&#x27;ve tried all of the multi-blade razors, including Harry&#x27;s and find that a safety razor works best for me and is much less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is made in China. I generally try to avoid Chinese manufactured products, but in this case I think the quality is present. The key features offered are a butterfly opening, a chrome finish, and a knurled handle. Like most safety razors, the handle is short, so if you have extremely large hands, you might want to consider a long handled razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Van Der Hagen German made DE blades are included. Personally, they didn&#x27;t work too well on my beard, so I opted for the Personna brand DE blades. Everyone&#x27;s beard is different, so you&#x27;ll need to try several different blades until you find which one&#x27;s right for your beard. I also use Cremo Shave Cream, and have experienced no razor burn, even when shaving against the hair growth grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re ready to tryout a safety razor and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of hard earned money, consider this one. If it doesn&#x27;t work out for you; give it to a relative. That&#x27;s what I did with my Harry&#x27;s set and my brother was quite appreciative. Sometimes you simply have to try it out for yourself. Reviews only offer an overview on products as personal as a razor.</li>
    <li> For what this razor costs, its not too bad. Its a good way to test whether or not you want to get serious about DE shaving without plunking down a ton of money. I picked mine up at Target in store, had a $20 gift card so I only had to pay $1.14 or so due to the sales tax above the $19.99 store price after my gift card. It is actually a Weshi, which is Chinese. They also manufacture the Micro Touch One, very similar razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually fairly impressed. Overall this is pretty decent. You have to make sure that the blade is centered properly when adding a blade, that is really the only issue with it. The construction is actually sturdier than I expected. I get good results from the shave, even though the razor is pretty mild. Its good to have a mild razor when you are a beginner too, because as my technique is getting better I am getting baby butt smooth shaves with 3 passes now, but the first attempt I made was not. I had to watch a few youtube videos to learn good technique. I was transferring all my bad habits from 16 years of Mach III shaving (pressure, going too fast, only making 1 multi-pass style shave instead of the 3 proper passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only used the blades that come with it, which are halfway decent but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them b/c they are about $1.00 a piece in store, I can get 100 blades for about $15 - $30 depending on what I go with. I just ordered a sampler pack to find which blades work best for me. Making this switch will save me TONS of money. I am completely done with cartridge razors and their b.s. gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am convinced that a DE razor is for me, I plan to buy something a little nicer, one of the fully stainless steel options. Of course, I have to save up some money first lol, but I will be keeping this razor for when I travel since I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if I lost it, and can easily replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good deal, and a good razor for a beginner with DE razors to start with.</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor.  Usually use the expensive disposables, but don&#x27;t plan on it ever again.  There is a definate learning curve to shaving at the proper angle.  Once you have that down there is definately a closer shave with less irritation.  Changing the blade is very easy to do.</li>
    <li> Good razor.  Purchased for a second travel razor.  Nice razor for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Van Der Hagen razor at Walmart, then ordered a couple more as Christmas gifts on Amazon.  This is good razor.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 months now.  I have noticed the TTO knob is getting a little hard to turn.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of drops of light oil and that has helped a little bit.  This razor is a little on the &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; side, but still fine for a beginner.  I have big hands, but like the handle length and balance.  Very easy to manoeuvre around the tough spots.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but the razor feels heavy in your hand. Which is good, but the blade moves easily in the top. I&#x27;m thinking this is not good</li>
    <li> I have been using traditional safety razors for some time now and bought this one on a whim to try it out, While it is generally of good construction and gets the job done, it is a classic case of you get what you pay for. At 20 dollars at the local target you can&#x27;t beat the price unfortunately it comes with a few downsides.  The handle is far to short for my liking. They market this as a feature to increase control but even with my small hands I felt like I had an uncomfortable grip on the razor.  While the angle of the blade is decent way to much of it is exposed. This gives you the opportunity if you are experienced enough for a SUPER close shave. Way to close for my comfort. Even at my experience level nicks were a common thing.  The blades included with the razor were complete rubbish.  If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to your nice muhle or edwin jagger for travel this isn&#x27;t a terrible choice.</li>
    <li> My son likes it and his skin is super sensitive because of the ingrown hairs he gets..I think it is helping the problem..</li>
    <li> I have been using a 2-blade Gillette Sensor since the 1980s. Those blade prices are now astronomical...I wonder sometimes if the price is going up to &#x27;force&#x27; people to stop using the old versions and convert to a modern multi. The problem with a fat multi is that I can&#x27;t get in close to shave under my nose. I have an average nose so how people with large one manage with a multi-blade is beyond me.  On a safety razor, it takes a few shaves to unlearn the &#x27;bearing-down&#x27; technique you use with a multi. Instead, use a steady, light drag across the face using only the weight of the razor. The reason is that a safety razor actually shaves the face smooth...multiple passes shave closer...rather than drag on the hair to let the next blade chop it (like a multi).  TIPS: use it with Gillette Foamy &#x27;Menthol&#x27; shave foam which was rated as the best in the US by a leading consumer magazine back in the 90&#x27;s. Somersets Original English Shaving Oil is also pretty neat stuff...and buy some quality blades...I use the Personna double-edge which are excellent.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if the handle was a bit longer. I am so used to using the razors with longer handles that getting used to this particular one will; take a short time. The shorter handle makes the razor easier to handle. Be prepared for the shorter handle when you order this quality razor.It is so hard to clean the razors on the market right now because of the multiple blades used in them &amp; they are expensive as we all know.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot how well these safety razors worked way back when.They give you a very smooth shave every time &amp; are very easy to clean. No more beating a razor on the sink to clean out a multiple blade razor! Sure, you can order so many other safety razors at very high prices,but why? The price of this razor is so much lower than some of the others out there but it works just as well. You do get 5 replacement blades with this razor &amp; Van Der Hagen is a quality name from Germany. I paired this razor with a Van Der Hagen luxury shave kit which includes a brush/razor stand,cup &amp; one shaving soap. This kit costs around 30 dollars but there are more expensive ones out there. Do not listen to the reviews of the shaving snobs who have more money than good sense who claim that you need to spend a bunch of money to get an outstanding shave. I am very particular about what I shave with &amp; I could have spent more money on these type of products, but why?</li>
    <li> This was my first Safety razor purchase and I am quite satisfied with it after my first shave. My skin is much less irritated than when I was using cartridge style razor&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> i really dont know why people still use and buy disposable shavers? i made the switch couple years ago to single blade razors, you get a better, closer shave, long lasting razors, and you help the environment, you also save a ton of cash!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying up to $50 for a pack of razors. Decided to try this safety razor.  I was a little worried I would cut myself, but it turned out to give a perfect shave.  No cuts. Very close and smooth. Like the textured handle for a more secure grip when my hands are wet or soapy.  The stainless blades it comes with are ok for beginners, but I will be upgrading once I use them up to a more aggressive razor blade.</li>
    <li> I never realized how poorly multi-blade razors actually shaved. One blade is way more effective. You just have to remember that you take shorter strokes or you run the risk of nicks. Rinsing out the blade is vital.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I USED THIS TYP (OLD STYLE) RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY GLAD I&#x27;VE TRIED IT, AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. VERY DURABLE, EASY TO CLEAN/MAINTAIN. USING A REAL RAZOR BLADE TO SHAVE WITH, IS THE WAY TO GO!</li>
    <li> I am brand new to the world of DE shaving. I bought this razor from Target along with the bowl and brush set from Van Der Hagen as well. I&#x27;ve spent a couple months comparing this razor against to offerings from Dollar Shave Club and this is the clear winner. I&#x27;ve never had a better shave than I get with this razor. It&#x27;s the only razor that I have ever used where I can go against the grain without getting burn, bumps and rash. I understand this razor is considered very mild and it takes a little getting used to as far as technique is concerned but once you figure it out you&#x27;ll be a believer too.</li>
    <li> used the razor for three weeks....the top will not open anymore to change a blade.....now....the razor is in two separate pieces......</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he loves it!  I was a little skeptical because of the cheap price, but so far it has worked great for him.</li>
    <li> The razor I purchased suffered from some cosmetic flaws, but holds the blade steady and even. However, these razors are not all made equally, and some buyers have received razors that are functionally defective. The difference in price between this and a higher-quality razor just isn&#x27;t enough to justify the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Parker razors, there are a ton to choose from in the $25-$35 price range and they are a much safer bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars due to my razor functioning just fine and the surprisingly good quality of the included blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor, you can pick up at target. Don&#x27;t use the blades that come with it tho, not good. Buy some Astra platinums, it&#x27;s like 100 blades to 10 bucks. But overall, good razor and I can shave daily with it</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time, works great have had no issues with it. Recommend it to everyone who is interested in single blade razors</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these because I am tired of overpriced razor cartridges.  I began shaving with a safety razor, and initially really liked it.  The problem is that after 3 months, I could not get the thing open to change the blade.  It kept &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; up, requiring pliers to twist the handle and open it.  Eventually, the shaft inside the handle broke.  I contacted the company, asking for a replacement (under the assumption that this was not a systemic quality problem).  I have not heard back from them.  Buying a new razor every 3 months is NOT an economical alternative to the overpriced razor cartridges.  I did purchase another safety razor, but it is not a Van Der Hagen.  My experience with the razor and the company&#x27;s customer service is that they don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> a great and safe  way to shave, i never once cut myself with this razor, even in sensitive areas (around the jaw, under the neck etc.) i highly recommend this over cartridge razors and it was a great transition to straight razors, but i still plan on using this when in a rush or on sensitive skin</li>
    <li> my husband loves this product, will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father for fathers day, he had never used a saftey razor up to this point. And had really stoped shaving because of the price of cartridge razors, and how painful it was. like me he shaves his head, and this razor is able to safely do that as long as he is carful due to it not being supper agressive. That being said hes still able to get it closer than he ever got with any other shaver, and he doesnt have to deal with the dry skin and irritation the others left. Plus my mom says shes deffinatly noticed a differnce. So all in all I  would say this razor is worth every penny, its built sturdy and will last for a long long time.</li>
    <li> Good durability but doesn&#x27;t work any better than the disposable I buy at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> The razor is really nice and the blades give a very smooth shave. I will need to order more blades in a few months to replenish the 5 it came with. closest shave i have ever gotten.</li>
    <li> I want to preface this by stating that I&#x27;m new to the safety razor game. This was my first DE razor purchase after a few shaves with a longer handled model. I had wanted to try a shorter razor after not being completely satisfied with the long handle I had been given by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my initial disappointment from learning that the razor itself is manufactured in China, I was pleased to find that the overall feel of the razor and the shave it provides exceeded my stunted expectations. It&#x27;s on the lighter side, but is easy to control, grips fairly well, and the shave with the included blades has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this seems to be a perfect DE razor to start with. As an inexperienced DE shaver, I can&#x27;t really say how it&#x27;d fare with a more experienced user, but I&#x27;d imagine those of you who know what you&#x27;re doing already have your allegiances fairly set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I hope to upgrade to a heaver razor after I&#x27;ve mastered the handling on this one a bit. I&#x27;m looking at a Merkur 34C or a Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
    <li> I regret buying this. It tore my skin to pieces on the first try. The blade was all red from my blood. I had blood coming out of my face in a hundred places.</li>
    <li> I was using a multi blade razor before I switched. It took me a few shaves to get use to the weight, and I did have a few cuts.  Once I remembered not put too much pressure on the razor, I really like it, and no more nicks.  I&#x27;m getting a good close shave, and saving on blades.</li>
    <li> Love it shaves real smooth.  nice heft good balance should last a lifetime of use works right out of the package</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45, so I&#x27;ve been shaving for a few years.  On a whim, I thought I&#x27;d see what the fuss was about with this double edge safety razor resurgence.  In a word, the first shave was terrible.  I cut myself several times and had to go very slowly. It felt like the blade was about as sharp as my wife&#x27;s disposable razor that&#x27;s been in the shower for weeks.  The second shave (on the same blade) was even worse... guess you get one shave per blade with these VDH razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try a different manufacturer&#x27;s blade, just to make sure I&#x27;m not missing something; but it appears this &amp;#34;old technology&amp;#34; was replaced with something better for a reason.  Honestly, I get a faster closer shave with a no-frills two-blade disposable.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine for $18.95 at Wal-mart. At the time it was cheaper even with taxes. The razor is not from Germany It&#x27;s Made in China, the blades are from Germany. The razor is sturdy construction made of chrome plated brass, its easy to load the blades and makes for a nice shave. It appears to be durable and I see no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t last a lifetime with proper care.</li>
    <li> great product, but it (no bulls***)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but it gets used regularly aand so far so good. Only request was maybe a slightly longer handle but he really loves it.</li>
    <li> This razor is EXCELLENT!!  The butterfly mechanism closes tight, so there is no blade bouncing.  I LOVE IT!  Why do I love it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been ranting about the SCAM that makes up the modern commercial shaving industry.  Every dang time I go to the drug store and spend $20 on five-tiered shaving cartridges (For Four) I start raving to my wife, for the next twenty minutes.  It&#x27;s nothing but a gosh-dang scam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once had a conversation with a mechanical engineer who worked for Chlorox.  She was a veteran there, and she told me about the project she had worked on: the development of one of those new &amp;#34;Swifter&amp;#34; mops.  She told me how her group had developed an excellent, modern, mop.  It was perfect, but not according to her boss.  Why?  Although the design was perfect, her boss wanted it adjusted to require &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; of some sort, so back to the drawing board.  And walla, a perfect mop was re-designed into a piece of crap, so that .... what?  So Chlorox would make substantial money on the refills.  In other words, it wasn&#x27;t about designing a quality product.  That was NOT the goal.  It never was.  The goal was simple: make a mop that requires refills; sell the mop at cost; and make money on the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bleeping shave companies have been doing this for years.  They haven&#x27;t been trying to design long-lasting, quality, razors for men.  They&#x27;ve been designing razors that REQUIRE you to shell out $20 a month!  Get it?  That is their goal!  Yet, I read reviews by users who tromp down to the store, by a safety razor, such as this one, poop out some shaving gel, and cut their face to pieces.  Then, they all say the same thing: &amp;#34;There&#x27;s a reason modern shave-companies stopped making safety razors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!  There is a reason you fools.  TO MAKE MONEY!  Not to provide you with a quality shave.  You want a quality shave??  Then you wet shave with a safety razor or straight razor, period. End of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;smy advice to all users.  Before you come here and write a bad review for this safety razor or any other one, LEARN HOW TO WET SHAVE FIRST!  Don&#x27;t come on here and give a razor a bad review, because you decided you have been shaving for years and must know how to do it.  Then you cut your face up, and now want to **tch about it.  Bunch of babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor, knowing how to wetshave, and NEVER cut myself once.  NOT ONCE, and I did THREE passes.  My wife said my face was like a babies it was so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen products are made in Liberty Texas, not Germany.  The blades are made in Germany.  Doesn&#x27;t matter where they are made: this razor is hands-down one of the best butterfly-opening safety razors you can get for the money.  In fact, it may be the best.  The problem with many butterfly-opening safety razors is that the blade can move around, if the top isn&#x27;t tight.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this razor, unless you tighten it like a little girl.  Tighten it like a man, and it will serve you in return.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with a Mach 3 or Quattro, both freebies I got in the mail years ago. Always hated paying obnoxious prices for cartridges; only bothered shaving (around a goatee) once a week or so and using a beard trimmer every other day. Considered the Dollar Shave Club when I started seeing commercials and FB ads, but them I saw Rick Harrison and his Micro One Touch commercials. Went to Target and found the Van Der Hagen instead for under $20..loving it! Paired with a shave soap and brush set, I&#x27;m shaving every other day now! There wasn&#x27;t even any learning curve for me; the only cuts I got were on previously irritated skin. Definitely a good buy, even though I found my dad&#x27;s old safety razor two days after buying this, lol!</li>
    <li> Performs satisfactory enough.  Comparable to the Micro Touch One razor and the Weishi twist to open razors.</li>
    <li> This will be a long review to warn you but it will be worth reading. It is my journey of shaving and the switch to the DE razor and a review of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing there will be a lot of people who are wondering if they should make the switch to this older form of shaving. Should I go with an electric shaver? 6 blade cartridge razor? Or just use a beard trimmer? Or the DE safety razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving in high school and used the fusion razor from gillette. My facial hair was thin and this razor removed it easily, a disposable bic would have removed it easy so there isn&#x27;t much to be said about that. A year later I had stopped using razors to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sophomore year of high school I then started using a beard trimmer I would remove the guard and then just trim it as short as possible and sport the five o clock shadow look which is popular still with a lot of guys. I remained doing this all the way through my last year of college. The problem with this meathod however is that beard trimmers not only remove your hair but also the dry skin on your face and it takes away from having a close even shave. The end result would be a mess on my bathroom counter and my face would be read and dry. I also tried a Norelco rotary shaver which did give a smooth closer shave but it just missed a lot of stray hairs and it became annoying. Plus there is nothing worse when your running late and your shavers battery dies when half of your face has been trimmed and the other half still scruffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mid way through college I went back to the cartridge razor. Things had changed in this world and there were dozens of great options out there, I used the hydro 5 by schick which was great and also started to use the dorco 6 blade razors which were cheap and very nice, dorco is the brand used in the dollar shave club. With the cartridge razors i did get a close shave but it was not comfortable. Razor burn was unavoidable and ingrown hairs were becoming blemishes. Also the huge factor was the price, 20 dollars for 4 blades? Are you kidding me? By now my facial hair was much thicker and a blade would last me two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the past few weeks I&#x27;ve been trying to find some relief, should I use different shaving creams to make it more comfortable? Should I go back to the electric shaver/trimmer? Neither, I have been reading dozens of article about DE safety razors and how they are the answer to every mans fight with shaving. But I was worried that it would take a half hour in the morning to apply lather and take my time with a sharp razor and I held off for another week. Then while at target I saw the Van der Hagen safety razor for $18 and I bit the bullet. I was pretty excited to try it out and a day later I was ready for a shave. Now I didn&#x27;t buy a badger brush or a bowl or shave soap, I bought some nivea canned shave gel for $2. So I get out of the shower my face soaked with hot water and I put on my shave gel and let it set in for a minute like anyone else would. I was pretty nervous because people always say first time with a safety razor your guaranteed to cut yourself. So I stare at my cartridge razor then back at the beautiful chrome Van der Hagen razor and finally  pick up the heavy razor and drag it with the grain down my face. It took me a few minutes to find the right angle and when I did it went across my face so smoothly and easily I was in disbelief. I kept expecting to pull the razor away and find blood all over my face but not once did I cut my face it it was cutting the hair so close. I did two passes one with the grain and one across the grain and after washing my face off with cold water I was amazed that there was absolutely no reddness or bumps and my face was completely bare of hair. When my gf came home and touched my face she immediately asked if i used a new razor to shave my face. She could see a difference immediately. Even my brother and best friend asked me later that evening for drinks if I waxed my face or something. 7 hours later my face still was smooth and showed no signs of a five o clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is the answer to shaving. Believe all of the snobby articles on different mens sites saying that this is the best way to shave. Yeah it takes maybe 10 minutes longer on your shaving time but it is worth it! Plus you feel bad ass shaving with a razor blade rather than those 6 blade, pivoting head, lubricating strip, vibrating cartridge razors. From what I hear this razor is a less aggressive blade compared to others so if you want something better go ahead buy a Merkur or Edwin Jagger just do yourself a favor and go to the DE razor.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! I actually don&#x27;t mind shaving now.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before buying this for my partner.  He wanted to make the move from the (insanely overpriced) cartridge razors he&#x27;s been using all his life, and we decided on this to begin the transition. He&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks and loves it.  Good safety razor for a great price!</li>
    <li> I just received this wonderful razor, and it exceeded all my expectations. It is exactly as described--with the heft and weight of the one I used to have during the 1950s and sixties. It functions beautifully, and gives me a close, smooth comfortable shave, not provided by today&#x27;s disposables. It is a bit of nostalgia as well.&lt;br /&gt;Although made in China (what isn&#x27;t?) The chrome plated brass quality is five stars. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is not enough blade exposure which makes it difficult to get a close shave.  It is easy to switch blades and you will rarely cut yourself though so those are 2 good things.</li>
    <li> The quality of this razor is pretty good the only thing is the handle is short and makes it hard to hold when your hands get wet</li>
    <li> Good entry level razor. The merker blades it came with were horrible. Put a good DE blade in this razor and you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> It works for what I need it for. For the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> My husband said its Best shave without all that cost.  Great razor good quality, Get a mug, soap and brush that will last a life time and little hot water gives a warm comfortable shave without the irritation.  Do not hesitate get you one, and save your face and wallet</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift to my husband and he really was excited about it.  I was not crazy about the razors that came with it because it cut him all up, but I think if I purchase different razors it should work well.  Great item.  Prompt deliver and on schedule.  Thanks a bunch.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was an upgrade from a cheap version I bought from shaving factory for eleven bucks . At 28 almost 29, bucks, the &amp;#34;van der Hagen&amp;#34; is a BIG MISTAKE!! It&#x27;s the SAME exact razor made in China packaged in the U.S. With a Dutch name do NOT waste your money on this razor!!! I want my money back !!!</li>
    <li> The blades are OK, don&#x27;t last like I remember the old one did. For being made in Germany, they are below par. The razor is a cheap Chinese knock off. It was advertised as a German made razor. :(</li>
    <li> Better shave than any of the Gillette or Schick stuff that comes with like 6 blades per attachment and costs an arm and a leg when you buy refills. Better shave at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I take coumadin so it is important to me to get a close shave without cuts or razor burn.  This is the best shave I have ever received.</li>
    <li> Not only is the shave better than most I have had with a multi blade, It is a very well made product. The big plus is that the replacement blades are much less expensive than the multis.  The butterfly opening makes it easy to change blades and clean.  I have been trying many different  double edge razors to pick the best and this one may be it for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at Walmart for a few dollars cheaper ($17.58) than on Amazon and found it to be a very nice one.  I have a medium heavy beard and shaved with a 2 day growth using a Derby blade that had been used 2 times before and got a very smooth result.  I made one pass with the grain and another against the grain.  This razor is not aggressive but if you prepare your beard properly it should do a very good job even on a fairly heavy beard.  The handle is about 3 inches long which some guys may think is too short but the knurled handle enables you to have a firm grip and good control.  I could not find any flaws in the plating or the twist mechanism.  The blade lined up correctly after closing.  I do know that if the TTO razors are not held with the cap straight up some of them will not close evenly.  I did not experience any of the problems that some reviewers did.  Maybe they just got a bad one.  This is a very good razor that I cannot find any fault with.</li>
    <li> Quite close to the 50&#x27;s Gillette Flare tip. Short fat handle (Which I Enjoy!) Decent heft but not as close as the Flare tip&lt;br /&gt;I really love the knurling on the handle as it provides a great grip,  especially right outta the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Butterfly doors open and close well. Very shiny chromed shaving tool!&lt;br /&gt;A more mild blade exposure which is perfect for me. It allows multiple passes without burn, nicks, or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Always provides a great shave. Love the fact that razors such as these are making a comeback!&lt;br /&gt;Shaved with a vintage flare tip and then compared it to this. Both are mild razors. I have a hard time telling&lt;br /&gt;Any difference. Good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;A little trick for a smoother shave is to use hair conditioner on your face and rub it in real good. Then use your brush and&lt;br /&gt;Face lather over the top.&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes and shaves!!</li>
    <li> I waited and waited for reviews and none were being posted, so I finally decided to take a chance and just order one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as soon as I ordered mine the other reviews started showing up and I found out from one that its made in China.  Generally, that wouldn&#x27;t put me off too much, but so far, my experiences with [[ASIN:B00A7239EK Chinese]] [[ASIN:B001D4Z87W safety razors]] haven&#x27;t been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;after all, VDH is a good company... I loved their [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Premium Shave Set]] and the [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]] is fantastic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... I got my razor and before I even opened the packaging I could see there was a blemish on the chroming.  I open the razor and the chroming work on the inside of butterfly mechanisms was very sloppy.  At least they made the surface smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that wouldn&#x27;t matter, ultimately, if it shaved well.  Sadly, like the other Made In China safety razors I&#x27;ve tried that have the twist to open style heads, the butterfly clasping sides don&#x27;t close evenly on the blade, so one side ends up cutting different than the other, since one clasp shuts properly, and the other doesn&#x27;t.  In my case, the side that closed tightly shaved okay, the side that didn&#x27;t left so little of the blade exposed I could barely shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m judging this razor based on the side that closed, it was milder than my Merkur, but still did quite well shaving my rather thick stubble.  Were both sides even I&#x27;d give this a 4 star rating as the design itself is solid and the blades it came with were great (I&#x27;ll have to remember to order some VDH blades later).  But mine doesn&#x27;t close right, leaving me with only one usable side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that I just got a bad razor and most close properly, have a better finish, etc. but at this price, every razor leaving the factory should be perfect.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it.  He has told me several times it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever had and he hasn&#x27;t had to replace the razor yet.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a great first DE razor. It&#x27;s modeled after the butterfly Gillette. Honestly, this razor is cheaper at your local store or at other online retailers. I bought one to see if I&#x27;d like DE shaving, and I do. I have since moved on to a much nicer razor but still use the Van der Hagen as my travel razor. It&#x27;s branded as a &amp;#34;Van der Hagen&amp;#34; and comes complete with Dutch orange packaging, but the razor is actually a Chinese made Weishi. If you want to use it to see if you enjoy DE shaving or want to use it for many years, I think the razor is well worth a try.</li>
    <li> My Husband didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but he truly loves his new razor.  After conditioning his skin as it recommends by shaving daily , his face is super smooth and it takes no time to shave.</li>
    <li> This is to replace my old one. The razor is heavy enough to feel good in your hand. The classic design is functional,  very easy to clean. No added features to get in the way.</li>
    <li> I got one, and then ordered another one. One for home and one for travel. These seem well made and opens and closes easily with no apparent problems.</li>
    <li> I own a Merkur 34C that I paid $50 for from Amazon. I am in the Navy and require a close shave everyday. While I was home on leave I was walking through Target. I saw this and picked it up as I have been looking for a safety razor for while I travel and did not want to bring my nice one out with me. I have been shaving with the Van Der Hagen for 2 weeks now. Let me tell you it works as well as my $50 Merkur at home. I use Every Man Jack shaving cream and aftershave. I normally use Gillett Silver Blue blades but decided to you the blades included today. They shave very well how ever I find that I will you 1 Van Der Hagen blade per shave where I can get 2 or 3 out of the Gillette Silver Blue. Great product for beginner and veteran alike.</li>
    <li> I like this kind of safety razor that opens with the twist of the handle.  This razor gives me a nice close shave.  I can not say the quality is good nor can I say it is bad.  Ask me about that after a year or so.  I can say that out of the box it opens and closes very well, shave is great.  Again, as with another razor I bought the blade does stick out from the ends of the razor.  The old time ones didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> Considering the price this is a really good razor.  It could be just a bit heavier like my Mercur but it&#x27;s still heavy enough for me to continue using.  I would buy it again.  BTW, if you&#x27;re thinking of going to double edge/wet shaving I highly recommend it.  NEVER again will I let a cartridge razor touch my face.  But do keep in mind you need to let the weight of the razor do the shaving.  DO NOT apply pressure like you do with a cartridge.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m a convert. Buy this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always detested electric razors, they irritate my skin horribly. But they have a place in my armrest for a quick run if I&#x27;m running behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge (Mach 3 for years till I ganked my sisters Fusion) razors aren&#x27;t so irritating but my skin only allows a once, maybe twice a week shave and its still a bit rough. Always has been. They work well on my head though. But over 20 years I&#x27;ve used them all, Bic throwaways, Sensor Excel, Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this guy. This guy is it. I remember my grandfather shaving with one so I mimicked what I remembered when I was a kid sitting on the toilet and watching him. Dad was a big nerdy hippy who had a beard and passed when I was  young so no help there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nary a cut. No blood loss. No nicks. Bit stingy on the aftershave but I expected that. Two passes, one with and one against. A few rough patches but nothing noticeable to the wife, just me. I chalk that up to low quality shaving cream (Barbasol, was not about to go mug &amp; brush till I had a trial run) and it being my first time.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this for about 3 months and it is exactly what I was looking for; good weight with a short handle. The head stays tightly closed until you twist the bottom of the handle and the handle doesn’t slip in wet fingers. The blades lasted about a week and a half shaving every day before noticeably dulling, so I’d say 10-12 shaves per blade. I picked up some Feather blades locally and they fit in the handle perfectly. I would certainly recommend this for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Doors operate smoothly and lock tight. I paired this razor with a used Gillette Silver Blue blade which I had used in my Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl over a year ago. This cheap razor actually gave me a closer, gentler shave than the EJ. Approximately two years ago I started collecting and using antique and new se/de razors. While I tried a variety of blades and numerous razors the results were disappointing and I went back to the multi blade disposables. About three months ago I decided to start shaving again with my straights and have become very proficient. I am awaiting the arrival of two new straights, a Dovo and a Boker. However, due to the time involved in shaving with straights I decided to buy this razor. I am so impressed with this razor that is now my daily shaver. I will buy a Merkur 38 HD for my collection, but this is because I like the way it looks. The straights will be used when I have plenty of time to shave and maintain them. Perhaps learning to shave correctly with the straights has improved my technique with de razors. Whatever the reason this razor performs flawlessly for me.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at a local store, but thought I would review it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very intrigued by the idea of using an old style razor. I had been using a multi-blade razor for a long time and was getting sick of wasting money on new heads. So I saw this in my local store and thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. It cost, with the soap, about the same as a new pack of multi-blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well my experience wasn&#x27;t what I would call pleasant. At first I thought it did a fairly good job when I started on my cheeks. Smooth enough, no really tugging. But as I continued to other parts of my face I began to notice, despite not feeling any real pain, that I was starting to show blood. I figured that a few nicks was probably normal and just continued on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of my shave my face was literally covered in blood. Mind you I have been shaving since I was 15, so for nearly 15 years I have never cut myself this severely and I started with an old one blade bic razor. The shape of the the razor is very cumbersome and can&#x27;t get into tight areas around the nose and mouth. I tried various angles and ended up slicing my nostril to the point of blood pouring out. I had to pull out my old dull razor to fix things up and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just assumed maybe I needed practice or my face needed to adjust. So I shaved again with it a few days later(I typically shave once or twice a week although my facial hair does grow quickly and thick).&lt;br /&gt;The results were the same if not worse. I cut my neck pretty bad and once again had blood everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step was the trash for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d like to the think that maybe I got a bad one where the angle of the blade wasn&#x27;t right, or something was out of order, but I refuse to spend money again on something that injured me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had it&#x27;s pros though. Easy to clean. Easy to use. But I&#x27;d rather spend a couple extra bucks and not cut myself constantly. There isa reason there have been advancements in razor technology.</li>
    <li> I recommend this razor to ANYONE looking to stop paying so damn much for shaving! BUT WHATS MORE is that if you get a cheap handle (I bought my first safety razor handle from someone overseas for $3, so yes it was inexpensive, but it took a long time to get here in comparison to the 2 days this razor took!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHATS MORE YET- the cheap handle I bough for $3 had you unscrew the hole top piece from the razor, separate two pieces of metal manually, insert a blade, put it all back together and hope you screwed it into the handle to the exact tightness that wouldn&#x27;t have you cutting yourself up all over the place! INSTEAD, this razor, you just twist the bottom of the handle and the top comes open to insert or remove a blade! SO HANDY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lives up to its mention!! :)</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other razors. But I&#x27;m very pleased with it, its easy to learn, work wonderfully, and has already saved me money on shaving. This is a great razor to me and I would recommend it to other people looking to start using DE safety razors. Maybe even practiced shavers too.</li>
    <li> Good value fir the money. Its the first two edged safety razor I&#x27;ve bought so it was good not to spend too much money on something I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with &amp; didn&#x27;t wabt ti spend a lot of money on. They handle is a little to short but the blades that came with it are Merkur &amp; are made in Solingnen the &amp;#34;City of Blades.&amp;#34; Mark V. Salt Lake City, UT</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for 2 weeks. I am new to this kind of shaving and like others razor burn for the first few days. Once I got the angle and technique figured out it works fine, I like a close shave so I need to go over 2 times with it. I started with the blade that came with it, nice for my face. I also got the 15 blade variety pack to see what blade(s) work the best. If I can get a month out of each blade I will have about a 20 month supply of blades. A lot sharper than the disposable ones that only last a week and then are completely dull. Great investment!!!  UPDATE: I have been using this razor for awhile now and I, too, have had the same problem with it getting to the point of not being able to open it. If you sterilize it like me with alcohol, the alcohol disperses the lubrication off the shaft and causes it to open hard. Just buy a can of 3 in 1 oil for a few dollars and put a drop on the shaft [after removing blade] work it in, and it will be fine. I keep my 3 in 1 oil in medicine cabinet right next to razor and put a drop on after sterilizing or if it starts opening hard. Cheaper alternative than buying a new razor which if you sterilize you will probably run into the same problem. Love the razor, great shave. found feather blades to be the best for my face...</li>
    <li> Old school and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The razor is perfect size and weight. Cuts very close and waxy to handle I like it.</li>
    <li> I am one person that hates shaving, and dread having to buy replacement blades for my fusion razor, $20 for 4 blades? I bought this safety razor from Walmart for around $12 with a 5 pack of blades included, and bought another 5 pack for about $3. I have been wanting to try a safety razor or a straight razor from MD barber. I have to say, this razor is great. I did knick my skin twice, but the shaving experience is amazing, and now I actually enjoy shaving. One thing I did find out is if you twist the bottom and close it completely it will knock out long hairs with no problem. But if you open it up a bit and put a tad of space between the razor and skin guard and shave against the grain, it will give you a really close shave, but please bare in mind, exposing more of the blade increases the risk of getting cut, so please be careful. This safety razor is also excellent at trimming, my goatee looks more even and straight.</li>
    <li> I just bought one of these at Wal Mart. I tried it for the first time when i got home, I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving my neck, always wind up bleeding, but this razor shaved my neck beautifully with no cuts and a very close shave as well. I would recommend this razor to anyone who has trouble shaving. I remember watching my father shave with one of these when i was a kid and have always wanted one of my own now I have one and it was one of my better investments.</li>
    <li> Good value!  Not the best one out there but entirely useable.  Just make sure to use good razor blades.  Spend $0.20 per blade instead of $0.15 ---you&#x27;ll still be saving lots over the cartridge style razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge razors after using this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for my ol&#x27; reliable Merkur (which has, alas, been left in some Vegas hotel restroom; damn my luck, and Jameson). I bought it for $17 at Fry&#x27;s and just used it. Although it has a less aggressive effect than my Merkur had (minus one star for me on that note), and the blades aren&#x27;t my usual (figured I&#x27;d try out the included VDH ones), I must say for the price, I dig it. My Merkur wasn&#x27;t a butterfly top and was a little longer in the handle, but I find I don&#x27;t mind the shorter handle and the weight is just fine. I also don&#x27;t mind the butterfly lid, so bonus on that note. The thing even shaves well (though as aforementioned, it is less aggressive, so might need to find a better angle), and my only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I&#x27;m unsure of how the material will hold up long-term. Other than that yes, I will purchase another Merkur (I love the action on &#x27;em) sometime down the road; however, as a spare travel kit one, or just a cheap-o beginner, I feel the quality and shave you get for the price ain&#x27;t too shabby, and I am perfectly content with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it now that he&#x27;s used to shaving with this type of razor. His face is much smoother than it ever was with a mach 3!</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I am somewhat new to DE shaving - a few months. This was my first razor and I have since also acquired Merkur 37c Slant and Merkur 15c Open Comb. I still think this is a great first razor, especially if you can get it under $20. I ended up buying another one for about $15 from Amazon Warehouse Deals - either as backup or to give to a friend to try. On the other hand I have several straight edge razors and have started that over a year ago. I loved it, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry I can&#x27;t take the care it takes, so I decided to get a DE.  1. The ripoff companies that make cartridge razors have lost me forever. I am not coming back. With straight edge I usually only indulged myself when I had a leisurely morning, not in a hurry anywhere (but that&#x27;s rare). This DE razor is actually easier and faster than a cartridge, because once you fill up the one side you flip it over and continue, twice as long before rinsing. Shaves closer too. This was the smoothest shave I ever got (mind you, I&#x27;m still learning with the straight edge and while they shave great, it&#x27;s not as easy to finesse the difficult spots - chin, upper lip. Plus I am still learning to hone/strop).  2. EVERYTHING is a gimmick! Pivoting head - a gimmick. Multiple blades - gimmick. Rubber guides - gimmick. And ESPECIALLY the aloe strip - was specifically developed to create a psychological perception that it&#x27;s time to change blades (heard this one was in a business school case study). One of these DE blades lasts a long time and blades are dirt-cheap, even the premium ones.  3. I was concerned that this razor is made in China, but it feels very solid. And I liked that it has guides underneath the cutting edge (aka &amp;#34;safety bar&amp;#34;) - it&#x27;s not like a free blade, not like straight edge. My first time shaving with it I had zero cuts/nicks. The handle is a little short, but it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to it. It&#x27;s probably even better when you need to use it upside down, under your nose, etc. FWIW both my Merkurs have even shorter handles - by another quarter-inch.  4. I got mine from Target, twenty bucks, just because I wanted one &amp;#34;today&amp;#34; and it was cheaper than most decent razors on Amazon.  5. I expected that the butterfly opening would be worse than the usual twist-off handle (like my father had), but it&#x27;s a solid mechanism. A pretty good design because you won&#x27;t lose parts, won&#x27;t drop anything down the sink, etc.  I just came across an article on Fortune.com: &amp;#34;How long does a razor really last? Gillette comes clean&amp;#34;. In it they talk about Gillette&#x27;s new ad stating that their Fusion cartridge will last &amp;#34;5 weeks&amp;#34;. Yeah, right. But even if it did AND even if they gave them away free, I would still continue using DE. And if you like simple math: if you shave daily AND throw away your DE blade every time, 5 weeks worth of shaving with Astra blades will run you about $3.50 (or even a tad less). A Fusion cartridge costs $4 - IF you buy in bulk from Costco. But typically those Astra blades last 4-6 shaves :)  UPDATE 06/10/2015: went back and used this razor again, with Astra SP blade and Williams Mug Soap. Good shave again :) After using my two other razors, which also happen to be mild, the only comment about this one: it&#x27;s not aggressive. And if you know the difference between aggressive and harsh, you&#x27;ll know that a little more aggressive can be good. It was a good shave, but buffing just took a few extra passes (and minutes), but on the plus side: no irritation/burn/bumps. At some point I&#x27;ll try it with Feather, Wilkinson Sword and Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> For the money you cannot beat this razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for five months and it&#x27;s performed wonderfully. This is my first safety razor. Although I&#x27;m tempted to get a Merkur razor I am sticking with my Vanderhagen because I am saving a ton of money. I have the Vanderhagen premi mug and stand. I use the $1.99 deluxe soap and have about 160 personna blades that I change every 3 to 4 shaves. Besides the soap my only other expense would be a $7 or so Aqua Velva aftershave. I am enjoying the best shaving experience and paying very little for it. I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> He didn&#x27;t care much for it.  He said it was ok, but has gone back to using store bought razors.</li>
    <li> I have no need to buy another razor.  Excellent product!</li>
