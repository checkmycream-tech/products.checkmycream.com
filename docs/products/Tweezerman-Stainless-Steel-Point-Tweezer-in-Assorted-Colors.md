      <li>Tweezerman makes good products and I heartily recommend these to anyone needing a superfine point.</li>
      <li>I really prefer the slant tweezers, but given the outstanding quality of the slant tweezers, I&#x27;m sure these are perfect for some application that I&#x27;m just not using them for.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve also found that they often break the hair off instead of just gripping it.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had better tweezers that grab the hair more easily.  </li>
      <li>The fine and precise point is perfect for targeting specific eyebrow hairs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the finely pointed tweezers, but it was my mistake and I&#x27;m ok about it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for tweezing ingrown hairs or tiny hairs on the face, neck, eyebrows or anywhere else on the body.  Precision is the highest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> These Tweezerman point tweezers are sharp and exact for tweezing even the finest of hairs with precision. They&#x27;re easy to use and since Tweezerman offers a free lifetime sharpening service for their tweezers, as long as you take care of them they should last a very long time. One note of caution, since these tweezers do have a very sharp point, you do need to be careful. Also, keep the rubber tip protector (that comes with them) on when you&#x27;re not using them because if you happen to drop them, the tip can become bent. (Though they can be fixed if this happens). They&#x27;re also great for removing slivers or ingrown hairs. If you&#x27;re looking for precise, professional quality tweezers, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
    <li> These are not as good as I expected.  It&#x27;s actually difficult to grab the smaller fine hairs with these....  I&#x27;ve also found that they often break the hair off instead of just gripping it.  I just don&#x27;t think these are ideal for plucking eyebrows (which is what I bought them for).      I&#x27;ve put them in the first aid kit on my boat as I think they&#x27;ll do a decent job at removing any splinters.</li>
    <li> there is NO Better tweezer EVER</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I every bought.  The company will sharpen these free for life.  I&#x27;ve used this feature.  I have several tweezerman tweezers in other styles.</li>
    <li> As a school nurse, I swear by these tweezers.  They can remove ANY splinter.  They are also great for touching up my eyebrows, disinfecting between of course!  They are totally worth the price but make sure you  always store them with the cap on.  Once the tips become bent they won&#x27;t work as well.  I dropped the last pair and bent the tips, rendering them useless.  Be careful with them, and they will become a go to!</li>
    <li> I have overgrown busy eyebrows in the middle, and have always been using a revlon, thinking that the short stubby hairs will never come out-when I bought this, I became obsessed with tweazing my eyebrows-it literally cna get e/t out!!! the only downside is that when i try too hard, i sometimes irritate my skin because the tweezers are really sharp, so my advice is be careful!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this tweezer. The one I received doesn&#x27;t pick out any thing..... I wasted my money on this one.</li>
    <li> The extremely sharp tips to this tweezer make an easy task of removing unwanted hair.  I purchased on years ago, which I use to this day.  I purchased this second one for my travel bag.  It puts other tweezers to shame.</li>
    <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;Where have you been all my life?&amp;#34;... this tweezer is FABULOUS!!! No more do I have to deal with broken off hairs when I pull on them. It pulls  them out by the roots. Sure wish I had this product decades ago. If I ever lose the one I have, I will be buying another one the same day!! This tweezer is THAT GOOD.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good pair of tweezers that could do everything so I wouldn&#x27;t spend a ton on a collection of them. These ones are great for cleaning up hairs after I wax my brows and even great at removing ingrown hairs. Sharp enough to get the job done without hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers!</li>
    <li> Always a great product, except the tips will get damaged eventually.  At some point, they will fall to the floor and the tips will get bent.  Get a small pair of pliers that you can use to very gently straighten the tips.  Also, use a small sharpening stone to carefully put the edge back on.  There are videos on youtube that can show you how.  Do not over-sharpen or you will permanently ruin the tweezer.  I have tried sending them back for the &amp;#34;free, lifetime sharpening&amp;#34; but do not recommend this service because your money is better spent on these two simple tools.  I felt that the person sharpening my set didn&#x27;t really test them before he sent them back to me.  I just wish they were made out of a stronger metal, hence only 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who complain that they are too sharp, buy something else next time.  These are for very delicate work on tiny hairs.  If you are fumble-fingered, then yes, they are too sharp for you.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that these are the only tweezers you will ever need. I have 900 other pairs and when I misplace these, my eyes well up with tears at the thought of losing them. I do A LOT of eyebrow grooming on myself as well as many others. These tweezers are WONDERFUL and VERY precise. I can reach microscopic hairs, that you can only see in a 10X lighted and magnified mirror, with these babies.     These tweezers are also fantastic for splinters, ingrown hairs, and tackling zits (which you shouldn&#x27;t be doing . . . tsk tsk).    Be careful! They&#x27;re sharp!</li>
    <li> I was looking for tweezers that had a very fine point, because I lost my last pair.  I was happy to at least be able to find this item.  I don&#x27;t know how the rest of the world plucks their eyebrows with the other kind of tweezers, but I require some precision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my expectations were too high, because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with these tweezers.  But they&#x27;re a little long, a little light, and somehow harder to use than my last pair.  But for me, they&#x27;re better than the alternative, the regular tweezers others use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Your color will be random - mine was orange.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are fine.  But this one shows as red and product shipped is not.</li>
    <li> I have had better ones.</li>
    <li> The heads up between Isers bent within three weeks. Rendering useless.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Worth the money. Thought they wouldn&#x27;t work well because they are so thin but I was wrong. Will never use any other.</li>
    <li> I had ordered a pair of Tweezerman tweezers to replace the slanted tip ones that I had had for several yrs.  They would not long grab the eyebrow&lt;br /&gt;hair.  I received these pointed tip tweezers by mistake, but kept them because I needed new tweezers.  I have been most pleased with these&lt;br /&gt;pointed tipped tweezers and have gotten to where I like them better than the slant tip.  They grab onto the tiniest little bit of eyebrow growth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!  Very easy to create a perfect shape with these and the hair never slips out.</li>
    <li> I like a really close shave. Often times, I have just a couple slightly visible hair around my lips after a morning shave, and I just can&#x27;t seem to get at it with a razor. Those times, the tweezers come out to finish the job. Question my manliness all you want, I just like a nice, clean, baby&#x27;s-butt-looking face when I step out in the mornings. Unfortunately, these hardly do the job. I figured they would perform better than the slant-edge ones for the smaller and/or ingrown hairs. This is not the case, and I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in my purchase. It has been demoted to emergency tweezers duty on hikes now. They redeemed themselves (if barely so) when they yanked a bee stinger from my back earlier this year. Otherwise, they just sit in my backpack, pretending to be functional.</li>
    <li> You never know when you will need a precise pair of tweezers. So be prepared!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are the best!</li>
    <li> I got the tweezers on time.  They were of good quality and work very well on small splinters.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought cheaper ones and they did not do the trick. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Great! The points match up well.</li>
    <li> Best point tweezers on the market. Perfect for taking out splinters. Not so great for tweezing eyebrows but there are other models for that.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s getting toward summer, I&#x27;ll just tell you how useful these tweezers are when someone gets an embedded tick or splinters.  These things are pointed and sharp and are for FINE work - so if you have shaky hands, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use these with a [[ASIN:B000GAVT7M Bausch &amp; Lomb Round Magnifier, 2x, 5-Inches]].  This magnifier has a small 1\\&quot; inset that&#x27;s 4x and you can pretty much see and pull out anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes quick work of splinters and even the kids want to watch through the magnifying glass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tweezerman products for a long time, but the tips on this one are not aligned properly, so it&#x27;s impossible to grip any eyebrow hair.  I tossed my old one when I ordered this - seems I was a bit premature. This tweezer will also be trashed and I&#x27;ll need to find something that works.</li>
    <li> Perfect for ingrown hairs or splinters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these tweezers for over 5 years.  I also have a pair of Tweezerman slanted and another brand in my cosmetics drawer.   These tweezers are fine for digging out ingrown hairs, but that&#x27;s it.  I find that no matter what type of hair (fine or course), and no matter what length these tweezers just won&#x27;t extract the hair period.   The course hairs break due to the sharpness, and the fine hairs can&#x27;t be grasped to extract.  I wind up digging out the ingrown hair and then using a different brand to pull it out.    The slanted Tweezerman does pretty much the same thing with less breakage.  However, if I have a gray hair it won&#x27;t pull it out at all.   The grays are more tenancious than the typical hair.    I&#x27;m not impressed with either type of Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Completely worth the price. The fine and precise point is perfect for targeting specific eyebrow hairs. I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is well made, with very precise handling for reaching anything, eyebrows, or splinters.    I have tried many brands, and these are the best.</li>
    <li> The only brand of Tweezers I would consider buying. Quality at it&#x27;s best. Besides using for facial applications they work well around the house when you need an extra hand for holding tiny items like nuts and bolts (glasses).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the picture, you aren&#x27;t getting a red tweezers like the picture shows.  I&#x27;d wanted the red to easily distinguish between all of my wife&#x27;s stainless eyebrow stuff and my splinter tweezers.  Got some ugly orange color instead.  Should have gotten a stainless and just saved the money!</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers. They are very sharp and work awesome. They are well worth the money. I only use this brand of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews and was anxious to get tweezers that actually remove hair.  I am very disappointed with these tweezers.  They only grasp thick, course hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all on fine eye brow hairs.  And, if you think you picked a specific color of tweezers, you&#x27;re wrong...  you get whatever they send.  I specifically picked the red pair and was sent orange, which included a lame note that you don&#x27;t get the color you ordered.  Bummed about this expensive tweezer purchase!</li>
    <li> Love Tweezerman pointy tweezers.  They seem to be the only tweezers that work for me.  So I love them, but I&#x27;m detracting a star because they are 1) very expensive, and 2) become all but useless if you happen to drop them on the bathroom floor.  For this reason (2), I have probably purchased at least 10 Tweezerman pointy tweezers over the last 10 years.  Not so great when they cost around $20 per pair.</li>
    <li> Sharp and these are perfect for the hard to get sliver or anything else, Great Tweezers will recommend to anyone to buy these.</li>
    <li> I just paid more and bought this tweezer and scissors(diff. purchase) bc only brand name.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this brand is something special and high qulity but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing special but more expensive. wont but tweezerman product anymore.</li>
    <li> best tweezers. the only thing is this used to come with a certificate that you purchased the tweezers and you send back the certificate and you get a free sharpening.. :/</li>
    <li> I tweeze my eyebrows regularly, and I bought this in hopes that I could use it to get out the tiny hairs that are difficult for my regular tweezer to snag onto.  Unfortunately this tweezer is just too pointy to snag/grip onto those small hairs, or maybe it is just hard for me to use.  I did find this useful for getting a splinter out of my foot though, so it will come in good use for those types of issues.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes good products and I heartily recommend these to anyone needing a superfine point. I keep one with my sewing tools for careful ripping as well as one by the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> this are friggin awesome!  Not sure what else to say about them, they work perfect.  I almost considered getting a pair for my brother as a gift, but I thought &amp;#34;how weird is it to give a guy tweezers?!?!?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these, no need to get the flat ones. this pointed ones are awesome for tugging individual hairs or splinters.  Well made, will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Mine are pink and I have had them for over five years.  I am very careful to not drop them or set them down too hard, so that the points stay aligned.  At some point, I will send them in to Tweezerman to have the points realigned, but I will have to get a replacement pair to use in the meantime.  I tried using the yellow ones for ingrown hair, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as good.    What I like best about these is that it is possible to grab one hair, and that I can catch the tiny, almost invisible hairs without grabbing skin, too.    When I originally purchased these, it was for post-surgical wound debridement (along with a scalpel) on a delicate skin graft. There is no way that any other tweezers (or needle-type forceps) could have done the job.  After that experience, I will probably never use any other kind, except possibly for the all-stainless ones, which could be autoclaved.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best.  Lost one pair and reordered because I enjoyed them so much.  These are a great pair.</li>
    <li> This product was very difficult to use.  Didn&#x27;t really grab anything.  Or at least it didn&#x27;t easily work for me.</li>
    <li> These were my first \\&quot;fine point\\&quot; tweezers, and I&#x27;m not that impressed.  I&#x27;ve had better tweezers that grab the hair more easily.  They&#x27;re great for ingrown hairs though.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs! That is... those  hairs these tweezers actually can grip. Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m flabbergasted. I keep reading about how wonderful they are... well, not for me. I have about six &amp;#34;granny hairs&amp;#34; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout. I&#x27;m NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those, too. Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners. THAT is the best tweezer I ever used. It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1397325896&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;revlon+tweezer</li>
    <li> Works better than any other tweezer I have ever owned.  It should come in a leather case to prevent loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these tweezers for over 20 years, and I love them.</li>
    <li> A real challenge to secure a hair for removal with these tweezers. Very tiny area in the tweezers tip that must be used or the hair slips through. Once you have it secured, works great. However, I&#x27;ve spent way too much time trying to find that magic zone of precision in the tip.</li>
    <li> Great tweezer but pricy</li>
    <li> I use only Tweezerman</li>
    <li> I LOVE ALL TWEEZERMAN PRODUCTS!!! I have been buying this brand of tweezers for over 30 years and they really work well and last long. My multiple purchases have come because I keep dropping the tweezers on their nose and bending the tips. I highly recommend all Tweezerman products!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They work better then most tweezers. I have thick hair and I get a lot of ingrown hairs on my face and these really help without&lt;br /&gt;making too much of a mess out of the removal.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ground to an extremely fine point, so they&#x27;re good if you need to puncture something. BUT they tend to loose their &#x27;edge&#x27; after a while. Also, i you drop them, the points WILL bend and become useless. The company will re-sharpen them for free, but you need to pay postage.</li>
    <li> These are the best Tweezers ever!!  I have owned several pairs over the years and they are definitely worth the money.  I would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> These guys are dangerous. You think you&#x27;re going to pluck that stupid chin hair and all of the sudden your armpit has flared up because you&#x27;ve picked at ingrown hairs that didn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for getting splinters, too!</li>
    <li> Beware of stabbing yourself! These things are actually sharp! I like them but you have to be careful because they easily slip under your skin without much effort. I do like them though.</li>
    <li> These have been worthless for me for tweezing hair.  Because the points are so minimal, you have to be very precise and at the right angle with a magnifying mirror to ensure you are capturing the strand of hair you are trying to tweeze. I simply don&#x27;t have the patience or time for using them.  I will say that when the jets on a dishwasher get clogged, these are great for inserting into the jets and pulling out food particles that are blocking the jets.  Because these are marketed for tweezing and not cleaning dishwasher jets, I have given them a rating of one star.</li>
    <li> There are no better tweezers than Tweezerman. Precision ground by real human beings, you can be assured the tweezers will catch onto the finest, thinnest hair you focus your obsessive-compulsive attention onto. Hooray!</li>
    <li> Nice tweezers.  Able to pluck even very thing hairs.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price, they are the best tweezers on the market. They are very precise and gets even the shortest hair. I couldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this one. It gets very tiny hairs out. Before I had to walk around until I could pull them out with regular ones but this one does the job very well! I love it.  I never had a tweezer that did such a nice job and left me no frustration with tiny hairs that I can&#x27;t get out :)</li>
    <li> The best tweezers in the world!!  Sharp point and last forever!!!!!  Edit 1/18/17 Last forever unless you drop them on ceramic tile :(</li>
    <li> Terrific tweezers as they will be able to get out even the most stubborn splinters. These have a very sharp point. I would keep the little plastic cap on them while not in use. Good buy!</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, but effective.</li>
    <li> My tweezers arrived early!!! And I immediately put them to work: holding tiny 1mm or smaller screws and electrical components :) They work perfectly, and have a nice \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel. I especially appreciate the tip cover that came with them, as I immediately dropped them when opening the package (Yeah, I&#x27;m smooth like that).&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had a pair for years but dropped them (point first) on tiles. Sadly the tip was ruined. These were the replacement and are true to form! Won&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is a great line, and these pointy, precise tweezers are my favorite Tweezerman product.  You may think they are pricey, and yeah, you&#x27;re right,  but how many cheap tweezers have you bought over the years that didn&#x27;t work out?  You know, when you grab the hair with the tweezers, pull, and the tweezers just slide along the hair,  not pulling it out at all.  Frustrated,  you attempt it again, with the same results. It makes the whole tweezing experience frustrating and worse,  your eyebrows look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally had enough of that about 10 years ago and bought a nice pair of Tweezerman tweezers exactly like these ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have had to replace them except that I&#x27;ve lost a few when my girlfriends see them and like them so much that I end up giving them away and ordering new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are worth it, so spend a little bit on some high quality Tweezerman tweezers like these. You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
    <li> These are so awesome, my mom and boyfriend keep &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; them and I keep ordering more!  I had one pair for 5 years and it still tweezed perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very pointy though, so if you&#x27;re clumsy, I would suggest a rounded tip.</li>
    <li> Had a pair of these for years and lost them. The brand I had were called eurotweez made in Italy. These are identical and you can literally do surgery with them Excellent!</li>
    <li> Packaging was old and a little beat up, but product was acceptable.</li>
    <li> I have had to send the product back to be sharpened because it didn&#x27;t tweeze tightly.  Once it was sharpened, it only worked effectively for a short  time before the problem reoccurred.</li>
    <li> These babies do the job, consistently.   They hold up well, especially if not dropped on the tips too often.  And you can always send them back for a free sharpening when they eventually lose their precision grip. They really grab those hard to hold fine and short sprouts that others can&#x27;t handle. Even ingrown hairs. I just won&#x27;t bother with any other brands anymore.  My local CVS can&#x27;t keep &#x27;em in stock, so thank goodness for Amazon.  They are a little more expensive in the short run, but I save in the long run for how long they hold up and work so well.</li>
    <li> You will never buy another brand after using this one.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Looove these they are so precise.  I bought these and the slanted ones and they are both as great as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;They both serve my purpose and when the slanted ones can&#x27;t get a fine chin hair I want gone the pointed one&#x27;s do.  I expect them both to be my last purchase of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are perfect for eyebrows. Grabs even the finest hairs. Great for removing slivers also.  Didn&#x27;t think I would find one after loosing my favorite but this is it.</li>
    <li> Nice high quality tweezers for a price. Great to have this when you need to do something with precision.</li>
    <li> I really prefer the slant tweezers, but given the outstanding quality of the slant tweezers, I&#x27;m sure these are perfect for some application that I&#x27;m just not using them for. My wife uses them to dig out ingrown hairs, and I suppose I could use them to dig metal and glass slivers out of my skin, but I usually just use a razor blade for that.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever made, Period! A must have for any bathroom/medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> Good quality...very precise and sharp ... I would buy again . It&#x27;s worth the extra money in my opinion. Good luck</li>
    <li> As always these are the very best tweezers. A professional recommended these to me. The very sharp point is necessary to effectively tweeze stubborn hairs. Extremely quick ship too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the tweezer yet but right out of the package I&#x27;m disappointed. Not only is it not red, it isn&#x27;t any \\&quot;assorted color\\&quot; at all.  Of all the tweezerman tweezers offered on Amazon I chose this one for its color, and even upon re-reading the description closely I did not see it stated anywhere that a color (or plain) will be chosen for you. And the description does state that the tweezer has a baked enamel finish - well, not the one I got. It came in a little purple case, but the tweezer itself is just stainless.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tweezers and have been using tweezerman for 15-20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t drop them! The tips bend very easily ---- but if you do, for $5.00 the company will resharpen them for you, making them as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside with purchasing on Amazon is that you have no clue what color tweezers you&#x27;re receiving.  I&#x27;d like to know and have the ability to choose a color.  Ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter, but I&#x27;d appreciate the consideration.</li>
    <li> Two years ago I had eyelid surgery. This was sucessful, but because they had to cut through the edge of my eyelid and sew it back together I have several eyelashes that will grow IN to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are VERY tiny, almost transparent, and only a few mm long. They are almost impossible to see, much less pluck. I have used a number of different tweezers and a flashlight to find and remove them. Recently, I became very frustrated as they have now become so fine they would slip through my other best tweezers. I couldnt pluck them. So I suffered for a few days and ordered the tweezerman reviewed here. Once it came it took me literally 30 seconds to pluck the two offending lashes. I had spend HOURS with my other best pair trying to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of buying lab-quality $40 tweezers, I think these are really great. Definitely a precision instrument. And the price is right! Just be careful, these are SHARP!</li>
    <li> If you need a tweezer, buy a Tweezerman. No substitutes apply. Not only are they the best, they come with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great. Able to pull short and long eye brow hairs.  I definitely recommend this product. A must have.</li>
    <li> I have used Tweezerman products for years (over 20).  I recently had to replace a pair of point Tweezermans taken from me by airport security.  How sad!  The tweezers I needed to replace had been purchased only three or four years ago. Anyhow I sent off for these, and they don&#x27;t do what the old pair did.  Not even close. They are hit and miss on pulling hairs out. On closer inspection to see why this might be the case, I noticed only the tiniest part of the tip actually makes contact when the tweezer is closed.  Less than one millimeter at the very tip actually makes metal to metal contact.  On my old pair the whole tip came in contact very nicely when the tool was closed (I refer to the unpainted metal part as being the whole tip)  They pulled out anything every time.  I am very disappointed at how this replacement works.  It is extremely hard to be sure the hair is positioned at just the right spot to make contact.  What is up with this new tip design?  After a getting a Tweezerman product that didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, I noticed what some of the negative reviews here are saying about new manufacturing changes.  It appears Tweezerman is a different company than it used to be!  What a real surprise that is.  I have associated that name with guaranteed quality for so long, and now how will I replace the quality product that I lost? If you know a product that has the quality of the old Tweezerman point tweezer please leave a comment telling me about it.  If you are looking for a good gripping point tweezer, save your money, this is no longer it.</li>
    <li> I agree with other posters that the quality isn&#x27;t as good as some I&#x27;d bought.  N</li>
    <li> pluck this! works great!</li>
    <li> I finally found a tweezer that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I was so afraid they would stop making them that I ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> I meant to buy the slant-tip tweezer, but I&#x27;m a moron and bought these by accident.  That said, they do work well for things that don&#x27;t require a slant-tip tweezer, and the Tweezerman brand is SUCH a good brand that I know they&#x27;re going to work reliably for many years, like my other Tweezerman tweezers have.  They&#x27;re strong, durable, and the tip is so precise that you really can&#x27;t help but grab/poke exactly what you&#x27;re targeting.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers money can buy for the DYI eyebrow shaper! These work great and the company stands by their product!</li>
    <li> Nothing like Tweezerman tweezers.  I have used them for years.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Tweezer point does not pull any hair or splinters out because tips do not line up.</li>
    <li> Only kind of tweezers that work for me.</li>
    <li> This little piece of tool works wonders on little tiny splinters to get. Shipment is really fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers after my darling husband decided to use my favorite pair as a tool to pry a SIM card from his phone.  I am so lucky to be one of those women who gets a stray hair or two (or dozen) on my chin, and they are often difficult to tweeze.  These tweezers make me wonder why I didn&#x27;t encourage my husband to break my old pair sooner.  They are super sharp and precise.  I don&#x27;t even need to use the 8X side of my beauty mirror to get those pesky little hairs.  Although the instructions tell you how to increase the tension, I have found the tension to be perfect without adjustment.  My brows have seriously never looked better.  They are so much fun to use that I had to make myself put them away before I wound up needing to purchase an eyebrow liner to draw new brows on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion for an improvement would be to include a small case for the tweezers.  A small velvet bag or a plastic sleeve would be perfect.  The small little plastic tube that covers just the points on the tweezers is going to get lost in my toiletry drawer without fail.  I give it 5 days before I&#x27;m cursing because I&#x27;ve stabbed myself while fishing around for my favorite lipstick.  Small price to pay for these sharp little beauties!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever. They have a lifetime sharpening available through the mail which is great and if they cannot sharpen them correctly, they will send you a 50% off coupon for a new pair on the website. Great product and great support. The only brand I will use anymore.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab fine hairs, tip doesn&#x27;t line up for long. Stick with Revlon Ultimate fine point tweezers. Work great for years (and cheaper).</li>
    <li> I really like Tweezerman products and have bought them as gifts several times.  This bright red tweezer was exactly what I wanted for precision tweezing, including the all-important removal of splinters.  That needle-fine tip to the blades and the way they meet exactly tip to tip is just what you want in a tool like this.  I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely buy more of these for friends and family.</li>
