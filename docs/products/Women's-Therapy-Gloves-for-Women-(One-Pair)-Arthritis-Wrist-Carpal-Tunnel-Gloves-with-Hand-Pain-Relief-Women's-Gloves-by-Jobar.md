      <li>LOVE THEM.  </li>

      <li>and they love them</li>
      <li>They are snug fitting and therefore ease the pain in my hands.  </li>
      <li>but they should say one size fit most.</li>
      <li>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE INCLUDED.</li>
      <li>Love the snuggie fit.  </li>
      <li>I wish they imobilized the wrist more but still very useful.</li>
      <li>These ripped the very first time I put them on!  </li>
      <li>They are too light weight.  </li>
      <li>The gloves are advertised as one size fit all</li>
      <li>Almost the closest I can get to pain free even if I have to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>These gloves may be good for someone else, but I purchased them for my 86 year old mother</li>
      <li>These work instantly and remarkably well.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t think someone with a medium or large hand could fit in these gloves.</li>

      <li>They fit very snug.</li>
      <li>Made a blister between my middle finger and ring finger; liked the compression, however.</li>
      <li>I did alot of research and am convinced that I have something rare maybe.</li>
      <li>I gave them two stars instead of one just because they look like they could actually be useful if you can put them on...or perhaps order the men&#x27;s size.</li>
      <li>Not only makes it easier for me to use my hands but  keeps them warm at the same time  love them</li>
      <li>The more they are washed &amp; dried, the more they will relax.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stretch very much.</li>
      <li>These gloves work VERY well!  </li>
      <li>What I do is put them on the open and close my hands and the pain gets alittle better to deal with.</li>
      <li>These gloves would hardly fit a five year old</li>
      <li>They seem to be made from great fabric and should last a long time</li>
      <li>I also like to wear them while driving to avoid pain in the first place.</li>
      <li>Great, but too small!</li>
      <li>I ordered these before and this time the fit is a little tighter, but its ok</li>
      <li>I wanted these for my daughter, since I had a similar pair from years ago, and she was so excited!  </li>

      <li>These are the exact opposite of comfortable and they are supposed to ease arthritis or carpal tunnel - not make your condition worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have large hands.</li>
      <li>I thought the description said large.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using these gloves for over a decade now for pain &amp; swelling in my fingers.  They DO run small and are a bit stiff when you first get them.  I always wash them before wearing and add fabric softener to the rinse.  I dry them in the dryer on low that first time.  After that, I wash them in the regular load and then let them air dry.  The more they are washed &amp; dried, the more they will relax. They are great for swelling compression and they keep the joints warm.  I have been wearing this one pair for about two years now and they are still in good shape!  If they run too small, try the men&#x27;s gloves...I have long, skinny fingers so this has not been a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Unless you have hands the size of a 10 year old child, these gloves will not fit. &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; is an untruth.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is they cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> Fits left hand fine, right hand it hurts where the gloves are sewn on the middle &amp; ring fingers. I also cannot secure the wrist straps, they are too small. Ironic thing to this whole thing is I have room to put other fingers in finger holes, but how the glove is sewn is off and is what&#x27;s causing them to result in more pain when wearing.</li>
    <li> The gloves are advertised as one size fit all but they should say one size fit most. They were so tall and appear to be made for children and not women.</li>
    <li> Yes, they were delivered in two days and I am a repeat purchaser.  I love them I wear them three seasons.</li>
    <li> I have a neck injury with nerve damage that extends into my hands. I have an office job so my hands and wrists always hurt. This was too tight and I am tiny. Couldn&#x27;t type with these on.</li>
    <li> to small does&#x27; work for me</li>
    <li> They are really tight and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> For very small hands. I wear size 5 shoe ...so the small are for like a 9-11 year old kid but they&#x27;re the greatest</li>
    <li> Great pair of gloves..they are tight, like intended.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and she has not stopped raving about them since the moment she put them on.</li>
    <li> These only have two size options, and I apparently chose the wrong one.  They are so tight that they cause tingling.  The workmanship seems fine, although I think velcro is a stupid thing to put on a a fabric that will snag.</li>
    <li> These gloves are way too small for me to get my hands in.  Were they for midgets or children or something?  Have I ordered the wrong ones?  The gloves I got are just TINY and useless to me.  Sorry for a bad review..but it is honest.</li>
    <li> This item I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am a small person and even these gloves are super tight. I found no use for them other than they are super tight and once you \\&quot;wear them\\&quot; then they are unreturnable.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in both my fingers and wrists.  Without these gloves, I would be unable to do the yard work I love.  My daughter uses these-said they were really good for the hands (she has arthritis also).  I agree with her wholeheartedly.  These are fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Excellent compression, but this makes removing them very difficult, especially if your hands hurt.</li>
    <li> These are way to tight, and my wife has small hands.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of  money.</li>
    <li> It supports and keeps my hands warm.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> Hated that they were way too small. I know they are supposed to be a tight fit but not so tight that they cut off circulation.</li>
    <li> These are too tight, they cut off circulation to my fingers.</li>
    <li> they are well made and they are nice ones ...but they run small in size.....  if you have very small hand they glove would work good.....</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all. These run very small. Shipment was delivered fast though.</li>
    <li> These gloves may be good for someone else, but I purchased them for my 86 year old mother and she didn&#x27;t have the strength to pull these on. Service was very good. So for people with a little more hand strength these may be good.</li>
    <li> The only person in my family who could get these gloves on is my 9-year-old grandson! They certainly don&#x27;t fit me! The material they are made of is quite thick, with seams on the outside in front and back of the fingers and I think that if you could get them on they would be most uncomfortable. The price was small, so it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the bother of returning them. The company said they were a good seller, but I bet people don&#x27;t buy them a second time!</li>
    <li> Gloves really make my hands feel better.  I wish the fingers were alittle longer like the thumb is because all the knuckles in my fingers hurt but good gloves anyway.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and they help so I&#x27;m afraid to try anything else.</li>
    <li> The one size fits all was about 4 sizes to small.</li>
    <li> Way to small,  i have small hands and i can&#x27;t wear these,  to much trouble to return.</li>
    <li> Way to small.I couldn&#x27;t get them over my fingers.I have small/medium womans hands and couldn&#x27;t get them over my finger. I guess them not posting a size should have been a warning sign.Don&#x27;t buy these unless you have super tiny hands</li>
    <li> Great Woman Therapy Glove</li>
    <li> These gloves work VERY well!  Was experiencing some signs of carpul tunnel, and having my fingers fall asleep.  On bad days, I can wear these for a few hours, and the compression they provide helps for hours!</li>
    <li> I would have preferred to know the size range.  The package says \\&quot;One size fits all\\&quot;  They were too small, very snug.  I hope they will loosen up some.  I thought the description said large.</li>
    <li> I had another pair but I use the other one so much I decided to buy another pair so I can wash one and I have another to wear.  It helps with my arthritis and carpal tunnel.  I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chela Huss</li>
    <li> size is very small  and not what I expected</li>
    <li> Glove seams separated after 1st washing and became unusable. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> These are great but they are too tight and I have average to small hands. I think they should be a tad bigger.</li>
    <li> These are for baby hands,I I wasted my time and money buying this</li>
    <li> Had wrist surgery in the summer.  The gloves are helping to loosen my stiff joints and the warmth is helping circulation.</li>
    <li> I have been to a hand specialist that could not tell me why my hand was is so much pain without an injury. Test for arthritis and what I thought strongly was carpal tunnel came back negative. I did alot of research and am convinced that I have something rare maybe. I found this product out of desperation for a remedy. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because the glove felt too tight but I&#x27;ve had it for a month &amp; have had great results. Almost the closest I can get to pain free even if I have to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> These work instantly and remarkably well. Use them for typing and driving a lot. I have given these as gifts and has always been appreciated.</li>
    <li> They fit a little tight but they do the job if you have pain in your hands</li>
    <li> It is too tight and make my hands numb. I think it should be a little bit lose and different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> Note that they do run small.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me. I bought a large and it&#x27;s still too tight on my hand can&#x27;t wear it for very long before it cuts off my circulation. Also hardcover off.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not for me used it couple of times then put in the drawer...never use it again maybe if it&#x27;s for me I could utilize it and rate it</li>
    <li> Theses have been a help for me I love them and will not give them up. I am able to type better because of them.</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all. Too small for me to even wear. So not worth it!</li>
    <li> Secure and comfortable!! I wear them when I am sleeping and my hands feel great in the morning!!! Give them a try and help to revive your tired hands!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM.  Love the snuggie fit.  They are warm.  Still a bit hard to type in but getting used to them.  A little icy heat and snuggie glove to bed is also a nice feeling.</li>
    <li> What a complete waste of money! These gloves are the cheapest, Made in China pieces of junk that I have ever bought. The material is thin and the workmanship is very shoddy. They will only fit women with very small hands. The velcro closure is very uneven and there is a rough, jagged edge along this area that scratches the skin. These are the exact opposite of comfortable and they are supposed to ease arthritis or carpal tunnel - not make your condition worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, while I was supposed to pay $3.59 for these on clearance, I was charged $11.99 and had to fight tooth and nail for a month to get a refund for the difference. This took six emails and three phone calls  ... and I finally received a refund check. Only for these crappy gloves to wind up in the garbage after trying them for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> one size does not fit all.</li>
    <li> But they run small.  Order one size up.  Usually a small fits me.  These are so tight my hands throb!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have small hands, but still too tight</li>
    <li> They Help a lot made of good materials</li>
    <li> I typically wear a women&#x27;s medium glove. I couldn&#x27;t begin to get these on my hands. My 10 year old niece struggled to get them on. I gave them two stars instead of one just because they look like they could actually be useful if you can put them on...or perhaps order the men&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> These are the best things that I have found for my very arthritic hands. I got a pair from my husband years ago and they&#x27;ve just now started wearing out. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon and so cheap. I bought tow more pair only because they are not available locally and the only place I could find them was on Amazon. I&#x27;m set for at least ten more years :)</li>
    <li> Not a good fit.. Should have returned</li>
    <li> The reason I did not give them a 5 star review is because of the one size fits all.  One size fits all does not quite live up to that.  I have small hand, I buy my gloves and hats in the kid section of stores for the ladies gloves and hats are to big for me.  So I would say if you have large or medium hands do not buy these.  They were just right for my hands just tight enough  but not so tight they cut off blood flow but very comfortable and really made my hands feel good and cut down the pain in them to nothing.  So yes do buy them for smaller hands and you get a good set of gloves at a great price!</li>
    <li> Shiping was fast and product was exactly as requested</li>
    <li> I have carpal tunnel in my right hand and its mainly around my knuckles were it hurts so I thought that these gloves would be good for that since they cover that part. All these gloves are are heat trappers and thats it. they dont even trap heat that well. Not worth it unless you need them to shade you from sun and thats it.</li>
    <li> these gloves run way too small, ended up giving them to my mom</li>
    <li> These gloves did what I needed them to do.  Very comfortable.  I wear them at night and my hands are not near as stiff in the morning, as they had been.</li>
    <li> I had originally bought these for my mom to help her wrists, but when she tried to put them on, they were just too small. So we tried on everyone else in the house and nobody could fit into them including my younger sister. I wish they would come in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> I like it and it seems working for me.  I&#x27;ve only worn it for four days now.  Great products.  They arrived on expected date.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I lovet it. works great.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I am a massage therapist and usually have aching hands at the end of the day. So, I found this product and decided to give it a try. Oh my goodness! It works great! I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with pain in their hands, wrists, and fingers!</li>
    <li> Bought for a wheelchair bound person who needed to have them to prevent blisters on her hands. They look good and hopefully will wear well.</li>
    <li> They run to small. I but them for a friend who is a teacher and she needs to write a lot and with the arthritis is having a lot of trouble but she gave them back to me because it can not fit her. I will try them myself</li>
    <li> There just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> very small---returning</li>
    <li> I have very small hands.  These gloves are extremely hard to get on and off.  You can&#x27;t bend your fingers and they actually hurt because they are so small.  No choice of size was offered which is a mistake.  I have no idea if they work or not as they were so painful I couldn&#x27;t leave them on.</li>
    <li> The gloves are ridiculously tight when you get them so you have to squeeze into them and wear them for only as long as you can stand it at first.  They are compression gloves and they help so much with pain and swelling.  I wear them when I sleep. They do eventually loosen up too much with use and washing so you will need to buy another. I use the old pair to wear while walking in the cold. Keeps hands warm and still can use fingers to use phone, etc.</li>
    <li> they were too small for my hands but worked pretty well didn&#x27;t want to sing like that TI 45 so I sold them to somebody else let my other hand and they love them</li>
    <li> Seems to be made good, however, they are to small. I can&#x27;t wear them. Very disappointed. They are not very big for a ladies size.</li>
    <li> I wanted these for my daughter, since I had a similar pair from years ago, and she was so excited!  She wears them constantly for her carpal tunnel and fibromyalgia.</li>
    <li> When I wear these overnight I wake up in the morning with rested wrists and thumbs. I also like to wear them while driving to avoid pain in the first place.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it to tight and made my hands red. I&#x27;m returning them</li>
    <li> I found these gloves cumbersome and hard to move my fingers. I do not recommend it. Better are the Imak gloves. Ended up giving these away.</li>
    <li> I have relatively small hands. These therapy gloves are pretty tight. I had a hard time getting them off. Unfortunately they are too uncomfortable for me to wear. I would suggest buying a different pair. They seem to be made from great fabric and should last a long time but they are definately for very slim hands.</li>
    <li> Shipped well. Too small</li>
    <li> I love this! really relieve pain</li>
    <li> really didn&#x27;t solve the problem</li>
    <li> The product was what I  have used  for my  arthritis  for a long time. but could not get my hands in gloves. I have used Jobar for many years. This is first time they were too small. I would like to return them. Found out since then that Medicare may cover them on my insurance. Please tell me how to return. Thank you  Linda Odom</li>
    <li> Gloves was to little didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted .</li>
    <li> they fit tight at first and feel a little small. (I am short but have stubby hands) However after a few uses, washes they fit fine and do their job. Great for carpal - I type a lot but note, don&#x27;t wear over night just for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I ordered these gloves to give relief to my sore aching arthritic fingers and wrists.  The gloves are so small, however, that it is not worth the pain of trying to put them on.  There is no benefit from these gloves as I can&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> These gloves are NOT theraputic, they are simply spandex gloves that do not do anything.  There is no benefit to anyone.</li>
    <li> I rate this purchase far down on my radar.  It is being advertised as &amp;#34;one size fits all.&amp;#34;  Not True.  I found that the gloves were enterely too tight and pulled between the fingers and the thumb.  So &amp;#34;one size does not fit all.&amp;#34;  Recommend going with the men&#x27;s gloves if you are searching for a larger women&#x27;s glove. I tried to return it but was unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> Very small.  Hard to put on.</li>
    <li> These gloves work great.  They are snug fitting and therefore ease the pain in my hands.  I really like the ends of my fingers being exposed helping me do things without taking them off.</li>
    <li> Made a blister between my middle finger and ring finger; liked the compression, however.</li>
    <li> The glove said 1 size fix all but that is wrong it was to small</li>
    <li> I have 3-1/2&amp;#34; palm at the nuckles these were way to small. My finger tips turned blue. Wished they worked</li>
    <li> For the time I can wear them, they do lessen the pain in my hands. However, they bind my hands in between the fingers and I have to take them off.</li>
    <li> I feel very fashionable at the gym when I wear my therapy gloves.  I can exercise, turn the page of my Kindle, drink from my water bottle; these gloves are very flexible.  Not only do the gloves help my arthritic joints, the gloves also support my wrists.</li>
    <li> Good to keep your hands</li>
    <li> Love these. They warm my hands and help with the aches and pains of my arthritis and carpel tunal as well. I use them any time I am really hurting in my fingers and or wrists.</li>
    <li> Maybe their OK but very very small????. No selection difference. I guess good material. My wife couldn&#x27;t use them at all. Guess I&#x27;ll order her a men&#x27;s pair. Have opened the package so don&#x27;t think I can exchange them.</li>
    <li> I am a paraplegic with both hands suffering from carpal tunnel and bone on bone arthritics  in both thumbs. Of course, I have to use my hands for everything and these gloves are  great. They are comfortable and  they work! I wish I had seen them  before having the carpal tunnel surgery that did&#x27;t help at all. I would highly recommend these gloves for anyone who is suffering.</li>
    <li> Not only makes it easier for me to use my hands but  keeps them warm at the same time  love them</li>
    <li> exceptional very pleased</li>
    <li> So far not feeling they are helping me much : (</li>
    <li> It was want I ordered</li>
    <li> So very small could not get them on. Total waste of money. Must be made for children.</li>
    <li> I even wore it like a bowling glove.  It helped me bowl a 143 which allowed my team to beat my grandson,s team.</li>
    <li> Stay away from these gloves unless you are a hobbit. They are WAY TO SMALL and cut off my circulation. Also the threads around the Velcro aew already unraveling after just trying them on once. This was a huge waste of money and hope. I an disabled with very bad arthritis and was really hoping these would help my hand/wrist/finger pain.</li>
    <li> You want a review, don&#x27;t buy this item!!!!!!  Not only does this item not work they make the problem worse. I can&#x27;t believe this product is even allowed to be on the market!!!!</li>
    <li> too tight one size do not fit all.</li>
    <li> The pair I received were too tight...You should have a size choice!!</li>
    <li> They were too small, my 10 year old grandson is wearing now. One size fits all, not very accurate.</li>
    <li> too small, not expect like this</li>
    <li> the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; advertised for women; wouldn&#x27;t fir a ten year old girl. I really needed the help with arthritis and carple tunnel condition. The gloves didn&#x27;t reach my palm.</li>
    <li> These ripped the very first time I put them on!  So disappointed.  I would not recommend these at all and wish I had never purchased.</li>
    <li> I purchase this Item because I have bad Arthritis and Triger Fingers and typing all day doesn&#x27;t help.  The product is made of a tight spong like material which absorbs the sweet and it does help my fingers out. I have little skinny hands and I can&#x27;t keep them on for long periods of time because they fit to tight and the holes for the finger are tight  If you don&#x27;t mind the tightness then I recommend.  It has been working on my triger fingers.  What I do is put them on the open and close my hands and the pain gets alittle better to deal with.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a lady whose hands are knotted and twisted from arthritis. She returned them to me because she couldn&#x27;t even begin to get them on. I tried them and agree (and I have small hands).</li>
    <li> It is extremely small!! I had to returne it</li>
    <li> To small one size dont fix all</li>
    <li> They are too light weight.  They do not give enough support and they smell awful.  They are really very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Gloves are too small, I can&#x27;t get my hand inside. I return them and waited to get money back.</li>
    <li> These gloves were extremely small.  My young child niece couldn&#x27;t  even get her small hands in them comfortably.  Do not recommend these gloves for even an average size hand.  A better glove is the Thermoskin Premium Arthritic Glove.  These are the gloves I used as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I just received these gloves.  However, I cannot use these gloves because they are so small that they don&#x27;t even begin to go on my hands.  Actually my hand hurts much worse by just trying to get it on.  No &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; whatsoever.  I know they are supposed to be &amp;#34;compression&amp;#34; but you have to get them on before that part can work.  I&#x27;ll try to see if there is someone I know with much smaller hands  that could use them. . . would cost me more to return than what I paid for them, but they are of no use to me.  For products such as this, obviously &amp;#34;one size does NOT fit all&amp;#34;.  Maybe they are measured on the smaller Chinese hands.  I hope others with &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; hands will think twice before buying them.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use these at night and sometimes when I paint. I can tell my hands when relaxed want to start curling like and old lady&#x27;s hands. Got to fit it! I&#x27;m hoping these will help!</li>
    <li> These gloves should be sized. They were a struggle to get on. I have large hands. They were a little short for my hand but I could see where, if they fit properly, they would be a rewally big help when on the computer. I do like the idea and I do wear them occasionally.</li>
    <li> It has been very hot here and I do not have a air conditioner in our bedroom, so I have not worn these yet.</li>
    <li> Insulated, helps keep your hand warm.</li>
    <li> Although they were advertised as one size fits all and seem to work if you could get them on with help, you could not get them on without help.  Accordingly, I have to find another pair because I live by myself..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for a little while but for long term doesn&#x27;t work.  Wearing it with rings doesn&#x27;t work either. Thank you</li>
    <li> Women&#x27;s ONE SIZE FITS ALL, Were TOO SMALL!&lt;br /&gt;A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE INCLUDED. Product runs SMALL. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the gloves fit perfectly fine, but the stitching came undone after around a days worth of use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I got these gloves b4 they were a thicker material &amp; I got the women&#x27;s size.  This time the gloves are a lot thiner and very hard to get on--would order the men&#x27;s size in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife, but they are no good for her because they are way too small.  I agree with other reviews that complain about the tiny size.  I cannot recommend these for normal sized women.  Midgets shop here!</li>
    <li> had to return was too tight.</li>
    <li> Fit is terrible...too tight...and I have very small hands</li>
    <li> I use these mostly when driving for hand and wrist pain.  I wish they imobilized the wrist more but still very useful.</li>
    <li> Great, but too small!</li>
    <li> They are a little tighter than the previous pair I purchased from another Company.  I have a small hand.  I don&#x27;t think someone with a medium or large hand could fit in these gloves. I purchased the gloves because the price was lower.</li>
    <li> Its small, not fit. I hope its bigger a little.</li>
    <li> Be careful buying these.  They run very small.  For me, it was $7.99 down the drain because if I returned them, I would have had to reimburse the company for shipping them to me plus pay the cost of shipping them back!  Maybe, I can donate them to a &amp;#34;child&amp;#34; in need of &amp;#34;therapeutic gloves.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These are for people with very small hands. They fit very snug. So tight they caused me pain after about 5 minutes. Will have to return them.</li>
    <li> I love these. I wear them when its cold. It helps keep hands warm and for old Arthur. I bought these for my friends who suffur. They love them.</li>
    <li> The gloves were a gift for my sister. She couldn&#x27;t get them on, they were so small. I tried them &amp;  couldn&#x27;t even get them on &amp; I have small hands. They look like a child&#x27;s size. They don&#x27;t stretch very much. I will have to return them. I didn&#x27;t see where you have to pick a size. I used to have the same gloves years ago, but I lost them. They were the same brand, but were thicker &amp; would fit almost any hand. I am very disappointed in these I just received.</li>
    <li> these work well for people with arthritis!!  awesome!</li>
    <li> Want return item for refund item is to small for wife hands</li>
    <li> These are one size fits all. Although I have small hands, I have to wiggle them on and off because my conditions weakens my ability to pull. The first ones I bought were sized and they worked great but I lost one so these will work as a substitute.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this product.  The one size fits all works if your hands are the size of a five year old.  the gloves are tiny.  I have small hands, I wear a size five or size six glove and these gloves are too small for me. Further the gloves caused my hands to swell and become numb.</li>
    <li> Gloves say one size fits all woman. These gloves would hardly fit a five year old</li>
    <li> These gloves are great mom wears them on her arthritic hands.  Only thing is that they need to have a small slit in the fingers if you wear a ring or they hurt.  Made the slit and they are perfect.  the did not fray at all.</li>
    <li> These gloves absolutely suited my needs.  They do run small, but I have very small hands, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.  I needed the compression gloves to sleep in at night, because I clench my hands and fingers into fists and wake up with pain every morning.  These gloves have helped to alleviate that pain.</li>
    <li> I ordered these before and this time the fit is a little tighter, but its ok</li>
    <li> nice but run very small</li>
    <li> This helped with pain :-)</li>
