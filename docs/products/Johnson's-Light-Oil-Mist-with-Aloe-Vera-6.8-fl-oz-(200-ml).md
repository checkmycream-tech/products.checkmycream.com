      <li>The smell is good, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still oil and feels like oil.  </li>
      <li>The product is very good as the oil is nice and light but the spray nozzle can be improved.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The added advantage is that my itchy winter skin has been banished in favor of a light, pleasant scent.</li>

      <li>Works great, very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and it smell nice.</li>
      <li>pedicure from chipping and skin smooth &amp; silky!</li>
      <li>This is nice and light.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love It</li>
      <li>a trigger would work much better.  </li>
      <li>not to mention there is no sort of seal on the top</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a nice, light oil mist that would absorb into my skin.</li>
      <li>you will love it too.</li>
      <li>I would just say it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this product I just bought a pack of six.</li>
      <li>Smell is light which is nice because I suffer from migraines and was worried about too strong a smell.  </li>
      <li>This spray mist is light enough, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells wonderful after hours.  </li>
      <li>I felt sweaty more than comfortable and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Well, its easy to use</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this product is for the spray, which I thought would be easy to use after showering.</li>
      <li>I got everything else in my order very quickly.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t sting or burn, went on easy.</li>
      <li>because it is an oil spray, it will make floors slippery, and I would suspect it would build up on carpet and become a huge dirt magnet.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something like Nivea spray lotion that is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Do not use for a silky smooth feeling.  </li>
      <li>My sister recommended it and it has not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Although I really like the convenience of a moisturizing oil in a fine spray (easy application), there are a couple things to keep in mind if you buy this product.  </li>
      <li>This is so much easier and quicker, and seems to work better than lotion.</li>
      <li>I bought the Johnson&#x27;s after reading several good reviews.</li>
      <li>I had to switch back to my lotion because it didn&#x27;t do a good job of providing moisture.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice and light, but the mist left my skin feeling sticky, like I was coated in sugar water.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to find a product that is easy to apply and absorbs fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not dripping all over the bathroom and getting my hands all greasy right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I love this product, especially easy to spray areas that are hard to reach in the winter, like your back.</li>
      <li>and I received it fast!</li>
      <li>The product itself is okay, although I&#x27;m not sure the oil is better than the lotions I use.</li>
      <li>Am enjoying the product daily!  </li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to this product, but it&#x27;s very sticky!</li>
      <li>It does smell good but can&#x27;t get past the sticky residue.</li>
      <li>I am very particular about products I use on my skin</li>
      <li>This oil spray is so fine and sheer.</li>
      <li>Very sticky feeling; it holds moisture in but still feels sticky at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>By the time I&#x27;ve covering my whole body, my finger is sore.</li>
      <li>It is sooo easy to apply, much easier than lotion, and keeps her skin from getting too dry!!</li>
      <li>The mild scent evaporates quickly but it dries a just slightly sticky.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to scented products, but this has such a light scent that I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
      <li>I had high expectations on this product based on the review.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The Johnson Mist is Ok but its a little greasy.  </li>
      <li>Most things were too heavy or too greasy.  </li>
      <li>I like that the spray easily reaches the middle of my back.  </li>
      <li>But the pump top is not easy to use.</li>
      <li>Nice, subtle scent.</li>
      <li>and I was very surprised this spray worked so well.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and quick due to the spray mist but doesn&#x27;t deliver the same level of moisture as your regular drug store lotions.</li>
      <li>I was sad when it disappeared from my local store shelves, but happy</li>
      <li>The concept of a spray oil is really leaving me wonder why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier.</li>
      <li>I feel not only moisturized but soft and feminine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a little stickier than the neurtogena dry bath oil spray but much better than any other rub on oil I have tried.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Spend a few more bucks on Little Docs Cooling Spray Lotion instead; your skin will thank you!</li>
      <li>To my dismay, I found that it did not absorb very quickly and left a sticky &#x27;film&#x27; behind.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s the only thing that takes care of my dry skin - especially during the winter.  </li>
<li> , It is the only product in a dry oil spray I can find</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products and just can&#x27;t get the same results as I get from this...</li>
<li> Once hands get a little oily from spreading the mist, it&#x27;s a real pain in the neck (and fingers) to push the button down without its swiveling into the room.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m using Ahava Dry Oil mist.</li>
<li> It was to replace my Sephora Dry Oil mist which they no longer make.</li>
<li> I suffer with really dry skin</li>
<li> This dry oil spray isn&#x27;t very dry</li>
<li> First, I suspect this is because of the Aloe Vera in the product, when it does dry, it is true that there is no oil film, but rather a slightly tacky film that lasts for hours - which can be a bit annoying.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of the few liquids that I take with me in my carry-on when flying (just put in a smaller bottle).  </li>
<li> Second...be careful where you are applying the product...</li>
<li> Moisturizes dry skin on back , which is otherwise hard to reach.</li>
<li> I always keep at least 20 bottles in a cabinet because I&#x27;m so afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it anymore.  </li>
<li> The spray nozzle turns so my finger slips off the nozzle thus I cannot push down the nozzle to spray.  </li>
<li> Was a little sticky, which I did&#x27;t expect, but thought i&#x27;d give it a try based on the price.</li>
<li> I was looking for a spray moisturizer and have tried a few from amazon.com.  </li>
<li> I get such sensitive skin in the cold winter months that my back itches and makes me extremely uncomfortable.</li>
<li> My little boy had a small rash and it disappeared when I started using this on his skin.</li>
<li> so doing so in the shower, on tile or linoleum creates a slick surface.</li>
<li> I have used other sprays in the past and I was never happy with them.</li>
<li> I used to use neutrogena dry bath oil spray and have been unable to find a comparable replacement.&lt;br</li>
<li> (I probably use a bottle every 6 weeks, so I keep at least a year&#x27;s supply on standby.)</li>
<li> Or at least, very difficult to find.</li>
<li> This wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I thought I would try it.</li>
<li> and it got tedious putting lotion on every day.</li>
<li> Unpleasant feeling, had to wash it off.</li>

    <li> This dry oil spray isn&#x27;t very dry but it also isn&#x27;t very expensive.  The mild scent evaporates quickly but it dries a just slightly sticky.  I like that the spray easily reaches the middle of my back.  I will look for a drier product next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil mist spray for about 4 years.  I love it!  It&#x27;s the only thing that takes care of my dry skin - especially during the winter.  I just keep it in the shower and spray all over my body and rub it in before drying off.  I can tell a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s one of the few liquids that I take with me in my carry-on when flying (just put in a smaller bottle).  I was sad when it disappeared from my local store shelves, but happy I can still get it on amazon.com.  I always keep at least 20 bottles in a cabinet because I&#x27;m so afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it anymore.  (I probably use a bottle every 6 weeks, so I keep at least a year&#x27;s supply on standby.) I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products and just can&#x27;t get the same results as I get from this...I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about products I use on my skin and I waited awhile to buy this spray. I wish I had bought this sooner! This oil spray is so fine and sheer. I feel not only moisturized but soft and feminine. I have used other sprays in the past and I was never happy with them. They made me greasy and sticky! I suffer with really dry skin and I was very surprised this spray worked so well. Didn&#x27;t sting or burn, went on easy. I love it! I am sold! The price was great and I received it fast! Try it out! you will love it too.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to find a product that is easy to apply and absorbs fast.  Well, its easy to use but it leaves a layer of stickiness that does not go away for hours!  I saw others mentioning this but I ignored. I used it twice and that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my elderly Mother to put on her skin apres showering.  It is a good moisturizer and has a light fragrance.  It is sooo easy to apply, much easier than lotion, and keeps her skin from getting too dry!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a nice, light oil mist that would absorb into my skin. I get such sensitive skin in the cold winter months that my back itches and makes me extremely uncomfortable. Since I don&#x27;t always have someone around to apply regular lotion to my back, I wanted a spray that I could apply myself. I bought the Johnson&#x27;s after reading several good reviews. I also used it on my legs after showering. To my dismay, I found that it did not absorb very quickly and left a sticky &#x27;film&#x27; behind. I felt sweaty more than comfortable and moisturized. I will not be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few more bucks on Little Docs Cooling Spray Lotion instead; your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this last summer at Lot-less stores, just to try it on my baby. It is so easy to apply and it smell nice. I cannot find it anywhere not even at Lot-less. My little boy had a small rash and it disappeared when I started using this on his skin. I love this product I just bought a pack of six.</li>
    <li> I have not received this item yet. It has been 4 weeks.  I got everything else in my order very quickly.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes dry skin on back , which is otherwise hard to reach. Scent is not over-powering and oil is not sticky.</li>
    <li> The product is very good as the oil is nice and light but the spray nozzle can be improved. It rotates as you keep pumping causing you to miss the target you are spraying.</li>
    <li> Was a little sticky, which I did&#x27;t expect, but thought i&#x27;d give it a try based on the price. Ended up mixing it with some Watkins body oil and it was easier to apply and silkier. Nice, subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an oil to put in my baby&#x27;s hair to give it some moisture.  Most things were too heavy or too greasy.  This spray mist is light enough, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells wonderful after hours.  My sister recommended it and it has not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I hated the smell,tthe runny consistency of this product, sticky, and the bottle sprayed all over everything. No wonder Johnson &amp; Johnson discontinued this product!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this product, but it&#x27;s very sticky! It does smell good but can&#x27;t get past the sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I like the oil mist. Using it after my shower keeps my skin from drying out all day. But the pump top is not easy to use. By the time I&#x27;ve covering my whole body, my finger is sore.</li>
    <li> Should of listened to a couple of the other reviews about it being sticky, doesn&#x27;t make ur legs etc feel soft at all.</li>
    <li> Could only wish for fragrance and an easier spray button...a trigger would work much better.  Once hands get a little oily from spreading the mist, it&#x27;s a real pain in the neck (and fingers) to push the button down without its swiveling into the room.</li>
    <li> Although I really like the convenience of a moisturizing oil in a fine spray (easy application), there are a couple things to keep in mind if you buy this product.  First, I suspect this is because of the Aloe Vera in the product, when it does dry, it is true that there is no oil film, but rather a slightly tacky film that lasts for hours - which can be a bit annoying.  Second...be careful where you are applying the product...because it is an oil spray, it will make floors slippery, and I would suspect it would build up on carpet and become a huge dirt magnet.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle turns so my finger slips off the nozzle thus I cannot push down the nozzle to spray.  I poured some lotion into my hand to apply.  I did not like the silicon feel to the product.  I through the bottle away.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love It and I hope I can have a long Life of Availability, It is the only product in a dry oil spray I can find</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly.  Am enjoying the product daily!  I don&#x27;t understand why it went off the market.  Or at least, very difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Works great, very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay, although I&#x27;m not sure the oil is better than the lotions I use. The real problem with this product is the spray attachment, which is easy to use if you hold it upright, but if you tilt it at all it&#x27;s difficult to push down. The reason I bought this product is for the spray, which I thought would be easy to use after showering.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick due to the spray mist but doesn&#x27;t deliver the same level of moisture as your regular drug store lotions. I had to switch back to my lotion because it didn&#x27;t do a good job of providing moisture. Might be a good product if you leave in a very humid area and don&#x27;t need good moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I used to use neutrogena dry bath oil spray and have been unable to find a comparable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little stickier than the neurtogena dry bath oil spray but much better than any other rub on oil I have tried.  Smell is light which is nice because I suffer from migraines and was worried about too strong a smell.  This is nice and light.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations on this product based on the review. It was to replace my Sephora Dry Oil mist which they no longer make. The smell was nice and light, but the mist left my skin feeling sticky, like I was coated in sugar water. Unpleasant feeling, had to wash it off. I&#x27;m using Ahava Dry Oil mist. The best one I&#x27;ve found as a replacement.</li>
    <li> The Johnson Mist is Ok but its a little greasy.  I was looking for something like Nivea spray lotion that is no longer available.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spray moisturizer and have tried a few from amazon.com.  This wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I thought I would try it. I would just say it&#x27;s ok.  The smell is good, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still oil and feels like oil.  I wanted something lighter that would &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; into my skin without residue.</li>
    <li> The concept of a spray oil is really leaving me wonder why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier. I&#x27;m not dripping all over the bathroom and getting my hands all greasy right out of the shower. The added advantage is that my itchy winter skin has been banished in favor of a light, pleasant scent. Just remember that you are spraying oil and so doing so in the shower, on tile or linoleum creates a slick surface. Otherwise, I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells HORRIBLE!!! it was a good price but i cannot stand the smell. not to mention there is no sort of seal on the top so who knows if the liquid inside is what its supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Very sticky feeling; it holds moisture in but still feels sticky at the end of the day.  Do not use for a silky smooth feeling.  You will only feel sticky....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering, and using this daily for years!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to family and friends.  No greasy feeling, or residue on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps pedicure from chipping and skin smooth &amp; silky!</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially easy to spray areas that are hard to reach in the winter, like your back.</li>
    <li> I have extra dry skin and it got tedious putting lotion on every day. This is so much easier and quicker, and seems to work better than lotion. I&#x27;m also sensitive to scented products, but this has such a light scent that I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. Love it!</li>
