      <li>Love, Love, Love OPI.</li>
      <li>it is very strong helping my egg shell nails stay strong</li>
      <li>After not receiving the first delivery which Amazon acted on very quickly the polish is great</li>
      <li>More clear than color.&lt;br /&gt;Needed to be more of a mixture of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it did arrive promptly and in good shape.</li>
      <li>I bough it with the OPI Mini Disney Couture De Minnie 2013 and this works perfectly with the other colors</li>

      <li>Love OPI products, but this one, not so much.</li>
      <li>you really need to scrub it!!</li>
      <li>a fun polish.</li>
      <li>This is just glitter and a clear coat , u have to apply this so many times to get some of the glitter on your nails ,  plus to get rid of it from your nails</li>
      <li>Dries up very fast</li>
      <li>dries fast and stays on very well!</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and lays flat on the nail</li>
      <li>I really like OPI, but this new bling line is not my cup of tea.</li>
      <li>This polish has large confetti like speckles so a bottom coat of a light color would really suit it, possible white.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It was more of clear nail polish with red and white speckles.  </li>
      <li>Would look best with pink, white, or red shades.. maybe even black!</li>
      <li>the bring out a new series...</li>
      <li>I gave it to my 20 year old granddaughter who loves it.</li>
      <li>I would get it again once the formula gets fixed.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it.</li>
      <li>Each layer only gives you a few sparkles and you end up with too many layers or dabbing it on.</li>
      <li>Just may take a little effort to get glitter where you want it if you don&#x27;t want it covering the whole nail.</li>

<li> Just may take a little effort to get glitter where you want it if you don&#x27;t want it covering the whole nail.</li>
<li> so remind you of Minnie Mouse, the shine and long lasting polish makes OPI number 1 with me.</li>
<li> I layer this color over other polish because it is very shear, but fun to wear with sparkle and a hint of crazy with the white flecks.</li>
<li> but the reality is I just haven&#x27;t been able to find a color to go underneath that makes this color pop for me :-(</li>
<li> so nothing catches or snags like some other polishes with flecks.  </li>
<li> also it does not chip as bad as other nail polishes and being a sales clerk and handling money it helps a lot being strong</li>
<li> , it takes a few coats to put on before dots come on</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to take the glitters out of bottle.</li>
<li> I didnt realize the base is just clear not tinted any color.</li>
<li> but this is very hard to put on comes out clumpy</li>
<li> very hard to get off</li>
<li> Very hard to mix, even with a polish shaker.</li>
<li> Not a great formula or consistency.</li>

    <li> Just may take a little effort to get glitter where you want it if you don&#x27;t want it covering the whole nail. Love, Love, Love OPI.</li>
    <li> Had nails done with it love it</li>
    <li> I love this glitter combo. Very unique!! I&#x27;m loving how the colors seem to work so well together.. Would look best with pink, white, or red shades.. maybe even black!</li>
    <li> Very hard to mix, even with a polish shaker. Not a great formula or consistency.</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time for a Christmas party and I LOVE IT!  Goes on smoothly and lays flat on the nail so nothing catches or snags like some other polishes with flecks.  It has tons of sparkle and lasted nicely.  Then, again, it&#x27;s OPI polish - it&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it looks really cute in the pic but the reality is I just haven&#x27;t been able to find a color to go underneath that makes this color pop for me :-(</li>
    <li> It looks nice when I put it on top of light color. It&#x27;s hard to take the glitters out of bottle.</li>
    <li> I love opi but this is very hard to put on comes out clumpy, it takes a few coats to put on before dots come on</li>
    <li> I didnt realize the base is just clear not tinted any color. I still like the nail polish. I bough it with the OPI Mini Disney Couture De Minnie 2013 and this works perfectly with the other colors</li>
    <li> This was a huge success as a gift.  She said it sparked and she was thrilled with it.  Great idea!</li>
    <li> It was more of clear nail polish with red and white speckles.  More clear than color.&lt;br /&gt;Needed to be more of a mixture of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it did arrive promptly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> I really like OPI, but this new bling line is not my cup of tea. Each layer only gives you a few sparkles and you end up with too many layers or dabbing it on. Love OPI products, but this one, not so much. Maybe I&#x27;m just over the age? I gave it to my 20 year old granddaughter who loves it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my daughters favorites!!  Great color</li>
    <li> Dries up very fast but I got compliments on this all the time.  I would get it again once the formula gets fixed.</li>
    <li> Does not go on thoroughly on your nail. You have to put multiple coats on to get the all-over glitter affect.</li>
    <li> I layer this color over other polish because it is very shear, but fun to wear with sparkle and a hint of crazy with the white flecks.</li>
    <li> very hard to get off but it looks nice</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it. Gave it to her with a princess dress and another color</li>
    <li> The name and color so remind you of Minnie Mouse, the shine and long lasting polish makes OPI number 1 with me. Minnie red what a great color to wear for any occasion, what a great fit and color - so many sparkles.... Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This polish has large confetti like speckles so a bottom coat of a light color would really suit it, possible white. Since they are larger confetti, 2 coats can be applied but they sometimes overlap, I think I would go with maybe a bottom color and just one. Cute bright confetti, and almost Christmassy... (Red and silver confetti).&lt;br /&gt;Its a fun polish.</li>
    <li> love it... love it....a beautiful dressing to my nails...opi is my most favorite polish and each month the bring out a new series...</li>
    <li> This is just glitter and a clear coat , u have to apply this so many times to get some of the glitter on your nails ,  plus to get rid of it from your nails you really need to scrub it!!, do no recommend this at all</li>
    <li> After not receiving the first delivery which Amazon acted on very quickly the polish is great I put it on top of another color it is very strong helping my egg shell nails stay strong also it does not chip as bad as other nail polishes and being a sales clerk and handling money it helps a lot being strong</li>
    <li> Awesome it came packaged very well.  I have used this product before and knew I would like it so that is why I ordered this item.</li>
    <li> the wife and daughter have had many a nail painting party with it already and they say it has passed the test!,  Does not chip,  dries fast and stays on very well!</li>
