    <li> Well worth it its a bit pricey but it does what it says it evens out skin tone.  And fades dark spots I have been using a lot of the Murad products and they work excellent. Investment well worth it !!!!!</li>
    <li> This product I&#x27;ve used before and it really works</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  It failed.  I still have a few dark spots on my face.  They were never huge but i thought this might get rid of them.</li>
    <li> Yes, I do like this serum.  It does work.  I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should, but I do see improvement from when I have used it.  I brought this for my mother and she loved it and wanted another bottle.  I would recommend the serum.</li>
    <li> I first learned of this product on Sephora, but I knew I could get it for a better price on Amazon, so I bought some. I have only used it 3 times, and already I can see a significant difference! To all you women who fall victim to hyperpigmentation in the summer or when overexposed to sunlight, this is the product for you.

    <li> I suffer from melasma. I have tried hundreds of products and spent thousands of dollars over the years....nothing ever even made a slight difference. Murad does really help lighten my dark patches....which have comsumed my whole face. It&#x27;s worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> Used product for almost 3 months before I started to see a difference. dark spots are still visible but lighter. Too expensive</li>
    <li> Am still in the progress to see if it does anything.  My skin does not peel, so it is not harsh - so far I don&#x27;t notice changes - but am giving it time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dark spot removing products. None of them have come close to the results I get with Murad. The only downside is the price. I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much money on it if it didn&#x27;t work. 10/10 will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over 3 weeks and still don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice aging spots disappearing it takes a couple of weeks but definitely works well and it feels great</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping ... VERY satisfied</li>
    <li> Sorry, folks.  I really wanted this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; to work, but after one-month of using it on my dark age spots, I have seen zero results. I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> good for smooth skin.bit very limited effect to spot</li>
    <li> It does cause a burning effect at first but does seem to help to some degree after use for while</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I have used this in the past and seen visible results. My skin is clearer than before. The skin of my face is even toned now. I have recommended this to my sister and her skin has very visible improvements.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in a month</li>
    <li> I have been putting this product on his face every night for nearly 3 weeks. There isnt a big noticeable difference at all. However, there is a difference. It has evened out the overall skin tone and the age spots have faded out. Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results like one would get if having age spots removed by a dermatologist but if you want a general smoothening of the skin and an even skin tone, this product does work.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!  Can we say, &amp;#34;auto-order?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Although the serum didn&#x27;t completely remove my age spots, I do see a fading, which is great!  Suggest you also purchase the moisture cream-C day; I love how soft and smooth it makes my face.</li>
    <li> The best aged spot remover !</li>
