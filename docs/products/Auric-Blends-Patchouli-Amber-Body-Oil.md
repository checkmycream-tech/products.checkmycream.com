      <li>Smells like some kind of freshener for a car or a litter box.</li>
      <li>I really liked this one.</li>
      <li>In my opinion the amber seems more like vanilla, either way it makes it much more pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
      <li>Patchouli is a great natural sent with the amber nice choice not over powering do try!  </li>

      <li>The Patchouli amber is really lovely though.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it</li>
      <li>one of my favorite blends.</li>
      <li>Not the most feminine smell....</li>
      <li>Auric Blends is one of the better oils.</li>
      <li>I love this oil, been using it for years.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>Love this product, I receive compliments all the time.</li>
      <li>Love the patchouli/ amber combo.</li>
      <li>glad I found it here:)</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Mesmerizing aroma-men love it!</li>
      <li>I guess the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last is a good thing!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply but the fragrance has a powder undertone to it.</li>
      <li>It did not smell good the after smell of it was decent</li>
      <li>I received this order rather fast, which I was extremely glad about.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the sweet &#x27;70&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>When you put it on at first it is quite strong, but as the day goes on it has a sweetness to it.</li>
      <li>I have the patchouli oil which is very earthy with a strong bite to it.  </li>
      <li>I use it to blend with other perfumes and the result is unique and exceptional.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful scent that I constantly get compliments on.</li>
      <li>This scent isn&#x27;t for me, but was willing to try for the first time.</li>
      <li>and it took almost a month to receive it in the mail when it was supposed to be much faster.</li>
      <li>Much softer.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely NOTHING resembling either Patchouli or Amber.  </li>
      <li>Thanks  EYK</li>
      <li>So much that I had to find her, compliment her and ask what it was.</li>
      <li>Everyone wants to  hug them</li>
      <li>Very earthy as you would expect.</li>
      <li>Not so much in the summer.</li>
      <li>Jus have to be very careful not to put on a lot, I think it would be overwhelming in the beginning.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about the amber, but it adds a little sweetness.</li>
      <li>A little strong, perhaps.</li>
      <li>I like the straight patchouli and so sent product back and want the correct product.</li>
      <li>It took a little long to get to us, the bottle is smaller than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of my junior high days in the mid 70s.</li>
      <li>A safer alternative :) This one was a little to manly smelling to me... similar to what you might smell on a guys aftershave or men&#x27;s soap possibly.</li>
      <li>I find this brand to have a punch at the beginning and then goes dead quickly.</li>
      <li>My coworkers made fun of me mercilessly when I put this on...&lt;br /&gt;Very very strong.</li>

<ol>

    <li> upset because i thought this was infused with pheromones.  it smells like men cologne.</li>
    <li> Good seller good product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, so many compliments when I wear the scent...</li>

    <li> I love this scent. I get compliments all the time. People say that I smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> A little strong, perhaps.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it ~ Smells wonderful and stays on all day . . .</li>
    <li> Irritating smell. I smelled it on someone else at the gym and loved it. So much that I had to find her, compliment her and ask what it was. So I went to amazon looked it up and bought it. It gives me the worst headache. Strong and annoying smell. Smells like some kind of freshener for a car or a litter box. I haven&#x27;t received any compliments either.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong. I smelled another one by this branch which was jasmine and Amber.... Much softer.</li>
    <li> the store I used to get this at in the Haight closed down... stupid rent hikes! glad I found it here:)</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> A little too much patchouli and too little amber, but works for me. Just don;t over do.</li>
    <li> I have opened this Bottle a Bunch of times. It smells very nice. I am going to wear it tomorrow and see how it lasts. I find this brand to have a punch at the beginning and then goes dead quickly. I think they need to do something so the sent lasts through the day. I don&#x27;t want to keep putting it on each time I go Potty, LOL..</li>
    <li> This had a cola smell to it which is not the smell I believed it to be and it took almost a month to receive it in the mail when it was supposed to be much faster.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments on this scent, very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Patchouli is a great natural sent with the amber nice choice not over powering do try!  a fragrance for a naturale use!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It reminds me of the sweet &#x27;70&#x27;s. I use it to blend with other perfumes and the result is unique and exceptional.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, been using it for years. Absolutely beautiful scent!! Great product, I&#x27;m ordering another one. Great product and service!!</li>
    <li> I had incorrectly ordered the Patchouli Amber...thinking it was the plain Patchouli...and it was not....I returned it to Xtremedek and&lt;br /&gt;they replaced it w/o any problems...Thanks  EYK</li>
    <li> There is absolutely NOTHING resembling either Patchouli or Amber.  It smells like Play-Doh in the dirt and it doesn&#x27;t last.  I guess the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last is a good thing!  Where is the Patchouli Oil that we used to wear???</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Did not like it...it smells like Cotton Candy, no earth smell at all..</li>
    <li> At the time this was the only product I saw. I did not like the smell. I like the straight patchouli and so sent product back and want the correct product. Is just a like factor.</li>
    <li> patchouli-amber combo is a Great! .  I use for my dogs. They are the best smelling dogs! Everyone wants to  hug them</li>
    <li> I received my package with no problems this company there great</li>
    <li> love it! get a lot of compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> Gave this to the wife for her birthday.  Who needs to Viagra after that.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the amber, but it adds a little sweetness. I&#x27;ve been wearing patchouli for years.  I get a lot of compliments when worn alone or  with other fragrances. Auric Blends is one of the better oils.</li>
    <li> Not same mixture as previous??</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC SERVICE AND PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It did not smell good the after smell of it was decent but then it starts to smell like cleaning supplies or detergent.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this. It took a little long to get to us, the bottle is smaller than I would have liked. Yet my dad was please with tge quality of the oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I receive compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Smells great and i get alot of compliments!</li>
    <li> I received this order rather fast, which I was extremely glad about. The smell at first smells like Pine Sol, after a while of it sitting on the skin it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Jus have to be very careful not to put on a lot, I think it would be overwhelming in the beginning. My boyfriend smelled it, but didn&#x27;t like it at all. This scent isn&#x27;t for me, but was willing to try for the first time.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite blends.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years.  Mesmerizing aroma-men love it!</li>
    <li> This scent is awesome.  I have the patchouli oil which is very earthy with a strong bite to it.  The Patchouli amber is really lovely though.  It has the earthiness of patchouli but sweetened with the amber.  In my opinion the amber seems more like vanilla, either way it makes it much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a chic &amp; I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl... I&#x27;m trying to eliminate &amp;#34;perfumes&amp;#34; from my life &amp; replace them with oils that smell amazing, instead. A safer alternative :) This one was a little to manly smelling to me... similar to what you might smell on a guys aftershave or men&#x27;s soap possibly. Not the most feminine smell.... but I still wear this from time to time. And best of all, I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions to this. Would recommend for a man!</li>
    <li> I really liked this one. When you put it on at first it is quite strong, but as the day goes on it has a sweetness to it. It&#x27;s a very warm smell. I would wear it during the fall and winter. Not so much in the summer.</li>
    <li> Very earthy as you would expect. Reminds me of my junior high days in the mid 70s. Love the patchouli/ amber combo. This scent is calming to me.</li>
    <li> Awesome smelling patchouli!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Patchouli Amber Body Oil . I will be ordering again in the future . Thank you .</li>
    <li> Auric Blends - Patchouli Amber Body Oil smells really nice without being overpowering. A very little bit is all one needs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply but the fragrance has a powder undertone to it. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> My coworkers made fun of me mercilessly when I put this on...&lt;br /&gt;Very very strong.</li>
