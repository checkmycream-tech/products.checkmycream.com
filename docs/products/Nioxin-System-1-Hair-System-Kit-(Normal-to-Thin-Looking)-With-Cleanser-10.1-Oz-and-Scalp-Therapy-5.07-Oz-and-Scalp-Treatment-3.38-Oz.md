      <li>I have no experience with the original, U.S. made product, but this does a good job</li>
      <li>This product has worked great on my very straight, yet frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Works awesome on my fine hair, it&#x27;s never been so shiny and manageable, very soft.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this or any healthy cleanser because it is really important to have a healthy scalp during te.ase!</li>
      <li>sure if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>I expect to buy more as I think it is working...</li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than 2 months now.</li>
      <li>I respect her integrity--but I have not been able to notice that for myself.</li>
      <li>and now my hairfall is reduced by 50%...and expecting to improve more in coming weeks.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>,i brush it and more hair comes out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not losing any more hair since I began the regimen.  </li>
      <li>but I noticed it is thinning a bit and wanted to find something I could use as a prophylactic to prevent any more hair loss.</li>
      <li>I like that the hair treatment smells better than before</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this system.</li>
      <li>Many stylists recommended this product to me.</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is working since I can&#x27;t see the part myself,</li>
      <li>I also notice my scalp getting itchy more oftebn...</li>
      <li>Her hair has been mistreated for most of her life and this seems to rectify her issues.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and product worked great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line is I will probably end up buying it again just to see if it makes any more difference.</li>
      <li>My sister uses your product, and she is pleased.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more...</li>
      <li>The conditioner was okay as was the scalp treatment.  </li>
      <li>My husband tried the different # systems from nioxin but the # 1 system seems to work best for him.</li>
      <li>i might need more time.</li>
      <li>I know my hair looked better.</li>
      <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Love Nioxin.</li>
      <li>but now it has become more of a healthier look</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s interesting is</li>
      <li>I use shampoo more than the conditioner</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>i do see my hair feeling thicker and greater</li>
      <li>really feels great.  </li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t use it if you are concerned with losing more hair.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This does not grow hair but it conditions the scalp to better hold on to the hair you still have while making the strands stronger and thicker resulting in the look of a healthier head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Always pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure my hair has become even thinner.</li>
      <li>Amazon prices for the product are better than anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>As you can see above, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product</li>
      <li>We will give it 3 more weeks.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>but it turns out many are allergic.</li>
      <li>Love the minty smell and seems  to be working - we will see in 30 days what it does for us</li>
      <li>It also takes care of the static and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think I would have selected a more appropriate one had I been better informed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure if I love it. I can&#x27;t say I really notice any big difference except my hair feels like it has a little more weight to it instead of so thin and light. But as soon as I use my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner my hair feels exactly the same as it did before. I have been using it for a little over a month and have about a half a bottle of shampoo but only a little bit left of the conditioner since the bottle is a lot smaller. I also notice my scalp getting itchy more oftebn... Maybe due to the scalp therapy spray but could have to do with some other factors possibly.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I will probably end up buying it again just to see if it makes any more difference.</li>
    <li> Great Product.. Very effective in controlling hairfall and maintaining a healthy scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product to make hair thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 8+ years.  My hair is fuller, softer, shinier, and breaks far less that when I use a typical shampoo product.  Plus, it makes your scalp tingle... really feels great.  Wakes you up!  I&#x27;ll never use another product.  It&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo set! I have ordered it now!</li>
    <li> I used this product daily for about two years and ran out of it about 6 -8 months ago and never replaced figured, figured it wasn&#x27;t doing much anyway and I would just use whatever was in the shower. Now that I have stopped using it I have realized how well this product was actually working! My hair is very noticeably thinner since I stopped using it. When using nioxin my hair did feel a little thicker and it certainly halted the thinning process, its not going to help you grow a super thick batch of new hair but it does give the feeling of thicker hair and helps slow down the thinning. highly reccomend</li>
    <li> Works awesome on my fine hair, it&#x27;s never been so shiny and manageable, very soft.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Been very happy so far with this product.  I expect to buy more as I think it is working...too early to tell, but I like it!</li>
    <li> The first week or so I thought this was a good product - until with repeated use, my hair began to come out more. The conditioner is terrible- was very hard to comb out my hair. Did not condition well at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if this stuff really works.  I have plenty of hair left just trying to slow down hair loss.</li>
    <li> It is the best product ever, my hair look great and it has stop falling,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caro&lt;br /&gt;Ecuador</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended for me to use this every other week interchangeably with another shampoo. I like it I&#x27;ve only used it once and my second time using it will be between tonight and tomorrow. Having natural hair the last step takes forever and my hair dries quickly so it makes it difficult to get to my hair while it&#x27;s good and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have no complaints though! My hair looks nice! lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 years now.  I find that it leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I would recommend it for anyone with thin hair.</li>
    <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product....Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I would never recommend this product. Every time i used it I lost a lot of hair (look at the picture, attached) in addition my hair got dry and it losts its shine. Now I need to think about what can I do to repair the damage that this treatment did.</li>
    <li> Hair won&#x27;t regrow but it makes the thinning a little less noticeable.  Smells nice. I have no experience with the original, U.S. made product, but this does a good job and it is not too expensive (unlike Minoxidil treatments).</li>
    <li> My husband tried the different # systems from nioxin but the # 1 system seems to work best for him. Won&#x27;t change what works.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and I can tell a difference in his hair.  It looks so much thicker!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Does not work as indicated.</li>
    <li> Have used for several years but local store no longer carries it as normal stock.  It is a terrific hair product and does help the scalp by stopping itching and less dandruff if you use the range of products.  I like it better but wouldnt say it produces any more hair on the balding male but does make hair appear thicker and less oily.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s just a waste of money.  I have finished the whole set and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> It does make your hair look thicker, but there is no replacing the genetic hair loss that I think this product misleads you into thinking.</li>
    <li> If you have an itchy scalp this system is a life saver.  It does have a slight medicated smell, but I actually like it.</li>
    <li> I tried both Nioxin 1 and 2 and both products proved to help me with my hair. I have already gone back and ordered the large bottle of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a significant difference in the texture or fullness of my hair. The smell was awful. In fact my doctor asked that I cease using it immediately because some of the ingredients are toxic and can cause itchy dry scalp-which I have now.</li>
    <li> This product is so good from people with thin hair , it adds volume and its light weight love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha&lt;br /&gt;NYC</li>
    <li> No signs of additional hair growth, but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for more than 2 months now. It hasn&#x27;t helped much yet. Also, the cleanser, conditioner and solution are disproportionate. Cleanser lasts a lot longer than solution and the solution lasts lot longer than conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product five times till. and now my hairfall is reduced by 50%...and expecting to improve more in coming weeks.</li>
    <li> It works.  It is a good system.  It is quite expensive but a little goes a long way.  I like the small cases for travel.</li>
    <li> So it seemed like this system was adding volume, but I stopped using it altogether since it made my scalp really, really, really itchy.  It was a little weird since I don&#x27;t have a history of sensitive skin.  As much as I liked having the extra volume (plus it smells quite nice!), I just couldn&#x27;t bear the itchiness.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a week and my hair fell out. I now have very thin hair and a bald spot near the back of my head. I started out with normal to thinning hair and now I have a bald spot.</li>
    <li> So I had a really heavy bout if telogen effluvium. You cannot stop te, as it has to run its course. It is overwhelming and scary, but it will stop. Nioxin is no miracle worker, as I have learned within a few months. What I believe it does it clean the scalp and make a healthy environment while you are waiting for new growth and a slow in shedding. I would recommend this or any healthy cleanser because it is really important to have a healthy scalp during te.ase! I will make an update in weeks.</li>
    <li> Nice Shampoo. I enjoy the scent and feel like it really cleans my scalp and hair, but in terms of being a natural thickener, I cannot say I feel or see a difference.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product. It has helped maintain the integrity of her hair. She has been using Nioxin for years.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t post reviews for anything but this product was so bad that I felt like I should spread the word.  I wasn&#x27;t losing hair but after several recommendations wanted to try this to make my hair thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week, I noticed falling hair when styling but ignored it as I&#x27;d seen reviewers claim it was normal and that hair was supposed to fall anyways.  I used this product for three weeks, hoping it would improve and I&#x27;d wake up to stronger hair.  Unfortunately, it kept getting worse.  Hair started falling more often, my head started itching, and for the first time in my life I had dandruff over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this product doesn&#x27;t work and will probably make your situation worse.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin. Great hair care system. Comes with leave-in conditioner. I love that the shampoo is bigger than the conditioner. I use shampoo more than the conditioner so I am left with a lot of conditioner and no shampoo.</li>
    <li> There was a picture of a bigger bottle of conditioner within the details of the add. I feel misled. Sneaky add.</li>
    <li> The product does not deliver against its promises. I used it for month and did not notice any improvement. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin before but been a couple years. Last time bought it directly from my hair salon on their recommendation of it as a good shampoo/conditioner.  This time tried the sample kit for Nioxin System 1.  The first time or two I used it I felt my scalp burn, figured it was not used to it. Also someone at work said he smelled candy!  I like the scent but hope it does not overwhelm. The last time I used it I really liked the conditioner; this time can&#x27;t tell much if it works well or not.  My hair is not thinning or falling out just wanted to give it a nice infusion, so we shall see.  It&#x27;s pretty costly so I may just order/use it from time to time as needed, and use another less costly but good shampoo/conditioner in between.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month and I&#x27;m sure my hair has become even thinner. Right now feeling more hopeless and not likely to buy another round of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now it has been 3 months since I&#x27;ve used this product, and I reduced my rating to only 1 star. As you can see above, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product but I thought I would at least finish up the bottles. Bad decision. My hair became even more and more dry and straw-like,  but the shedding worsened. I&#x27;ve lost at least 20% of my hair. Stopped using it last week, and the shedding has reduced dramatically. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Love the minty smell and seems  to be working - we will see in 30 days what it does for us</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and serioulsy i do notice the improvement, you feel the freshness in every shower!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the treatment once and the results in multiple applications are quite hopeful for my thin hair (ugh!) Suggested to purchase from my sister who loves the product.</li>
    <li> There was an inadequate amount of descriptive information about the 4 systems. I think I would have selected a more appropriate one had I been better informed. No idea if it is working yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for years.  Probably 20 at least.  I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it.  I have thin hair.  It seems to keep it from getting thinner and gives it more volume.  When I don&#x27;t use it I see more hair in the comb.</li>
    <li> good shampoo for those of us loosing our hair.</li>
    <li> I liked the way the shampoo made my hair feel.  The conditioner was okay as was the scalp treatment.  But after a month, I see no results.  Hair still thinning.  I will continue using for a while longer.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes your hair softer and manageable immediately with a slow increase in fullness.  I decided to purchase the 30 day supplement to see if that will help increase the fullness results.  But, that was 3 weeks after starting this kit so I have to update.</li>
    <li> conditioner very small was a good price and product but not sure if id buy it again, probably will buy individual sizes next time</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!!! Not only did I receive a partial order but the two bottles I did receive were not full...I am not a happy customer....</li>
    <li> I have VERY thin hair.  I&#x27;ve only used these products twice and have already seen a difference in my hair: a wonderful sheen is back (like when I was a kid); my hair does seem fuller; and a little dab goes a long, long way with lots of suds.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on amazon before but I felt the need to warn others regarding this product.  After reading a lot of positive feedback on this shampoo I decided to give it a try.  On my first try I noticed that my hair fell out significantly more after using the shampoo and conditioner.  So I stopped using it immediately and thought it could just be a coincidence.  I waited a few more days before I used it again and the same thing happened.  More hair than normal fell especially when blow drying my hair.  Isn&#x27;t this supposed to help with hair loss?  Please don&#x27;t use it if you are concerned with losing more hair.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time as promised and in new condition.  I have long hair so only putting it on my scalp caused my hair to dry out and I had to often use other conditioners or hair treatments.  I think I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair.  But too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because my stylist recommended it to me. However, it didn&#x27;t do anything that it was supposed to do. After using the system for almost 2 months, my hair does not look or feel any thicker, or fuller. It still looks a little thin with thin strands of hair. I really wished this product would have worked. I have natural (uncolored) hair that is normal to thin looking. It gets two stars instead of one, because I liked the clean feeling you get from the tingling in the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My husband just bought this and was surprised to find out that the cleaner is actually 150mL although Amazon&#x27;s description says it is 300mL. Amazon needs to correct the description.&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t started using it. Hopefully it works for him. Will update later.</li>
    <li> I just used this product today and when I sprayed the scalp treatment on, my scalp and everywhere on my body where the aerosol went, I turned bright red, including my head.  I am returning this asap.  The conditioner also my my head burn.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received my package in record time; however, the scalp treatment arrived in the box with a dirty container appearing as if it had been either used or sitting on a shelf. The label was dirty and peeling. The shampoo and conditioner appeared to be new.</li>
    <li> My sister uses your product, and she is pleased. I started using this product because of her recomindation. The leave on conditioner say&#x27;s to shake well, which I did. It is supposed to foam, it doesn&#x27;t. I have yet to see anything different, but I will keep on using it with HIGH hopes.</li>
    <li> Someone told me that this would help my hair grow, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. The price was right and it was so worth it. I can&#x27;t tell if there is any growth, and the density of my hair has not really changed, however, this product makes my hair so soft and shiny and it feels so extremely healthy that even if there is no immediate growth I am sure that I will see some growth soon!!! I am in braids now, but I will continue to use Nioxin when I take them out to see if there is actual growth.</li>
    <li> a friend gave me this product originally to try it ( she went through brain cancer surgery and needed help with her hair growing back)... she colors her hair and so she gave me the formula for color treated hair ( my hair is natural, never colored or treated) I tried it out of frustration of hair loss and it seemed to work.. I know my hair looked better. I decided to buy this for myself, the # 1 combo for natural hair, and I LOVE THIS  STUFF!. My hair looks fuller and I think it&#x27;s starting to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair so I have never used conditioner all the way up to my roots because it would leave my hair looking dirty within a day but with Nioxin I had to put it on my scalp for it to work and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Hair stays soft and clean for 2/3 days. It looks shiny and full from day one - day three.&lt;br /&gt;I read a review about this stuff now being made in Mexico and how it doesn&#x27;t work as well anymore but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more... This is a fabulous product... It works just fine</li>
    <li> I like the Nioxin Hair System Kit as it has cleanser, conditioner and Scalp Treatment. This has really worked for me. I have seen +ve growth in hair and seen some new growth (with Nioxin Hair boost) in the area where it was almost getting bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not magic, you need to apply it regularly and will see noticeable impact within 3-4 months. I am not sure if it will work for other but did work for me, so this is a really good option worth to try, if you are looking for something similar.</li>
    <li> Be very careful to patch test your skin with this product. My daughter turned burning red on her skin from it. Benadryl fixed that but it turns out many are allergic. I was not, but she was. Caution is required.</li>
    <li> This hair system works for sure! Helped my wife grow her hair back after hers started to fall out.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, just as expected. This formula is great!</li>
    <li> I have used this quite some time and it has helped my hair dramatically.</li>
    <li> I have tried Nioxin in the past with very little results, decided to give it another go. It doesnt seem to do a whole lot from my perspective, but i dont seem to be thinning quite as fast so that is a plus. For the price I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not losing any more hair since I began the regimen.  Might even be a big fuller.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love this product I have been using it for about two months and love the difference it has made. My hair is not falling out near as much as before.  It is also noticeably thicker both by sight and touch.  I went thru gastric by pass and was not ready for my hair to fall out but that is exactly what it did when I stopped crying I went to my hair dresser and pleaded for help. The price in the salon was so high I just could not even bring myself to pay that so I came home, hit my computer with hours of research ending with buying it thru Amazon.  This does not grow hair but it conditions the scalp to better hold on to the hair you still have while making the strands stronger and thicker resulting in the look of a healthier head of hair.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo and treatment</li>
    <li> Pretty much why I still have as much hair as I do.</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin and I had an allergic reaction to it won&#x27;t buy again..waist of money. .</li>
    <li> I just talked to a rep of the company. she said the product was improved 2 years ago. she said all it does is improve the skin condition so the hair can grow if it wants too. She also said if it hasn&#x27;t worked in a year it&#x27;s not going too. That statement saves me a lot of money!!!</li>
    <li> Received in good condition.  I have heard good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Expensive but I like it</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what I expected and has done wonders for my hair. I recommend it to all my friends! It came in a timely manner and I am very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> The product description claimed the cleanser is 300ml, but it was actually 150ml.</li>
    <li> Great quality product at a super great price!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product worked great. My hair feels thicker and stronger than without using the system.  Would recommend this product to anyone that feels they have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price &amp; fast delivery.  Noticeable results right away. A++</li>
    <li> Great price on this product. So far, it has helped with preventing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Product is good.  These bottles are more of a trial size so if you are actively using the product there is a better long-term value to get the 33oz size and refill the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> If used correctly, and I did, Nioxin System 1 Hair System delivers what it promises. Even my hair dresser noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> works great i do see my hair feeling thicker and greater</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and it seems to doing my hair well but still haven&#x27;t noticed much length growth after three months of using it but I&#x27;ve always had trouble growing hair.</li>
    <li> I am noticing new hair growth and less scalp irritation from the cleanliness of this product versus Biolage/Matrix shampoos.  It also helped to get a filtered shower head too.</li>
    <li> Helped my hair become clean before it was very oily and dry but now it has become more of a healthier look</li>
    <li> this product not bad but it does not give the benefit  .&lt;br /&gt;my hair does not be thinner ..i hope it work later</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as it used to be....</li>
    <li> I used it only a few yet, but the shampoo and conditionner seem ok, with a standard minty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention when applying the last product (scalp treatment), it&#x27;s pretty aggressive to the skin: the first time it leaked a bit on my neck and left some red marks for an hour or so. Protect your skin with a towel when applying.&lt;br /&gt;But the scalp tingling doesn&#x27;t bother me. However the smell of the treatment is kind of bad, sort old school pomade... Not so fun, but I hope it works a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again. I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s effective on the long run.</li>
    <li> I like this product seems to be working pretty well for. But I should have ordered the 3 hair system instead of the 1.</li>
    <li> This will definetly help to retain your existing hair, so use it even you have hair loss or not. Best Cleanser and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser who recommended this set to me says that she can tell that my hair is significantly thicker. I respect her integrity--but I have not been able to notice that for myself.</li>
    <li> I will give it more time i have been using it three weeks,i have noticed i lose more hair right after washing i run my hand through my wet hair and quite a few strands come out and also after my hair dries,i brush it and more hair comes out *sigh* but less hair loss between washing&#x27;s.Over all i noticed less hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is the best product line that I have found to create a healthy scalp bed for hair re-growth.  It makes my scalp white, like it used to be, instead of the flesh tone that we see when hair begins to thin.  I have tried the color system as well, thinking that it might be a bit less drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system, when coupled with Black Currant Oil (500 mg 3x a day) and 1 kelp supplement a day seems to be the best combo I have tried so far.  I like that the hair treatment smells better than before (it used to smell like the first time you turn your heat on in the fall, like burnt dust, and was pretty sticky).  Now the improved formula is something that I will ACTUALLY use.  I also like that now, when I wash my hair, I am feeling stubble in the spot I have been applying the treatment to.  I have been using this for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product.  I was using everyday, but made my hair frizzy, so I only use 2 times a week.  But I really give it a thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I can feel the difference. My hair feels thicker and stronger! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a beauty blog and I love it. I am 28 years old and my hair is naturally oily but I noticed it is thinning a bit and wanted to find something I could use as a prophylactic to prevent any more hair loss. This product leave my hair clean and soft and my scalp with a slight warm tingling sensation. The scent is a light mint and I love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Factory sealed, authentic and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> A barber said the back of my head was getting thinner, and recommended this product to me.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is working since I can&#x27;t see the part myself, but it gives me a feeling that I am doing something.</li>
    <li> So pleased with everything!</li>
    <li> While this product does not regrow hair it does seem to make it fuller.  The 3 products together work very well together and also make my hair feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I stopped using it after 2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I am not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Always pleased with this product.  Amazon prices for the product are better than anywhere else.  Delivery time excellent.  I needed product because a heart medicine and my age and thinning hair.  I have spoken with beauticians who have said this product is used by chemo patients and has helped in the hair loss.  Love it and use every time I wash my hair which is every day or every other day.</li>
    <li> The system does help reduce loss of hair. I would give the product five stars, the three star is for the misleading advertisement, the cleanser is 150 ml rather than 300 ml, the same volume as the scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> For about a month prior to purchase, I was shedding hair daily.  Almost as much hair as Aspen, my golden retriever.  Basically a comb full of hair each day.  This was a new phenomenon that started in Oct. 2014.  Maybe a  few strands would show up in the comb, but never a comb full.  On my next trip for a hair cut I mentioned it to Suzanne, lady who cuts my hair, and she suggested I give Nioxin a try.  So I did.  After about a week or two of using the System 1 my hair thinning slowed down and today, 3 months later, it is a rare occurrence to get one strand of hair in my comb.  What can I say, it works!  And yes on my next hair cut, just the other day, I was told the hair is thicker and there is new growth coming in.  I&#x27;m sold on it!</li>
    <li> My husband  used this product it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel fuller, cleans very effectively and seems to be re-growing hair.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery. Very satisfied :-)</li>
    <li> I know this product does not work for everyone but it has definitely worked for me.  I highly recommend picking this up and using on a daily basis for at least three months to see results.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if there is any hair growth yet but it does make your scalp feel really clean.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this system. And it made my hair look great. However, on step three, the spray on scalp treatment burned my head. All day I had a burning sensation on my scalp especially when I went into the sun. I accidentally got a few drops on my shoulder and my skin turned red instantly. If you have sensitive skin this may not be for you. But if you can handle a product like this it may be worth it...</li>
    <li> As my age progressed from cradle to coffin I noticed my hair was thinning and receding. My beautician (who is also my wine steward and podiatrist) recommended the Nioxin product. Now just a few months in to my treatment most of my friends call me simply the Lion as my entire body head to toe (including private parts) is covered in a thick cape of beautiful soft hair. I save so much money not buying winter clothes! Truly wonderful and wondrous.</li>
    <li> So far I can&#x27;t complain. I do feel my hair much healthier and softer. I do think it is a bit longer and thicker, I&#x27;m planning on buying the Shampoo and conditioner now, I still have the some treatment left.</li>
    <li> Show me the double blind placebo controlled study.  Not working yet.  Not done the bottles yet. We will give it 3 more weeks.</li>
    <li> I did not think it was possible. This product created to help balding cancer patients really does stop hair loss. I use it religiously. The only minor drawback is I have to visit the barber a bit more often but that is just fine by me!! THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have very thinning hair and I am only in my 20&#x27;s. Many stylists recommended this product to me. There was a noticeable difference within just a week of using it.  It&#x27;s been a month now and I really notice that my hair looks thicker and healthier and I lose less hair in the shower and while styling my hair. I will definitely be repurchasing this product when it runs out. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product has worked great on my very straight, yet frizzy hair. It gives some thickness and decent volume without weighing my hair down. It also takes care of the static and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used it too, but he has sensitive and dry skin on his scalp. It seems to have aggravated his dandruff and causes redness on his scalp. I have noticed redness too, but it quickly disappears for me. I believe this is from the peppermint oil contained in the system.</li>
    <li> It cleans your scalp without drying your hair and immediately stops hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. The only think is that it doesn’t provide enough moisture to be able to detangle your hair so what i do is that I only massage the conditioner into my scalp (Yes you can do this with this product bc it is non-oily) and then I use another conditioner that has argan oil in the ends, to keep my hair shiny and detangle it easily!</li>
    <li> Definitely see the result, but somehow expected more. I feel my hair get stronger. i am losing less, however i have been using the product for 3 weeks i might need more time.</li>
    <li> Great price and necessary item!</li>
    <li> For the wife and she loves this system. Her hair has been mistreated for most of her life and this seems to rectify her issues.</li>
    <li> I have only used this item for a month so perhaps that isn&#x27;t long enough to really give it a chance, not sure? However I have not noticed any difference in my hair at all. I bought this for balding at the scalp and thinning of the hair. If anything the product dried my hair out. I will not buy more but hope to find something that works.</li>
    <li> Since my hairdresser has started using these products on my hair I have experienced less hair loss, which was my goal.</li>
    <li> I really cannot tell if the product is doing what it is supposed to or not yet.  It apparently takes prolonged use for visible results.</li>
    <li> This Nioxin System works. Even though, I have used this product for a short time but my friends and I can see the results already. This is a great product and is helping me maintain the current level of hair and giving some much needed strength.</li>
    <li> I tried this a long time ago.This did nothing for my thinning hair. The scalp treatment irritated and burned my scalp but I kept using it thinking maybe that&#x27;s how it works but my hair kept falling out as usual. The shampoo does give my hair body though. That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about it. I tried hairmaxx pills a couple weeks and had to stop because it interacted with my allergy meds i didn&#x27;t have time to see results. I tried minoxidil for a few days and it burned my scalp and made more hair fall out.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to lose more hair to find out IF minoxidil might work so I gave that up too. I tried msm, iodine(seaweed form) and biotin 2 months, that slowed down the hair fall for only a short time. I desperately scoured the web and found the internet to be so full of bs about hairloss and everybody&#x27;s just trying to sell you something. I can&#x27;t afford to see doctors who probably won&#x27;t know anything about it and I don&#x27;t like taking drugs. After a lot of heartache and searching the web I found a site called hairloss-research.org. You might want to check it out especially if you&#x27;re a woman. There is a ton of information about  the causes including info about PCOS.  It says too much androgens can cause hair loss. They suggest for women spearmint tea 2x/day will reduce andgrogens (testosterone free floating in your blood) significantly in 5 days. That&#x27;s based on a study done in Turkey. I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s cheap and easy enough so I went to the store and got 3 boxes of bigelow plantation mint and mint medley but you can use whatever spearmint tea you like, and I drink 2 cups a day and within a couple days my scalp pain abated, by day 4 noticed a lot less hair coming out. No longer finding hairs on my shirt. After a week now I don&#x27;t see hairs coming out in the shower or brush, hair is shiny again and scalp pain is gone. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and entering menopause so it seems my problem could be hormonal. What&#x27;s interesting is they say inflammation is responsible for a lot of the underlying health issues which lead to hair loss and diet plays a huge role there and so I quit my daily cup of coffee too. I hope you will find this helpful and good luck.</li>
    <li> This works! must follow stepbystep for results. took about 2 treatments to see new growth. Also taking vitamins.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works! I noticed a difference after just 2 washes! I had chemo from July thru Dec &amp; was completely bald. Now I have tons of thick hair growing in. No doubt I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was way cheaper than buying it from the place I get my hair cut. Was VERY skeptical of it; was talked into trying it by the lady that cuts my hair. I have been losing my hair in the center of my head, and it was very noticable. After 3 months of using this product my hair has actually been growing back! (woohoo) The lady that cuts my hair commented how thick and full it is growing. I HAVE to get my hair cut every month now-but I&#x27;m not complaining! My hair is darker also-I&#x27;m 48 and was getting some gray, but I have less of it now. I waited over a year and finally tried it and am so glad I did! Not really a believer in stuff like this but I have to say it made a believer out of me. Guys, try it!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and as advertised. The cost was good - can&#x27;t buy here on the Island of Hawaii for any less.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews but decided to order this through Amazon. Very glad I did. This product is the exact same as you get from the beauty supply store but $40 cheaper!! Works and feels exactly the same and all of the ingredience match up with the store bought one. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My previous product works better than this.My hair became dry and I don&#x27;t see any improvement in making thick and strong enough hair.</li>
    <li> In a few months I&#x27;ll be turning 28 years old and I am starting to get a bit thin near the forehead area. Unfortunately baldness is quite prevalent on my mom&#x27;s side of the family... fearing the worst, I&#x27;ve decided to take some preventative measures to at least slow down the rate of thinning and shedding that&#x27;s been taking hold for the past few years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff appears to be working. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for several years now and If I would&#x27;ve continued losing hair at the rate that I was a few years ago, I should be bald by now. But I&#x27;m not even close! I still have a nice head of curly hair on my head and my hairline seems to be holding strong on the front lines of the war against male pattern baldness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell of both the shampoo and conditioner. They have a pretty strong peppermint scent to them and they make your scalp feel nice and tingly. I wish the scalp treatment sprayed in a mist instead of a steam because most it ends up just running down the sides of my head or onto my face. Sometimes the stuff can even leave red streaks from the increased blood flow it causes (I think there is niacin in there). Either way, the combination of the things in this kit have helped me to keep the hair I have and it helps with my dry scalp situation too. I used to flake pretty badly due to dry scalp, but this system seems to be keeping the flakes away far more than any dandruff shampoo has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good. Seems to be helping me keep the hair I have. Helps with dry scalp and prevents flaking.</li>
