<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best face wash I have ever used for my rosacea and dry skin, hands down. This saved my horrific skin and is also very light and soothing to use. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts but it has cut the oiliness on my face down by HALF throughout the day. I really love this product and if it were cheaper I&#x27;d keep a whole handful in stock at home but I gotta pay the bills, lol. Anyway, it has a nice, light orange scent and really get my pores clean without having to scrub my face which is unheard of for past skin care routines I&#x27;ve used. Seriously though, please consider reaching out and making more of these because this completely changed my skin and you have a customer for life. Whatever you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re doing it right! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Has a light fragrance that is clean and refreshing. Makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I feel that this cleanser is one of the best I&#x27;ve used... it deep cleans&lt;br /&gt;gently and had a wonderful fragrance PLUS it isn&#x27;t cost prohibitive!&lt;br /&gt;Combining this with the Vital C Hydrating Serum....Heaven !!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Smells wonderful..........used it the first time when I went to a spa for a facial and loved it enough that I came to Amazon and bought some for home use!</li>
    <li> Same product as my med spa has but costs less</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!  Your face is so smooth after you use it.  I also use the moisturizer and the eye treatment.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this daily wear facial cream and it has sunscreen too!!  Win/win!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic wash for dry or rosacea skin. If you are at all oily, it can give you trouble with clogged pores. Would be a great purchase for people with sensitive skin in cold, harsh climates. The product is as expected and similar quality to what I have purchased in salons.</li>
    <li> I purchased one a few months ago and when I received this one the container is totally different so I was a little perturbed. However I love the product it has a nice clean scent and is gentle to my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look and feel awesome!! Is helping with fine lines...pumps my skin up!</li>
    <li> This is a good bland and great product for prevent skin damage! I used every day before make up. Great!</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used for my clarasonic...love the way it works and has a pleasant scent!  This seller delivered as promised..would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This facal wash is great . I am not a big fan on cream facal wash but this one feels great , smells great and make my skin very soft . I have not had one breakout since I started using this product . I have tried other image products before and although this one in not my favorite I am glad I tried it . The only reason why this one is not my favorite is because it a cream and I prefer to use a soap form .</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and this cleanser is perfect for me.  It works well for me in the SW Florida climate.  I had originally purchased 2 yrs ago from a Salon here in Fort Myers.  This time purchased from Amazon at better price.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample by the aesthetician who had given me a facial.  I tucked it away in the bathroom cabinet and had forgotten about it for about a couple of weeks, when I came across it again.  I really liked the current cleanser I was using, but thought I would just give this a \\&quot;try\\&quot;.  This turned out to be the best cleanser I have ever used!!  Yes, the best!!  It does not foam up, and lathers slightly, with the end result of very soft, silky skin. (I use it with my Clarisonic face brush)  I had concerns about skin breakouts as well, but have not had any since using this product (for about 8 months now) It has a pleasant smell of orange and citrus, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an overbearing smell ( I hate perfumes).  I live in the desert, and this is perfect for my skin.  My face feels soft and hydrated, but not oily. This cleanser is a keeper!  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this as well.</li>
    <li> Took time to get used to this.  It is a cream &amp; doesn&#x27;t lather.  It does clean though- even washes my make up off.  Smells really good.  Not sure if my skin is improved but for sure, it isn&#x27;t breaking out or reacting.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different facial regiments, as I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts that get very sore. I use this stuff every morning, and don&#x27;t need any moisturizer. I still get blackheads, so at night I use Neutrogena all-in-one to get the dirt out of my pores. This will definitely remain in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years and I love it.  It hydrates and cleans my over 50 skin.  I&#x27;m use to paying a lot more for the product $35-45.00 so when I found it at cost it was a sell.  I have Amazon prime so I had in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Image Vital C products (all of them, cleanser, serum, cream, scrub and mask).  AWESOME PRODUCTS.  my face has never looked better.  Very smooth and even and no breakouts.  I used to breakout with anything else.  GREAT PRODUCT LINE and good investment for the price.</li>
    <li> I always thought I had oily skin, but had a facial one day and was told that my skin was actually more combo/dry, but was producing oil because I was stripping too much moisture from my face. She recommended this cleanser, and I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a year now. It&#x27;s awesome because it leaves my skin feeling clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. And it goes a long way - used once daily, one bottle lasts 3-5 months.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I swear by it!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband - he liked it.</li>
    <li> The foam feels fresh and hydration even while it cleanses. I&#x27;m a mid-aged lady with sensitive skin. These products hydrate and don&#x27;t clog pores or cause breakouts. My skin has less of a red undertone which is my natural state.</li>
    <li> Best feeling facial cleanser I have ever used.  I also buy the same Daily Defense moisterizer.  I would like to get the Daily Defense Moisterizer that is tinted, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it on-line.  Excellent products!</li>
    <li> I really love this! I usually use image skin care clear cell cleanser, and the vital c hydrating anti-aging serum. I noticed without the serum I get more flushed (I have rosacea). This works awesome when I use it at night in the shower, really helps reduce the redness and bumps even more. Now one of my staple products for my everyday routine for my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;VERY HAPPY! (:</li>
    <li> really heavy, almost like putting lotion on instead of cleaning face. just started using it, so will have to see what results i get from this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, sometimes I put it on my face, just to smell it!  Makes my face smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this product as much as all the other Vital C products I have tried. I like the Image Ormedic Facial Cleanser much better, a little goes along way. One bottle lasted me just over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly and I noticed my skin responding by the moisture my skin holds. My skin appears radiant. thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great face wash that is gentle on your skin! If you have a oily skin, this face wash won&#x27;t dry out your skin and will help reduce the oil production.</li>
    <li> I alternate this cleanser with a retinol cleanser which can be drying. Keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Smells so good and it feels so soft and smooth after one apply.  I love it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My skin can be challenging to manage.  It trends towards dry, but I sometimes get clogged pores which result in fine bumps across my nose.  Cleansers with salicylic acid are typically too harsh for my skin and also dry it out.  High emollient cleansers result in uncharacteristic acne for me.  I had been using a basic glycerin cleanser to keep my skin soft and moisturized, and a prescription acne medicine to control the bumps across my nose.  While this routine was adequate, my skin was just looking dull and tired.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of cleansers, so when I received the cheapish looking bottle of Vital C in the mail, my expectations were low.  Boy was I wrong!!  This cleanser not only leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but it has allowed me to discontinue use of my prescription acne medication because all the bumps across my nose have vanished.  After a couple of weeks use, my skin started looking brighter, fresher, smoother, and more even.  I&#x27;ve even stopped wearing make-up to work some days, which is something I&#x27;ve NEVER done before.  Image Vital C is definitely the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and love the way it cleanses and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE Image products. I have Rosacea and the Vital C line is perfect year round for me. No irritation nor dryness.</li>
    <li> Really nice texture to this cream type cleanser. It&#x27;s nourishing however doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy. Effectively removes make up and leaves the skin feeling soft, refreshed and moisturized. Feels very gentle. I had to stop using Image Ageless Total cleanser as I found it quite drying around my nose. Lovely orange fragrance too.</li>
    <li> I first used this product in a spa, and absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice and smells really good! (It smells like a sweet tangerine and gives the user a sense of freshness).&lt;br /&gt;Let me mention that I have a very dry skin.  I jug outdoors and therefore I am exposed to the sun.  When I went for a facial to the spa, the lady recommended this product because of my dry skin.  I tried it and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t purchase it from the spa shop since the amazon listing was cheaper.  Ordered the product from an amazon seller and started using right after I received it.&lt;br /&gt;At the spa, I was told to use it every morning and every night, however, I only use it at night to clean my face.  After applying it on my face and neck, I rub it for about a minute until my skin absorbs it. It absorbs smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers!  Then as it&#x27;s instruction says, I wash my face with cold water.  It actually seems like my skin shines after washing my face and I feel the freshness!&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I apply the moisturizing cream of the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very dry skin but after using this product and it&#x27;s moisturizer, I have to admit that my skin is no longer as dry as it was before.  I have noticed an improvement in less than a week of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a dry skin.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product on a regular basis, I have gotten more &amp;#34;you have lovely skin or a beautiful complexion&amp;#34; than I can count. It smells fresh with the scent of oranges and is gentle on one&#x27;s skin. I can softly wipe off the day&#x27;s make up grime with a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! And it came super quick!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  Keeps my face soft and subtle.  Even when I go for facials they comment how clean my face it.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Just starting using it. Already love it.</li>
    <li> Image is my go-to brand.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products from this line and I really like this skin cleanser.  It is gentle, which is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star because I love this product.  I use Daily Defense products and can tell a major difference as far as hydration and smoothness.  I recommend the Daily Defense serum and mask and also the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love it and it gets the skin sooooo clean.</li>
    <li> This keeps my face soft and moisturized.  It smells good and helps me look younger.  My skin was dry and this fixed it. I am surprised that this is being sold here though. Image company requires that it only be sold through medical facilities and practitioners.  I am glad though because it was half the cost.</li>
    <li> Image Vital C Hydrating facial cleanser makes my skin feel fresh and thoroughly clean, but not dried out at all!</li>
    <li> I love this product because I have sensitive skin and uneven skin tone it makes my face smoother and my make up goes on better.</li>
    <li> I buy this product regularly now. Being over 50, I have to minimize dryness as well as wrinkles. This product is better than most.</li>
    <li> Product packaging was not original , I know this bcause i am an estetician &amp; I have ordered this product directly from Inage skincare. Product insidevthe bottle is ok.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, and want cosmeceutical product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Smells great, like oranges and doesn&#x27;t dry out my 48 year old skin!</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin, I love all image products</li>
    <li> Smells great and very hydrating without being oily. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love my face lotion! Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Got this originally as a sample from an esthetician.  Just loved how creamy it was and didn&#x27;t leave my face dried out.</li>
    <li> My face gets dried out alot when using facial cleansing products. So I thought to give this one a try. It is a cream cleanser so it worked on my face. I massage it around my face for 20 seconds or so and then rinse it. My face feels nice and smooth and soft. Not dried out like some other products do.</li>
    <li> My go-to for facial wash! It does an amazing job plus it smells wonderful! I originally purchased in an office while having a facial. Much cheaper on Amazon for the same great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and don&#x27;t notice a difference either way which is a good thing.  Not drying, no blackheads and great price.  I love that it is paraban free.  I use this along with the Vital C Serum and Night cream.  I use the Hydrating night cream during the day only because I haven&#x27;t bought the day cream yet.  On my way to getting the whole regimen.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this line! I was given a sample at the spa and fell in love from the start. My skin is glowing! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product on my skin. Love it even more now that I can find it here for half the price as it is in stores.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bother me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying out my face.  It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well but is super gentle and moisturizing. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleanser and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I feel like I get a great skin wash everytime I use this. It is good for all skin types, non drying and very hydrating!</li>
    <li> I bought this after having a facial, on the recommendation of the aesthetician. It is wonderful for cleansing without leaving my face too dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and am very satisfied.  It has a nice tinging sensation due to the vitamin C I think, yet is not too harsh for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face so soft and clean, it&#x27;s almost like I really don&#x27;t need a moisturizer after cleansing.  I highly recommend to anyone with mature skin to clean withot drying.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is so gentle, yet it contains enzymes that are exfoliating (without burning/tingling), so my skin is glowing after I use it! It&#x27;s not a foaming cleanser - you use a small amount on dry skin, then rinse or wipe off (similar to cetaphil). I use this cleanser in the morning when a harsh cleanser isn&#x27;t necessary, to give me a nice glow to start the day. I have oily skin that is sensitive, and this is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for 10 years. It&#x27;s pricy, but a bottle will last for months as you don&#x27;t need much. It&#x27;s especially nice in the winter when my skin needs a little extra moisture.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it cleans your skin as thoroughly as it should. I use it as a morning cleanser rather than a nightly cleanser bc it doesn&#x27;t seem to get my makeup off too well. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It feels great, smells wonderful and I appreciate the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use water with it.  You can message it in then wipe it off with a tissue, leaving you skin clean without feeling stripped.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser after being out on the salt water &amp; my face feels like it was sand-blasted.  It&#x27;s very soothing, creamy &amp; leaves your skin feeling so soft &amp; nice.  Highly recommend this creamer.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product 5 yrs ago and have not found a product that is better. My face stays hydrated through the harsh winter and it is gentle enough on my sensitive skin. I love this product</li>
    <li> I love how well this cleanser removes toxins and impurities, and the way it makes my skin feel after a shower.  The only downfall is that the jar is tiny and if you use it everyday it won&#x27;t last long.  Image is an amazing brand, specifically the Vital C line, but it is pricey and the bottle should be twice the size for the money.</li>
    <li> My estetician suggested this because I needed a cream cleanser instead of a gel. This is so creamy and I love putting it on. The smell is amazing and fresh too, not artificial smelling. I hadn&#x27;t used this line before but I really do like how soft my face is and it seems to help with the overall dryness.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good cleanser for my chronically pissed off skin and this is it! Up until now everything that I have tried left me with red angry skin so I&#x27;m thankful for both the image vital C cleanser and hydrating cream. I bought these here on Amazon after using samples from my salon facial  for two weeks. its rich but light, very gentle, smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My girlfriend who is married to a plastic surgeon suggested I try it, and I have been using it ever since. It is not cheap, but well worth it. Highly recommend for people with rosacea.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin moisturized and soft.... No need for a toner after cleansing with this product! If you have dry skin this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a salon I received a facial from months ago and it was $26. I found it here a lot cheaper. I love this stuff. When I ran out of this I went and bought some other brand (Ponds, I think) but that made my face feel super dry. This Vital C leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized and it smells pretty good too (smells like citrus). I will keep buying this because it does exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> Love this hydrating cleanser for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is my second bottle that I have purchased. I use a damp wash cloth and massage into my skin and it takes off my make-up no problem. I love Image products and I&#x27;m glad that I can purchase them at a lower price thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and refreshing orange scent</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to order this off amazon but I&#x27;m sooooo happy I did. I couldn&#x27;t find a single spa that carried this anywhere around Tampa. I have very very sensitive combination skin and my skin LOVES this product and my skin looks so healthy now. Thank God I was able to order this from amazon!</li>
    <li> I totally love this cleanser (hard to find) as it helps to keep my rosacea at bay. Feels nice on my skin and does not irritate it.</li>
    <li> I will give this product a 5 stars! it won&#x27;t make my skin dry. I would recommend this to all skin type.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, gentle face wash that has a very creamy texture.  It really doesn&#x27;t lather but cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  If you have dry skin this is the face cleaner for you.</li>
    <li> The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
    <li> I use it for years! All my friends love this cleanser! Good business!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works wonders for me.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product with glycoric acid and love this one.  It has an orange scent that makes it feel so fresh.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it. Amazon didn&#x27;t carry it when I was using it before</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser that I have EVER used!  Smooth, creamy, non-greasy, wonderful smelling (like oranges) and cleans beautifully.  Enough said?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my face fresh and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I love Image Vital C facial cleanser!  I have never been brand loyal before.  I have pretty average combination skin: maybe get a pimple or two once a month, slightly oily in the T zone and slightly dry everywhere else.  I have used everything from expensive department store brands, high end luxury products, to Wal-Mart&#x27;s finest (as well as their cheapest).  I&#x27;ve never found anything I really got too excited about.  I went to an open house at a local spa and in their gift bag they included a full sized bottle of Image Vital C cleanser.  I tried it that night and immediately fell in love with the light citrus scent.  Even my husband who is very sensitive to smell and generally doesn&#x27;t like anything scented commented that it smelled really great.  I continued using it for a couple of weeks and loved how soft and smooth my skin was.  My combination skin was less dramatic - the oily zone not quite as oily and the dry zones not quite as dry.  Nice!  I wasn&#x27;t breaking out - but I don&#x27;t do that often anyway.  Then, a couple of months later I had an extreme reaction to a prescription and ended up with a large area of my face being overcome with a tissue killing rash and in many places blistering and turning into huge open wounds.  It looked like a handful of acid had wrapped around my face, ear and neck.  It was awful.  As I recovered the Vital C was the perfect thing to keep the area clean and yet not burn or hurt when it touched the broken, healing skin.  It claims to be good for post-surgical skin, and I give it a bit of credit for having minimal scarring.  I am fair skinned and heavily freckled, so the new tissue is very noticeable still (8 months later) - but only because it doesn&#x27;t have any freckles.  The skin is nice and firm and healthy and not red or puckered or scarred.  I just hope the freckles fill in over time - but I can&#x27;t count on any product to do that!  I&#x27;m now a loyal Vital C user.  I buy it in the spa sized bottle when the deal is right because I know this is the only thing I want to use summer and winter.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This was my favorite of the image but didn&#x27;t over time make a difference! It was fabulous as far as taking off makup(I only wore tinted moisturizer). Smells great! Not drying! I had to stop using after a year it was not cleaning well my pores were clogging even though I was using Image line (per my estetician).</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. I have stopped having beakouts since I started using it, and it feels really refreshing on my face.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best Cleanser on the MARKET</li>
    <li> product fine, hate the forced follow up</li>
    <li> i love this face wash. I have acne prone dry sensitive skin..this works amazing.i have not broken out much since using it almost a year now</li>
    <li> I finally did some research on this (old) product. It has been tested and assessed as hazardous and toxic at ewg.org  [...]  I&#x27;ve noticed that switching to this product, thinking it&#x27;ll be healthier than Oil of Olay (which I used for a decade), has damaged my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Ready to order again.</li>
    <li> I really love this facial cleanser and will look into other products by this company</li>
    <li> This has always been a favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product it hydrating for my dry older skin, my only grip is it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup but that&#x27;s a small issue. Love ordering them from you fast speedy supply thanks.</li>
    <li> the reason I order this product was because I received a gift for my birthday which was a facial and this was the product which the place were I went used. the cost at the salon was extremely  high so I decided to purchase from Amazon. which I really liked. the product is very good I purchased only the facial cleaner because I have moisture and sermon left from my prev order</li>
    <li> Great for your skin snd smells great</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;IMAGE&amp;#34; products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
    <li> I had a facial and this was part of the product used. my skin  feels rejuvinated after using all the product line.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Daughter who loves Image this smells great like oranges and leaves her face refreshed and clean</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and smells great for men or women.  And it&#x27;s not greasy.  I highly recommend it.  Been using it for more than two years now.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. It&#x27;s very gentle and formulated for Rosacea.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The vital c face wash (at night) and the ormedic face wash(in. Morning)  work great for balancing out my acne, oily skin. However great for any skin type. Vital c keeps down the redness. A lot of people with acne are afraid of putting moisture on the skin. I was the same way. but ive learned that this actually lets the bacteria that is already there come out rather than building up under the skin forming a nasty traped sist zit, which is a result of drying and blocking it. Your skin still needs healthy moisture. The ormedic is a wonder organic face wash that works and doesnt use harnful chemicals on your skin. No over dryness. Healthy and good for your skin. It is recomemned to wash twice ( with any face wash) to ensure cleanlyness. The first washes oil n dirt off the seconed actually washes the skin itself. If u dont want the expense of using it twice than use another face wash ( equate proactive)  for the first wash than the image face wash for the seconed. I also use their sunscreen, hyaluronic serum, vital c moisturizer/or mask and sometimes ormedic mask and resurfising mask.  These products are great.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past, and this is the first time ordering from Amazon instead of the dermatologist.  It tingles when putting on, but really leaves your face feeling great.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time and love it.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful scent and leaves your face soft and very clean. Just a small amount needed and I use it on my neck also. Has no drying effect at all.  Have use for about three years  now and completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Nice citrus fragrance, leaves skin hydrated, not stripped. Would use a weekly scrub, to remove residue that this cleaner is unable to.</li>
    <li> This is the very best cleanser I have ever put on my face!  My face feels cleaner and smoother and I look younger for it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have very complicated adult onset acne plus on occasion dryness with eczema.  This product is my favorite for the winter months.  My face cleared up within 3 days of using this product.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This serum is outstanding.  It is very light and you only need a small amount to leave your skin feeling totally refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It smells very nice too. It is easy to use and mild for m sensitive skin.  I have been using it about 4 months and have already reordered another bottle. Great product.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser cleans your face without drying it out and the vitamin C does wonders for keeping your skin healthy.  I love Image Skincare!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle, cleans well, smells nice and leaves my skin soft. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and have used other Image Skincare products.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for years now, it cleans face and really make it look good.&lt;br /&gt;I will only use this from now on</li>
    <li> I ordered on recommendation of a skincare technician, however then learned it was not a good product for my skin type. I returned with no problem.  I would definitely reorder from this seller.</li>
    <li> used forever, great stuff</li>
    <li> I had to give this product 3 stars because of the packaging.  It is extremely difficult to remove the product from the bottle.  the flip top part of the cap has broken, and I am really having a problem with it.  I love the smell of the product and have been using it on the advice of my physician.  I just wish the packaging would be changed.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very dry skin that also breaks out and this has been the only cleanser she can use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for all skin types</li>
    <li> My neice uses these products, and so do I.  This is some good stuff.  It makes your face feel clean.</li>
    <li> awesome product, love the entire line of Vital C  product came quickly</li>
    <li> Product is not good for oily skin.  It does not remove all makeup from face.  I used a makeup remover after cleansing and my face was still full of makeup.  I asked seller to return product and they told me they would only give me 30% of the price which is clearly BS!  I ended up keeping the cleanser instead and now it is only collecting dust in my cabinet!</li>
    <li> cleans your face without drying your skin out . love it use it every day</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, very gentle and very moisturizing. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to clean your skin, so its well worth the money.</li>
    <li> A spa I went to used this as a cleanser during a facial and was recommended for my skin type (combination oily with HUGE pores :/ ). I LOVE the smell, it&#x27;s not overdrying (although I normally put coconut oil on my face afterward anyway) and it really cleans my skin. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on makeup or skincare products, but man-worth every penny! I won&#x27;t use anything else! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The product easily cleans off make-up. I did not realize how much it hydrated my skin until I stopped using it for a while!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this cleanser is always my go to.  Cleans well and not drying.  Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and have bad reactions to a lot of products. I bought this product after a facial and love it. It doesn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup well, but other than that, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m allergic to eye makeup remover, but someone told me to try baby shampoo and this works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes!</li>
    <li> Great smell and seems to really clean my skin.  I am giving this a 4 star because the packaging could be better.  Would prefer a pump to not have to squeeze out so much from the bottle each time.  Then again if you are an avid gym goer, this is portable and easy to take to the gym.  I am not one for scents normally, but it is a very nice &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; smell to start and finish the day with.  Yes it does take off makeup pretty well and I use this with my clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- No stripping&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin smooth and fresh&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be non-drying and great for my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None unless you prefer a pump to control how much cleanser you use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Image line I also use their lip shine which is pepperminty and leaves a descent shine on the lips.</li>
    <li> Received January 2nd and this product is wonderful - -the best!</li>
    <li> Love it! Worth the money, makes your complexion soft and hydrated. When used with moisturizer more of a plus. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I was having a problem keeping my face moisturized and this product did an amazing job at fixing this problem. My face feels moisturized and smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2+ years and found it to be excellent.  As my skin has aged I have moved on to a different cleanser though.  Would recommend this product for anyone seeking a good, hydrating cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this entire line! Glad to see it being sold on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any skin type.  It leaves skin smooth, not oily.  If I could afford it, I would use is to clean my whole body.  It smells fresh like orange blossoms.  Product arrived in good shape and more quickly than anticipated.</li>
    <li> this product does everything it says it does I&#x27;m a first time user and I love the product. will return to purchase more</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this cleanser just recently and fell in love with it. Top notch quality! Better price on line compared to what I paid it the spa.</li>
    <li> It smells really fresh and cleans the skin without stripping it of natural oils. I&#x27;ll continue using this. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this since it cleans your skin without drying it out. You do have to wash it off a little more then most products. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about 6 years and love it.  It is gentle but effective.  The price is  better online than I was paying at the Spa.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  It gets dry and irritated, and it breaks out.  I have been using this cleanser for many years, and get lots of compliments on my skin.  It is great for sensitive skin and a little bit of the cleanser goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - My skin is glowing!</li>
    <li> This is the only facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Plus, it has anti-aging properties, so it does it all.  Highly recommend to those with sensitive skin and who can&#x27;t use any facial cleansers with oil in it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it does what it says...Hydrates your skin without drying your skin out.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this from my facialist and loved it but of course I&#x27;m an Amazon person so reordered it twice. I always have 2 on hand- 1 in the shower and 1 by my sink. Fabulous face wash especially for dry skin but it&#x27;s good for all!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and have NO complaints.  It has kept my skin very well hydrated.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> This is light and creamy but not greasy.  It cleanses very well and gently.  I use it all over my face - even on my eyes for mascara even though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not recommended.  I love it!  I love all of the Image skin care that I have tried.  It makes your face feel great!</li>
    <li> I have used the Image Vital C Hydrating cleanser for several years and love it. It is gentle, cleans well without drying my skin and has a really nice citrus smell. I am in my 40&#x27;s, so it is important to me that I use products that actually work with my skin and offer some sort of benefit. Image is a pharmaceutical-grade product and I will continue to use as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for sensitive and/or combination skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to strip your skin of its natural oil and yet your face feels clean after using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance and smoothness of the facial cleanser just fine for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> One of my standby favorites...cleans without stripping the skin and maintains the moisture for my dry skin as I age.</li>
    <li> This is the product used on me and recommended by my aesthetician.  It works very well - cleanses thoroughly and gently.  It&#x27;s best to wipe it off with a wet cloth as opposed to rinsing.</li>
    <li> My wife turned me onto this product. It works great and you have a hint of oranges on you as well.</li>
    <li> This line of products are great! They aren&#x27;t harsh on your skin, and it gently cleanses your face. I love it and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle and creamy and makes my face feel clean, but doesn&#x27;t strip skin of moisture.  Since my aesthetician stopped carrying it, it&#x27;s great to be able to purchase here.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t wow you at first, but as someone with rosacea, it&#x27;s the most unharmful product I&#x27;ve found :)  It&#x27;s calming.  However, I paid extra to ship overnight and the shipper was not on the ball and found all my neighbor&#x27;s homes, but not mine.  Annoying.  The product arrived after I left for an international vacation.  In fact, it&#x27;s still at my neighbor&#x27;s house, it was never delivered to me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, I love Image products of all kinds.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is the first cleanser I have ever used consitantly. I like the way my skin feels from using it and I love the hint of orange fragance. I have very sensitive skin and after 6 mos of using this product I haven&#x27;t had one issue.</li>
    <li> Caused me and also daughter to break out and we never have issues with breakouts</li>
    <li> This works. Leaves my skin soft and smooth after use. Removes make-up (you may have to use more of the product depending on how much make-up you use). At first, I saw not much benefit in using this but I started to massage it longer on my face until the cream becomes translucent. Do not do a quick massage then rinse. Be patient and massage until translucent and then wash off. This is my favorite facial cleanser so far. I also use Boscia, Dermalogica &amp; Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Has a mild scent of orange and is light&lt;br /&gt;and feels great on the skin.  You only need&lt;br /&gt;a small amount which is fabulous.</li>
    <li> bought this from my derma salon, and found it here at a better price, just cant live without this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve never been able to find a face cleanser that worked well for my very dry skin. This is different. The citrus aroma is heavenly and the hydrating lotion feels wonderful as you massage it around your face.  I actually look forward to cleaning my face every night!</li>
    <li> This is a great hydrating skin care product. Would definately purchase it again. Very interested in trying additional Image products</li>
    <li> My skin glows!  You must try this skin care. My wellness doctor recommemned it to me and my skin looks radiant and I&#x27;m 53.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my estetician.  I love it and will keep using it.  Great line of facial products that do seem to help.</li>
    <li> Have used this another cleanser by same company for several years, works very well.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best facial cleanser, especially w/ my sensitive skin and I suffer from rosacea.  I no longer have the winter-dryness, nor the patchy dry skin during the Spring/Summer.  You don&#x27;t need to use much, and I leave it on for a few minutes.  I usually wet my finger tips and massage to get a little lather before rinsing &amp; rinse w/ cold water.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and looks younger, too (i&#x27;m in my upper 40&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am greatful I am able to find this skin care products on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The main reason I didn&#x27;t like this product is that it doesn&#x27;t create a lather, which didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clean. The only thing I liked about it was the scent, but I&#x27;d never order it again.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!  Removes makeup, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Leaves it moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to reduce redness.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love it. It smell like oranges and is so refreshing and hydrating BUT...every time it use I break out with this huge cystic acne ) :</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I have very, very dry skin and acne rosacea which leaves my skin stripped very easily with other cleansers. I was recommended this product from an esthetician after getting a Vitamin C facial and I now use this cleanser, Image&#x27;s Daily Matte Moisturizer with SPF and a brightening face wash by Image. My skin is not nearly as red, its much more hydrated and putting on makeup is easier than ever. A lot of my actual acne comes from foods I eat (shrimp, ramen noodles, etc) and if I cut those foods from my diet completely I get no acne at all and if I do, it&#x27;s cleared up within a few days from start to finish if I wash my face with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used Dr. Hauscka&#x27;s and it is good but this is even more hydrating. To give you the other side of the story though...my husband(who has oily skin and can&#x27;t stand lotion period) was desperate one day and used it-he hated it. He had to wash his face again because he felt like something was on it.&lt;br /&gt;So again I say it is very hydrating and will leave your face feeling full of  moisture.</li>
    <li> I have used this pricy for 3 years and it is a quality skin care product</li>
    <li> I love Image Skincare but I don&#x27;t love the Vital C line. I love the Ageless (silver label) line the best.&lt;br /&gt;But I do have to say I have a LOT of allergies and this line seems to bother me. I do tend to have acne&lt;br /&gt;breakouts too when I use the serum and get dry patches from the &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; repair cream (why is it&lt;br /&gt;dehydrating me??)... my aesthetician claims the serum is bringing out all of the impurities and that is why it&lt;br /&gt;is breaking me out.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It&#x27;s the best to help with redness.  I received the item promptly, and the item was sealed to prevent leakage.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff...and it does not smell bad. this was the most affordable place we could find this product</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to have younger skin. The product has a rich orange scent and gives my face a glow. I have been using the product for three months now and will not ever use anything else.</li>
</ol>
