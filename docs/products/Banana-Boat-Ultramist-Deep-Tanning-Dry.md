      <li>So far, this is a perfect fix.</li>
      <li>I have always love banana boat for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t make that under 50 any more, so banana boat it is.</li>
      <li>I love Banana Boat Sunscreen.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s spray sputtered and top leaked.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted for a good price</li>
      <li>Love it, lightweight and easy to carry</li>
      <li>goes on clear, smells great</li>
      <li>I do tan easily</li>

      <li>Seller refunded my money right away no questions asked.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite sunblocks, just enough spf not to get burned</li>

      <li>THANKS MUCH.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but dries almost immediately and provides good coverage without rubbing it in.  </li>
      <li>What a time to be alive!</li>
      <li>I got in the pool barely a minute after putting it on, floated for an hour and a half with no re-application, and had no burn, just light tan lines.</li>
      <li>(so I can&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who isn&#x27;t used to spending a lot of time in the sun with little to no coverage), but until using this I tended to burn a bit the first couple of times in the sun during the summer.  </li>

<li> it does not allow the sand to stick to you like other oils...</li>
<li> It does noting, but help to burns you, not good at all</li>

    <li> Love it, lightweight and easy to carry</li>
    <li> This brand is my goto sunscreen. I buy the 4, 8, and 15 for whenever I am on a tropical vacation. The smell is pleasant, the sunscreen goes on evenly, and it does not feel overly oily. The only lighter sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used is the neutragena ultra sheer but they don&#x27;t make that under 50 any more, so banana boat it is.</li>
    <li> Great tanning product, especially when you are tanning in the sand it does not allow the sand to stick to you like other oils...</li>
    <li> Works well, not greasy and the price is good.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this tanning oil. She refuses to use anything else!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen sprays on and protects you from the sun. What a time to be alive!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for a good price</li>
    <li> I have always love banana boat for quite awhile. And getting this from Amazon my first time was a great in price wise I think I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and works as advertised. Keeps your skin from peeling (as long as you don&#x27;t get burnt of course). Also protects you at a low level from the sun and bronzes your skin. Never feel like I have dry skin after using this product like others out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Florida and have tried every sunscreen there is, I think. I love Banana Boat Sunscreen. It sprays a fine cool mist, never oily! Nice seller too. Got a defective can that&#x27;s spray sputtered and top leaked. Seller refunded my money right away no questions asked. That&#x27;s trust......that&#x27;s Amazon</li>
    <li> goes on clear, smells great</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning product.  Use to be for years a Coppertone girl - but once you try this product you will change over as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but dries almost immediately and provides good coverage without rubbing it in.  I got in the pool barely a minute after putting it on, floated for an hour and a half with no re-application, and had no burn, just light tan lines. I do tan easily (so I can&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who isn&#x27;t used to spending a lot of time in the sun with little to no coverage), but until using this I tended to burn a bit the first couple of times in the sun during the summer.  So far, this is a perfect fix.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day all year. I use it as my after shower lotion and my suntan oil in the summer and just my shower spray the rest of the year . I love the fact that it&#x27;s an oil but a dry one so it&#x27;s not slimey. I can&#x27;t find SPF4 anywhere else but Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite sunblocks, just enough spf not to get burned and I get a great tan from it.</li>
    <li> It does noting, but help to burns you, not good at all</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere for this price. Great price and good quality product for the outdoors</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC SELLER.  GREAT PRODUCT AND I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED.  THANKS MUCH.  5 STAR SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rene</li>
    <li> Perfect for summer &amp; a great price!!!</li>
