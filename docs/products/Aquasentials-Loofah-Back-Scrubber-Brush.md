### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So happy I bought it!</li>
      <li>Looks great!</li>
      <li>Excellent product</li>
      <li>And the price was great!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally found out the best solution was to go prison style and jam it forcefully up into the loofah.</li>
      <li>luffa sponges themselves are absolutely awesome!  </li>
      <li>The loofa is ample and the style is excellent.  </li>
      <li>Look what it has going for it: a very good Loofah,and a stick.</li>
      <li>good scrubber but not the best quality</li>
      <li>worked great for 3 uses</li>
      <li>Great Loofah and stick.....</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t tell me you have quality tested this product and are proud to sell it.</li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>That is a great idea.  </li>
      <li>Great price, good product.</li>
      <li>if I can prevent even one person from being ripped off then that would be good.</li>
      <li>its a good idea but needs work to keep the handle attached.</li>
      <li>(so it scrubs good).  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved it.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly (in fact, a day before it was scheduled) and it works great.</li>
      <li>This one of a kind loofah on a stick will tickle your pickle and scrub your bubs.</li>
      <li>To each their own.  </li>
      <li>Some people love them though and good for them.  </li>
      <li>What kind of glue is this??  </li>
      <li>Swissco Deluxe Bath Brush, Tortoise 1 ea]]</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Loofah comes off very easily.</li>
      <li>This product would be good, except for one very important thing -- it falls apart during the first use!  </li>
      <li>A couple truss head tacks would to a much better job of holding it together.</li>
      <li>[...]    I think you will be more than pleased with this one,  heck,  </li>
      <li>thought it would be used more than it is</li>
      <li>make keep a bath more enjoyful</li>
      <li>the&lt;br /&gt;product deserves better.</li>
      <li>I would of like this even better.</li>
      <li>What more can you say.</li>
      <li>I very much love</li>
      <li>your money and buy something better.  </li>
      <li>its not a horrible loofa after it broke</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>The handle is made of nice wood and very handy for scrubbing your back.</li>
      <li>There is no way to secure the loofah to the handle, so the product is better described as a loofah and a stick.  </li>
      <li>The handle makes it easy to reach all parts of the body.</li>
      <li>Aside from the unstable grip, the loofah top part just came right off as I was struggling to use it!  </li>
      <li>is warm water first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty much thrilled with this thing.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice loofah brush, but it came off the handle the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i just put the stick through the hole in the sponge and it works fine</li>
      <li>I thought this would be great having a handle and all, but the glue holding it on was cheap and the thing fell apart on the second use.</li>
      <li>This is more useful as a cat toy.</li>
      <li>However this one was really cheap.</li>
      <li>but once you turn on the shower the Loofah softens and provides a great scrub for your back.</li>
      <li>Unlike many people, mine did NOT fall off with the first use.</li>
      <li>This product works great, but the head detaches from the handle too easily, especially during a good back scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>It looks great hanging in my shower by the cute little rope on the end.  </li>
      <li>, i would say try another loofa, this isnt anything special....</li>
      <li>But for all other area&#x27;s it is great.</li>
      <li>Skip it and spend a little more money, or buy some good waterproof glue along with it...</li>
      <li>I guess some super glue would help.</li>
      <li>The very first time I tried to use it, the sponge fell off the stick.....</li>
      <li>The loofah fell off of the stick the very first time that I used it.</li>
      <li>Online this looked like a great Loofah because it didn&#x27;t look as big and bulky as what one normally sees in the stores.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband &amp; the first time he used it, the sponge came off from the stick!</li>
      <li>Great little body scrubbing brush.</li>
      <li>so I really scrub good enough.  </li>
      <li>] I couldn&#x27;t find effective relief for my itchy back.    </li>
      <li>luffa sponges think they are the best product out there for my sensitive skin, however until coming across the hands free big bear luffa back scrubber</li>
      <li>On the other hand, I &#x27;m the type of person that likes to find the bright side of things</li>
      <li>The glue is not the right adhesive for the product.  </li>
      <li>Had to go right out and replace with one from a store I could see before buying.</li>
      <li>So I took it right off and used it by hand.  </li>
      <li>I guess you could find the right glue and glue it back - but life is short, and this product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Nowhere near as nice as the old one it replaces.</li>
      <li>Put simply, this is a cheap sponge placed on the end of a cheap stick.</li>
      <li>I was very much looking forward to receiving this product, but when my shipment came in the company did not place my product in with my shipment.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was able to put it back on and it falls off sometimes</li>
      <li>First let me start by saying,</li>
      <li>Sponge part fell off first time using.</li>
      <li>At first I was not going to write a review</li>
      <li>the loofa unglued itself after first use.</li>
      <li>Fell apart the first shower.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product as a gift, and it arrived fast!  </li>
      <li>The head fell off during the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
      <li>Used it this AM for the first time and it immediately detached from the handle.</li>
      <li>The Loofah is &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the stick with, I assume, a water soluble glue, because on first use it came unstuck.</li>
      <li>The first time I picked up the brush, the loofah fell off the handle.  </li>
      <li>My first seperated and fell off during the first use.  </li>
      <li>The scrubber slipped off the wood handle on the first try.</li>
      <li>As with everyone else, this thing fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The problem was that the loofah fell off of the stick the first time it was used.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for scrubbing hard to reach areas on the back.</li>
      <li>Great price and came earlier than expected</li>
      <li>,it makes your skin feel clean and alive.</li>
      <li>Only 10 minutes of light use and the sponge fell right off.  </li>
      <li>i can barely get it to fit around the shelf hanger in my shower.</li>
      <li>The one good thing I can say, is that the sponge material is nice and firm, does not get too soft when wet</li>
      <li>absolute garbage, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>This really limits the surface area that the glue can be adhered to.</li>
      <li>the sponge tip is cylindrical and the handle is straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the product but the handle seemed to loosen after second use.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great having a handle and all, but the glue holding it on was cheap and the thing fell apart on the second use.</li>
    <li> Nowhere near as nice as the old one it replaces. the sponge tip is cylindrical and the handle is straight. Hard to use for old creaky body.</li>
    <li> The sponge on this back scrubber is just way too hard. The product info claims \\&quot;Loofah soften when wet\\&quot;, which is technically true, but only insofar as it goes from the consistency of coarse sandpaper to that of a scouring pad.    Furthermore, after only a few uses, the sponge has already started separating from the wooden backing.    I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> As with everyone else, this thing fell apart the first time I used it. It&#x27;s not even worth it to send it back. Just a waste of five bucks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this piece of junk and it fell apart. When I reported it the company stated they would replace the item but surprise..they never did. DO NOT BUT!</li>
    <li> As with others who bought this I should have listened to what they wrote and heeded the warnings.  Only 10 minutes of light use and the sponge fell right off.  The glue is not the right adhesive for the product.  You would think that after other customers complaining of the same problem they would fix it or stop selling the item.  Its not worth the time to bother to return.  I can only warn others that the glue used to glue the sponge on does not hold.  In less than 10 minutes of light scrubbing the sponge fell off.  Guess I will use some silicone to affix the sponge to the handle and keep using it.  For the price I am not going to waste my time trying to package it up and get it shipped back.</li>
    <li> its not a horrible loofa after it broke i just put the stick through the hole in the sponge and it works fine, i would say try another loofa, this isnt anything special....</li>
    <li> Others have had the same experience I had...a poor one!  The adhesive that holds the sponge portion on the wood simply does not hold up.  My first seperated and fell off during the first use.  The second began loosening and fell off within 3 uses.  Don&#x27;t waiste your money!</li>
    <li> poorly glued or just a bad product - either way, I now have a useless back scrubber. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> The 2nd time this was used, the sponge came off the wooden handle.  This was truly a waste!</li>
    <li> thought it would be used more than it is</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would help exfoliate my skin that I could use with my moisturizing body wash &amp; this was definitely it! I have sensitive skin, but this is gentle while still getting the job done. So happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> The loofah portion fell off of the brush backing immediately- had to glue that back on.  The whole \\&quot;removable\\&quot; brush assembly does not stay on the handle, so it \\&quot;removes\\&quot; itself.  I&#x27;ll have to glue that part as well.  Skip it and spend a little more money, or buy some good waterproof glue along with it...</li>
    <li> The item fell off the stick as soon as it hit water.  It was a piece of crap, a waste of money and I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> Works really well in the shower, nice thick loofah for scrubbing that does not get soft.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift, and it arrived fast!  It looks just like the picture, and it arrived well packaged.  And the price was great!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had not even used this loofa one time. I was right in the middle of a shower and the loofa itself fell off the wood that it was glued onto.  Also the detatchable part of the brush was made crooked enough that the head fell off at first also.</li>
    <li> Not a good deal; loofah came unglued from the stick.</li>
    <li> Handle was attached with a thin line of glue.  Detatched within 5 minutes of use.  Would not recommend product.</li>
    <li> Scrubs your skin and back. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was pleasntly surprised to find that my loofah was delivered in a pack of two. Unlike many people, mine did NOT fall off with the first use. It serves it&#x27;s purpose and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This has been the answer to my husband&#x27;s back scrubbing problem.  His back feels 100% better since using his AquaBella Loofah back scrubber.</li>
    <li> I was having problems scrubbing my back and didn&#x27;t want to put my hand near my dirty ass. Low and behold someone else had thought of a solution to my problem. The loofah on a stick. This one of a kind loofah on a stick will tickle your pickle and scrub your bubs. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> I did manage to cram it in real tight and it held for awhile but alas it failed and went into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;It scrubbed well when it stayed together.&lt;br /&gt;Handle could have been a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad as it had great potential.</li>
    <li> good scrubber but not the best quality, i&#x27;ve had issues where the handle a brush separate</li>
    <li> This product works great, but the head detaches from the handle too easily, especially during a good back scrubbing.  I guess some super glue would help.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and it looks great. However the 2nd time I tried to use it, the loofah fell off leaving me with a wooden handle and a detached loofah; not really useful for washing my back.</li>
    <li> Sponge fell off after two weeks of use</li>
    <li> Used it this AM for the first time and it immediately detached from the handle. It&#x27;s a simple fix Aquasentials... A couple truss head tacks would to a much better job of holding it together. You can&#x27;t tell me you have quality tested this product and are proud to sell it.</li>
    <li> It is a loofah on a stick. What more can you say. Eight seven six five four three two one.</li>
    <li> Great Loofah and stick..... just wish they would stay together. First time out of the package and they separated faster than a Hollywood marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried several times to get them to stick together with various types of adhesive. No Luck usually they lasted a little while longer before falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally found out the best solution was to go prison style and jam it forcefully up into the loofah. Now it stays put....and calls me daddy.</li>
    <li> Read these reviews and please listen... ALL these people can&#x27;t be wrong.  The brush head WILL fall off the handle within seconds, literally.  Once it breaks, you WILL have to use some serious glue to put it back on.  What a terrible product... but all Aquabella would have to do is to use some decent glue, a staple or nail, and this would be just what you&#x27;d think.  Why they would sell such a defective product is quite baffling.  Unless you have waterproof rubber cement standing by, save yourself $6.  Otherwise, it will be $1 for every second you can scrub your back before it breaks.</li>
    <li> I was very much looking forward to receiving this product, but when my shipment came in the company did not place my product in with my shipment.  I had to get in touch with Amazon to refund my money. They did so very promptly.  I would be very careful if you have an order with several pieces and one of them is from AquaBella because you just may not receive it.  Just FYI.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife in addition to some other brushes so that sshe can just throw them away when they get funky. Great price, good product.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I found the handle and head did not fit well and came apart when trying to use it.  I also found the sisal very hard.  It didn&#x27;t soften up when wet and was pretty much useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> [...]    I think you will be more than pleased with this one,  heck,  the handle is even attached to the head with a dove tail joint.</li>
    <li> Looks great! long reach. Just what I wanted. Fell apart the first shower. The glue was a thin layer that did not go into the loofah fibers. On the other hand the wood part is well constucted, just useless.</li>
    <li> When dry it is rough but once you turn on the shower the Loofah softens and provides a great scrub for your back.</li>
    <li> After trying to find relief for my itchy back for years, I started using luffa&#x27;s for exfoliating the skin.  I very much love luffa sponges think they are the best product out there for my sensitive skin, however until coming across the hands free big bear luffa back scrubber [[ASIN:B002T4NKI4 The BIG BEAR - Bath and Body Natural Loofah Back Scrubber]] I couldn&#x27;t find effective relief for my itchy back.    I have the same complaints as many other reviewing this product.  Bad glue, cheap construction, etc, etc, etc.  I have lots of extra handles from broken luffa back brushes that I have yet to find a good use for.  (Any suggestions besides a cat string fishing toy?)  I have glued regular luffa sponges to them with Gorilla Glue (which holds much better btw) but still had the problem of not being able to really scrub my back hard enough for effective results.      Back brushes are awkward, cumbersome, and quite honestly don&#x27;t do a very good job of exfoliating in my opinion because it&#x27;s hard to get good pressure against it.  Some people love them though and good for them.  To each their own.  I would find myself jerry-rigging the back brush (adding more than one luffa) with Gorilla Glue and trying to hold it between the shower wall and my back so I really scrub good enough.  Well, I&#x27;m glad I found the luffa that attaches to the shower wall because the luffa back brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me.  Again though... luffa sponges themselves are absolutely awesome!  It still used the sponge for the rest of my body when the regular glue came off.  ;o)</li>
    <li> The loofah fell off of the stick the very first time that I used it.</li>
    <li> the loofa unglued itself after first use.</li>
    <li> This product failed, in an entirely predictable way, in two weeks.  I tell you I&#x27;ve been looking for a Loofah to scrub my back for years.  But this isn&#x27;t the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is glued to a piece of wood with a removable handle.  That is a great idea.  However, the porous nature of the Loofah and the glue used made it simply a matter of time before the glue failed.  Now I have a chest scrubber and two useless pieces of wood.  I can pretty much guarantee that you will have the same.</li>
    <li> The loofah is loose, although it has not yet fallen off, as with many other people.</li>
    <li> The scrubber broke off the 2nd week that I had it. I was able to put it back on and it falls off sometimes but it works.</li>
    <li> make keep a bath more enjoyful</li>
    <li> worked great for 3 uses then the handle came out. its a good idea but needs work to keep the handle attached.</li>
    <li> this thing is scratchy itchy and every thing elts not to mentchion when i used it the dame thing broke. do not buy this item it sucks.</li>
    <li> Crap brush, fell apart after 3 months.</li>
    <li> broke as soon as I got it</li>
    <li> I came as it was specified and with the specified time period.  The problem was that the loofah fell off of the stick the first time it was used.  It appeared to be glued on and the separated from the glue.  So we are not able to use it as intended.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s to where I can&#x27;t really reach. If it was a little rougher for scrubbing I would of like this even better.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times before the loofah detached from the handle, which was disappointing - now I use both hands so that the loofah stays on, which is only mildly annoying. i still use it sometimes. The loofah is quality, though, does the job. I wish the little rope at the end of the handle was a little larger - i can barely get it to fit around the shelf hanger in my shower.</li>
    <li> Absolutely useless.  The loofah is glued to the stick with a water-soluble glue.  That&#x27;s right; as soon as I got it wet the first time, the head fell off.  It didn&#x27;t even last long enough to apply soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... it&#x27;s a bath tool you can&#x27;t use in the bath.</li>
    <li> Loofahs are a dilemma.  You have to decide how to use them and it&#x27;s not at all clear.  They are horribly rough on the skin and should not be used in the facial area but only on rough skin areas.  Used in the proper way, they&#x27;re indispensible and this one in particular seems robust enough to use long term.</li>
    <li> Could I give this no stars of negative stars I would. Sponge part fell off first time using. It&#x27;s a real piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Great price and came earlier than expected</li>
    <li> As a back cleaning product, this is a major fail.  The grip is very poor and the wood became extremely slippery when wet and soapy.  I couldn&#x27;t properly use it because it was just slipping all over the place.    Aside from the unstable grip, the loofah top part just came right off as I was struggling to use it!  It&#x27;s glued on but once it got wet, the glue gave out and it was sliding out of the connection and became very unstable to use as a back scrubber.  So I took it right off and used it by hand.  And here&#x27;s the weird part.  I slipped it back together after the shower and left it on the counter.  Some days later I noted the top loofah part was totally glued shut and unmovable once again!  Weird!!  What kind of glue is this??  Damn thing falls apart in the shower and acts normal outside the shower.... what?!    In other news... the cats seem to enjoy the wooden stick as a cat toy and like to chase the string about.  So I tied some of their stringy toys to it and they just jump around at it.  This is more useful as a cat toy.</li>
    <li> Great little body scrubbing brush. The handle is made of nice wood and very handy for scrubbing your back. I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping that exfoliating my back will iliminate a problem I have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but this item has motivated me to do so now. Put simply, this is a cheap sponge placed on the end of a cheap stick. It&#x27;s not glued or affixed to the stick in any way. It spins, rotates, moves and falls off with anything use other than just looking at it.  The head fell off during the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy something better.  Maybe this...[[ASIN:B000TUC9AA Swissco Deluxe Bath Brush, Tortoise 1 ea]]</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;There if that is not clear you may want to get your eyes checked because I typed that in all caps as if to scream it at you. I bought this and used it just one time and it fell apart this is a P.O.S. i wish I would have picked one up at Target or Bed Bath and Beyond it would have probably lasted longer than one use. At first I was not going to write a review but then I thought about it and if I can prevent even one person from being ripped off then that would be good. Now to be fair the loofa sponge is fine but the build quality is what failed and there are a couple of sharp spots on the handle which if the darn thing had not fallen apart it could have cut me. Keep your money and get one locally. Now let me end by swying, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! Thanks for reading this review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing for the small of the back. Problem areas are doomed if you soak this is warm water first. Otherwise it is pretty stiff. I suspect is softens up over time, but soak it a few minutes until you break it in.</li>
    <li> I do not normally give out bad reviews, but figured I needed to! The big problem I had was the Loofah became unglued from the wand in the very first week of use, leaving the wand useless. On the other hand, I &#x27;m the type of person that likes to find the bright side of things + I&#x27;m a penny pinches, and don&#x27;t like to through anything away unless it is just impossible to find some sort of use for it. So I continue to use the Loofah with out the wand.</li>
    <li> the sponge came off the stick the first or second time I used it, don&#x27;t waste your money . . .</li>
    <li> The sponge part doesn&#x27;t stay on the stick for very long!</li>
    <li> came apart after little use</li>
    <li> It has a beautiful wood finish that makes it look like a very expensive product.  The loofa is ample and the style is excellent.  It looks great hanging in my shower by the cute little rope on the end.  I would highly recommend this brush.  My boyfriend loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much thrilled with this thing.  It allows me to have a radiant back which women find irresistibly smooth.</li>
    <li> This was for my son and he loves it.  It arrived very quickly (in fact, a day before it was scheduled) and it works great.</li>
    <li> I like this loofah,it makes your skin feel clean and alive. However if you have restricked movement of you arms, it becomes a little hard to reach your back area in the middle. But for all other area&#x27;s it is great.</li>
    <li> Yes, it did the same thing all the &#x27;1-star&#x27; users complained about. . .but the&lt;br /&gt;product deserves better. Look what it has going for it: a very good Loofah,and a stick. Missing: the ability to stay together. The solution: glue. Voila!</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with this purchase.  The first time I picked up the brush, the loofah fell off the handle.  There is no way to secure the loofah to the handle, so the product is better described as a loofah and a stick.  It is completely usless as a back scrubber brush.</li>
    <li> Tiny feeble little thing, like a child&#x27;s toy. Had to go right out and replace with one from a store I could see before buying. Total piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected!</li>
    <li> This is a nice loofah brush, but it came off the handle the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I just stuck it back on and kept going with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband &amp; the first time he used it, the sponge came off from the stick! Very poorly made &amp; will not be buying from again.</li>
    <li> This sucked. The Loofah is &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the stick with, I assume, a water soluble glue, because on first use it came unstuck. I guess you could find the right glue and glue it back - but life is short, and this product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> This product would be good, except for one very important thing -- it falls apart during the first use!  Yes, the wooden handle is just thrust up into the loofah (maybe with some very poor glue; I&#x27;m not sure) and it will come apart with even mild scrubbing.  Don&#x27;t even think about scrubbing hard, or it just falls off after like two scrubs across a person&#x27;s back.  The one good thing I can say, is that the sponge material is nice and firm, does not get too soft when wet (so it scrubs good).  Great loofah with a very very poor handle attached to it.</li>
    <li> The scrubber slipped off the wood handle on the first try. Would have benefitted from a little glue to keep it attached</li>
    <li> Loofah comes off very easily. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> brush head is very, very, very stiff.</li>
    <li> Great Product. The handle makes it easy to reach all parts of the body.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another loofah on a stick to replace one that I&#x27;ve had for a little while and found this one.  The very first time I tried to use it, the sponge fell off the stick.....absolute garbage, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Online this looked like a great Loofah because it didn&#x27;t look as big and bulky as what one normally sees in the stores. However, most loofah back scrubbers have a wooden or plastic base glued onto the backside of the actual loofah and then the handle is attached to the base. However this one was really cheap. Instead of using a wide base the manufacturer simply put some glue on the handle&#x27;s end and stuck in the actual centre of the loofah. This means the the glue is attached to the actual handle which is only an inch or so wide. This really limits the surface area that the glue can be adhered to. So what happens is, the handle is attached via glue to a dry loofah. As soon as the loofah gets wet for the very first time, it expands as it soaks in water. Thus the area that is attached to the handle expands and breaks the bonds with the glue as it expands and the glue and handle don&#x27;t proportionately expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the instant I got this loofah wet it broke within seconds. I went out and bought another make one in person and noted in the good models there is a really wide base that is attacked to the backside (as opposed into the centre which will experience the most expansion). Then the actual handle is attacked to the other side of the base which makes it much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate giving Amazon products on star but I would give this zero if I could. I just can&#x27;t believe the manufacturer is not aware of this problem. Really pass on this, it will break.</li>
    <li> Perfect for scrubbing hard to reach areas on the back. A+++Seller!</li>
