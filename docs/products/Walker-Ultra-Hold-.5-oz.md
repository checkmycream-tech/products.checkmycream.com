<ol>

      <li>I like this glue the best</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I chose this product because its waterproof and it holds perfectly!</li>
      <li>Best glue for lace wigs, gives the strongest hold when used correctly.</li>
      <li>Very happy with that.</li>
      <li>The hold is awesome for your lace wigs!</li>
      <li>the best!</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work!</li>
      <li>Good buy!</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Great .</li>
      <li>Works great and all I use for my lace fronts because I can even swim and it doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Works great on lace pieces.</li>
      <li>It all arrived together, which was great because I wanted to practice before my lace front wig arrived.</li>
      <li>This adhesive has amazing hold!</li>
      <li>for starters, i have been (successfully) doing my hair for years.</li>
      <li>You best to love the hair you apply cause it&#x27;s gonna be there for a while.</li>
      <li>i believe it is good</li>
      <li>GOOD PRODUCT, WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good at applying my lace wigs.  </li>
      <li>this  adhesive is good ..</li>
      <li>Oh ya alcohol works good on removal.</li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>Please, please, please, do not use this product without some sort of scalp protectant for your skin and a solvent to safely remove it!</li>
      <li>Make sure you have scalp protector and lace glue removal!</li>
      <li>If you need a better adhesive, try Vapon No-Tape!</li>
      <li>This hair bond is amazing.</li>
      <li>but I prefer the ones where the model applies her own products as I will have to do.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it cures to a nice flexible finish that holds for 3 to 4 days.</li>
      <li>My sister get her hair done at a salon, but I do my own hair, so it&amp;#34;s just not for me.</li>
      <li>have applied my own lace wigs using this technique, and it lasts for weeks, if you want  it</li>
      <li>its very easy and nice to be use in the saloon, ideal for who&#x27;s  wearing hair wig more than one week, but the strong smell of it cause kind of the complain from customers, but we like to use it to them.</li>
      <li>Best hair sealer by far!</li>
      <li>Walker Ultra Hold is the best lace wig hold available for humid and hot temps.</li>
      <li>It is a very good glue that holds very cheap wigs on very well.  </li>
      <li>Shipper was fast, accurate and the price was the best I could find.  </li>
      <li>It is best to buy the smallest size if it for individual (not salon) usage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still learning to work with glue and adhesives, so I think I will get better with this one with practice.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy until I find a better one.</li>
      <li>You could get caught in a hurricane, while falling in a plane doing 6 g&#x27;s and your lace front will still be all in place on top of your head.</li>
      <li>Was completely satisfied with this purchase and order process.  </li>
      <li>Was okay</li>
      <li>this glue does do the job I love it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m confident I will be pleased again.  </li>
      <li>you will not get a better hold ever</li>
      <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
      <li>have used this glue for many years, since lace wigs were introduced to us.</li>
      <li>and I need more control.</li>
      <li>Ultra hold last me about 2.5 weeks, even with perfect application.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>DID THE JOB, BUT MAKE SURE THAT</li>
      <li>I did not know what I was doing and had more of this stuff on my wig than on my hair</li>
      <li>This adhesive might be better for a cap with combs.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s okay for me.  </li>
      <li>and if you want a hold for more than 1 day i will not advise you to purchase this glue</li>
      <li>Works, Great, but it is really messy and stringy, if you can deal with the gooey it works great .</li>
      <li>It was how ever easy to apply</li>
      <li>Love this product , dries quick and comes off easy when u want.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly: I bought this as a cheap glue to hold my packer on (I&#x27;m FTM transsexual).</li>
      <li>This is too light, wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Great hold in a size that will last.  </li>
      <li>I am really happy that I found this adhesive--the stuff I was using before was gummy and wouldn&#x27;t last an afternoon.  </li>
      <li>so I am a far cry from the application expert, but I can say, this glue does offer good hold.  </li>
      <li>It is sticky , strong Oder, and does not keep my full lace wig adhered .</li>
      <li>Works really well!!!</li>
      <li>Use the scalp protector first for a better grip and then apply the Walker Ultra Hold.</li>
      <li>This product is ok, it holds pretty well 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>When I make my first lace top wig, I plan on using this.</li>
      <li>Honest opinion from a new lover of lace wigs.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell anyone who isnt experienced with Lace wigs and using adhesives should steer clear of this particular product.  </li>
      <li>Holds great usually lasts a week or more.</li>
      <li>and I want a full refund the glue is sticky</li>
      <li>Does a good job sticking but the bottle has no applicator - definitely a pain.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the product because when I sweat the glue loosens and the full lace wig slides, not what I want.</li>
      <li>so i think I&#x27;m being fair by stating that maybe its just my  inexperience with applying lace wigs and using adhesive, but I personally wouldnt recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like super glue.</li>
      <li>Super sticky and goopy..</li>
      <li>Reliable product and quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>, comes off easily with 99 % pure alcohol.  </li>
      <li>i really thanks to the person who send it to me accurately and promptly.</li>
      <li>I received the product early 7-12-11, which I am pleased about.</li>
      <li>However after some experimenting I have found out that if you rub gently using a cotton swab and some rubbing alcohol that it comes right off!</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff when I use to glue my wigs down</li>
      <li>was exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>This product is like nail polish in the sense that the more you open and close it, the thickier and lumpy it becomes.</li>
      <li>The larger size does not have the best shelf life if you open and close it multiple times.</li>
      <li>so I tried to use it with a wooden stick and although the application was better, it still did not suit my needs.</li>
      <li>I will be using this same shipper soon to order more product</li>
      <li>this is a really good glue it works really well, it holds nicely when you sweat or get your hair wet, it lasts for a few weeks.</li>
      <li>(pretty much rubbing alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it has a much stronger hold and is waterproof.</li>
      <li>This glue really does work for me.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
      <li>it came with very matty hair,wat did expect for 7.96 i want purchase from that company again.</li>
      <li>I did a patch test on the back of my hand to make sure it would not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It also got very goopey on the top, due to the nature of the design.</li>
      <li>First off, this got here really early, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product , dries quick and comes off easy when u want. Just don&#x27;t knock the bottle over</li>
    <li> this is a really good glue it works really well, it holds nicely when you sweat or get your hair wet, it lasts for a few weeks. highly recommend this product . it is however a bit messy so be careful.</li>
    <li> This adhesive has amazing hold! Although I find that it is messy and leaves glue strings all over the place. However after some experimenting I have found out that if you rub gently using a cotton swab and some rubbing alcohol that it comes right off! The adhesive stays sticky for a few days and if you get it wet within the first 24 hours it still sticks although you can peel your hair piece off without any effort. It also doesn&#x27;t yellow up and turn crispy either. Slightly expensive but in my opinion worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m kinda up in the air about this product because for one some spots remain sticky days after but then it holds like nothing else. So its kinda like you have to have a little bit of a give and take with this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months back and I can tell anyone who isnt experienced with Lace wigs and using adhesives should steer clear of this particular product.  It was extremely messy and got everywhere, all over my hands the hair, I have a wig now that still has traces of the adhesive in the baby hair. NOT to mention there is no applicator brush! So, it was pain having to find something to apply it; and the brush i bought was ruined by the glue. Its also is a pain to get the glue off of my hair line!  I&#x27;m new to wearing lace wigs so i think I&#x27;m being fair by stating that maybe its just my  inexperience with applying lace wigs and using adhesive, but I personally wouldnt recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> First off, this got here really early, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly: I bought this as a cheap glue to hold my packer on (I&#x27;m FTM transsexual). I use a basic Mr. Limpy. It took about three coats and I had to press on it a while, but after leaving it on a while it actually held up REALLY well. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up in the shower, over sleep, or exercising; if any problems occur I&#x27;ll write another review or update this one if that&#x27;s possible. If I don&#x27;t update, then everything worked out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for breast forms. Tread carefully, I assume those weigh more than small packers.</li>
    <li> this  adhesive is good ..the only thing is it&#x27;s not for everyone ..i been using this since 2009(for like 2months) when i frist discover lace wigs..but it never holes long for me and the nape(back of my neck) never holds at all.it last like 3-5 days then i need a touch up ..but i always take it out on day five cause i do have hair on my head a lot too ....again i jus wish it will hole longer .. i guess i&#x27;ll jus hav to deal with my hair or find another glue!</li>
    <li> What can i say,i ride a bike and don&#x27;t want stuff flying off on me. All i know this is some sticky stuff.Oh ya alcohol works good on removal.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible I ordered it in the 5 oz size and guess what it comes without a brush how I am supposed to apply it? I did not know this when I ordered it I wonder do the other sizes comes with a brush I feel duped and I want a full refund the glue is sticky but it wont lace my wigs overall please do not purchase it in the smallest size because there is no BRUSH I wish someone had written in there reviews before I bought this horrible deceiving worthless product</li>
    <li> I buy this product because this is what my beautician uses.It only holds for a few days, and not for that long if you sweat in your head. I will continue to buy until I find a better one. Any suggestions are welcome!</li>
    <li> This glue really does work for me.  I finally found a glue that obviously mesh with my skin well.  Like another reviewer said be very careful it is like super glue.</li>
    <li> I hope this review helps some of the Ultra Hold users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this glue for many years, since lace wigs were introduced to us. I prefer the smaller bottle, must less waste, and the alternative to using a brush,(which is not included), is a Q tip, just break off the end, the thinner the line, the more natural the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after applying, give it a little more wait time, when it feels really sticky, but does not stick to your finger when touched, say 30 minutes, if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After attaching your unit, do not comb or style immediately, let the glue adhere to the unit, use the back of a comb or your fingertips to smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have applied my own lace wigs using this technique, and it lasts for weeks, if you want  it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this little bottle is great, check the other sites. I will definitely be reordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Walker Ultra Hold is the best lace wig hold available for humid and hot temps. If you spend days and nights in the gym, it is the product for you as well. It is best to buy the smallest size if it for individual (not salon) usage. The larger size does not have the best shelf life if you open and close it multiple times. This product is like nail polish in the sense that the more you open and close it, the thickier and lumpy it becomes.</li>
    <li> Yes this product has a firm hold</li>
    <li> Was completely satisfied with this purchase and order process.  Shipper was fast, accurate and the price was the best I could find.  I will be using this same shipper soon to order more product and I&#x27;m confident I will be pleased again.  Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS. JUST MAKE SURE YOU USE IT ALL UP, AND SOON. IT WILL DRY UP IF YOU JUST LET IT SIT AROUND</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months for my lace front wig. I apply it with a thin craft stix rather than any brush for more control. I have a terrible time with the consistent curing of the product. Sometimes it cures to a nice flexible finish that holds for 3 to 4 days. But the majority of the time it never cures completely and remains just sticky enough to constantly attract flyaway hair to your hair line. At nighttime even with a hair cover you will gather tiny lint around your hair line. I have tried several methods to advance the cure to a complete finish, but have been unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, once this bottle is at the end, I will continue my search for the adhesive of my dreams.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the product because when I sweat the glue loosens and the full lace wig slides, not what I want. It was how ever easy to apply</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of lace wigs glue and i think this one is the worst. It do not hold at all and i used the scalp protector with it but still it do not work.  It is also sticky and messy.  It do not hold well and  if you sweat at all this glue is not for you and if you want a hold for more than 1 day i will not advise you to purchase this glue</li>
    <li> Hopefully this will meet my every expectation.  When I make my first lace top wig, I plan on using this.</li>
    <li> Ordered ghost bond, ms lolas cream and ultra hold all at the same time.  Ultra hold last me about 2.5 weeks, even with perfect application.  I exercise and sauna alot so that&#x27;s okay for me.  I&#x27;m good at applying my lace wigs.  I like this glue the best, comes off easily with 99 % pure alcohol.  I do also use lace remover too.  Protect your scalp with scalp protector.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with removal or irritation.  Honest opinion from a new lover of lace wigs.  Hopes this help.  Also, rcvd glue with small amount of duck tape around cap, no drying issues of glue, recap and seal with tape.</li>
    <li> this glue is terrible i just wasted my money. i will never buy it again. it is so messy and sticky poor product.</li>
    <li> DID THE JOB, BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU PLACE HAIRPIECE ON CORRECTLY BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT COMING UP ANY TIME SOON! GOOD PRODUCT, WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I only glue down my wigs when i have a long night of performing... and, this is what every entertainer needs, somthing that is sweatproof and will not agravate your hairline!!</li>
    <li> Ok so I hate lace tape. I sweat like CRAZY! That&#x27;s why I chose this product because its waterproof and it holds perfectly! I only used a little to sample on my skin. The only bad thing is it&#x27;s sticky so you have to be very careful! Make sure you have scalp protector and lace glue removal! I will order again soon! (:</li>
    <li> Reliable product and quick delivery.  Product was as described and needed a travel size.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> this us bull crap . It is sticky , strong Oder, and does not keep my full lace wig adhered . It gets all in my wigs baby hairs  &amp; is stringy. It even was tacky on my hair bonnet ... Never again will I be ripped off .</li>
    <li> Works great and all I use for my lace fronts because I can even swim and it doesn&#x27;t budge. Only one I trust</li>
    <li> You could get caught in a hurricane, while falling in a plane doing 6 g&#x27;s and your lace front will still be all in place on top of your head. You best to love the hair you apply cause it&#x27;s gonna be there for a while.</li>
    <li> The glue was fine ,the wig was awful it came with very matty hair,wat did expect for 7.96 i want purchase from that company again.</li>
    <li> its very easy and nice to be use in the saloon, ideal for who&#x27;s  wearing hair wig more than one week, but the strong smell of it cause kind of the complain from customers, but we like to use it to them.</li>
    <li> Sticky, doesn&#x27;t spread well and the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last long, comes off after an hour or so, completely useless for me.</li>
    <li> Held up well, did not damage my lace wig. I chose to wear my wig a few days at a time, because my hair is so oily. I did not move though, once the glue dried. Very happy with that. The only thing that I did not love, was how sticky it became due to the &amp;#34;nail polish bottle design.&amp;#34; The brush made it harder to apply, not easier. It also got very goopey on the top, due to the nature of the design. Sticky stuff.</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong product. I was sent mity-tite instead of of ultra hold, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I didn&#x27;t return it because I needed the product but it wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  Janet Koch</li>
    <li> the shipment came fast , the only down fall to this glue its really tacky so I would buy extra brushed to used during the use sage of this product it holds extremely well if applied correctly.</li>
    <li> this s*** made y forehead burn u had a scar for 3 months I decided to just use tape instead</li>
    <li> Please, please, please, do not use this product without some sort of scalp protectant for your skin and a solvent to safely remove it! This stuff lives up to its name, believe me. It&#x27;s like super glue. You should lay down some napkins or cloth to protect your counter surface as well in case you spill some. I did a patch test on the back of my hand to make sure it would not irritate my sensitive skin. A brush is provided with the product, but I would prefer one with a finer width of bristles. Along with this product I purchased the Walker Skin Protectant, a roll of supertape and the C-22 Citrus Solvent. It all arrived together, which was great because I wanted to practice before my lace front wig arrived. First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris. I then spread 2 thin layers of protectant, letting the first layer dry before adding the second. When the protectant no longer felt tacky, I applied a thin layer of Ultra Hold. It goes on clear and dries clear. As an experiement, I added a layer of supertape to test the difference in the hold with and without the tape. I needed the solvent to remove the tape and glue. I believe the citrus base helps to remove the glues and soothe your skin. I can only imagine what it will be like to remove the glue and tape while under an attached lace front wig. If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube. Type in \\&quot;how to apply a lace front wig\\&quot; and all sorts of results pop up. Videos in which the beauty expert applies the products on the model are helpful, but I prefer the ones where the model applies her own products as I will have to do. Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned. Again, please do not use this on unprotected skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning to work with glue and adhesives, so I think I will get better with this one with practice. It adhered &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; to my wig system, but while I like the brush on application, it is a stringy, messy glue to work with out of the bottle. It did not hold very long after application. (again that could be my fault, user error) I&#x27;ve seen tutorials that use this glue with Supertape, so I&#x27;m going to try that approach next.</li>
    <li> Mind you, I have not worn LF for very long so I am a far cry from the application expert, but I can say, this glue does offer good hold.  I&#x27;ve never worn a LF for 4-6 weeks straight, but it can definately last for 5 days without a touch up.  Caution, it is sticky, tacky and an all around mess but until I can master LF tape, this will have to do.</li>
    <li> Icky, sticky, stringy, and impossible to get off of lace-front wigs! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product!</li>
    <li> works well.good price</li>
    <li> Hard to work with, very messy.  Very difficult to get out of the jar.  Once in place, the adhesion lasted about 3-5 days.</li>
    <li> Works great on lace pieces. Holds great usually lasts a week or more.</li>
    <li> Works really well!!! Love it</li>
    <li> Works, Great, but it is really messy and stringy, if you can deal with the gooey it works great . Use, really small layers works better that way</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff when I use to glue my wigs down but now I use glueless wigs so I won&#x27;t mess you my edges. good stuff.</li>
    <li> this glue does do the job I love it only problem the person I ordered it from they lied said the glue came with attatched brush to apply the glue it didnt so now when I use the glue I use the tip of my finger real mess so before you buy this glue be cautious on who your buying from :(</li>
    <li> I do like to use this glue in comparison to others. I like the fact that it has a much stronger hold and is waterproof. I am a heavy sweater and need something that can hold up to that. Use the scalp protector first for a better grip and then apply the Walker Ultra Hold. Let it dry a bit and become tacky first that is key. Then apply your unit.</li>
    <li> was exactly what i wanted. i really thanks to the person who send it to me accurately and promptly. thank u</li>
    <li> I hate this glue!! It sticks to everything and I do mean everything except my scalp!!It&#x27;s stringy and got in my eye once.  It doesn&#x27;t hold very well and I followed the instructions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;. The brush sucks so I tried to use it with a wooden stick and although the application was better, it still did not suit my needs.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is terrible! for starters, i have been (successfully) doing my hair for years. i applied it exactly as directed and the hair slipped off two hours later. ill go back to my sallys hair glue that at least lasts for a few days.</li>
    <li> Never got to use because the wig I got was very bad</li>
    <li> I received the product early 7-12-11, which I am pleased about. I was disappointed that the bottle was not full and it did not have an application brush inside. I cannot send it back because I dont have time to wait for a new bottle.</li>
    <li> This is too light, wasn&#x27;t for me. If you need a better adhesive, try Vapon No-Tape! This adhesive might be better for a cap with combs.</li>
    <li> Does a good job sticking but the bottle has no applicator - definitely a pain. The cap opens well even after repeated uses and some glue getting on the edges. I use this on the toupe tape for extra hold. It is a little stringy like cement so watch for whispy glue strings. No applicator is a bit of a pain.</li>
    <li> Does not work, way to difficult to work with also. I&#x27;ll stick to the tape.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product is same strength as regular.</li>
    <li> Great . It holds and will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> you will not get a better hold ever</li>
    <li> Great hold in a size that will last.  The price is very reasonable especially for something of this quality.</li>
    <li> This hair bond is amazing. The hold is awesome for your lace wigs! The hold lasts up to several hours or days depending on how much you use. Best hair sealer by far!</li>
    <li> No doubt at all that this is the strongest glue that I have ever used.  I am really happy that I found this adhesive--the stuff I was using before was gummy and wouldn&#x27;t last an afternoon.  I would recommend using an adhesive &#x27;release&#x27; solution (pretty much rubbing alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best!</li>
    <li> The glue didn&#x27;t work at all for me. It actually irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought fort lace front wigs. It holds believe me. I only had to used it once every two weeks. Didn&#x27;t have to put a lot.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner. Works as  described! Good buy!</li>
    <li> I like it but I wish it came with instructions to use. If you dont already know how to use it watch a video.</li>
    <li> i believe it is good -the only bad is its either drying up or it becomes sticky after a few days,</li>
    <li> We just don&#x27;t get along!  My sister loves this, but I can&#x27;t deal with it! It gets all over the place and I need more control. My sister get her hair done at a salon, but I do my own hair, so it&amp;#34;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it only kept my lace front wig in place for less than 24 hours. Some people say it has a &amp;#34;super glue&amp;#34; hold which is a bunch of bologna.! I give this product 👎👎......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this twice now for wigs for halloween.  It is a very good glue that holds very cheap wigs on very well.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s so stringy and sticky, it&#x27;s very hard to apply it without an awful mess that gets all over your fingers.  I would still buy it again if I needed, because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  My only advice is that you should use this to apply your wig well before your manicure or you&#x27;ll have weird sticky glue all over your nails.</li>
    <li> I did not know what I was doing and had more of this stuff on my wig than on my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;The products needs a different application tool, that polish brush was not good for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome...I use in combination with Supertape.  Will hold for about 4 weeks.  Also, I have found that buying the small bottles are better than buying the large one. Once this glue is open it will become stringy over time so make sure that the cap is on tight and store in a drawer or a dark place.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, it holds pretty well 2-3 days. It is very messy so you must be careful. I am looking for a product that last more than just a few days though. If any suggestions please let me know... I wear lace fronts I put the glue on the rim of the lace and let it sit for 15 mins to let it mold. Even doing that it still only last a few days.</li>
    <li> Best glue for lace wigs, gives the strongest hold when used correctly. I can&#x27;t find it in beauty supply stores locally but will be reordering whenever I run out.</li>
    <li> I used it but it didnt keep the hair in, I might of did it wrong but I looked up online how to and did as said n they came out 2 days later</li>
    <li> Super sticky and goopy.. It got on my wig, it took two days to get off my hair line. The brush it comes with is useless because the product is very thick and it gets everywhere. I would try a product that is thinner and less goopy.</li>
    <li> So far i haven&#x27;t found a glue that holds well for me. Just didn&#x27;t last...next day it was gooey and messy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Will hold for at least three days.</li>
    <li> Was okay did what it was suppose to do came on time.</li>
    <li> This glue I use for multi purposes but beware it can be very messy if not handled properly. Please allow it to air dry a bit before bonding as it will slide if you don&#x27;t. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
