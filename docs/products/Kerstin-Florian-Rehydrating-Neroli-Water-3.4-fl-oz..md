    <li> Love the Neroli Water</li>
    <li> This refreshing spray is perfect for a spritz any time of day. The scent is so refreshing. The scent of orange blossoms instantly remind me of trips to Palm Desert, California walking by the orange trees on the golf course.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing fragrance and great as a pick me up.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and the smell is simply divine. The perfect pick me up to make your skin glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hoarding a bottle of this I got in 1996 in Palm Springs at my first facial. Every once in a while, I&#x27;d spray a little across the bed and fall asleep to the smell of orange blossoms. I now have as much as I want, as often as I want. Yeah.</li>

A quick spritz when he&#x27;s in bed and he feels a little better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using up your bottle this way, but the smell is so good, you may find other uses. ;)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use it primarily as a toner, but it is also a great way to give your face a little extra hydration throughout the day.  It smells divine.  One little spritz and you feel like you are sitting in a spa!  I even sent a bottle to a friend for her birthday.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing stuff, makes me feel wonderful, and uplifted and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I am a Medical Dr I also practice homeopathic medicine. Neroli is one of the best products I have been using on my patients as well as my self. It is particularly good for any type of trauma. Grief depression. I actually came across this product in Mexico at a Spa.  I am never without it. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My co-worker brought this product to work one day after discovering it at a local spa. After several months of going back to her office for a quick pick-me-up spray, I caved and bought my own. This stuff is worth every penny. My skin feels refreshed after using it, but the best part for me is the scent. It is totally relaxing and strangely relieves my work anxiety. It’s like magic!</li>
    <li> During the day my skin can become dry, especially when indoors with the air conditioner on all the time, or when in a car with blasting air conditioner or heat on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is a way to refresh the face with a mist of neroli infused water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a lovely scent of neroli, the bitter orange tree. It has a strong scent when first sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is just a bit oily with water, when sprayed onto the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well for me. I have normal to oily skin due to living in Houston, Texas. I have sensitive skin and am constantly battling rosacea, this works well and does not make my rosacea flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in a durable mister spray bottle. The mister works well.</li>
