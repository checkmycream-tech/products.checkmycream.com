<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very smooth shave! Outstanding...</li>
    <li> SURE BETS ITS PREDECESSOR THUMBS DOWN.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it very much.</li>
    <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
    <li> very good,I like this very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user for over 10 years, starting with the Mach3. This is a great product, and is worth upgrading from Fusion ProGlide Power because the weight in the head creates better contact with the skin, which improves the shave significantly. I use less strokes as a result (though the overall shave is the same as the Fusion ProGlide Power). This means less skin irritation, more uses out of each blade, and less shaving cream. Great razor!</li>
    <li> The razor and blades are ok, however the flexball element is all gimmick, and no real benefit</li>
    <li> Hubs loves this razor. I give him a hard time that his face is always stubbley and the baby doesn&#x27;t like his kisses so after he got this razor he immediately shaved and then rubbed his face on the baby. It was adorable.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor out there. I have tried the regular Fusion and this one beats it. Most noticeably, the proglide power blades are a pretty substantial improvement over the regular fusion ones. It seems that the green comfort strip on the proglide power blades last a lot longer than the orange on on the regular fusion. Also, the blades are sharper. I get the closest shave possile using the fusion clear shaving gel too. I have a tough beard and the combination does it for me.</li>
    <li> Yes they are expensive and I would take half a star for the inability to reach certain places (such as under the nose). BUT... they last waylonger than any other razor I&#x27;ve used in my life and are therefore cheaper in the long run.  I change blades about every 6-8 months and I have a pretty thick beard.</li>
    <li> A GOOD SHOPPING.AND I LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> If you sport a bald head like I do and want that &amp;#34;clean as a baby&#x27;s ass&amp;#34; effect, then go no further.  This is the one.  Period.  Nice price  and fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> By far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  Love Gillette.</li>
    <li> Follows the curves of your face allowing for close and comfortable shaves without knicks....</li>
    <li> My goodness... This Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor is smooth! I received this promotional razor for free thanks to Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;In life, I&#x27;ve always worked to be extremely honest. Here&#x27;s my honesty: I have a full beard. That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t need to shave; I still have a neckbeard that needs maintenance. When offered a change for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, I was a little hesitant. With such a small area of the face to shave, I&#x27;ve been happy using disposable razors. I&#x27;m glad I submitted to the offer, though, as I have never had such a painless and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a curse. When I shave with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, I have to check to make sure everything is working because I don&#x27;t feel any irritation whatsoever. It&#x27;s beautiful. Not only that... you know when you have been lazy for a couple days and your beard gets a little rough? You know how razors often pull at those longer hairs? It doesn&#x27;t happen with this razor! It just cuts right through, often in a single stroke!&lt;br /&gt;In regard to the handle... I&#x27;m not fully convinced it&#x27;s that beneficial to have the flexball technology. I know I haven&#x27;t had any knicks, but I&#x27;ve always found slowing down while shaving is the easiest way to avoid cuts - not fancy flexballs. In the mirror, I do see the head moving in a full range of motion - much more than standard razors. I just can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed any improvement. Aside from the flexball, the handle is sturdy, has rubber grips for sure grip and works much better than those disposables I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I must admit that I&#x27;m pretty darn cheap. It&#x27;s going to be hard to steer me away from my super cheap disposable razors, but if any can, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor is the one!</li>
    <li> First I should disclose that I received this razor as part of a promotion for Gillette. That being said, I think the razor worked very well. I&#x27;m not normally a fan of the multi blade razors but this one gave be a clean comfortable shave. And I thought the handle was well designed.</li>
    <li> As advertised!! The Pivot helps get every contour of your face....no nicks, no cuts.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work, and this razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Very smooth shave and it seems like the blades last for ever. I rcd the razor free from Gillette as a promotion and couldn&#x27;t be more thankful!!!</li>
    <li> I like it and it feels like an upgrade over the previous version without the flexball!  For such a low price, there&#x27;s no reason not to get it.</li>
    <li> Thanks for order very good and great service thanking u again will use again</li>
    <li> meh - lot&#x27;s of hype, but the performance is not really better.  As usual, cartridges are a rip-off.</li>
    <li> Love a vibrating face massage as I shave.</li>
    <li> I really like recommended&lt;br /&gt; Good price with good quality</li>
    <li> I was happy to get this in the mail today because my Mach-3 blades had run out.  I was nervous to try the ProGlide because I have always used the Mach-3 but was very impressed with not only the closeness, but also the ability of the blade to cut so close to the trouble areas, like the upper lip and the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to switch tomorrow I would definitely give the ProGlide a 2nd go because it uses technology and finesse to cut a clean shave on even my tough beard.</li>
    <li> I know, it sounds like a gimmick. But for reasons that I can&#x27;t explain, the vibration does make for a better shave.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously priced razor. Gillette throw all these bells and whistles on what should be a reasonably basic product: A disposable razor. How expensive should that be? I was (mistakenly) under the impression that Gillette made the best products and I was happy to pay through the nose for them. Since then I have decided to try some others and the best by far are the Dorco Razors. http://www.amazon.com/Dorco-Shaving-System-Cartridges-Handle/dp/B008O84ZQA/ref&#x3D;pd_bia_nav_t_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0V6TGE7R8AD3KX2JTECS. Good quality for very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different razors and I will say the Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is bar far the best. I love how the razor doesn&#x27;t pull the hair as compared to disposable razors. The Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is smooth and fits perfectly into your hand. The contouring ability of the FlexBall really gets into those hard to reach spots that most razors leave stubble. The weight of the razor takes a little getting used but feels really well engineered. Wonderful razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome Razor! This is a great upgrade from older versions of this razor. I never thought the tilting head would make such a difference. But it does, going over your chin and neck are much easier. I have less nicks than ever.</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift by a friend, my head very sensitive to razers but thought this was a game changer as it had promised on the box. Well was wrong my head was filled with razor burn all over. Used it 3 times and had to dismantle it and trush it and 3 weeks of sour burns</li>
    <li> The roller ball function allows for a shave that’s nothing less than stellar.  Usually, I am a fan of The Art of Shaving, but Gillette’s  new blade definitely has made me a fan. There are two aspects I like about this blade: 1) the detailer blade at the top is PERFECT for trimming side burns, the area under your nose, or even reshaping the 5’oclock shadow to accentuate your jawline and 2) the roller ball function allows the blade to easily glide around the contours of your round/square face.  The ONLY thing preventing from rating it a 5 start is the shaving cream.  The cream in itself is great, however, it tends to leak just a little bit of the gel right after you use it. However, if the gel isn’t the important, then just go with the blade as it’s a perfect 5.</li>
    <li> I am happy that I got this free product from Gillette on bzzagent. No nicks were caused , shaving cream very cooling sensation on my face while and during my shave. Very comfortable . I will def be purchasing this in the future. Thank you</li>
    <li> Dear Gillette, Thankyou! Thankyou! Thankyou!!! I am for the first time ever, completely satisfied with a disposable razor. So much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Shaving daily used to be such a hassle, i would stand in front of the mirror like a zombie and just get it done and over with as fast as possible, bearing through all the pain. NOW, with the Gillette fusion Proglide Power Razor, shaving is a joy!! It&#x27;s so cool how quickly the blades go right through my facial hair, \\&quot;like butta\\&quot;!!!! This is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever written, and i couldn&#x27;t think of a better product to praise!!  (Note: I received the product as a promotion of the brand, but it in no way influenced my review of said product)</li>
    <li> Works well still hard to shave in all areas of face, blades dont last long about 3 weeks, and very expensive to replace ,I like vibration as it keeps clearing hair from between blades . I tried old school one blade like my dad used but they are too long to shave using correctly with shaving sodas and brush,i am 52 yrs old and can&#x27;t find a way to shave that gets close and in all places also last long ?</li>
    <li> Started with the original Fusion razor, and have stayed with Gillette right up to this new product.&lt;br /&gt;Love these razors.</li>
    <li> The battery does make a difference. I that it was a hoax until I actually decided to go on my brother in law&#x27;s reco. These blades last a long time, give a smooth shave and the battery has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I was sent a Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall technology by Gillette. I tried it out and here&#x27;s what I think so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology offers a truly innovative shaving experience. The multi razor with gel strip easily glides over my skin without tugging or pulling whiskers. The gel strip helps to leave my skin hydrated after the blades give me a very close shave. The FlexBall allows me to shave more surface area without having to worry about the blades cutting at the wrong angle. This saves me time in the morning. It has been 9 hours since I have shaved with my ProGlide and my skin feels like I just shaved. I usually have noticeable stubble by now. I love the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology and will continue to use it as long as I can. This razor is definition value for the money.</li>
    <li> The problem I have with manual razors is that I need to shave, then I need to shave again to get everything that was missed the first time. This is not only time consuming, but leads to skin irritation and makes me wonder why I bother with the process. I was skeptical when I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor as a product promotion from Gillette. I&#x27;ve seen razor manufacturers use a lot of gimmicks, and \\&quot;FlexBall Technology\\&quot; seemed like more of the same.&lt;br /&gt;On my first use, I started with about 2 days of stubble. I don&#x27;t grow a thick beard, but my facial hair grows quickly and in multiple directions. I used Fusion ProGlide as my shaving gel. Starting under my chin and shaving up, I noticed immediately how smooth the shave felt. I didn&#x27;t see the spots that I was used to...the spots that I&#x27;d have to go back over. When I rinsed the blade after a few more swipes, I was shocked at how much hair was washing into the sink. Without question, it was as close of a shave as I can remember. After I finished, I prepared to go back over the trouble spots that I&#x27;m used to needing to two or three times, but there wasn&#x27;t really much I had to do.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting another razor gimmick, but found the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> The best razor ever (until now)</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth shave.  My uncle recommended it and I concur.  The 5 blades means the replacement blades do not need to be changed regularly.  Full disclosure, I received a free trial package but even still I thought it was  great shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor will keep buying the refills for this razors will recommend to everyone:) thanks also to bzzagent.com for giving me the chance for using the product</li>
    <li> Top notch!  Well worth the price!  Even thought I received as a free promotion, I am impressed with the products and will continue to buy.  I used the Gillette Shaving Gel and was impressed the scent was not overpowering and did not leave a film on my face.  If you are looking for a quality product without breaking the bank-I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The flex ball allows you to shave without adjusting your wrist position too often. Great if you need quicker shaves.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find much difference between mach 3 turbo and this one, except this one vibrates while shaving, which results in less irritation while shaving.</li>
    <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me this as a promotion. The razor is just as good as the mach 3 though I do miss the vibrate mode wich made it a little smoother. As for the new gel that came with it, it really doesn&#x27;t have the problem of slowly leaking out after you&#x27;re done, and the plastic bottoms stops that annoying rust ring on your counter. Also the top of the gel locks. The razor is a good shave but not really any better, but definitely not worse than the older one, so a good buy if you need a new razor, and the shaving gel is great from container to scent and providing a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to avoid Gillette just due to them being the highest priced shave on the market, I found out there&#x27;s a reason for this. Recently I&#x27;ve used Schick Hydro 5 and found it to be decent but I didn&#x27;t like the tug and pull even with new blades. Prior to that I tried Dollar Shave Club blades and again, just found them to be ok. I decided to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power on a whim and boy was I surprised. These blades are superior to any other that I&#x27;ve tried and the power version makes for a very comfortable shave. Yes, these blades are more expensive than the rest but they&#x27;re worth the money. Last year I read an article where Gillette actually came out and stated that their blades can be used for 5 weeks before they need replacing. If that&#x27;s the case then that would make these blades the best deal around.</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for a few weeks thanks to Gillette letting me try it for free. This razor contours my face well and give me a close shave unlike the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay sharp but I have been using it consistently for 2 weeks now (about every other day) and it is still almost as good as new.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  The flex ball worked fine and rotated as it said it would; however, it didn&#x27;t really provide any closer shave than other razors.  Worse, after only a week of use and then leaving your facial hair grow for 4 days, the blades could no longer cut without tearing at the hairs.  It was one of the most painful shaves ever, you think I was shaving a beard.  I did the same test with blades I ordered from Harry&#x27;s and they still cut smooth as the day they came out of the box.  I don&#x27;t blame Gillette, the are using comparable blades to their competitors.  But they don&#x27;t stand up when compared to better quality.  The blades clog constantly as well.  So basically, all that leaves you with this razor is a flex ball which becomes something of a gimmick with a mediocre blade.  I reviewed this based on a kit I received from Buzz Agent.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  The ball feature allows for an easy shave every time.  I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with anything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave often thankfully but whenever I do I hate shaving because I have mild acne. I don&#x27;t know if the vibrating aspect of this razor actually works but it definitely feels like I can shave without worrying about my acne. The cartridges are expensive so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a viable razor if you shave often, but if you don&#x27;t have to shave often or have sensitive skin then this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my husband and he was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think they could improve the Gillette fusion razor.I was wrong.The flexball now allows me to shave easily around my chin and neck with no irritation and a clean shave.This razor is worth the upgrade!!</li>
    <li> Gillette shaving gel helps me to getting a really nice and smooth shave while it also keeping your face cool.  It has a very pleasant smell and will get the job done.  I like the closeness I get and the ease it goes on.  It reduced shaving irritation to almost nothing.</li>
    <li> After using this razor for over a month, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the shave.  I used the Proglide prior to this and I can say the major difference is that with the flex ball, it takes less strokes to get those curves on the face.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how much of an impact the flexball would have but I noticed a difference immediately during the first shave.  I&#x27;m not big on electric razors so anyone looking to purchase a standard razor, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Thanks, awesome product</li>
    <li> I love this razor. The vibrating action makes keeping the 5 blade head a snap to rinse out. Well worth the money and you will make a lot of points if you give this as a gift.</li>
    <li> yes, very good product, it is soft with less force, and no hurt to the skin, and i want to displace the Schick Razon for 4 Blades, i like it.</li>
    <li> Mostly gimmicky, I&#x27;m sure, but it actually does seem to follow contours quite well. Razors are always impressive when they and their blades are both fresh, but I&#x27;d still say it does a pretty impressively good job of giving a smooth, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that it only comes with one blade cartridge.</li>
    <li> I used the disposable razors like BIC with bad results so switched to Gillette Fusion when they came out. Went from Gillette Fusion Razor to Gillette Fusion Power Razor to  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler 3-in-1 Groomer with Trimmer  and never been sorry. When I saw this new razor figured for a few bucks would give it a try. Today I shave my face dry with it and WOW, this razor is GREAT! It slide over my face with no drag what so ever, no scraps or cuts. Did 3/4 of my face before realized never turned it on, after I did it was even better no friction just smooth glide. Yes the blades are expensive but so is all the toilet paper you will be using to stop the bleeding from all the other razors. If you own an old Fusion razor or thinking of buying a new one don&#x27;t hesitate to buy the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, you will be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> good razor,and i use it everyday,it fits me well</li>
    <li> The blade was not to good</li>
    <li> Love it so far, better than the usual proglide. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> like the razor handle</li>
    <li> As described. And, works GREAT. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product is good, quality is guaranteed</li>
    <li> The blade does not seem to be as sharp as I usually use, thought they are the same brand and should be as &amp;#34;sharp &amp;#34; ? May be the way this razor head moves it is not the same as the previous model of Gillette that i used ?</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from bzzagent.com and I am so glad I accepted the offer.  I was using a razor from a different brand and I got so used to it and got comfortable that I can honestly say, if I saw this at the store, I wouldn&#x27;t have even given this a second look.  I tried different brands before and this razor glides smoothly, cuts close without causing irritation. I love this product and again, thank you bzzagent.com!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor and gillette shaving gel as part of a free testing sample from BZZAgent. I love this razor and will be purchasing when this one dulls out. It cut my 4 day old stubble with ease and it contoured along my face very smoothly with no cutting. The gel also made it glide smoothly but I love the ball technology that definitely helped.</li>
    <li> i reveived this in the mail free through BzzAgent to try and this razor gives the closest shave ever. It leaves your skin silky smooth. The flexball is also great because it adjusts to your face and helps prevent razor burn while getting a closer shave. I would definitely recommend this razor as well as their shaving cream which smells good and prevents razor burn.</li>
    <li> Is very good, is I have ever used the best goods, thank amazon!</li>
    <li> I tried this, as a Bzzagent!&lt;br /&gt;it ROCKED MY SHAVE</li>
    <li> Son absolutely loves this razor. Says it is the closest he has ever been able to shave. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> At first I thought that the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; was a gimmick to sell more razors. Then I noticed that since I bought this razor I have yet to cut myself shaving. So maybe the ball does actually work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see much difference from the regular power fusion proglide (without &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; technology....)</li>
    <li> great close shave, very long lasting blades.</li>
    <li> I had an old Fusion Proglide Power and recently the vibration button on the handle broke (after 4 years).  I hated every second that I shaved without the vibration.  Its one of those features that I thumbed my noes at, but after using it every day for years its now a feature I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free sample in order to review, and I must admit I was quite pleased.  I have used the same razor and replaceable head for years, and I am not a fan of change.  One use of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall and I&#x27;m already considering purchasing a bunch of replaceable razor heads.  It gave me one of the closest shaves I have ever had, and the flexball technology makes it easy to miss those hard to shave spots around the jawline.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally rave about a razor&#x27;s performance but I have to give Kudos to Gillette for taking the time to engineer a razor as smooth and advanced as the FlexBall razor. I immediately felt like I was getting a smoother shave and with my sensitive skin, that is a big deal. I highly recommend it and if you have a strong jaw line the FlexBall really helps get around those areas.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at the close shave I got from this razor. I have used gillette fusion power for a long time now. Even with a brand new razor I don&#x27;t get the same ease of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball didn&#x27;t add anything for me in my shaving experience but again very impressed with the blades, the most important part.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from my previous Gillette fusion.  This thing not only looks sleek, it shaves sleek.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is quick, the flexball provides tremendous flexibility and smoothness in the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is a pleasure and dare I say fun with the flexball handle.</li>
    <li> Love the razor. The new flexball technology does make a big difference. It gives you a nice clean shave and it makes your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Recently got to try the  flexball on a prior Bzz with the new gel as well and have to say what a great combination. No nicks and best of all, no ingrown hairs the next couple of days after. When I received notice I was selected to Bzz the subscription kit I was very happy. I was a Dollar Shave club member and was planning on canceling for the new Gillette product. Now being given the opportunity to see what its all about I did just that.  For me it was a clear choice of close shave and no ingrown hairs from Gillette or stubbly shave and plenty of ingrown hairs from Dollar shave. I truly believe Gillette got it right with this product, and BTW the Shave Gel has one of the best scents out there. My wife loves it</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors for years.  They are not the cheapest razors in the world so I feel like you should get what you pay for when it comes to razor blades.  First of all the product itself looks great.  The handle is very comfortable and feels solid in your hands.  The flexball allows the razor to bend and contour to almost anything: with that being said so do my hands and wrist.  The first day that I used this product I was disappointed to say the least.  It did not feel any different than the razor that I was currently using and maybe just a little bit worse.  Surprisingly everyday after that it seemed to get better and better.  The one thing that I would say that sets it apart from my current razor is the amount of times I need to shave over a certain area for it to feel smooth and clean.  This one is once and done. There is no need to keep shaving the same spot over and over like the current razor that I was using.  I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on.  I would recommend this razor to anyone who currently uses any Gillette products.  I would like to mention that this was a free trial from Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> The slight vibration of the power makes a huge difference. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good razor I like the pivoting head and the power.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, I have noticed that this thing gives me a closer shave than my $130 electric shaver. I will be using it on my business trips. Get yourself one you won&#x27;t be sad that you did!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my old man, and he loves it so much!</li>
    <li> When I bought the NEW Fusion Proglide with Flexball(tm) Technology razor, I was expecting to get a better shave than their previous model. I was however, quite surprised in what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t expect, is to get some help with shaving around my jaw line and my favorite bumpy apple on my neck. That always makes me very cautious not to get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally need to keep turning the razors I use slightly to avoid cuts, but the Fusion Proglide with Flexball(tm) Technology razor took care of that worry. The head swivels to ease shaving over bumpy apples and jaw lines and actually made me less anxious about shaving these areas with my second and third uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time, I&#x27;ve used the twin blade model they have due to cost, but now I&#x27;ve made the switch to this, because the cost of not switching for me, means the fear of getting cuts because my hand just doesn&#x27;t pivot with the ease that the Fusion Proglide with Flexball(tm) Technology razor does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Gillette! I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try. If you&#x27;re skeptical, I get it, but you really need to try this one!</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  The Flexball gives me a close comfortable shave with effortless strokes across my face.  I have sensitive skin, so other razors with cause irritation when going over the same area many times.  Luckily, the Fusion Proglide usually only takes one draw across the skin to give me the close shave I like.  The blades seem to be of high quality and will maintain their sharpness for many daily shaves.  I&#x27;m excited I&#x27;ve found this razor and imagine I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I am a long time, faithful Gillette customer. I have used there products for several years, and have never truly been dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my free razor from Gillette to try out. I broke it out of the box the same day it arrived, and used it that night to shave my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one new addition that Gillette made to their new Fusion ProGlide Power was the FlexBall technology. I can honestly say that this is a major improvement from the old  ProGlide Power. With the flexball razor, I feel like I can cut through the contours of my face and skin more sharply and get a closer shave. The first shave was very smooth and precise. The one thing that I still had trouble figuring out if it was really a benefit (even on the previous version) was the vibrating razor component. In my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like it makes a difference. I own a Fusion ProGlide Styler and the vibrating component on that feels like it really adds to the shave, but I don&#x27;t get the same feel with the ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking to purchase a new razor, either because it is time for a new one or if you are fed up with your current one and want to try something new, you cannot go wrong with this product. With Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Power (with FlexBall Technology) you are getting a solid, reliable razor. You are going to get a close shave every time with little to no discomfort. The blade will glide across your skin effortlessly and you will be able to maneuver it across the contour of your face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Gillette had sent me one for free to try, and I got to say it does help especially around the neck. It&#x27;s a good idea i do wish it pivoted a little more though. The handle also has an upgraded grip from the standard fusion and its comfortable to hold. The Proglide blades provide a nice close shave, and last a little over a week when shaving daily.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with this razor for two days now.  In the past, I have not liked any of Gillette&#x27;s Fusion product lines.  They tended to nick my face while not providing a closer, more comfortable shave than razors that had fewer blades and no gimmicks.  However, those technical problems have all been corrected in the new Proglide Power Flexball razor handle.  It uses either the original Fusion Power or Proglide Power cartridges.  The Flexball technology has made a major difference when comparing the quality of my shaves to those two previous versions, as well as the current razor I regularly use.  Gillette has been hyping this handle&#x27;s ability to adjust to the contours one&#x27;s face.  I can say without a doubt that it lives up to the hype very well.  The result has been a very effective and comfortable shave.  What has impressed me more than anything is how well it shaves the trouble spots on my face.  I have always had difficulty with the areas on, and immediately under, my jawline.  This razor has been able to shave them effortlessly.  I was absolutely stunned at how much stubble had been reduced on my jawbone after just the initial pass.  After re-lathering and making a second pass, I could not believe how smooth the area was.  I have been neither cut nor nicked thus far, nor have I experienced any irritation during or after usage.  I still do not think the vibrating feature helps obtain a closer shave, but it does seem to relax the skin somewhat.  The one issue that Gillette has not addressed is the cost of the replacement cartridges.  That is what will prevent me from using this razor on a regular basis.  But, in terms of shear quality and mechanics, this is positively excellent - a five star rating without question.</li>
    <li> There are several things about this razor that are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexball - this is great for that close shave.  Overrated?  Nope...it actually delivers a point of difference from other razors.  I shave in the shower, and have had a great experience with this razor, no nicks so far, and a really close shave.  I don&#x27;t have to go over tough areas as much now with this flexible design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Blade - the extra blade for trimming around sideburns and nose seems to have been improved.  28 days in, still sharp, and this is not usual with other blades.  Love the precision there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel - great.  Has the right weight, adds a little more joy to the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clogs?  No.  The blades seem far enough apart that they are not clogging with hair.  So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> since you need to get refills eventually this is only average. Refills are too pricey!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other razors and I can say that this gives me the closest shave. I have been using other brand razors and types and when I use this one I get the closest ever. I have threw all of my other ones away and replaced it with this one. The blades do not dull as fast either. I have thick facial hair and these cut right threw it. Also with it being powered it helps out a lot. I have used this razor for about a few weeks now and am still using the same blade. I am very happy with this and have recomended this to friends, family and colleagues.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Power Fusion since it was introduced way back when. For the most part it does the job, I do have sensitive skin and I have yet to find a shaving solution that does not leave my face feeling like fire.&lt;br /&gt;So figured it was time to try something new and got this one. I was so hoping for that moment that I had discovered the answers to my shaving problems......unfortunately I had not. This Proglide razor gives the same shave and I cannot tell how the Flexball technology is helping. Heck I am still trying to determine how the &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; Power Fusion I have gets me a better shave. Just want that razor that the cartridges last long, soothes the face, and gives a really close shave time after time.......still looking.</li>
    <li> First things first, I got the Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle for free from Gillette, but even if I hadn&#x27;t I would have still reviewed this razor in the same manner. You see, I am very direct, sometimes too direct at times and view life from a more logical perspective in opposition to an emotional or intuitive perspective. That being said, the Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle provides, by far, the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever had. At first glance, I thought &amp;#34;oh, another vibrating razor. Okay...&amp;#34; But the Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle is different. There is something to the design of the handle that really makes the Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle a truly remarkable design. As you move the razor across your face, the curves and angles of your face are very manageable through the design of the FlexBall. The vibrating handle adds something... now, I&#x27;m not an engineer, but there is some harmony and comfort to the vibration that makes the shave smoother and easier. The blade itself cuts swiftly and closely without any knicks or cuts. The Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle is simply the best shave I have had so far in my life.</li>
    <li> I want to thank Gillette for this awesome product. After 4 or 5 shaves, the razor is just as sharp as the first use. This sounds crazy but i swear it&#x27;s true, since shaving with this razor i no longer have the 5 &amp;#34;O-Clock&amp;#34; Shadow. This is the best razor out there right now.  Everyone should try it and they will see what the big deal is. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette. I&#x27;m Italian so it is very difficult for me to get a good close shave that lasts more than a few hours. Thanks to the Fusion ProGlide, my shave will last me at least 24 hours. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was this impressed by a razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a special promotion. It works great!  the swivel head is so innovative and shaving has never been easier.  I can even skip a day it get so close!&lt;br /&gt;A++++</li>
    <li> After receiving Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle from Gillette, I was impressed by the new look, but didn&#x27;t think the shave could get better. I was wrong, it just took me a few shaves to notice. It&#x27;s closer, so I shave less. Good work Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle!</li>
    <li> I recently received this new razor invention from Gillette directly from the brand.  If you currently enjoying using the Fusion razor, you will definitely enjoying using the Fusion with the Flexball.  The Flexball allows the blades to glide more easily and smoothly over the various nooks and crannies of your facial structure.  Especially along the chin and the jaw line where the bone doesn&#x27;t always provide a smooth area for the blades to move on.  Additionally, the new blades seem to be much better than the older Fusion blades.  But the Flexball just allows a smooth flowing handle and blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would get 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the price of replacement blades.  If somehow the blades were cheaper, that would be much better, but then again, this is how they get you.  With the Flexball and the vibration, you could probably use cheaper blades or extend the life of the blades.  It won&#x27;t be as nice as a fresh blade, but it&#x27;ll beat any other one out there.</li>
    <li> My husband goes through razors like nobody&#x27;s business so I thought why not pick him this one. I liked the idea of the Flexball Handle Technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to him it&#x27;s a decent razor and the Flexball makes it easier to get shaving done around his chin area without cutting himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s pretty much all he gave me on it lol!</li>
    <li> Def will be buying another has to be the best shave I have had in a long time. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have used yet! It glides over my skin and doesn&#x27;t miss a single spot! Very close shave! Thank you Gillette for allowing me to try this product for free:)</li>
    <li> This razor is the best! It&#x27;s better than the non-Flexball Fusion I had used before and the Schick Hydro 5 powered razor I was using when I decided to give it a try. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor directly from Gillette to test it out. The first time I picked it up the weight and handle felt comfortable. Now I didn&#x27;t expect much from the shave due to the prior razor having done so well but I was very wrong! The rotating motion helps to get the jawline and avoids those missed spots from the rigid razor. As you shave the razor pivots and rotates to hug your face for a great shave. The blades are designed in the same manner as before but the rotating head along with the pivot makes shaving much less of chore.&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest anyone that shaves on a regular occasion get this!</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s fusion Proglife with flexball handle technology is awesome! The first time i used it I could blaze through a shave and get nearly every hair on the first pass. Super smooth and great feeling razor!</li>
    <li> There are a million shaving choices out there from cheap throwaways to expensive specialty razors and this one is a good quality razor at close to a throwaway price.  It is an improvement on an already popular model that gives a close shave without any major skin irritation.  I have already been using a Fusion razor and this one adds a more comfortable handle that is easier to guide.  A solid improvement on an old standby.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, which has made me despise shaving more than twice a week.  For that reason, I was excited to try the new Flexball razor, provided by Gillette.  I was a Gillette man growing up, but a few years ago decided to switch to a cheaper competitor.  The differences were quite marked.  This Flexball razor takes things to a whole new level.  For the past month, my face has been the least irritated it&#x27;s been since I started shaving.  It really does follow the contour of your face markedly better, resulting in much less irritation and nicks\cuts.  Whole the blades may be overpriced, this razor is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first saw this razor. It looked like just another gimmick to get me to spend money, but then I tried it out and it exceeded my expectations. What a smooth shave!! It followed all of the contours of my face with no problems whatsoever. It is the closest shave I have had in a long time. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Fusion Power razor since it came out.  The blade setup with the addition of vibration made for the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had...before the new Flexball model.  Even without vibration, this outperforms the old model, and without having to swap batteries fairly often (a big downside of the Power model).  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this razor, and look forward to getting as much life and enjoyment out of it as I have the Power model.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who is a mostly electric shaver user, but sometimes needs a very close shave for special occasions/meetings, etc.  He likes this razor very much and had no complaints at all, says the flexibility is amazing and that there was no irritation whatsoever considering the closeness of the shave on his rather heavy, coarse facial hair.  He did not, however, think that the vibration enhanced the shave and I have to agree.  I ended up trying this for myself just for fun because it looked an awful lot like my women&#x27;s razor, and was very surprised that it actually works much better than the razor I use, which is about the same price. I&#x27;ve honestly never had such a close shave and the flex is amazing, especially around the ankles and underarm areas, and, yes, it works very well on private areas also. The thing that surprised me the most was how gentle it is; I normally always end up with a bit of razor burn no matter how careful I try to be but had none with this.</li>
    <li> I normally use single blade razors and I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this. I like how the sways as I go around my chin. I don&#x27;t have to lift my head as I am shaving to get to certain areas. I like the lotion at the end of the blade as well.</li>
    <li> Have been using the razor for the last month.  Very great shaver.  I love how it contours to my face.  Giving be a very close shave with no razor knicks yet.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Gillette Razors, and this one is just OK.  I don&#x27;t think the ball helps it anything.</li>
    <li> Okay, so there actually isn&#x27;t a bell. Though, if there was a bell, would you really want to be shaved by it? Also, if you mustache a question, you should shave it for later. See! This review was worth reading after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, back to ringing (I couldn&#x27;t resist) in another exciting review - this time of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with FlexBall technology, which Gillette kindly sent me to try so I cannot comment on how cost effective the product is (also because that is something that varies by person). If that isn&#x27;t a really long name for a product, I don&#x27;t know what is. Fortunately, as long as your life is not a living infomercial, you will usually refer to it as just your razor, if you refer to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you may be wondering when I will actually start reviewing the product instead of writing hilarious (Work with me here) puns and thoughts. What&#x27;s the hurry though? Take some time to smell the roses...which now you can because your razor will helpfully shave any hair away that is currently interfering with your ability to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a razor with five blades, it delivers a fittingly smooth and excellent shave. The FlexBall technology is not only fun to say, but also makes shaving fun, as it allows the razor to adjust to the contours of each person&#x27;s face (If you&#x27;re questioning how in the world that is fun, you obviously need FlexBall technology in your life or are simply not easily amused and should reconnect with your inner child who should not be shaving in the first place making this point moot). I have yet to experience that peculiar burning sensation that some disposable razors have left in the past, which is admittedly a good thing. As this is a power razor, there is a button that will cause it to vibrate. I did not notice a difference shaving with the razor vibrating or not, but perhaps there is some rationale behind it. If not, it&#x27;s simply a nifty party trick...for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is a sleek instrument, which may cause your other toiletries some serious envy, supposing they were animate and had feelings. Major animation studios have yet to release movies about animated toiletries to help us further visualize this situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a plastic mount of sorts to rest your razor on when not in use. Unfortunately, this grey piece of plastic is not nearly as sleek as the razor, but that&#x27;s not really a major concern when one purchases a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an effective, handsome razor, the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology certainly fits the bill so it is worth a try. If you&#x27;re not, then the razor market is certainly vast and you are welcome to go explore the numerous options. If you&#x27;re wondering when this review will finally conclude, look no further.instrument, which may cause your other toiletries some serious envy, supposing they were animate and had feelings.

    <li> Had been using a Schick razor for a while but wanted to try something new. I fell in love with this Gillette razor. It gets every hair on your face including the hairs on the sides and under and around your neck. Very few cuts compared to razors that I&#x27;ve used in the past. First time using Gillette but this will now be my brand for life. If you haven&#x27;t purchased one I strongly suggest that you do so.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I received a promotional Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor and was incredible impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  the Proglide is a five blade shaver with an additional blade on the back for trimming. The new Proglide cartridges will easily fit on your existing Gillette Fusion shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The flexball technology allows the shaver to stay in close contact to your skin. It really targets the hard to get corners such as the bottom of your chin and crook of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Proglide does come with an improved handle compared to the old Fusion, but the real difference between the two version is to be found in the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The leading blades have been made thinner, and the lubricating strip above the blades is significantly larger to improve the glide across your face.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get to test the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette. I was skeptical about the FlexBall Handle Technology but found that it does give a closer shave in those hard to reach areas. I&#x27;ve used the razor for about 10 shaves and the blades are still sharp enough to give a clean shave. It is difficult to nick yourself with the flexball because it bends to the contours of your face. Overall this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used. It is my razor of choice!!</li>
    <li> I used this lasst night and WOW what a great razor.  I normally can&#x27;t use razors because of  razor bumps on my neck, but found that this product was great and gentle.  i was able to finally get the close shave i have always wanted.  I&#x27;m keeping this Gillette Fusion Proglide for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Finally Upgraded to a swivel head model. Bought on Amazon good deal on product &amp; 2-day shipping.</li>
    <li> The razor worked very well. I found when it&#x27;s vibrating, I didn&#x27;t have enough control around sensitive areas such as the ears and mouth edges. I cut the top of my ear. Partly my own fault. Next time, I&#x27;ll turn it off when I need more control. I shave my head as well as my face. I let my hair grow out a week and tested the razor. I found I was able to shave everything off with less time and effort then before. The vibrating action definitely makes a difference in time and results in a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I recieved one of these Fusion Proglide razors with power function from Gilette as one of their testers. I used to use the old fusion before the powerball and i felt it to be a pretty run of the mill razor in all honesty. But after a few tips and getting this new razor with a rotating head i felt the shave was much smoother. The hairs seemed to cut more even and with less strokes. all in all i think its a pretty good value at a mere 10 dollars and can be found at pretty much any local retailer. ive tried a fair amount of different razors and if your an occasional shaver like me this easily handles the job.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me one of these Proglide Power Razor to try out earlier this month. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I have to say I am really enjoying it. I am getting a much closer shave than my previous razor and  its also gentler on my skin. The vibrating action really helps to ensure no hair is left behind and has me looking all spiffy and top notch. Would definitely  recommend it.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well, has a smooth motion and close shave.  The using the vibration function is a bit annoying, as it makes your hand tingle and makes the razor get warm.</li>
    <li> Best shave I recall having.  Particularly good around my chin and the sensitive adam&#x27;s apple.  Highly recommend.  I liked it so much I ordered one for my son in law, who also loves it, agreeing that the proglide feature fits the contours of your face, chin, etc.  He also says best one he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used a Gillette razor for years, but this one is a definite improvement over anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does a great job with only one pass. It is also wider than most so shaving takes less time. The vibration provided by the AAA battery in the handle is a great feeling too. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different type of brands of razors. I think I have found the perfect one for me. It follows the contours of your face and it&#x27;s the closest shave that I&#x27;ve got so far in my life. I don&#x27;t have to go over and over a spot like  I used to with other razors and I realize that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often too. Overall I love it. Thanks Gillette for sending my Fusion Proglide Power free.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I never used a razor like this before, it gives me a nice close shave and hugs the different curves on my face.  It even mowed right through a patch that every other razor always seems to miss and always leaves that stubble rough patch.  Don&#x27;t hesitate give it a try yourself!!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding and the price was great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so cheap, and I really like this shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a while. Figured I&#x27;d share my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Very responsive design. Easy to manipulate. I&#x27;ve lived an active life, spent time in the military, so I have a few scars on my head/face. This razor didn&#x27;t nick me. I even shaved my head today with it (wife likes the clean shaven look). Shaved my head by myself, no mirror, just by touch, was out of shaving cream so I just used soap. Didn&#x27;t cut myself, got all the hair. Used the small single blade for around the ears. After 30 years of shaving, this is my favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;CON: Replacement blades are too freaking expensive. Yes, it&#x27;s a great razor, but the refills are over-priced. Were the refills less expensive, I would have given this razor a 5 star rating. I understand the company needs to make a profit. But honestly, $4 to $5 for one refill? Seriously? That&#x27;s just INSANE.  I&#x27;m using every trick I can think of to extend the life of the blades. If they were even $3 for a refill, I&#x27;d just pop in a new one every week or two.</li>
    <li> After trying this razor I am 100% satisfied. I have been a Gillette user for years it is the only razor that doesn&#x27;t leave my face razor burned and irritated. So  once I found out they came out with a new product I knew I had to try it. I actually received this razor free from Gillette to try and I must say the results are amazing. I not only used the razor to shave my face but also my head. I have been shaving my head for many years now and usually end up going over some spots twice just to make sure I have followed the contour of my head close enough. With the Flexball technology you do not have to do that anymore. The razor follows the contour perfectly allowing for a closer shave. The power feature which I have always found to be a good feature also allows for one of the closest shaves. The trimming blade on the backside of the razor allows for detailed trimming which is perfect for getting straight cut side burns and close into hard to get at spots. This razor all in all is amazing and I will be continuing to use Gillette products forever the quality that this company provides is top notch. This razor proves time and time again that Gillette provides for its consumers and does not lie when coming up with new innovative products for the most comfortable shave. Thanks again Gillette!!!!</li>
    <li> This flexball technology is really something!  It creates such a smooth shave over all the contours of my face.  It is amazing!  I have used Gillette for years and this is, by far, my favorite razor from them yet!  It takes a little getting used to as the shave as the handling is different from every other razor on the market, but worth it in the end.  Very easy and wonderful shave that lasts twice as long as my shaves in the past!</li>
    <li> After using this for a few weeks now (after getting this product given to me my Gilette to test), I am not all that impressed.  I feel like the ball handle sort of leaves me out of control of my face and the razor itself.  I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really close shave.  And I also notice that I miss strips or sections, have to go over the areas again, and that gives my sensitive skin razor burn.  It seemed like a really great idea at first.  But I also have a very sharp face, so maybe guys with a rounder face would benefit from this technology better.  I will be sticking with my other Gilette razor from now on.</li>
    <li> I just tried the new Pro-glide. And i must say that it is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I have the razor that was made without the flex ball technology, and i could definitely feel the difference between the two. The way it makes my hyper sensitive skin feel afterwards is just beyond words. Its so much more of a smoother glide than its predecessor. I have not found any cons for this yet, but im pretty sure that the more i use this, ill eventually find something. But if your are looking for a new razor. I highly recommended this incredible tool. Well Done Gillette, Well Done</li>
    <li> this shaver is one of the best i have ever used works great for men and women very easy to use</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me a Fusion ProGlide Razor to try out and I’m glad they did because it gave me the opportunity to try a razor with flexable rollerball technology for the first time. It definitely took me a bit of time to get used to it, as well as the slightly heavier weight than my more traditional (and less scientifically advanced) razor. But after awhile I learned how to guide the razor over my face to shave away all my unwanted hair. It was pretty cool how there are five blades – so the hairs have no way to escape! I especially liked the hydration strip although I still use shaving cream too – but I think it adds to the razor’s ability to glide smoothly over my skin.</li>
    <li> Received the product free from Gillette. I was skeptical that the vibration while cutting with 5 blades and a flexball would be a recipe for cuts. Boy was i wrong. This is an amazing razor. My skin hasn&#x27;t been its smooth since before I had facial hair. My Wife agrees that its the closest, cleanest shave ever, I&#x27;m sold. Another plus is leaving the vibration on when cleaning the blades. After each glide I would just leave vibration on it held just the blades under the sink water, one very light tap on the sink and all the hair fell out. Normally i use disposable razors as my hair is coarse when short and gets stuck in the razor. Also while gliding down my neck, instead of gliding off my jawline, the flexball swiveled and it continued gliding right down my neck. Really impressed all around.</li>
    <li> Some people say it&#x27;s a gimmick but I feel the flexball does a better job on the curves on my face.  I&#x27;ve noticed much less irritation.</li>
    <li> What an amazing shaving experience! I cannot praise this Gillette fusion pro glide power ball enough. I found after the first time that I used it, I had no uncomfortable pulling of my facial hair at all, which I have had in the past with some razors. It conformed to my face perfectly. The only downside that I can see is that the refill blades are pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> Receiving the product from Gillette through the mail, I would like to give you all the following appraisal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about four days, I&#x27;m not one for extolling the virtues of any powered razor.  I believe they&#x27;re only a fad that gives no practical purpose than to get you to use higher cost shaving heads and to buy batteries.  I also feel that the multiple blades are of no practical use either when only one or two quality blades can give you the same feel, along with a good lubricating strip, of a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is bulky and doesn&#x27;t feel good in my hand.  As someone with sensitive skin, I had multiple problems getting knicks on my throat area and I have relatively smooth skin in the first place.  It works okay but I wouldn&#x27;t invest in shaving heads for this unit.  I will undoubtedly go back to my store-branded disposable variety that has two blades and a lubricating strip -- I can get ten of them in a bag for a dollar, saving me a proverbial TON of money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have disposable income and want something that stands out in your bathroom, go ahead and purchase this somewhat overpriced product and spend nearly or over $200/year for your shaving habit as opposed to $10/year for my own shaving needs.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor and comfortable to use. It does take away the need to contort your face just like the commercials show. In my case, however, because I have a \\&quot;leather\\&quot; face, I need to press a razor hard against my face to get a close shave. With this razor&#x27;s design, it is \\&quot;too\\&quot; flexible to allow me to do this. I would prefer a more stable head to be able to apply the necessary pressure. If you shave differently then the other enhancements this razor offers are worthy of purchase.</li>
    <li> I had previously used the older model of this razor but prefer this one better due to the pivoting head. Not only does that help get all of those stubborn hairs but it helps provide a close shave that I prefer.  This razor also helps prevent razor burn with the moisturizing strips.  Great new feature to a trusted old brand.</li>
    <li> Just tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Handle Razor and I cannot believe what this razor delivers in grooming. I have a goatee that needs to be shaved around and this works with precision trimming. I am used to my electric razor and then using another trimmer razor for detail, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try and by golly, it worked. Must be the Flexball Handle, because none of my other razors worked around the edges like this one does. Close shave like most 5 bladed razors, but corners like no other. I *do* have sensitive skin, which gets very dry in midwest winters, but this did not cause irritation. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion has always been my choice of shaver for some time now. I can always depend on a smooth shave with no cuts or hair resistance with this product and it has gotten even better with the flexball. The Flexball helps a little more with maneuverability and goes with your facial structure enabling less tug and pull. I recommend Gillette above all for these reasons and more.</li>
    <li> I received the new Fusion ProGlide from Gillette to try and really like it! The pivoting head follows eevery contour of my face and neck. The multiple blades are ridiculously sharp, which leads to a super close comfortable shave without any nics or irritation and the single blade on the back of the head allows me to keep sharp lines on my goatee. The overall construction of this razor is very sturdy and seems that it will last for years. I don&#x27;t know that I would have gone out and purchased this razor on my own, but after trying it, I&#x27;m sold!! I&#x27;ve even bought a second one for travel!!</li>
    <li> It is about time that someone made a razor for those of us with prominent jaw lines and cleft chins. I highly recommend it for those who have the same. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this razor which I received from Gilette to try out.  It was a comfortable shave, and the massaging of the razor mixed with the pivoting end produced a closer shave than I have ever had before.  Overall I would absolutely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a comfortable close shave.</li>
    <li> Coming from a Mach 3 and Schick Hydro razor, I would consistently get close shaves. Being given this razor as a promotion from GIllette, I have tried this razor our daily for the past four weeks. In comparison to the industry standard razors, the Proglide razor offers and similarly close shave, but with added flexibility, which I find gives more comfort in every shave stroke. Having the pivot base also gives the feeling of more control when shaving. I would have no hesitation in recommending this razor to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two caveats I found with this razor were related to pricing. Replacement heads must have been made more commoditized since the Mach 3, but I find my cartridges wear out after only two weeks of use. This pales in comparison to the 4-6 weeks I got from my Schick or Mach 3. Which then brings me to unit pricing, Replacement heads can utilize the Fusion cartridges, but these are still insanely expensive to buy and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping up, if you want the best, most comfortable shave, get this razor, but with the understanding that it will cost you quite a bit in maintenance costs. If you are looking for a budget friendly alternative, invest in Mach 3 disposables from Gillette, which give great performance and a fraction of the costs. You will get minor irritation going the alternative route, but this is sacrifice you will have to make.</li>
    <li> razor is flexible and contours with the shape of your face, providing a close cut.  Quality product from Gillette. Try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fusion razors extensively, though every cartridge purchase makes me shrug at the woeful economics of the endeavor.  I&#x27;ve never found the shave lacking, but I nonetheless transitioned to old school safety razors to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m trying Fusion again.  This is a good, albeit initially weird handle.  It does what it claims, specifically allowing for somewhat unique pivots to reduce wrist gymnastics while delivering a great shave.  At first the benefits were a bit limited, as my old habits were hard to break free from.  In the end, I got a better shave than with a traditional handled Proglide with less effort.  I think that&#x27;s the whole point, and since it uses the same cartridges, it&#x27;s a one time investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my double edged safety razor and $.10 (or less) blades.  That&#x27;s my choice, but you may enjoy Gillete&#x27;s work, especially if you&#x27;re already using Proglides.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned. No irritation and only took one pass for me to be smooth!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to try and was so excited to test it, as I regularly use Gillette Fusion and Fusion Proglide razors already. I have never been so pleased with a razor as I am with this one. It glides so smoothly and easily. It does not snag hair or chop up your face like almost every other razor on the market. I get the closest shave, and can walk away without tearing my face up, so this razor gets two thumbs up. I recommend this to every man out there. Stop using crappy razors, there is a much better, yet decently affordable razor that will make every man happy.</li>
    <li> This razor kicks some serious butt.  I used the normal Fusion power razor previously and didn&#x27;t really think a flex ball would make a big difference, but it did.  My face was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of the shower and have my wife feel it.  The ball made it go around countours a lot better than the standard razor so I got less cuts and more smoothness.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try out. I noticed right away it was very comfortable to hold. The FlexBall motion helps to get the jawline and all the other nooks and crannies so you can avoid those missed spots from the regular razors. This razor really hugs your face as you shave to give you the closest shave possible. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Flexball Gillette is the best idea Gillette have !!! This is the best shave in the world !!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with flex ball handle technology is very versatile. It is an all around good razor. It adapts to the contours of your shaving area easily and leaves a smooth finish without irritation.</li>
    <li> I got this razor f on Gillette to try and I absolutely love it. It is a solid razor with the roller ball to super close to ever inch of my face! Well designed and I highly recommend this product. My wife even used it on her legs and loved it!</li>
    <li> First off upon opening my package I was impressed just by the quality of the product; Very well made. Literally just used it and I havent had an easier shave; as they say virtually every hair, I was not expecting it to do that in one stroke of the blade.</li>
    <li> Received to test. Absolutely smooth shave. Flexball technology is the next big razor accomplishment. Very easy to use. Responded well to the shape of my face. The precision trimmer swagged up the sideburns!</li>
    <li> I received this razor 3 days ago as a buzzagent and I used it immediatelty.  I am not one that is excited for a change in brand of razors but I must tell you that this left me smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to shave the next morning.  I was shaving daily with my old razor and I am not going to miss doing that.  I have found my new razor.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever. I&#x27;m not a big fan when it comes to having to shave because if you don&#x27;t get the right type of razor, it&#x27;ll hurt when you shave. I personally am now in love with this product. I was hesitant at first, but a lot of people told me this would be a really good razor to use. I bought it, I used it and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. When it comes to shaving I have an extremely sensitive chin so it hurts when shave my chin but I really like this. My chin didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I used this. It moves with the shape of your skin, it has a good grip and nice form. The one thing I don&#x27;t understand is the vibration feature. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out it&#x27;s real purpose. Anywho, it&#x27;s a great product. :) definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor!  I never invest in more expensive razors mostly because I am cheap.  I usually use disposable razors and I have to shave every single day because of work.  Ever since I started using this razor, I only have to shave every other day.  I can not believe how good of a shave that I get with this razor.  My face is smoother than it&#x27;s been in years!  I have been telling all of my friends about this amazing product!  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> This razor was very smooth. Not much difference from other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past however. Didn&#x27;t seem to minimize the occurrence of razor bumps.</li>
    <li> gillete fusion is easy on the wallet its sensitive for the skin it acts as if it is electric trimmers what more an you ask for</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a part of a promotion by Gillette.  I am a a guy with a beard who always keeps his neck clean shaven.  My usual razor is an old 2 blade which I like except for the fact if I shave too soon after the last shave I breakout pretty bad and my neck tends to be quite sore.  So after I opened the package and see that his razor comes with a really nice holding tray for the razor I use this baby for my shave. WOW I couldn&#x27;t believe the closeness of the shave and the next morning when the neck irritation usually happens there is nothing.  I am a really happy guy.  Would replace my old 2 blade in a heartbeat, except when I checked on the price of replacement blades I couldn&#x27;t believe the price!! Yes, this is no doubt the best shave I ever had, but when this blade dulls, I&#x27;ll go back to using my old 2 blade.  :(</li>
    <li> This Fusion Proglide Power Razor experience was unlike any other razor experience I&#x27;ve had. The size of the handle was hefty providing a comfortable and sturdy grip. The blades contoured to my face resulting in every hair being cut no matter what direction it grew in. The one downfall I found with this experience was the use of the vibrator mechanism. This sensation takes away the feeling of blade up against your skin which to some people might be a benefit but I disagree. Without the feeling of the blade against my skin I cannot feel the hair being cut and do not feel as though I am getting a good shave so I go over areas more than once. Since I was having this response I did not use the vibrator for the other half of my face to experiment and see the difference. What I found was that I had no nicks and cuts on the non vibrator side and 3 or 4 on the vibrator side. The experience resulted in smooth skin,  no redness, and no dryness proving to be a razor I would buy and recommend to others, minus the vibration.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I choose four out of five stars because the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power With Flex ball technology gives you a closer and accurate shave with the 5 thin blades and the Flexball technology helps the blade adapt to your face. Also I recommend men that while shaving try to shave slowly and try to avoid shaving when you have breakouts.</li>
    <li> Let it be known that I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide w/ Flexball Handle from Gillette as part of a trial / promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette razors in general are just great, regardless of the latest gadget they&#x27;ve added to their newest razor.  That&#x27;s why I gave the ProGlide w/ Flexball Handle three stars.  If you took out all the gimmicks, this would still be a decent razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But specifically focusing on the Flexball &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;, I found it to be rather... forgettable.  At no point was I shaving my face and thinking, &amp;#34;Oh wow, this is way better now that it has this new Flexball!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve seen the commercial where they show you how well it contours to curves, and that&#x27;s great and all, but I never had a problem with it before this version of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess overall, my 3 stars reflects my feeling towards Gillette adding a new, insignificant feature to a razor that really didn&#x27;t need improving in the first place.  Enough with the gizmos Gillette, just give us the same great quality razor you&#x27;ve always produced and leave out the newfangled trinkets that we don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I received this razor FREE from Gillette as part of a product test group.&lt;br /&gt;I let my beard grow for months &amp; decided to shave when my new razor arrived. As usual, Fusion did not disappoint. I shaved the right side with my standard Fusion and the left side with the new Flexball handle. Both with new blades installed. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but I could not tell the difference. Bottom line, the Fusion is a great series of razors. I will continue to buy replacement blades but my advice is to get whatever handle is cheapest. I would not pay extra for power or Flexball. I just can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Overall, this razor was very sharp, almost too sharp and uncomfortable for me to use after I had been using an electric shaver for a year-and-a-half or so. I love how it works, but this was definitely a challenge to use and still is. I don&#x27;t know how often I will keep trying again, but this definitely was worth getting from Gillette. It definitely will be useful for men that need a good and close shave - because this thing is sharp. Just a quick recommendation: get a cooler for your face. This thing is so sharp, it can even irritate non-sensitive faces.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor! it uses the same blades as any of the Fusion razors which is great.  the ball makes it a really great shave</li>
    <li> After trying the Fusion ProGlide Power as a free product sample, I am reminded of why I ditched my Fusion razor before. I didn&#x27;t like the feeling that I was being duped into buying a disposable cartridge with twice as many blades than were necessary for the sake of increased profits. Regardless, I sat aside my go-to discount 3 blade razor when my ProGlide Power arrived last week.&lt;br /&gt;  I quickly noticed three features of this razor that makes it stand out among my current line-up: the FlexBall handle, the amount of blades per cartridge, &amp; the micropulsing power feature.&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting action of the razor&#x27;s head due to the Flexball is pretty impressive. It&#x27;s noticeably the key feature to this razor with good reason. It keeps the blades in contact with the face while shaving around the chin. More contact &#x3D; less strokes for a faster, better shave. Speaking of the blades, I believe 5 + 1 was my count on this one. That is nearly half a dozen more than I use when shaving with my safety razor. This number of blades makes it more difficult to clean after each use than the mach 3. Not to mention, the cost of cartridge replacements. I typically avoid fusion razors for that reason alone. Lastly, the micro pulse feature is still useless in my book. By my account this is merely a vibrating handle. I&#x27;m sure the word &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; has been tied to this feature many times before. I&#x27;ve used the razor with and without the power feature and see no noticeable difference. Likewise, I&#x27;ve gone back to my safety razor for a closer, smoother shavet. I&#x27;ll stick with fewer blades per cartridge and not feel cheated when replacing them as needed.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from Gillette as a promotion. I think the razor is great, but I am not sure if it has anything to do with the Flex Ball or more about the razor head itself. I have a full beard so maybe the Flex Ball does its magic on the face contours I don&#x27;t shave. But it&#x27;s really nice for the back of my neck and beard line.</li>
    <li> Great product, the blades could be better but still works great. Love the flexability it has. Cleans shaves very nicely. Works great for a sensative face. i got as a gift and love it.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m a fashionable male, the good people at Gillette mailed me a Fusion ProGlide to review. You know the one. It&#x27;s got 5 Japanese katanas and a nuclear reactor strapped to it that they call &amp;#34;razor blades&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;battery&amp;#34;. And this cock of the walk also has a new trick: FlexBall technology! Better than my previous razor? Definitely. Revolutionary? Whoa whoa whoa there Paul Walker, pump the brakes. Let&#x27;s go feature by feature, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 blades: super sharp, vastly super to the disposable razors I was using. I still think they clog up more than the better spaced 3 blade razors Gillette previously touted as the greatest invention since sliced bread, but they&#x27;re certainly nice blades. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; blade: great to have, although I worry that some users won&#x27;t notice it, as it&#x27;s rather hidden. Doesn&#x27;t clog and is at a good angle for precision work, it definitely brings a nice bottle of wine to the table and doesn&#x27;t overstay it&#x27;s welcome. Phenomenal guest that single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery/nuclear reactor: I often shave in the shower without shaving cream. I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical, and I still think it&#x27;s a little hokey. But it&#x27;s kind of nice. Not sure I would pay more for it, but I definitely don&#x27;t mind it. Also alleviates TMJ disorders I&#x27;m told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lube strip: A+++. Like many things, I only wish it lasted longer. Made shaving much more pleasant. If I could cover my entire body with that stuff and slip and slide down the highway to work everyday, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FlexBall: Sorry, I&#x27;m just not buying it. OK, it definitely allows the razor to angle. But the thing is, your face just doesn&#x27;t have as many contours as they&#x27;d like you to believe. Your skin already stretches, your wrist pivots, your fingers protract. There&#x27;s already a variety of positions available on demand to the average shaver, just by moving your hand. And contrary to the implied design, actually gripping the razor by the ball detaches the blade. I think if you paid maximum attention, you could maybe notice it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;. Maybe. If you never paid attention to it, you&#x27;d forget it was there. Looks cool though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great razor, and I&#x27;d loved receiving one for free. I&#x27;ll probably buy the obscenely priced replacement blades because, all things considered, they last a long time, leave my face smooth, and never leave me with the feeling of having my individual hairs ripped out like my previous solution (trained armadillos/disposable razors) did. FlexBall? Eh, I&#x27;m over it. But if that&#x27;s what Gillette needs to do to sleep at night, I&#x27;m OK with it. If only the rest of the developed world &amp;#34;innovated&amp;#34; at the same pace as razor technology...l detaches the blade. I think if you paid maximum attention, you could maybe notice it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;. Maybe. If you never paid attention to it, you&#x27;d forget it was there.

    <li> I have to admit that I am one of those guys that thinks &amp;#34;more is better&amp;#34; when it comes to razor blades. I probably am being influenced by advertising and my own naivety, but if they made a razor with 20 blades I would be the first in line to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this razor to be the smoothest cutting, longest lasting blade that I have ever used. Since I have a light beard (and don&#x27;t shave my upper lip) I have used the same blade for a month and it is still working great. The lubrication part wore off in 2 weeks but I am okay with that. The Flexball technology seems to work for me, especially around the chin area which is where I usually cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Power feature before and I can&#x27;t say that I am sold on it.  It vibrates and that is about it.  For me it is not helpful.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will be buying more blades for this one in the future (once I have saved up for them, that is.) :-)</li>
    <li> I already use Gillette razors, so it was nice to be able to try something new from the same great brand. I received this razor to try for free from Gillette. First, I liked how the holder was much smaller and less bulkier than previous versions. The pivoting neck action from the ball provided a smooth shave and easy maneuverability. I may not have tried this new version on my own, but I&#x27;m glad I got the opportunity to try and see how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I like maintaining a small amount of facial hair, mostly in the shape of a goatee and the rest of my face to look nice and cleanly shaven. With most razors I shave and my face feels prickly afterwards letting me know that the razor I&#x27;m using just doesn&#x27;t cut it. haha puns. That was unintentional until I reread it. But then I got this bad boy. It makes my face feel nice and smooth and easily gets all of the unwanted facial hair. This razor is certainly a cut above the rest. Okay that one was intentional.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot. It works very well on the face and neck. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is on my chest. It didn&#x27;t get all the hairs and didn&#x27;t shave them all the way to the skin. But it works on the face! Gillette sent me it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that upon hearing about this new ball technology I was extremely skeptical, I mean what difference would it make really.  Well, let me just say that I can without a doubt say that the ball made a world of difference. The ball increases the flexibility of the razors blades allowing it to glide over the natural curves of my face. Giving me an extremely smooth and close shave. Thinking that this might be a one time only shave, I was pleased to find that the razor had a number of repeat performances in store for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and while the lubricating strip is wearing thin, the blades are still delivering an extremely close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually an electric razor kind of guy.  Less hassle, smooth shave. I tried this razor and I&#x27;m really glad I did. First, and most important, is a smooth shave. And no nicks. The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall provides a close shave even in those hard to get places. It takes a AAA battery which I have not had to replace. One day I left it on accidentally as I was rushing off to work and it&#x27;s nice to know that it shuts itself off. That is handy for me. It&#x27;s excellent and I think I just found my new razor.  For full disclosure, I was given this razor to test.  But my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This razor and handle is very thick and durable and has a razor that swivels on its base that can respond to the curves of your face for a very smooth shave.  It is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that make it easy to pass over an area multiple times while shaving with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried both of this razor with the vibrating button and the one without and prefer this product&#x27;s \\&quot;power on-board battery\\&quot; that does seem to be a  soothing shaving experience with the \\&quot;Micropulses\\&quot; they may be helping to reduce friction and increase razor glide, it does seem like a smoother shave but is hard to quantify. The blade itself seems to be very razor sharp and good for multiple shaves depending on how big of a job your beard is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an outstanding razor system taking shaving to a new level, no complaints here, I was very impressed with the great shaving  experience.</li>
    <li> A close shave just got better.  The Flexball handle lets the razor glide with nice sweeping strokes.  The Fusion Proglide was already good, and it just got better.  I got a sample to try from Gillette and will using this as my new Gillette.  You can&#x27;t beat this and the best blades around for the closest smoothest shave.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No nicks or cuts.  V ery close shave and great for hard areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Flexball (ever expanding product name) for about a month now.  Prior to this I was already using a similar Proglide for my everyday shaving.  I suspect there may be more global R&amp;D dollars being pumped into razor development than trying to find the cure for ebola - the only key product enhancement that I can tell between my new/old razor is the addition of the \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; which kind of acts like car shocks to make shaving a less bumpy ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion my shave with the Flexball is a slightly smoother / slightly better shave than my non-Flexball.  It&#x27;s not as big of an improvement as I noticed when I went from non-power to battery-powered version for a better/closer shave, bit still a slight improvement.  So considering the flexball is pretty much the same price range as the non-flex might as well get the flex.  It&#x27;s not the razor cost that gets you anyway - it&#x27;s the $3+ per replacement razor cartridge.  Still overall 5-STAR rating from me for this Fusion Proglide Flexball in consideration of price/value.  For $11 + occasional refills I get a nice smooth shave with no nicks (thus also avoiding the dreaded \\&quot;toilet paper face\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> I have been using a safety razor for a long time specificly a Gillette Fatboy.I received this razor from Gillette for free to review and this razor is going to change the way I shave fore sure. Absolutely zero drag. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Fusion proglide razor and found it to be a great improvement over the previous Fusion series.  The flexball handle really helps contour my face, especially as you go around the neck-- an area I always end up cutting myself.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This razor worked great, I received it in the mail from Gillette in a timely manner, I normally get really bad razor burn or end up cutting myself but not with this.. I defiantly recommend this to someone with corse hair or sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I combined this brush with a Badger hair shaving brush.  The combo has given me the best shaving experience in my life.</li>
    <li> This really isn&#x27;t much different than the other blades. it deserves 4 stars because it&#x27;s a premium product. But I noticed no difference in shave quality or closeness using this vs. past technology. I&#x27;d say stick with the Mach 5 or 3 and the regular blades.</li>
    <li> Overview: This razor is okay. The flex ball and the blades are nice, but the vibration is pointless in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I was given this product by the brand to test it out and review it, I did not purchase it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this razor I was using some other Gillette disposable razor (2 blades) from a large multi-pack. I would reuse this razor for a month or two or three before switching (I am an Asian male, so at most I shave once every other day). So when I tried out this razor, I was pleasently surprised at how smooth it glided. It still required multiple strokes in the same area to get a complete shave, so I can&#x27;t really say it does a better job at a clean shave that my disposable 2 blade. However, it was definitely more comfortable. The flex ball really does help the blades follow the contour of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this razor perfect though. Maybe because I&#x27;m used to my 2 blade razor, but the 5 blades is a little thick for me, and thus made it hard to manipulate on my face. Also I found the &amp;#34;micropulses&amp;#34; to be absolutely useless. All it did for me was made my hand numb and caused me to cut myself. I don&#x27;t see the logic behind it; the only thing I can think of is to imitate using an electric razor, but there&#x27;s no functional need for that. I just don&#x27;t use that feature anymore. I will say that the battery adds a nice heft to the handle if that&#x27;s any consolation. The indicator/lubrication strip seems to be white already only after 3 uses; as previously mentioned my razors usually last much longer than that. It&#x27;s possible that maybe I just got a bad strip?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the packaging was also very eco and frustration friendly, it lacked a lot of information. For example, where is the battery, and how do you replace it? (in the bottom, and you twist to get it out) Is it waterproof? (seems to be so far) When/Why use the vibrations? (this is answered on the product page here, but not in or on the package) How to change the blades? These are fundamental questions that should be answered and the product features should be advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad razor. I&#x27;m glad I got to try it out but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again-- maybe I would get replacement blades if they are cheap enough.How to change the blades?

    <li> I just started using the new razor and it is a good razor with awesome technology. Everything about it is similar to the prior Fusion Proglide and the Flexball improves the technology to the next level of razors. I would highly recommend it and the razor will even fit your old fusion blades if you have extras. It provides a clean shave. Even with the high cost of this razor it&#x27;s hard to use lesser razor&#x27;s as the shave is not close enough.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. The 5 blades definitely does it&#x27;s job and leaves a smooth finish. I was a Gillette mach3 guy for several years- in comparison to that, this razor does a phenom job.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the pivoting action of the fusion blade- I think it gets around the tough spots very well . As far as the vibrating action, it takes a bit to get used to- I seriously doubt if the vibrating action makes any difference or not- I get similar results with this turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is a good improvement over the previous generation Mach 3 and was worth the money spent (and a lot more to be spent in future  on the cartridges)</li>
    <li> Nice piece of hardware. Thank you Gillette for coming out with something that cuts to the contour of my face!!!</li>
    <li> Before I start I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that this was a free review unit provided by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since my first shave with a Mach 3 and have been using them ever since. I&#x27;ll put my hands up and say that it is in no shape or form the better than a safety razor - for the closeness and precision it can&#x27;t be - but for ease of use? for the quickness? I&#x27;ll have to give it to Gillette when I need to clean my face to look office fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a strange one this. I&#x27;m hooked on the 5 blades (does it really matter though?) and the power friction (that&#x27;s more a perceived benefit, I know) but the Flexball? For me, personally, it made no difference - whatever i tried, I could in no ease of use get it pivot side-to-side unless I was planning to purposefully cut myself. I loved the weightier feel over the none Flexball one as it gave me just a little more extra weight requiring less pressure from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the razor now for the past three weeks. Has it been life altering? No, has it made shaving any easier? No chance. Does it do what a razor should and safely? Definitely yes.</li>
    <li> My wife likes my close shave with the new Gilette Fusion Razor.  Therefore, I like it.</li>
    <li> Its a great razor, I received this razor as part of a promotion to try it out and evaluate it. It works great and is a very comfortable and close shave. Best I have used in a long time.</li>
    <li> This razor produced a really great shave- I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to unpackage and use right out of the box. Batteries were included and already in the razor. The five blades gave a really clean shave, even when I used only water with no shaving cream on two days of growth. The razor head has a cool contour/swivel that made it glide over curves easily while staying close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish the back of the base had a suction cup to firmly attach it to the shower. Also, the smooth bar/strip seems to be cracking a bit after about a week of wear, but doesn&#x27;t appear to affect the quality of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I got the Gillette Fusion for free from Gillette to review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moM58NZ9YSRYT5]]Amazing experience. I own the previous version and to me this is a noticeable improvement in quality and smoothness of shaving.</li>
    <li> I felt initially that this was probably a gimmick, but I no longer feel that way after using it for a week.  It isn&#x27;t the miracle that the commercials claim, but I think it probably does do a little better job than the regular version.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball is an excellent razor. I have tried many razors and this one fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been blessed by having a full beard, it grows in patches on my face so I need to shave often so it does not look like I have dirt growing on my face. I have one spot under my chin and neck area that the stubble will not remove no matter what direction I use the razor, but after a free trial of the Gillette ProGlide, the FlexBall on the razor really helps to get the hair off in this area that no other razor has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this razor is it gives a nice close and quick shave with fewer strokes, and the blades seems to last a while too.&lt;br /&gt;It also works great for manscaping.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need this new razor if you already have the ProGlide power.  The FlexBall adds nothing.  It does not rotate like a ball only from side to side.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and could not detect any difference.  I&#x27;m a forever user of Gillette razors and they make the best but this one doesn&#x27;t add a thing in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Let me start with this. I hate shaving.  I hate it so much that I&#x27;ve basically just stopped altogether with the exception of a pair of beard trimmers.  However, every once in awhile I have an occasion I need to get cleaned up for, so I&#x27;ll shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette and was eager to try it.  After having previously used one of their Mach razors before, I was familiar with the product line.  Let me just say I was blown away.  It felt like I was shaving with the ease of an electric razor, except the closeness of a non-electric razor.  I&#x27;ve only used the product twice, so it still remains to be seen how well the blade keeps up, and how long the battery lasts, but in terms of the quality, it is the best and easiest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Previous to this I was using the Gillette Fusion Proglide, the previous model of this same razor.  I was happy to find out that there is a big difference with this razor.  The vibrating razor and the flex ball handle provide for a much closer shave and much more comfort.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> was quite excited to try out this new razor with the FlexBall and also battery-powered. I tried to look up online for more information behind what the battery-powered razor would do that was so much different and could not find much. There was also little mention in the information that came with the razor so that was a little curious. I certainly don&#x27;t claim to be an expert or stay up on new razors in the market but seem moderately aware and this was fairly new for me. I have used a Gillette razor and blades prior to this and had liked it fine so expected an upgrade in this new razor. What I found instead was that I only liked it slightly more in use and most of the traits that were touted seemed more like novelties than helpful. These were not the kind of items that really set it apart or improved the shave, but rather actually made it a little more frustrating because it meant a heavier and bulkier razor. Additionally, one thing I noticed is that it was harder to shave on the corners of my mouth than it normally was. Overall, this is still a fine razor but all in all, I think I&#x27;d still prefer my more basic Gillette with the same blades.</li>
    <li> I like the easy glide flexball. It makes shaving over the face easier. Gives a clean and close shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best disposable razors I have ever tried.  The best feature is the flex ball handle.  It makes the hard to reach places where I usually get nicked and thing of the past.  It just glides around my face and chin perfectly.  No more walking out of the house with a tiny piece of tissue attached to my face.  The only critic I can say is that the vibrating handle didn&#x27;t add anything to my shave.  I shaved one side non-vibrating and the other vibrating and there was no difference.  It was a very nice, smooth and very close shave without any nicks.  I will definitely be buying this product again and telling all of my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: The company has sent me a free sample to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy with a very thick beard that grows faster than weed on my lawn. I used to use the 3 blade Gillette razors years ago. Since then I have moved onto straight razors, a badger brush and italian shaving soap and I am generally a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Gillette razor and unpacked it, I realized how much it has changed since I have stopped using it. The handle has a nice, solid weight to it with a good grip. I also noticed the new power button with the indicator light. It&#x27;s a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the most important part; how close this razor shaves. After a couple of shaves, it became clear that not turning on the \\&quot;vibration\\&quot; actually provides a closer shave. I like the \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; head and it provides marginally better shaving experience compared to a regular razor with a limited movement spectrum. If you shave against the grain, this horizontal movement will prove to be much more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like this new blade. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price of replacement blades. If it were 30% cheaper, this product would be an easy 5 start.</li>
    <li> I received this to try from Gillette.  I usually use a Schick Quattro, but I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I had no idea why a cartridge razor would need a battery.  It has a good look and a decent weight to it - great balance. It&#x27;s definitely a step up from my Quattro.  It glides so smoothly I had to feel to make sure it was actually getting close enough to my skin.  It gives a great, close shave.  I&#x27;m definitely making my switch.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide works as advertised. The shave is very smooth and it only takes me one or two passes.</li>
    <li> Not all it is made up to be. Only different is more money</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette, I received a free razor to try out. It&#x27;s a much better improvement to my old razor! It glides smoothly and goes around curves and edges without a problem. Definitely see an improvement in my skin overall.</li>
    <li> I finally got my hands on the Fusion Proglide and I am very happy with it, I have sensitive skin so I shave every other day and try to keep the passes to a minimum so I won&#x27;t be scratching my face all morning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for the past week and usually get the best results in my first pass and had zero problems with irritation, would defenetly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I received one of these razors for review from Gillette. My first impression when opening the packaging was that it was easy to open, much easier than one of those plastic clamshells. However, half of the container is cardstock and the other half is plastic. I was confused if I was supposed to be able to recycle each of these separately. The second reaction that I had was that I was disappointed there was only one cartridge included. If I had purchased this myself, I would be upset to have to buy refills right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette razors for many years. As with my previous experiences, the first use of a new razor is fantastic. It takes 1 swipe to do what I had been doing with 5 swipes with an old, dull razor. Unfortunately, After a week with the razor, I can tell that the performance is declining as was the case with my previous Gillette experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chief complaint about this razor is that the shaved hair gets clogged between the blades and is hard to rinse out. I have previously had the same experience with Fusion Proglide razors without the Flexball handles. Unfortunately, this one is no different. This is the main reason why I switched back to the Mach 3 razor and have stuck with that for many years. The blades are just easier to rinse, since they are spread out more. It may be my imagination, but I think I get a longer life from the Mach 3 than from the Fusion blades, probably because I can keep them cleaner, causing less oxidation on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the extra blade on the back side of the razor. That is something you don&#x27;t get with the Mach 3. It is handy for trimming sideburns, underneath the nose and the corners of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also nice that the cartridges are interchangeable with other Fusion handles. This could be handy if you are traveling or don&#x27;t want to use the Flexball feature for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the Flexball feature itself. For all that it is promoted to be and the great marketing that Gillette has done, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with Flexball. It&#x27;s ok, but I just don&#x27;t notice that it does anything special for me that simply angling my wrist slightly wouldn&#x27;t do. Sorry, I&#x27;m not in love with this razor. It&#x27;s just ok. Make a Flexball that is compatible with Mach 3 cartridges and I might be a customer.the great marketing that Gillette has done, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with Flexball.

    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion free from Gillette. I&#x27;ve  been a Proglide user for over a year and i could say that this is an upgrade by certain cases. I&#x27;m in the military and of course i&#x27;m not going to feel the full effect because of me having to constantly shave not giving my face time to grow more hair than it needs. My face is sort on the baby face side of things at the age of 29 so far as contours in the face mine are minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the flexball technology could come in use with more detailed faces but as for me it&#x27;s just like a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Update on 8/22/2014&lt;br /&gt;As I noted in my first review, quality versus value is a key factor for me.  With shaving 4-5 times a week, I finally had my first knick 3 weeks in.  Three weeks on a blade is very good, and makes up for the fairly high cartridge cost, around $3 a piece.[[ASIN:B004B8F8MM Gillette Fusion Power Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills 8 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;I have used many razors in the past 25 years, with varied degrees of success.  I look several things in a new razor, but typically will judge based on value and performance.  In the value category, this razor is in line with similar product cartridge costs.  The real test is in performance.  With the first use I noticed 2 things: not a single nick, and a very close shave.  This was quite a change for me; I usually have a nick or two, every time I shave, no matter how careful I am.  The bonus, so far, is that the blade has maintained this level of performance for a week&#x27;s worth of shaving.  The powered handle does take a little getting used to, but there is a noticeable difference in razor drag when it is not turned on.  Give this razor a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the results.  Thank you Gillette, for the free trial-- you have earned a customer!</li>
    <li> Very close shave, face and head.  I suggest shaving slower.  No nicks that way.  GREAT RAZOR.  WORKS JUST LIKE GILLETTE SAYS.  I just threw out my Schick</li>
    <li> This is the greatest razor I&#x27;ve used. The razor did all the work just like the commercial, I didn&#x27;t have to do a thing, no more making strange faces while shaving....lol</li>
    <li> This new version with the flexball is a noticeable improvement over the previous version without it. I was skeptical that it would be better, but it is. I gave my son one and he really likes it as well. It is definitely worth buying the new version.</li>
    <li> I like this new razor.  I have tried a half dozen others and this one is setting the standard for the industry.  I do not think it is possible to get razor burn with this product.  I am going to gather my other razors and begin my own museum of ancient shaving devices.</li>
    <li> Love the razor. Seems to work better than older style. Pleased.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a campaign on BZZ Agent, on first use the razor nicked me at my jaw line, so wasn&#x60;t too happy about that.  On the  second use,  I didn&#x27;t get cut and it did a good job on my problem areas.  By the third use the blade started to dull which is typical of the fusion blades I have found. Overall I don&#x27;t think the powerball made that much of a difference when compared to the fusion proglide power razor.</li>
    <li> Just tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor.  One word, Outstanding!  I have tried many different razors over the years and this is by far the best ever.  It provides a close smooth shave.  The five blades and the vibrating head prevent chaffing, razor burn and skin irritation.  I normally get two to three shaves from a blade.  I got six from the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this razor about a week ago from the company. it&#x27;s a fine razor. It had done its job a little better than the throwaways I had been using. The only thing i didnt like though was in certain areas of the face I had to make it stop vibrating for fear of slitting my throat. but all in all I would recommend it</li>
    <li> My husband used this razor for shaving his face and head. Although it didn&#x27;t do what he wanted on his head, he did like the shave he got on his face. He liked the way it pivoted and moved.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Been a loyal Gillette user for almost 30 years.  This by far is my favorite.  Love the way the blade bends and turns to contour.  Best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
    <li> I received the razor from Gillette and have been very satisfied with it.  I am a firefighter so having a close shave is very important, especially around the jaw line.  The ProGlide ball helps to get a close shave on the jaw line and the other tough areas.  The only con I have is the vibrating part really isn&#x27;t necessary, its actually kind of weird.  I would really recommend this to anyone out there who needs a good razor.</li>
    <li> Love my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor that  I got to try to from BzzAgent. The new flexball handle technology helps me get a nice shave on my face, around my jaw and neck without nicking myself in the process. Very easy to use and works great for a nice and clean shaved face. This is my go to razor now!</li>
    <li> I have to say that the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power I received from Gillette works great. I have a beard and don&#x27;t shave to often, so my facial skin is sensitive. I got a chance to use it a couple times the past month. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power did a great job on my face and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The smooth cut of the 5 blades took care of my over grown stubble/hair with no problems at all. The feature of the flexball seems like it would be of great use and improvement of the the razor. Unfortunately with the beard I don&#x27;t get to the curves on my face. The Power feature I don&#x27;t care about one way or the other. I can&#x27;t say that the power feature adds to the shaving experience. Overall, I don&#x27;t know if I would seek out and buy one of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razors, but I will definitely pick up the replacement blades now that I have one. And I would also recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few weeks since I&#x27;ve gotten it. It really gets the job done. The thin blades get me a close shave every time. The flex ball technology makes shaving even more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great blade but the swivel handle didn&#x27;t offer much benefit for me over the standard Fusion series. I&#x27;ll likely keep this one as a back-up; it&#x27;s awesome that the blades are interchangable with the standard one so that you don&#x27;t have to shell out even more cash for Gillette&#x27;s gimmicks.</li>
    <li> Just started using this over the last week and it is so smooth that it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving. I really like the swivel action, which is good for guys like me who shave their heads. It has this battery powered vibrating action that you can activate by pushing a button. I don&#x27;t feel like that really did anything for me. I found that without it, I still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> Very good razor and the blades last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user for as long as I can remember, so when I found this product on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to give it a try. It is battery operated, and the single triple A battery is included. There is a nifty light indicator on the handle that will light up when the battery is nearing the end of its useful life. As for the 5 blade set-up and flexball technology, I found the entire shaving experiencing to be extremely user friendly. The flexball technology does a great job of allowing the blade to move around the specific contours of my face, and the result was an extremely close shave that was done in a matter of minutes. The price tag for this razor is a bit on the high side, but you&#x27;re paying for quality here. This razor gives you a close shave that electric shavers simply can&#x27;t offer, and the flexball technology is an added touch that puts this razor over the top while justifying the higher price tag. If you can afford it, this is a great buy. I will be a repeat customer going forward as I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my other Gillette razors that don&#x27;t have the flexball.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor. Really close shave.</li>
    <li> I am always looking to try out new razors since shaving is a hassle. I received this through bzzagent and was excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The handle seems to be a bit smaller/thinner. Not a huge deal but take takes a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is a tad bit better but I would have to say the biggest thing is it&#x27;s an easier shave. It glides on the curves much easier then&lt;br /&gt;a normal razor. Seems to be holding up ok since I have had it for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I overall would reccomend this razor. It seems that the price point is in line with most other razors.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power With Flexball Technology for free from Gillette to use and then review. I love the Flexball and the way it glides across my face.  The vibrations from the power I&#x27;m not sure really do anything.  The handle is a little awkward especially when the Power is on.  Overall the razor is great but the power I could do without.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. i would not say its the best out there. I have the regular one (without flex ball) as well and both are perfectly fine. This one has some advantage with the power button and i like that. I had an issue with this order. The power in the first one did not work. Amazon sent me a replacement asap and let me keep the old one. This is very good customer service. Fast shipping and hassle free packaging like always.</li>
    <li> the best of the best!</li>
    <li> Such a smooth gliding razor, especially for sensitive skin. Would recommend to everybody!</li>
    <li> I felt that the razor gave me a smooth shave on the parts of my face that i shave. I have a groomed beard down the side of my cheeks and under my jawline, I felt the swivel head was a little hard to control to get the nice straight line i like so i ended up going back to the regular razor after i used the Fusion Proglide to even up the line. My wife was very happy with it, she used it on her legs and loved the results. I felt her legs and felt nice and smooth. All and all for a nice clean shave it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from the company in the mail as a promotion.  It has been amazing.  I love that the head of the razor heats up, it seems to help it cut easier and doesn&#x27;t give me any razor burn like other razors do that are very expensive.  The vibration probably helps too, I&#x27;ve had other razors that vibrate, but the heating up is nice.  I&#x27;ll keep using this razor and buy more blades for it when I need them.</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have used the Sensor Excel razor for years, but having sensitive skin, I was on the lookout for something that gave a more comfortable shave, so I gave the Fusion Proglide a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: I didn&#x27;t really experience a much closer shave with the Fusion than I did with the Excel; maybe this is because I have a kind of wiry beard. Five blades don&#x27;t seem to have an advantage over three, and the Proglide blades last about as long as the Excel, which for me is about 5 or 6 shaves. The rolling head on the Fusion does help minimally, in that I don&#x27;t have to go over the tricky surfaces as much, but if you&#x27;re looking for a 1-stroke-clean-as-a-baby&#x27;s-you-know-what, you will not find it here. So the Proglide blades do the job, but I would give it 3 stars for the performance category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: This is where the Fusion shines. The Proglide blades do not irritate my skin nearly as much as the Excel, and I no longer feel like my face is sunburned after shaving. Granted, the Proglide blades are quite a bit more expensive than Excel, but to me, the comfort factor makes it worth the extra cost. I would rate this razor 5 stars for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features: I have used the Fusion both with and without the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; feature, and quite frankly, do not see any difference in performance or comfort. I think this feature is more of a marketing gimmick than anything else, so do not buy this razor solely because you think a vibrating blade will give you a better shave. In my experience, it will not. One feature I do like though, is the small trimmer blade on the end of the regular blade. This is very effective in getting to the whiskers that grow directly under my nose, and it also does a decent job of trimming and evening up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if skin irritation is not a factor for you, you may do just as well with a less expensive shaving system. If you do have a problem with razor burn though, I suggest trying the Fusion Proglide and decide for yourself if the extra blade cost justifies a more comfortable shave.and decide for yourself if the extra blade cost justifies a more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor.  I just bought one for myself over the weekend.  It is easy to use and the slight vibration makes the hair easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Have tried a few different razors over the past few months and this is my far the best.  Leaves the face smooth.  My search for a new razor is over!</li>
    <li> Great razor! Love the way it smoothly glides and the movement over the curves of your face is perfect</li>
    <li> I received this Razor from Gillette to review and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed! Perfect Size and The blades are amazing - smooth shave every time. I don&#x27;t know why, but the vibrating technology seems to help tremendously. The flexball handle makes it so that you don&#x27;t miss anything and have smooth clean lines. Love this razor!</li>
    <li> Hubby says it&#x27;s fine but isn&#x27;t wowed by the ball.  He feels he gets a better shave with his fusion without the ball, really likes the vibration, says that improves his shave but doesn&#x27;t think the ball added anything.  Son likes his, but has only recently started shaving so doesn&#x27;t really have experience of anything else plus he still has quite fine facial hair.</li>
    <li> Just switched back from my $300+ panasonic electric and very pleasedwith this product. Shave is now quicker and closer</li>
    <li> Decent razor on the surface, but after using this new pro glide version for awhile I&#x27;ve noticed that it isn&#x27;t such a great razor. When the Fusion was introduced, they made a point of suggesting that you can get A LOT of shaves from a single blade cartridge. Well, those ads went away quickly (probably because someone higher up said \\&quot;We need to get them to buy MORE often!\\&quot;) Last year you could get a dozen plus uses out of a single cartridge before the comfort strip started fading.. Now you&#x27;re lucky to get three shaves before it starts feeling uncomfortable. The pulse also helps wear it down much sooner. This razor is a money pit in the long run, and with or without the pulse feature, I still have to finish up with my electric razor - just like before. I&#x27;m better off buying the 3 blade disposables for $5; at least you get more shaves out of one single razor at only 1/3 the cost.. I bought the regular pro glide last year and now this so called upgrade..and it&#x27;s just overpriced junk..</li>
    <li> Well this was my first time shaving and I could have pick a better razor I though well they all look the same there all the same just some looks better than others but I was wrong this one Is different I&#x27;m sticking to this razor it was easy I could reach bottom of my chin with out looking all the way up and It was great I&#x27;m glad I choose this razor to shave for the first time I really recommend this brand and razor you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I received this just last week and thought that it would be just another razor. I was wrong. this razor more than meets with all that it says it will do. I have a better shave now with this and thanks to the flex ball it lasts all day. This is a GREAT razor and I recommend every one gets one of these to experience the difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t confuse with motored onen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the non-flexball version of this razor and it worked great! I upgraded to the flex ball and was surprised it got better!  This razor hugs the curves of my faces nd gets the hard to shave places better than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
    <li> Provided a pretty close shave the first few shaves but the blades started to dull faster than I expected they would.  Overall it provides a really smooth shaving experience and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Best and smoothest shave ever.Cheapest price anywhere.</li>
    <li> I may actually prefer a razor without the flex ball. It was a bit of an uneven shave in some parts, and I had to look in the mirror pretty closely to catch the parts it wiffed on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype . My hopes were very high . The roller ball isn&#x27;t smooth . It rotates on its own and it actually cut me. It more of a toy then a useful product.  This razor gives me razor burn and crazy stubble .</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that I was skeptical.  I received a free Fusion Proglide sample from Gillette, and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have had bad experiences with 4 or 5 bladed razors (they always seemed to tear up my skin), and I have been a pretty steady Mach3 fan since college.  Be that as it may, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It looked pretty nifty from the package, but I didn&#x27;t get to testing it out for a while - which means I had a good week&#x27;s worth of beard to tame when I finally put razor to shaving cream.  Wow.  I was surprised - my face felt smooth and there was no irritation whatsoever.  Also, no ingrown hairs or stubble, which had been a recurring problem with both the Mach3 and other razors.  I had it figured that it was just the cost of doing business - guess not!&lt;br /&gt;Seven shaves later (and in some cases, with several days in between), the shave is still smooth and painless, the results just as smooth and clean.  I didn&#x27;t believe I would ever trade in my old razor, but the Proglide proved me wrong.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor I have ever used.  I love the way it glides effortlessly over my face.  It is easy to maneuver around my jaw line and down my neck.  It is pivoting head is unique and easy to use.  It makes shaving a breeze.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be changing razors any time soon!  Thanks Gillette for letting me test drive one of these.  It was awesome!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the results of the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor. It leaves my skin smooth, especially in the areas that are uneven. The razor left me clean shaven under my chin also, which I usually don&#x27;t get good results under. I&#x27;ve been using the same razor for over a week and it still works just as well as when I first got it. The only drawback is that it takes a little more time to rinse the shaver to get it clean after I shave,</li>
    <li> As an individual in a career field that requires me to shave every single morning, I consider myself an expert on cheap, disposable razors. When I received this razor from Gillette, I was pretty excited to try it out, in hopes that I would find a razor that did not turn my face into a bloody pulp every morning. While I can safely say that this is a step up from previous fusion razors, i do feel like it is more of a minute step forward, as opposed to a real revolution in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does a decent job of matching the contours of the face, and the 5 blade heads are relatively smooth across your face. Gillette definitely has a leg up on the other brands here. With that being said, I give it 4 stars because while&lt;br /&gt;It does offer a good, close shave, I do not think its worth upgrading to just for the sake of its gimmicky marketing. It won&#x27;t change your life, but it would definitely be worth upgrading when your current fusion finally bites the dust.</li>
    <li> My husband received this item for free from Gillette to try the product and share his opinions. He does not have an Amazon account so he is writing the rest of this review. It is his 100% his honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 and said it is excellent for older men as it has multiple functions that they can utilize. Younger men could use it too, but he said that you have to be very careful with it so parents of teenagers who want to use it should really consider their maturity and how responsible they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like making changes to my facial hair and sometimes am clean shaven, some times have a beard too. Right now however I just have a mustache and the rest of my face is clean shaven. I have been using various versions of Gillette shavers my whole life and what I typically use is a Mach3Turbo blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the single blade on back that I can can use to fine tune my side burns or mustache. Then on the front there are 5 blades and a comb like strip below them. The blades work well cutting the hairs close to the skin leaving it feeling smooth. I can&#x27;t really say how the comb is working. There is also a power button that you can turn on that makes the whole thing vibrate. It is an interesting concept, but it is battery operated. I would like to see one to see one made with a rechargeable battery. I would also like to know more information on how waterproof this is. I like to shave in the shower and I worry about using this this product around so much water. I do realize the blade needs rinsed while shaving, but that is slightly different than being in the shower with it. I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the packaging or website talking about it&#x27;s waterproof or resistant properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like this better than my old Mach3 Turbo and will use this one until the blade wears out for sure. I will look into buying new blades and using the handle until it no longer functions, however when I saw the product in stores it was expensive. I see here on Amazon it is a few dollars cheaper and is eligible for PRIME which my wife is a member of so it can be shipped free. However I have the handle for now so I just need to buy the blades. They are a bit more expensive than the old blades I used, but I think the difference in shave makes it worth it. I will be using this from now on.see here on Amazon it is a few dollars cheaper and is eligible for PRIME which my wife is a member of so it can be shipped free.

    <li> As soon as I began using this Razor, I noticed that it preformed flawlessly. The pivotal head and flexible design provide excellent shaving comfort, and the smoothest shave possible. I was definitely pleased with the way it contours to the shape of my face. The blades are perfect! I have never tried a better razor!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Proglide Flexball handle. Shaving with this one is much smoother, and faster too. Well worth it&#x27;s money!</li>
    <li> Thought the ball thing was just a gimmick, but since my old Fusion was looking pretty worse for the wear I ordered this one.  I was surprised to see that the ball does make a difference.  To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about a night and day difference, but it makes enough of a difference that I would recommend buying this handle even if your old one isn&#x27;t in need of being replaced.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I don&#x27;t like the razors they have out there for women. Tried so many different kinds. My husband use this brand and I tried it.  Love it.  Works perfectly and shaved nicely</li>
    <li> It works well point blank</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette razor. they cut my  facial hair close to my skin, but the replacement blades are expensive</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome. The flexball technology really makes a difference. It conformed to all the curves and angles on my face. The shave was great. I didnt have any razor burn which I thought I might since it has five blades. All in all it&#x27;s a great razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion Gillette razors are far superior to other disposable and replaceable-blade razors, but is the ProGlide Power any better?  I say Yes.  It&#x27;s quicker and easier to manoeuvre around my face and the blade itself is an improvement on the older models, so overall it delivers a better shave in a shorter time.  What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from Gillette to try out, and have loved it.  I thought it was a bit gimmicky at first, because we have seen the blade before, and we&#x27;ve seen the Power before, so what&#x27;s new?  Honestly, not too much, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  The blade connecting system is the same - something that always bugs me is when a new model, with different connection, forces you to upgrade.  I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors with Power before, and found that they help reduce the number of times you have to shave an area, and therefore help reduce irritation.  This is something I&#x27;m glad they stuck with.  And the blades?  Well they&#x27;re great too.  My only gripe with them is that they never seem to last long enough.  This could be because I have a tendency to let my stubble grow out fairly often, and then shave back.  Someone advised me to clean and oil the blade after each use, and although this sounds tedious, it takes 30 seconds, and I&#x27;ve found it significantly increases the life of the blades.  So finally the Flexball.  I think it just adds to the overall experience.  Nothing revolutionary, but it does help.  I&#x27;ve found it helps get a better shave first time around the chin, which normally takes a few passes at a few different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best shave, go with the best razor.  and this is it.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from the brand.  At first I was quite skeptical.  I already was using a Gillette Fusion, how much better could this Flexball really be.  Honestly it was the best dang razor that I have ever used.  By a lot.  The difference between using the power and not is subtle but noticeable, however the difference between the Fusion and the one with the Flexball is markedly improved.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of the claims made by this razor buy the packaging and product description. The glide ball and vibrating handle just seemed too gimmicky to actually do anything useful, but I was tired enough of my Mach 3 that I decided to take a leap of faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I surprised at how well this razor performed. It hugs my face very well, avoiding the nicks that my bumpy skin usually causes. The vibration seems to help &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; it&#x27;s way through my stubble as long as I take my time shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;edger&amp;#34; blade is something that I haven&#x27;t figured out yet. Am I supposed to hold the razor perpendicular or parallel to the ground when getting the hard to reach areas? Beyond my confusion with that part, I must say that I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what to do with all of those unused Mach 3 cartridges?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hugs your face&lt;br /&gt;vibrating handle assists with stubble&lt;br /&gt;sturdy constructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I need to read the instructions&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges are pricey</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always review razors. But, when I do, it actually performs better than my expectations. I did feel a noticeable smoothness with the new Flexball but can&#x27;t say it shaves any more effectively. Still takes me the same amount of time and passes to get all the hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is something you should run out and get, but if your current Proglide is out of battery and you&#x27;re too lazy to buy a pack of AAAs, it&#x27;s probably better to just get one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is they look pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> I love it! The flexball handle allows the blade to move with my face and jawline. Give my face a quick once-over with and and I&#x27;m done! I&#x27;d say this saved me about 30% if the time it took with disposable 2 bladed razors. Would highly recommend based on experience and value of time saved!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Gillette to review. The first things I noticed after shaving was how it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. With other razors even electronic ones my skin is usually red for a little after shaving. With this razor I got a great shave and my skin felt and looked fine after. For anyone with sensitive skin I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide. It truly is the best razor I have tried for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt; The second thing I noticed with this razor was how close of a shave I could get. Typically I have to go over my face a second or third time to really get a decent shave. With the Gillette Proglide it is almost effortless to get a good close shave. The way the razor allows the blade to move and glide on your face and neck really helps it to get the best shave possible. The ability of the blade to move and contour to your face is such a small feature but makes a huge difference when you shave. Whoever came up with that idea has just saved so many from razorburn and at the same time made it faster and easier to get a close shave. Overall I would highly recommend this product for the closeness of the shave and for anyone with any degree of sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> What can you not love?! It works great and gives you the smoothest shave you can get. This is the only razor I&#x27;ll ever need now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Gillete Razor products and have been using since their old ones WITHOUT the power in them. This one, however, surprises me as it is even more comfortable than the last! I thought the last was amazing but this BLEW mew away! It took a long time for my package to arrive, but this razor gave me an unbelievably close shave that lasted for almost 2 days. Amazing!!! Even my girlfriend couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting how soft my face is. And even better news.... I was able to shave the top lip against the grain for the first time. THAT&#x27;S how comfortable it is. The razor uses its stabilizers to glide along your face even where it curves and the strip seems to make it even gentler on my very sensitive skin. I cannot stress enough how amazing the shave was for me. The micropulses really got in close and really, really gave me, a guy with sensitive skin that cuts easily, a GREAT close shave that didn&#x27;t even cut or burn anywhere. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology provided a smooth shave, but when I tried to trim up my sideburns where my hair is a little longer, it definitely yanked those hairs.  So, if you are just doing everyday shaving, this is your blade.  However, if you are trimming around longer hair, use something else.  I did find that it provided a VERY close shave with less passes.  I have sensitive skin and have had issues with razor burn. I had the same issue with the ProGlide. No worse/no better.</li>
    <li> Great design and the handle is well balanced for a confident grip! And for a &amp;#34;electric razor&amp;#34; very affordable! Would definitely recommend for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> Just got this razor and it is amazing!  Way better than the Mach 3 I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years.  With the combination of the new FlexBall, five razor blades and battery power, the Fusion is the best way to shave your face for the closeness and comfort you are looking for.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product by the distributor to sample for a period of time and WOW, does this thing really do its job!  My jawline is baby soft and the blades on these things are razor sharp. I actually really do appreciate the Flexball Handle Technology more than I even anticipated I would. It helps ease my shave into the deep contours of my face that every other razor seems to have found elusive thus far.  I am not sure if the power feature seems to do much of a giant difference for me though I do see a slight improvement in the ease along the more coarse hairs that I have but otherwise it doesn&#x27;t stand out to me as outstandingly beneficial.  I like the grip and the weight of the razor as well, it is surprisingly more weighted than I thought but still lightweight and flexible enough for me to have complete control with maximum grip, which is nice.  Overall, I really do have to genuinely give this product a 10/10 (or, rather, 5 out of 5). I would definitely go out and buy the product myself again once the razor dulls on this one (which, by the way, after about 10 days of relatively light use it really is showing no sign of).&lt;br /&gt;Great job, Gillette!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to put extra positive review on this item, the TV ads says everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to have it with the battery, a vibration helps shaving a bit.</li>
    <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! This product is THE BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever tried!! I simply cannot recommend it enough!! So super simple to use and works fantastic!!! I am sold!!! Try it...you will not be let down!!!</li>
    <li> ...they actually made it even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Gillette Fusion shaving products since, well, almost when they first came out.  Before that, I shaved with their Mach 3 blades for years.  So when Gillette sent me a Fusion Proglide Power Razor (the one with the Flexball), I have to say, yeah, it may just be a razor, but I was excited to try it.  I showered, and grabbed my Ursa Major Stellar Shave Cream (that&#x27;s both what it&#x27;s called, and how I&#x27;d describe it, but that&#x27;s a topic for a whole *other* reivew) as I do for every other blade shave (I am a creature of habit, after all), and got down to business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d used both the battery powered and non-battery powered versions of the Fusion, and to be quite honest, I&#x27;m not all that sure just what the battery power does, other than add some vibration to my shave. It is noticeably quieter than the last iteration of a battery-powered razor I used.  On one hand, perhaps it allows for a closer shave by the way it grabs hairs as it effortlessly passes over them.  Or, perhaps the vibration allows me to use a bit less pressure which makes for an even more comfortable shave.  Whichever it actually is (maybe a bit of both?), those personal care gurus in at the impressively titled &amp;#34;World Shaving Headquarters&amp;#34; in South Boston, Massachusetts have come up with yet another winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a very smooth, very comfortable, and close shave  While this was a fresh blade, I did notice that I didn&#x27;t need to make multiple passes over any area of my face (except for a small spot that *I* missed.  As i was shaving, the razor seemed to rinse clean easier than the Fusion I&#x27;ve been using - MUCH easier.  The ball did help the razor pivot naturally around the contours of my face. My skin wasn&#x27;t red, nicked, cut or irritated in any way,  For some reason, after I cleaned the razor before putting it away, upon looking at the five blades, I thought of the commercial on TV with the man who claims that he gets a better shave with one blade than he does with multiple blades.  Unless he&#x27;s a barber and using a barber&#x27;s razor, I highly doubt he gets as close a shave as I did with my Fusion Proglide Power with the Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette definitely knew what they were doing when they sent this to me for free - I&#x27;m already planning to purchase a supply of these blades, as they will be replacingtter shave with one blade than he does with multiple blades.  Unless he&#x27;s a barber and using a barber&#x27;s razor, I highly doubt he gets as close a shave as I did with my Fusion Proglide Power with the Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette definitely knew what they were doing when they sent this to me for free - I&#x27;m already planning to purchase a supply of these blades, as they will be replacing</li>
    <li> hello used this puppy&lt;br /&gt;well its not a puppy its an amazing razor id like to say its purrty sweet and well made probably the best razor ive used so far i am impressed that is all bzz agent out!!&lt;br /&gt;p.s recieved this free from gillette via bzz agent !!:)</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to try directly from Gillette to try. I love it! This razor is better for my face than the normal fusion. I normally have to shave in all directions to get all the stubble. With the head moving with my face I get so much less razor burn. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> Just buy it....don&#x27;t think twice!</li>
    <li> I decided to see what all the hype was about with Gillette&#x27;s new razor and I am very impressed. Great new razor with a very smooth cut. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I received this razor for Christmas yesterday and couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. It simply doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave. I had to go over the same spots on my neck/chin four or five times and even then it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I will continue to use the cheap disposable razors that are less expensive and much more effective.</li>
    <li> As somebody who is OCD about getting as close a shave as possible, the Gillette Fusion series has been my go-to for the past 8 or more years.  While you do pay a premium for the brand name, in my opinion it is worth it, because competitor blades do not compared in terms of the comfort and closeness of the shave.  This new swivel head is the natural evolution of their previous lineup, and it really does make for an improved shaving experience.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more for your blades, I would 100% recommend this product as well as Gillette shaving products in general.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave ever.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out and I love it.  I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, so my choice of razors has been very limited.  The lubricated strip on the blades make for a very pleasant shave and the vibrating handle makes me not even feel the shave.  I don&#x27;t get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow as the blades seem to cut very close.  My skin is soft afterwards and doesn&#x27;t break out.  The blades last for a long time.  With another brand, I changed out the blades every week.  I used a blade for about 3 weeks with this razor before I noticed any depreciation in shave quality.  I really like this easy to use razor that provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 15 years and I can remember the very first time how bad my neck was torn up with razor burn. Luckily, over the past 15 years things have gotten better with the 3,4 and then 5 blade versions but the razor burn was still there just not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;When I was asked to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology I figured it was just gonna be another razor but man was I wrong! They actually managed to develop something revolutionary. The Flexball Technology allows the razor to effectively pivot around your face instead of having to manuveur your face around the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The result is the fastest, most comfortable and irritation free shave of my life. I&#x27;m a Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology customer moving forward and you should definately try it for yourself and join the shaving revolution!</li>
    <li> I received my new Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m very impressed.  You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design as every part / feature of this razor has a useful purpose.  The handle has a battery which allows for vibration which lifts each hair before cutting to get a smooth clean shave with no razor burn.  The FlexBall provides tension which allows maximum contact and better contour shaving.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that if I go a few days without shaving, I don&#x27;t need to use my electric trimmer to pre-shave, this razor handles it all with no pulling or tugging.  Probably my favorite feature is the blade on the back of the cartridge which can be used for trimming / edging.  Overall this is a well designed razor which I would gladly recommend to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best one. I can move it all over my face with out the thought of getting cut. I love that it can get the hard places that the other razors couldn&#x27;t get..  plus my wife likes it too...</li>
    <li> First, let me say this... I have been an electric razor user for the past 10 years or so.  However, prior to that I did have my trusty Mach 3.  When I heard about the offer to try out the Fusion ProGlide for free via directly via Gillette, I thought why not.  I usually shave every two days and man, was it painful to trim that stubble.  The hair on my face does grow fast, so maybe that was part of the issue.  I also remembered how much my neck gets cut up from a manual razor.  Overall, the shave was really close and it took a bit longer for the hair to grow back... but my neck was irritated and it was painful to shave the longer stubble.  I&#x27;ll stick to my electric for now.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball handle the day after it arrived from Gillette.  I was excited to try something new in the razor category.  It did a nice job of a shave but it wasn&#x27;t anything extraordinary.  I was changing from a Fusion ProGlide Power, of which I am quite fond.  This new one just didn&#x27;t blow me away with closeness, comfort or anything else really.  It worked well just not better than the one I have.  However if you are stepping up from a lesser than a premium razor you will like this one for sure.  It is comfortable, close, and has a great trimming option for up under your nose or other tight spots.  Thank you Gillette, but I won&#x27;t be switching from my ProGlide Power.</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette to try, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The vibration really helps to get a close shave without razor burn.  My skin feels smooth and healthy and looks great.  At first I thought the vibration was just a gimmick, but it really does work.  Thanks for the product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fusion Proglide Power with Flexball razor since May when I received it from Gillette.  I have commented previously on how will it works compared to my electric razor.  I have been on vacation for the past few days and wanted to comment that with my electric razor I would shave everyday and sometimes in the evening again depending on my plans.  I have always used the Proglide daily out of habit except this week while on my cruise. My family had activities planned from earlier morning to late at night.  I forgot to shave one morning but by that evening my wife commented how soft my face was since I changed razors.  She could not believe that it was over 24 hours since I shaved because she is always particular about a clean shaven face.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> This was a gift. This razor wasn&#x27;t any better than other multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is using fresh blades &amp; perhaps a double blade head.&lt;br /&gt;Your wrist pivots just fine. At least mine does.&lt;br /&gt;The second cutting head included was either worn or defective as it hurt dragging it across my face. I actually just pulled the cutting head that I was replacing back out of the trash &amp; used it until I couldn&#x27;t take it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like an expensive gimmick to me. YMMV</li>
    <li> I loved it! It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair at all, makes my skin feel good!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so it rocks! I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> Excellent edge trim feature unlike any other! Super smooth shave almost like there&#x27;s not contact. I would recommend this razor to anyone male or female that wants the best shave of their life.</li>
    <li> Really have liked this razor.  The vibration feature actually makes a huge difference, when on I can shave with only water comfortably.  In general, the most flexible razor I have ever used, will certainly continue to use this for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only unfortunate thing is that the blades seem to get dull fairly quickly. Further, when the blade had become too dull to use, I decided to replace it.  When pressing the button located near the blade for removal, I felt something lock up, and when trying to insert the replacement blade, the locks refused to snap into place.  For such a durable razor otherwise, including water exposure and travel wear-and-tear, it was unfortunate to see it break from such a simple action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this razor has been phenomenal, and I will certainly be picking up another soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor as a promotion from Gillette to review but opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> It took a while to properly review the razor since it felt up front like there was not that much of a change and I only shave a couple of times a week.  I had been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for some time and will use that as the rating basis.  The difference that I can see are cosmetic, with the exception of the ball feature of course .  I was not impressed the first time I used it until I switched back to the ProGlide Power while on a business trip.  Then I realized the subtle but key difference in the shaving that helped make the saving process faster and feel just that much better with the new &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some how Gillette managed to make the shaving better on razors which I did not think was possible.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette and really love the pivoting feature.  It gets into places other razors typically do not!  My favorite new razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor  with FlexBall handle technology free from Gillette some weeks back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Fusion razor before, but not with the FlexBall handle. so when I had the chance to try one with the FlexBall handle, I was excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is awesome! I have never got a better shave with other razor. I always, shave in the shower, where I get the closest shave. Very smooth shave. nno burning sensation and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I could not see a difference between the Fusion and the Fusion ProGlide with the FlexBall, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors themselves are the best I can find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always interested in trying new Gillette products, especially the Fusion line because they always delivery a great shave. I was excited to receive a free sample of the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thought? Excellent shave as usual. You really couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shaving product. The Flexball Handle Technology is pretty great. You can feel the ball moving with the contours of your face. I could certainly seeing this product having staying power in the marketplace vs. some of the other alternatives Gillette has introduced like the Fusion with the power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Been using the regular manual pro glide for a few years and loved the great shave it provides. Decided to upgrade to Power and saw Gillette just released one with flex ball technology so decided to give it a try. After a few uses, I feel like the flex ball does help with contours a bit, but not necessarily a must have feature. The power feature is pretty impressive, really does give you a smoother shave without having to apply as much pressure as a manual. One negative though is it&#x27;s not at effective in shaping sideburns as the manual is, as a note I never use the single blade on the back of the cartridge. Still, I really like the power feature and am gonna stick with it for now. I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor if you don&#x27;t have a Gillette pro glide. If you have the previous model I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone to rush to get one.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Gillette to review. I have always liked Gillette razors and didn&#x27;t think there was any room left for improvement but they did it! The flexball technology is great.The way the razor allows the blade to move and glide on your face and neck really helps you to get the best shave possible. The ability of the blade to move and contour to your face is such a small feature but makes a huge difference when you shave. I find that I never get nicked while using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically I have to go over my face a second or third time to really get a decent shave. With the Gillette Proglide it is almost effortless to get a good close shave the first time. Overall I would highly recommend this product for the closeness of the shave and for anyone with any degree of sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I give this three stars because I like but I think the regular fusion is just as good. I have tried both through a  company that gives free trials. I don&#x27;t feel like the extra cost it worth it for a little better shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really wanted to like this razor and hoped that it would give me a new, thrilling shaving experience.  Having previously been a plain-jane Fusion user, I was a little underwhelmed.  Still a great shave, mind you, but the tilting motion was rather gimmicky at best.  If you haven&#x27;t tried the Fusion line of razors, go for it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s really not worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> I really like the Proglide line from Gillette. I use them everyday and since trying it have not found a better razor. I get a close shave, and never experience any irritation. With each razor you get a holder for the razor as well, which I appreciate. I only gave this 4 starts though because i feel it is the same as all the other Proglides. I did not experience any difference from this one to the regular manual one that I bought. Will definitely buy again and continue to use.</li>
    <li> Nice toy. Close shave, maybe too close because my razor bumps returned with a vengeance. This might work for you but I had to go back to my safety razor. Perhaps over time I could get used to it but I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait. As for how good it was, it gave a good close shave. The pivot helped a little but there seemed little difference from the regular fusion razor. I give it 3 stars for being cool. You may want to try it yourself though it is kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> Several years back, after experimenting with electric razors and standard blades alike, I settled back on the basic old handle w/ disposable blades.  For the past couple of years I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3, and been quite happy with it.  One of the reasons / main use cases is that I like to shave in the shower (with shower mirror) and get it all done then vs. hanging over my sink.  A few weeks back I had the chance to get my hands on a free/promo version of the Fusion Proglide and figured &#x27;what the heck&#x27; I&#x27;ll give it a go.  I must say I really like it.  I tend to shave every 1-2 days (often aligned to customer meetings :) and am finding that the FP works very well in my morning routine, holds its own in the shower, and actually enables me to get a nice clean, close shave with only going over my face once.  This is in contrast to the blade I&#x27;d been using, where I typically had to do one direction and then again reverse (against the grain) after to get it nice and smooth.  Overall, very pleased with this device and can see myself continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample and will not bother with refills.  It shaves fine, but no better than less expensive models.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Fusion proglide from Gillette, after using it 2 time, i absolutely love it. The flex ball is pretty amazing for the curves on my face. The handle is also very comfortable. After shaving my face feels smooth and not itchy like my previous razer. I also notice my shaves are very close. The best part is its very easy to clean, just put it under running water and all done.</li>
    <li> I WAS DOUBTFUL AT FIRST IF THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER MEN&#x27;S RAZOR WAS FOR ME OR NOT! AFTER JUST TWO SHAVES I WAS CONVINCED ! IT GAVE ME A VERY CLOSE SHAVE WITHOUT ANY CUTS OR SCRAPES.. I GET THAT CLEAN FEELING WHEN I&#x27;M DONE. IN THE MORNING. IT&#x27;S MADE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE POWER ON OR OFF.</li>
    <li> The flex ball works very well. Especially when you go around your jaw line. I give it four stars because the blade is the same as any average razor.</li>
    <li> This razor works great!!! It shares very close and follows the contours of your face. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely fantastic.  I&#x27;ve used a Fusion Proglide Power for a few years now.  This gizmo is ten times the razor, in my opinion.  If you like the Fusion Proglide razors, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this product from Gillette for free, and I have to say its probably one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used. not only do I get a clean shave, but without nicks due to the contouring ball. Definitely will buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this! For a razor I think it is one of the best ones yet. I have several so I was a little iffy on purchasing it but my wife brought it home so I hade to try it. It gives a close shave and does not rip up my face. The price is good and it is something that I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Works ad advertised on first shave.  The first shave is to me the best judge of the difference between this one and its predecessor.  My shave was easier, no nicks and the smoothness was as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion razors have always been my favorite so I was really excited to try out the Proglide with pivot (thanks Gilette for the test run!).&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely say that I was not disappointed. It worked as well and BETTER than the other Gilette fusion razors, the pivot provides a smooth clean shave with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative about this razor is that it needs a replacement too soon for my liking given the cost of each blade.  I will likely use this razor again in the future and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will start this review off by saying I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this razor on my own, I thought the power, and flexball feature were just another gimmick to get us to fork over more money. I was previously using the Gillette Fusion Proglide without the power or trackball and thought that was an incredible shave. Luckily someone bought me the razor for x-mas so I was able to try it out on someone else&#x27;s dime. Upon the first swipe of shaving my head I knew I was in for a comfortable shave, after I was done shaving my head and face I couldn&#x27;t believe how close of a shave I received, and as my title says I have a very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to point out any cons to this razor it would first be the prices of the blades, for someone who shaves their head and face I go through them quickly, although I did find out any of the Fusion Proglide blades are compatible, they are all expensive so no real break there. The second would be because the razor handle houses a battery it&#x27;s a little thicker then I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Great shaving blades at a price cheaper than stores</li>
    <li> I just bought the new Gillette Fusion Proglide FlexBall razor ... and I have a gripe.  All right, a nit.  The razor itself is just fine.  In fact, probably their best razor ever.  But -- the razor handle&#x27;s supplied carrier is too cheap and too small -- I have always stored my Gillette razor vertically in its case and I cannot with the silly little clear plastic device.  And the razor needs a good carry case when traveling -- not so good with the latest iteration.  I cannot use my previous Fusion Proglide (non-Flexball) carrier because the new razor&#x27;s handle is slightly longer and it doesn&#x27;t fit well.  50+ years a Gillette razor user and never had a problem like this before.</li>
    <li> How can a great product be improved?!?!?!? Get this and you will see!</li>
    <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve every used to shave with.  Unbelievably close shave and handles all the different directions my facial hair grows.  This is the Rolls Royce of multi blade razors hands down!</li>
    <li> While the razor is great, I didn&#x27;t see any added value of &amp;#34;Powering&amp;#34; it for it only vibrated and is a nuisance at best! In my opinion, is just a gimmick on Gillette&#x27;s part. By the manual one and stop wasting your money, like I feel I have.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to Gillette. Nothing else matches it, in my experience. I&#x27;ll keep trying to find something better.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and met my expectations</li>
    <li> I have all Gillette mens shavers. I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was a teenager ( I won&#x27;t say just how long ago that was) I wish they had such quality shavers back then. I get such a close shave with Gillette I&#x27;ll use nothing else. This new razor gets even closer due to the new design. And I received this quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I decided to get the Gillette Fusion Proglide Powerball razor and give it a try. I was glad I did! Upon removing it from the packaging the first thing that got my attention was the weight of the razor. It felt really solid and comfortable in the hand. The razor performs solid. It definitely glides around the face very well. The shave is a bit better than just the Fusion. Overall, very satisfied. Worth the upgrade.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to product and all I have to say is run out and get you one. Provides a smooth close shave and gives you the control to get even the most stubborn hairs. Do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
    <li> Gillette did a great job creating this razor. It gives a nice smooth shave and the addition of the battery makes for a close shave.</li>
    <li> One of the closest (Best) overall shaves that I have gotten.  The hairs under my chin grow in a dozen different directions, making it difficult to get all hairs shaved closely.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle did the best job of getting all hairs shaved close to the skin, of any Razor that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;With all of that being said, I don&#x27;t know that I would spend that much on a Razor every time.  I will have to see how long the Razor stays shaving sharp, and will then update my review.  All in all the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle is a very deluxe shaving instrument, and I would reccomend it to anyone-If you don&#x27;t mind the price.  I am still stuck in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s on the prices of products, just for reference</li>
    <li> Does not do any better shave than my Schick &amp; Schick blades are half the price than Gillette.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivered.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth, I like this razor. It is fun to use</li>
    <li> I like the comfort of the grip and the closeness of the shave without razor bumps!!!!  Thumbs up GILLETTE!!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is the best razor I have issue to date. It is amazing this wasn&#x27;t invented already! It definitely moves way more fluent then a traditional razor, which makes for a smoother shave! I recommend this razor for anyone that uses razors.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Upgraded&#x27; from my previous Gillette fusion power handle that also vibrated. I don&#x27;t this new ball in handle technology is any better.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the ball moves...thats if you apply enough pressure. My jaw is not shaped like a rotating bowling ball like in the commercial for this. If you are using pre-shave oil and shaving cream, that is all you need for these Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: It&#x27;s gimmicky not worth the &#x27;upgrade&#x27;</li>
    <li> I got one of these razors to try out from Gilette, I usually hate shaving - I seem to have way too many &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; on my face and neck, and end up with at least a little razor burn every time. After using this for a week, I have a clean shaven face with *no* razor burn. The pivot point on the razor made it SO much easier to navigate around, and the blades are (as expected from Gilette), nice and sharp, and have lasted for 5 shaves so far. The powered feature is pretty nice, too - feels like it&#x27;s giving a closer shave on the first pass than you would ordinarily get. All in all, a very nice change of pace for me!</li>
    <li> Just about the time I am about to go on a mission to find a new razor, I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor with the Flexball Technology from Gillette. Naturally my first thought is this yet another multi-blade razor, what else can it do? I was wrong, this new razor from Gillette has the Flexball Handle Technology and that elevated my shaving experience to a new high. Truly this is an impressive innovation and this razor does glide across your face, hugging every curve without any bumps or nicks. I was skeptical about what could this new razor possibly do at this point and I was pleasantly surprised at just how comfortable it made my daily shaving experience. Great improvement with the Flexball Handle Technology.</li>
    <li> Bought the Flexball version after my 1st gen Fusion proglide stopped working.  First thing I noticed was that the handle is heavier on the Flexball, so had to get used to the extra weight.  I&#x27;m not sure that the Flexball gives you a better shave, considering its the blades that give you the shave.  I dont think I would spend the extra money for the Flexball, but for some it may contour better to the face.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette. I waited a couple weeks before trying it to see how it could really perform. I have to say, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It was the smoothest and probably best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The flexball is a major improvement over previous designs, not a single hair was missed. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I definitely recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I received one of these from Gillette as a tester. And let me say it is awesome. I shaves really smooth, and I have a rough facial hair and sensitive skin. At first I thought really another shaver, that&#x27;s what the world needs another shaver. But then I saw the promotion to try one free. So I gave it at shot. First three shaves it worked like all new blades work great the first couple of shaves, then they go down hill from that. Well much to my surprise this shaver hasn&#x27;t done that been using the shaver for two weeks almost three. And still shaves as good now as it did the first time. Only down fall is the price. I checked out a couple of prices at my local shop and the replacements are crazy expensive. But Id would say if you wanted a real good shave it is worth it if your like me and try those other shavers that do it and then sputter out after four shaves.</li>
    <li> what can I say? this razorr is fantastic! not only do I shave my face but I&#x27;ll shave my head...the flexball technology works great. Follows every curve of my face and head. What a difference!  The 5 thin blades really make for a close tight shave...and with fewer strokes. The single blade on the back side makes cleaning up around my ears and under my nose a breeze. And the electric vibrating really seems to make the hairs stand up for a super close shave with no irritation. Gillete nailed it with this razor...awesome product!</li>
    <li> Great shave. I am a fan of Gillette but the flexball feature makes this a great choice to get the best shave possible.  The blades stayed sharp for quite a while and provided a close and comfortable shave.  I did not receive instructions with my razor but it was pretty self explanatory.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This is pretty smooth on skin and hence does not irritate my skin. Decongestant will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion was given to me for a free review! I was not disapponted. The best razor i have used would be an understatement.  It was smooth, quick, painless and with no nicks. By far one of the closest shaves i have ever experienced with the least amount of hassle.  It is affordable and definitely worth every penny.  If you are looking to try something new, you should definitely give this one a try. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Been using Gillette razors since 1994!</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty good, still trying to determine whether it is cost effective compared to the lesser expensive versions.  I will have to see how long the blade lasts for a comparison.</li>
    <li> I started using Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual about ten days ago, thanks to a massive testing project carried on by Procter&amp;Gamble. After around ten shaves I can firmly say that it&#x27;s the best manual razor I&#x27;ve ever used (still I&#x27;ve always used Gillette Manual razors). The most clear gain concerns the number of effective shaves without any performance breakedown with one single head.&lt;br /&gt;At the tenth shave there&#x27;s still no evidence of skin irritation and green smoothing bar fade. I guess I will be able to use it for five further shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The recharging heads are a bit expensive somehow I &#x27;m sure they are worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Not sure how exactly adding power affects shave compared to non-powered regular fusion proglide. The flexball seems to make it just a little bit easier to handle knowing it can turn a bit, but does not make dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> I never really understood power razors and when I opened the package I immediately questioned why this vibrated? But I tried it, and compared to my usual razors this have a very smooth and close shave, it never cut my face, and the trimming blade allowed me to get more detailed trims than I usually would be able to, replacement blades are costly however but outside of that, a great razor I would be happy to use again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this razor very much. It moves smoothly over my skin as I shave. I have to shave on a regular basis so having a sturdy razor is important. The thin blade on the back helped me trim my uni-brow. My skin is always smooth after shaving and cuts are rare. I would recommend this for men OR women looking for a good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Gillette products. I feel like they are the longest lasting blades as well as the most innovative designs. The Fusion didn&#x27;t disappoint either. I used it on long hair as well as short stubble and both lengths were close shaves. After receiving this razor I was sad that it only came with one blade in the pack, but because of the quality I am sure it will last for some time and plan on buying replacements once its done.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this product. However I was scepical if it would work or not. I recievied this as a free sample From Gillette.It was ALOT better then I though it was going to be.  The only thing I would change is for it to have more blades.</li>
    <li> I tried out the Gillete Fusion Proglide and was pleased with this product. I shave about every three days and have not changed the blade in the month I have had it. The Proglide has only one vibration setting compared to other similar products that have many settings. This product feels good in your hand and also has a bit of weight to it which I liked. The rotating ball does in fact play a nice role in the product. I have recommended this product to others and will continue to buy replacement blades when needed.</li>
    <li> The razor head rotates!!!!! So stoked to finally have a good razor, and it&#x27;s electric! :D</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Slight improvement over the last model, but worth the money. Especially for my ugly mug.</li>
    <li> Gillette made a huge mistake marketing heavily on the Mach 3 in the late 90&#x27;s over the competitors two blade technology. It has stuck ever since to a significant proportion of men (local and abroad) and in many respects, their children who grew up with influencers to the product whom to a great extent, refuse to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like ink jet printers, these shavers are being sold cheap in anticipation of recovering costs from the blade cartridges. The Fusion Proglide line manages to be even more expensive over previous generations which makes little justification for those who find no issues with their current 3/4/5 blade shaver. To stop producing previous generation blades would cause an uproar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent four and five blades meant that the shave head ended up to be &#x27;larger&#x27; and less &#x27;precise control&#x27; over the Mach 3.  The marketing worked briefly - more blades surely has got to be &#x27;better&#x27; but not all consumers are fools to give in which is why Mach 3 still exists after a decade, the Flexball seems like a last attempt to revive the market and in many respects is still largely a &#x27;gimmick&#x27; as many have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However where attributes do differ is the Proglide blades are definitely thinner over the Fusion ones and has improved the shaving experience with less resistance and comparable to the experience of using the Mach 3 for the first time. I struggled to find justification for the Flexball for several weeks as the wrist movements often cancel out the requirement for the blade to &#x27;flex&#x27; around the face - to the point I admitted to myself that it was just a marketing tactic and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then realised that this shaver is also suited for other &#x27;areas&#x27; of the body other than the face (whether Gillette will readily admit/endorse or otherwise). The Flexball definitely will assist in shaving more difficult and challenging to reach parts of the body and if you do like to keep things groomed (even down there) this will offer a slight improvement through better control due to the flexing blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this model is slightly larger than previous generation models so take this into account if you do travel; and if you are going to attempt to experiment with grooming areas other than your face, do use a different blade cartridge.etter control due to the flexing blade head.    Lastly, this model is slightly larger than previous generation models so take this into account if you do travel; and if you are going to attempt to experiment with grooming areas other than your face, do use a different blade cartridge.</li>
    <li> The best experience i&#x27;ve ever had shaving....no razor bumps....no cuts....It&#x27;s a MIRACLE</li>
    <li> Since growing a beard a little over a year ago, Ive made the switch from electric razors to manual.  I shave my neck and stray facial hairs daily to maintain a professional and clean look.  I really like the Proglide as it seems to get a clean shave on the first pass, and ultimately saves me a bit of time.  The razors are sharp, but did not cut me once.  This was a good shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, I found it difficult to meet the precision I needed where my beard meets my neck when cleaning up the beard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I wanted a fully clean shave, this is a great tool to get the job done and have smooth aftershave.  Nice design Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Gillette for letting me try it free.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! This has really helped my sensitive skin and a challenging shave routine that I have as I am always doing a quick shave.  I never have the time to really spend 30 minutes on a shave.  Sorry to the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34; fan club but I am a busy guy.  This is good for the guy who needs to shave everyday and first thing.</li>
    <li> This really is the best shave a man can get!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic. But the addition of a battery to the Pro Glide makes it even better. The razor is very quiet, and the battery just gives it a little vibration which makes it glide even more smoothly without pulling. The single AAA battery in the handle doesn’t increase the size of the razor appreciably, but adds weight to the handle which is nice.</li>
    <li> As all Gillette razors, this razor worked great. I did not see much difference between this and the non pro-glide power versions though. I did notice that I did not cut myself this time though so that may have something to do with the new &amp;#34;flex ball technology&amp;#34; haha. I received this razor from Gillette so pricing was of no issue. The razor is heavy in a good sturdy high quality type of way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would find a better razor than the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor until I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle. I received this as a free trial offer for Gillette and was amazed it was such a great product. I have never received such a smooth and clean shave before. I have sensitive skin on my face and always end up with lots of cuts on my face after shaving, but not anymore with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power with Flexball Handle. With the lubestrips, I no longer need to use an aftershave lotion. This is definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from Gillette to try and it was incredible! This razor will replace my regular razor. I got a nice smooth shave with this razor.  I will definitely continue to use this razor in place of the one I was using prior. The pivoting flex ball is great for getting a closer shave. I like that I can choose to turn the power on or off as I choose.  The shave is so smooth that my wife had to go out and purchase one to use on her legs for a much closer smooth shave. Very good product that we will both continue to use. Thank you Gillette for sending this to me to try...excellent product!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, pleasant transaction. Would do business with again. Great product, love this razor! A+</li>
    <li> I got this product free from gillette for testing purposes. I really liked how close of a shave I got. It moved smoothly across my face and curved great with the shape of my face. The blades left me with the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I would definitely recommend this product for anybody, especially those that have thick facial hair like me. Great great product will be buying regularly.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I got my Proglide Power for free from the brand.  I went from using an unpowered regular Fusion to this and they are both nice razors. The Proglide gives a nice shave but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference whether I had the power on or not. I shave with the grain first then against.  Either way, I didn&#x27;t have any pulling or irritation. I was a little worried that the handle might buzz and bother me with the power on but that&#x27;s not a problem.  The precision trimmer blade tends to clog pretty easily and I don&#x27;t use it much. I&#x27;ve been shaving for about a month now and haven&#x27;t replaced the blade cartridge yet.  I usually only do that when the razor burn gets intolerable and/or I start cutting myself.  Hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this razor for the close, comfortable shave, but I am not sure the power function adds anything. I also don&#x27;t like the precision trimming blade.</li>
    <li> Four years ago I went from a 5 blade to a 2 blade disposable, because the 5 blade razor gave me terrible razor burn and ingrown hairs. I have super tight curly hair, and people with my hair type tend to have bad razor burn and ingrown hair problems from shaving. The 2 blade razor significantly reduced my razor burn and ingrown hair problem, however it just never felt like I was getting a decent shave. I decided to try the 5 blade razor again after all the claims of improved technology. Wrong, razor burn and ingrown hairs are back like never before. I&#x27;ve decided to invest in a safety razor, because it&#x27;s supposed to help with this problem, especially with my hair type. This cartridge might work for some, but I&#x27;ve decided 5 blades do nothing more than tear apart your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple weeks now and overall its a great multi-blade razor. Cuts close, leaves my face smooth, very little irritation. My one complaint is that the teal strip that leaves a tiny bit of lotion or gel to help combat irritation seems to deteriorate after about  5-7 uses, I&#x27;m not a daily shaver, I shave once every 4-5 days so shaving thicker hair might have something to do with it.  But FlexBall technology makes it really easy on my skin, only 4 stars due to strip going after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product from Gillette to review.</li>
    <li> Been shaving my melon for years...I have always had great luck with Gillette products, used this twice so far and no issues, blades do a good job &amp; I actually like the flexball. Nice Razor</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor for the past month after receiving it FREE from Gillette.  I LOVE the Flexball Handle Technology.  The improved handle allows for a better grip and control of the razor.  It is very comfortable to use. It has allowed me to get a close, even shave in a shorter amount of time.  I would definitely recommend this razor to others and will continue to use it myself. Once again Gillette has created a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I had not used a safety razor in many years, and I was surprised how well it worked. This razor is outstanding. I also like the vibrating head I think it improves the shave greatly.</li>
    <li> I only use Gillette shaving products. Have been since I was 14. This is the worst product they&#x27;ve come out with in the last 10 years. I get a much closer shave with the regular pro glide. I feel the moving head prevents close shaves. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a big difference from Fusion Proglide Power.</li>
    <li> The razor has a premium feel to it. It&#x27;s got good heft and feels solid in the hand. The razor performs well. I can get a fairly clean shave but not the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Razor burns are still a problem and a reason why I&#x27;ll stick with my braun electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that the razor seems to be a little difficult to clean. Shavings seem to stay in the razor and requires a lot of effort to get it all out. The flexball technology seems to be kind of gimmicky. I didn&#x27;t notice any advantages of having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Gillette for letting me try the product for free.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. and the Gillette fusion proglide shaves smooth and comfortable leaving your face feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and will def purchase it again.  I feel like I will be able to use this razor for more than a mont</li>
    <li> Not very happy with the quality of this product, after 1 shave, it no longer was sharp and pulled my beard to the point that I can no longer use it.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;i was afraid, but I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Not interested in the vibrator function, but it shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the pivot ball would be very loose and make the razor harder to handle, but that was not my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I got a razor burn from using the vibrator - use it with care!  (battery is INCLUDED)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat gift for the man who has everything.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can buy an automatic replacement razor service on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They mail you a new blade about the time you think you need one.&lt;br /&gt;(I have my filters delivered that way, so I remember to change them out on schedule)</li>
    <li> Gillette does it again!</li>
    <li> Received  the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silver Touch Power Razor from Gillette. I can honestly say this is the best razor I have ever used.  No more making faces or pulling your skin, the blade glides over the skin and gives the closest shave ever.  It seems to leave my skin very smooth, something to get use to but in a good way.  I sometimes have to double check the area to make sure it actually did something because the shave is so smooth and effortless.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the razor for three weeks now and I believe this will become a permanent item in my shower.  Besides, my girlfriend agrees and feels this is the best razor she has used and compared the smoothness to using hair removal  cream.  You don&#x27;t even notice when going around knees, chin, underarms, etc. the blades pivot to meet the needs of the skin surface</li>
    <li> This new style of rotational blade changed how I shave. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to test this out through Gillette. I have always been playing asked with their products, and I have to say wow this is great, I am now able to get my neck in less strokes. I have always had to use multiple strokes to get my neck and jaw line, and now that the blade rotates slightly I am able to get it all in a sglue stroke. This has saved my some time in the bathroom in the morning. This razor handle is built stronger then before, and the rotating head is stronger then I thought it would be. It is a strong product and I am going to stay with Gillette and I will keep using this style of razor until they cone up with a new better product.</li>
    <li> Excellent , smooth and clean shave. the flex ball technology contours my face to good i am  trying the product for free thanks to Gillette and bzz agent team.I love the way that The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor feels comfortable in my hand and is easy to use .the GilletteÂ® 2-in-1 Shave Gel works.great with this shaver ,I would recommend the Gillette Fusion 2-in-1 Shave Gel.  and proglide fusion with flexball technology. to any wanting a close shave and smooth shave .</li>
    <li> This razor replaced the Fusion Power I used since it came out... My experience with the fusion power was mixed; the blades during the first year where outstanding, later on they just become average. This time I pre-ordered this razor a few days before launch and I got 2x24 blades for future use, assuming that the quality of the first ones will be as good as it used to be with the first ones of the previous version. I&#x27;m 3 month later today and still my first blade runs strong. Now I do believe I have blades until the next model comes out :)&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of advertisement for some no name razors shipped with all you need at a fraction of this one, but do your math: Perfect shaving experience, one blade/3 month (at least)... You got the point; it&#x27;s worth 100% what they ask for!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;10 month passed since I started using this razor. I replaced the original blade after 5 month and the second was replaced yesterday after 5 1/2 month in use. I got a 24 pack at Costco for $48 and my usage is predicted to be 2.2 blades/year which brings the cost of a fabulous shaving experience to $6.6/year. The trick is that I only shave at the end of my shower and I don&#x27;t use regular foam. The shaving gel I use is also my best shaving experience and at age 50+ this goes way back. The gel I experienced to give me the best shave and protect my blades is to be found on Amazon since RiteAid discontinued this year the product line, it&#x27;s made in England and it&#x27;s Called &amp;#34;The Real Shaving Company - Shaving Gel&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Battery was dead upon receipt, installed new battery works good now</li>
    <li> Very nice, very comfortable with them</li>
    <li> One of the best Razors on the market.  My wife says that my face is as smooth as her rear end?  Is that a good thing?</li>
    <li> Best Razor I have ever owned!  Smooth...just fantastic.</li>
    <li> Much prefered this razor and fusion blades over my previous Mach 3 setup. Shave is closer and I like the way the razor conforms to the facial curves. Pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoys this razor as it makes shaving his head so much easier than standard razors.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money!!  Gives you a NICE shave!!!</li>
    <li> The best shave I have had in a while</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors before this, but this is like the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The vibrating effect and the blades that follow you face&#x27;s contour makes it absolutely easy to shave against the grain, although I would recommend against doing that as it causes razor burns, skin irritations and ingrown hair. All in all, a really good razor for a reasonably close shave even with grain.</li>
    <li> Great razor for both men and women. 5 blades, sturdy handle, great shaving.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! It contours to my face and cuts down on shaving time. This is a huge plus considering I shave every morning! I also like the fact that it uses the same blades as my old razor so I didn&#x27;t have to waste blades! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice improvement over an already very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheap investment for a positive result.</li>
    <li> For all the years I&#x27;ve been shaving,I always regularly used a Gillette. I started with Trac II,switched to Sensor,then Mach 3 then Fusion. This Flexball model works like a charm! I probably will never switch again if this one remains unsurpassed.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle complimentary of Gillette to test at home. Normally, I use a triple blade razor so this 5 blade razor seems intimidating initially. I was also curious about how being &amp;#34;powered&amp;#34; would make a difference when I shave. The razor has a nice weight to it, has an edging blade on the back, a lubricating strip on the front as well as a microcomb that helps to glide the hair into the blades. The power button is streamlined on the handle and low enough down that there is not a risk of accidentally turning it on or off as you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;I shaved using Gillette Sensitive Skin shaving gel and decided my first try would be to use the razor with the power it was given. I got the cleanest, closest shave with this razor! There was no tugging or a need to go over the same area multiple times which prevents having any irritation. The lubricating strip also works towards decreasing irritation by hydrating your skin. The pivoting head, glides nicely over the contour of your face and neck, meaning no nicks. The edging blade on the back is great for cleaning up your mustache and sideburns too. The vibrations are not strong but I think they do make a big difference on the smoothness and ease of the shave that you get when using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Though there wasn&#x27;t any discernable difference when using the razor without the vibrations than with; I have to say that there was something different about my shave using the razor with the power on.&lt;br /&gt;The blades don&#x27;t seem to last as long as my usual razor, but I think that may be partly because these razors are much thinner. I can not complain about that though as I&#x27;d gladly spend more to have a great shave that is not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d Highly recommend using Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle. You will get an amazingly close and smooth shave, no irritation, and the lubricating strip leaves your skin feeling hydrated.eling hydrated.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this razor does the job but the flex ball has nothing to offer. When Gillette sent me this item to try I was excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. Compared to other Gillette razors it was the same if not worse. Yes it curves around the face but not much better than other moving head razors. Great product and brand just something that is just as good as similar models. Clean cut! But what could you expect with Gillette? Nothing less than a perfect shave.</li>
    <li> This works great...&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor from Gillette and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;I shave once a week, maybe, this handled my scruff with little trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I had to make SIGNIFICANTLY less funny faces to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I found the vibration feature a nice touch that I felt helped in closeness of shave and less swipes of same area.&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;With how little I shave and how thin the space between the razor is, I had a little trouble getting the hair out. That&#x27;s on me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I would greatly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am in the military and must shave daily.  I also shave my head and this razor is excellent.  I was away training for a month and was able to use two blades while shaving my face each day and my head 2-3 times a week.  Very smooth and clean shave with no issues.  This will be my new razor for some time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology for two months now.  I really like the flexball.  It hugged my face.  This caused less knicks than usual.  The new design on a razor has helped to achieve a better shave.  My wife loves the way that my face feels.  She loved it so much that she started to use the razor for her legs.  I am going to hide it from her!  I would recommend this to someone who has sensitive skin.  I received this razor for free from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach3 razor for several years and decided it was time for a replacement. Saw the advertisements for the new Fusion Proglide Power Razor and thought I would give it a try. It provides a good shave, but no better than the Mach3 system. I did not notice any advantage from the rotating head. And the battery powered vibrating head........? Not at all sure what that is all about. Since the Fusion did not give a better shave than the Mach3, I would have to say that the vibrating head did nothing. I&#x27;ve got to believe it is just a marketing gimmick. In fact, I have to say that I found it slightly annoying. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until the battery runs down and then not replace the battery. All-in-all the Fusion is a good razor and just as good as the Mach3. I don&#x27;t feel that I got cheated by buying the Fusion over the Mach3, but just didn&#x27;t get any better shave.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVE WITH A RAZOR EVER!</li>
    <li> Over the years a trusted brand</li>
    <li> Gillette keep making better razor, this one is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great shave! On time!</li>
    <li> Compared with Gillette Mach 3, the beard more clean.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever owned!!</li>
    <li> Lives to its reputation. Only downside the strip of aloe on top gets very thin after 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> I used my Gillette Fusion for the 1st time this morning. The shave is smooth &amp; fast. The head pivots to the contours of the face. It also has a &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; blade on top which makes it easy to trim hairs. I set the length of my sideburns with that blade. I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to see how long the blade stays sharp to see if the replacement blades are worth the price. I hope it does.</li>
    <li> This razor is a delight to use. Smooth pain and nick free. I love the vibrating handle. My only complaint is Gillette&#x27;s price gouging.</li>
    <li> Good  Value easy shopping</li>
    <li> I like it very much. Earlier i used Mach 3 which was ok. but this is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great razor, but I think the vibrating head is just a gimmick.  Too expensive!</li>
    <li> A very good razor and does cut every blade of hair on your face it beats all electric razors.</li>
    <li> I found the razor to be very comfortable to use. It fits quite nicely in one&#x27;s hand and the vibrations that it puts out seems to make it glide freely over ones face all in all I really am more than pleased with the results of my shaving with it. Buy it you&#x27;ll like it. 5 Stars</li>
    <li> Was researching straight razors and siingle blade safety razors and they were often compared to,the Fusion Pro Glide. I had a coupon so thought I would give it a try. Figured the five blades and vibrating razor was a gimmick. Had been using the Mach lll and liked it a lot. THIS IS NOT A GIMMICK. Hadn&#x27;t shaved in three days and it felt like there were no blades in the razor. Handle is thicker and a little heavier than the Maxh lll but I like the extra heft. A lot of rubber on the handle making it non-slip. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I though this was a gimmick, but I have to admit after 10 days use, it actually does work better than the original without the flexball handle.  Add to this that it was 60% less than the corner drug store chain and you have a great deal!</li>
    <li> Awesome but the blades don&#x27;t seem to last as long as they used to</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Power Razor is very good love it&lt;br /&gt;Item as described, super fast shipment,.</li>
    <li> BEST RAZOR YET FROM GILLETTE</li>
    <li> This razor contours to every crease and it doesn&#x27;t miss a hair. I usually have to shave twice but not with this fella!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to have received the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette.  I&#x27;m a lifelong Gillette man, and was really excited to try a new option for my travel razor.  The design is GREAT!  Very appealing to the eye, easy to pack, looks good on bathroom counters in modern hotels.  Love the pivot/FlexBall idea....in theory.  In execution, it fell short of my standard: the Gillette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide didn&#x27;t seem to give me a closer shave then the Mach 3, and definitely not as close as the Proglide Styler.  The extra blade just resulted in my skin being more irritated than usual, and more skin nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wasn&#x27;t able to get the precision I like when trimming/maintaining my beard line.  Not sure if my pics show it, but the line had dips in it after using the Fusion Proglide due to the FlexBall.  I&#x27;d line the razor up for a straight shave, but it obviously tilted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a really great quality shaver for someone who isn&#x27;t maintaining shaped facial hair, or has less sensitive skin.  But it just wasn&#x27;t for me.  Though I&#x27;m still a tried and true Gillette man when it comes to their other awesome products!</li>
    <li> Recently got this bulk from my Sam Club and it really did the job amazinly. I can&#x27;t wait to shave now</li>
    <li> When I first saw that the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power (GFPP) had a vibrating feature I thought that it was more novelty then anything.  After my first use of this razor I was proven wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Gillette brand for years and was a big activist for the Mach 3 turbo brand.  I also have a electric razor that I have been using lately as well.  Neither of these items that I use comes close to giving as close a shave as the GFPP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found with using this razor is that the vibration creats that little bit of motion while the razor glids across your face.  This causes the blades to cut the facial hair more easily, which leads to a closer shave.  With other raxors I have always had some resistance which has lead to shaving be a longer more teadious process as I sometimes would have to go over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed now that since I am getting a much closer shave that I can go longer periods in between shavings.  I have also used this razor after long weekends and even with longer facial hair I have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a razor that I keep in my bathroom until Gillette suprises me if they can with something better.</li>
    <li> It shaves better than a disposable. But just about any other the razors on the market that aren&#x27;t disposable do. With this I figured that the flexball would make the whole process a lot quicker because it would really get all the contours of my face. That was not the case. It was no faster no slower then the Mach 3 I bought years ago. Nice try Gillette but I&#x27;m not so sure its the best a man can get, maybe it is and i am just picky. Whatever</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology through a special program run by Gillette.  I used one of the blades for my scalp and face.  At first, it was just like any other razor.  But after a few swipes around the curves, I realized it was adjusting and following the contours of my head really well.  Then, I let my daughter use the other blade for her legs.  She REALLY liked it and felt a lot safer.  So, it&#x27;s a pretty darn good razor!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a free campaign.  I know Gillette Fusion very well as I have used them for years.  The newest iteration is the same quality and precision that you&#x27;d expect from Proglide but I don&#x27;t understand the new capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved everyday with this razor since I got it and tried to see if I could see the new flexball in action and I just didn&#x27;t see it pivot the way it&#x27;s designed to.  I just don&#x27;t shave in a manner that would require the razor to pivot from side to side, in fact I try to avoid it because I would think that would lead to cuts.  This is a great razor that gives a fantastic shave but the new flexball featur seems gimmicky to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with anything that Gillette Fusion Proglide can offer but the flexball just didn&#x27;t move for me the way it&#x27;s designed.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, I got what I ordered at a good price.</li>
    <li> i love it, the best razor in the market</li>
    <li> The best razor I ever purchased.  Replacement  blades a little expensive, but worth the smooth close shave of head and face.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very practical. China supermarkets do not sell, I feel great knife head, Amazon&#x27;s direct mail service is also in place, very good, the five-star praise!</li>
    <li> Just added a battery and motors&#x27;s razor</li>
    <li> Generally love these power razors, but mine broke in half in first week</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor a few weeks ago and have enjoyed using it. The handle is a decent size which allows for a good grip while shaving. The razor glides along my face and leaves me with a smooth and clean shave. The FlexBall technology allows for the razor to move side to side a little for those tough to reach places. I have used the same blade on the razor for about seven shaves and it still gives a great shave. No irritation or cuts have happened while I have used this razor. Their is a button to push which vibrates the razor allowing for a closer shave. I highly recommend this razor for people on the go and for those who wish to get a comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> Very close shave with shaving gel or in the clutch if you need a quick touch up. Power glide swivel head does a great job contouring your face with as little efforts and shaving swipes. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL HANDLE is amazing! i received the full product free from BZZAGENT Campaign to try and review it. It gave me a very close shave and no irritation so far. I fully recommend this product, so much so that i have also bought me a 2nd one for my travel bag that stays packed for my weekly travel. I am loving how smooth and soft my face is and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for a long time, so when BzzAgent asked me to review the  Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall by Gillette it was a no brainer that I would say yes. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be much different then the one I currently had honestly, but since I was receiving it for free from Gillette to review, what did I have to lose? I was pleasantly surprised! The FlexBall handle technology makes a HUGE difference in just how close and smooth you can get without having to go through the gymnastics it usually requires to get all the hair. It also held true to the Gillette name. It allowed me my normal smooth shave and did it even easier then before. Overall I&#x27;d have to give this product 5 stars. It definitely surpassed my expectations.  (Having to post from my girlfriends account as she does all the amazon shopping so mine is not currently elligible to post reviews from till I make a purchase!)</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the Proglide Fusion Power with Flexball to test, I highly recommend this razor to anyone that suffer from irritation, burning, and breakouts after shaving. When you shave with this razor it is kind of an odd sensation because it really doesn&#x27;t feel like it is touching your face. It gives a very close shave as with most Gillette products. The one downside is that the refill cartridges are not cheap. I also noticed Gillette Proglide Fusion Power with Flexball seemed to require the use of more shaving gel or cream than other razors I have used otherwise it likes to cut.</li>
    <li> I really love this razor.  The flexball is the key for me.  I have a sensitive face, so I seem to always end up with issues.  This razor, however, has been a true relief to use...especially on my neck.  It really provides a nice, smooth stroke and clean finish.  No pulling of the hairs, and no irritation.  As of now...this is my go to razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Really sharp, very smooth. No razor burn, close shave. Gets those tough spots easily.  Best razor so far.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my face with every kind of shaver possible, disposable, electric or safety razor. They all worked fine for me. So when I received Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor to try free as part of my BzzAgent campaign I was more than happy to do so. And boy oh boy, I was so surprised how well it works. The electric vibration helps gliding the razor across the face. It gave me a very clean and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;And even though the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is not the cheapest one, but it is well worth it to buy it, use it and enjoy it! I really love this razor, and it has became the only one I am using now!!!</li>
    <li> I really liked the swivel action of this razor.  It seemed to follow the contours of my face with ease, capturing and eliminating previously elusive stubble pockets.  After receiving the product from Gillette, my first thought was &amp;#34;oh great, another multi blade razor&amp;#34;.....but I was surprised by how well it works.  I have not yet priced the replacement blades and can only hope they are less expensive than some of the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this product.  It went above and beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> Probably the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Smooth, thorough (one pass is enough) no knicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I don&#x27;t look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 8am. It&#x27;s an expensive budget buster but worth it - especially on days I need to look my sharpest. Great combination of an electric shaver and a razor. The blades seem to last a long time - they better at this price!</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette fusion proglide it leave&#x27;s me with the closest shave i&#x27;ve ever gotten from a manual razor. leave your face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have used this and my Dad ended up getting one as well because I liked it so much.  Great shave.  Much better than the cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> The new Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball Handle Technology was a great shaver.  It was not exemplary, but I would purchase it in the future for my beard styling and shaving needs.  I really enjoyed the feel and handle of the shaver.  The Flexball was evident and made a difference in how I handled the shaver.  I was not able to have a perfect shave, as the shaver got caught up in some longer hairs, which was actually painful. #GotItFree via being a Bzz Agent.  I tried this product from free thanks to Gillette.  I tried it and was asked to review it.</li>
    <li> I recently received Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball. I&#x27;ve tried using ProGlide and Fusion ProGlide in the past, but it never had a lasting impression with me. The Flexball is an improvement, but I still have issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexball Technology: This part is great. I&#x27;m used to razors with a pivoting head, but they&#x27;ve improved on that with even more rotational flexibility. The Flexball definitely helps shave fine lines better. As someone with some facial hair it&#x27;s a great addition to be able to better define the particular beard style I have by getting in and around those areas better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is that for some reason I do not get the WOW experience when using Fusion ProGlide that so many others seem to get. I&#x27;ve used several razors, and while Fusion ProGlide has a nice pedigree, I wouldn&#x27;t rank this one particularly high on my list. The blades never feel that comfortable on my skin, and I don&#x27;t feel like I get the smoothest shave. I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m just doing something wrong, but since I get a great shave with a different razor I think it&#x27;s just that I shouldn&#x27;t be using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I would recommend picking this up. I seem to be in the minority in regards to the issues I have, and Flexball is definitely a useful feature to have in a razor.</li>
    <li> When Gillette provided me the opportunity to try out the new flex ball technology I was ecstatic!  I&#x27;ve been using their products for years and it really is the only razor that works for my face.  Appearence is very similar to the pro glide model with one exception being the flex ball pivot area.  While it looks simple this little pivot motion made a huge difference in the closeness of my shave in tough areas.  Places like my chin and neck line were much easier to do in my opinion.  Combine this with the power option for that close shave and you have a winner.  Cheers gillette!!</li>
    <li> Gillette does it again - I remember way back to the Sensor (with it&#x27;s 2 or 3 blades) being blown away by how much nicer it felt than any other razor I&#x27;d used to date. Now that they have Dyson technology, this is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced! Nicely Done!!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor because it moves very easily across the skin with out cutting me. its very precise and I never have to go back over an area because the razor didn&#x27;t remove all the hair it does its job right the first time.</li>
    <li> Great razor! No burn, no nicks, clean shave after only one pass of the razor.</li>
    <li> Love it I been using the same blade for 2 weeks now shave head and beard every other day and by noon still a close shave. Every time they come out with a new razor I automatically by on blind faith. So much better than the last 1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men&#x27;s Body Groomer With Beard Trimmer  that lasted about a year before it gave out ....I will recommend this to friends!!!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!  I got it for free from the company. It contours to the shape of my face perfectly! I was skeptical at first about this razor but after trying it, I am now a loyal customer. I love how it moves and swivels and the blades are super sharp and makes shaving pleasant and fun!</li>
    <li> I have a very tricky face to shave and with the new Flexball Handle Technology it has been a real dream to use. No more cutting up my face and toilet paper to stop the bleeding. If you want a razor that follows your face better and glides so smooth then this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how nice the feel for the new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor moves! I shave daily, and the roataing head moves in all directions with ease. No more awkward elbows!  The blades are sharp, and there isn&#x27;t any need for double shaving an area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works great. I have used it half a dozen times since it arrived and it will give you a very very good and very close shave. The flexball gives the blade more ability to stay on your face as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the value, spend the extra and go with the Flexball technology instead of cheap, disposable razors.  It&#x27;s innovate, and works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Gillette provided me with a free Proglide razor sample for my review)</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received this razor as a promotional offer for free from Gillette, so price isn&#x27;t factoring into this review so here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years my favorite razor was the Gillette Mach 3 due to it&#x27;s long lasting moisturizing strip and high quality blades but times have changed and along with it so have razors.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unable to use the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide as my primary razor due to me having a goatee. When I try to get a relatively close edge shave up next to my goatee, my jawline presses against the corner of the razor therein causing the razor to pivot and tilt it sideways which then actually cuts a crooked line INTO my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this major flaw it looks to be a decent razor that would be good for full face shaving as long as you don&#x27;t have any (or want to keep any) facial hair. It&#x27;s not spectacular or somehow a MUCH better razor than the Mach 3 or other high end Gillette razors it&#x27;s merely a new handle that allows you to do less work by saving you a few extra strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Same ole car with a new paint job and a fancy new steering wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confused about the vibrate function and don&#x27;t understand what benefit this feature provides.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor FREE from Gillette.  I have nothing bad to say about this product.  It delivers a nice, close shave and the Flexball works well at moving to the contours of your face.  The best part about this razor is that you can choose to turn on the battery, which makes it vibrate.  This prevents hair from getting stuck in the blades, which will make the head last longer and save you money by not having to buy replacement heads as often as some other razors on the market.</li>
    <li> my husband feel in love with the product and he deff recommends it to all his friends! he got this product from bzzagent to try out!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Fusion Proglide to test it out on my beard and see if I liked it enough to switch over.  I&#x27;m not the type of person that brags about how well a product is but, in this case the Fusion Proglide was better than my Shick Quattro with titanium blades.  Fist off, the shave was a lot cleaner, smoother and took less passes to shave than my Shick razor.  Secondly, I thought the vibrating razor was a kool feature that almost took away the feeling of shaving altogether.  Lastly, the razors never clogged up like my shick razor does.  I would recommend this razor for those seeking a new one, most definitely.</li>
    <li> A couple of disclaimers here, one I did receive this item for free from Gillette in order to perform a review of the product and two I normally shave with a straight razor because over the years I started to develop severe issue with ingrown hairs on my neck when I shaved with a Mach 3 razor. So with that said here is my review for this razor. I am trying to be as fair and honest as I can in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with this razor was rather surprising. Having had issues with multi-blade razors in the past I did not expect a good shave. Well, I actually got a really good shave with this razor. I kept my shaving routine the same as when I shave with a straight razor. I use a shave brush and shave soap and build up my lather in a bowl and apply the lather to my face. This was the first time I have performed this with this style razor and I must say I&#x27;m fairly certain it makes a huge difference in my shaving experience. So the first shave went very well. I did not experience any ingrown hairs on my neck and the shave was a breeze. The simplicity of shaving with this razor is certainly appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that does confuse me is the flexball. I don&#x27;t believe the flexball helped the shave at all. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I shave with a straight razor, and I am used to holding my razor at many different angles, but the flexball just felt like a gimmick to me. YMMV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the second shave went well, but I did notice the slightest reduction in the quality of the shave. It still shaved well though and I did not notice any reaction from my skin after the shave. It was the third shave where I notice some small red dots showing up on my neck. This makes sense seeing as the blades wear down as you use them, but for me this was just happening way to fast. I&#x27;ll continue to use this razor just to see how long the blade will last until I cannot stand it anymore, but I&#x27;m currently four shaves (about two weeks) in and the old familiar red bumps are coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is well made and does a good job. Shaving is a very personal experience, in that, what works for me may or may not work for you. If you shave with a multi-bladed razor and have no ill affects then this razor will probably work well for you. I would say that the flexball and the buzzing handle are pretty much worthless, so if they offer a cheaper option without those features you could do just as well with that. But of course these features may be beneficial to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is pretty cheap to buy, it&#x27;s the blades that cost so much, so it may worth a shot to buy it and see. I shave two to three times a week on average so a blade might last me a couple of weeks before the irritation is too much to handle. An 8-count of blades on Amazon cost about $32.50 right now, so say I use 26 blades a year, that&#x27;s 3.25 (8-count) blade refills, so that equals $105.63 per year to shave. I spent a little more than that for my straight razor and accessories a couple of years ago and haven&#x27;t bought anything since (except for shave soaps and such.) I think I will stick with the straight razor, I just like the shave better and my cost over time is less.back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is well made and does a good job. Shaving is a very personal experience, in that, what works for me may or may not work for you. If you shave with a multi-bladed razor and have no ill affects then this razor will probably work well for you.

    <li> I got a free sample to try by Gillette.This razor is one of the best out there .It made my skin smooth and didn&#x27;t give me any razor pumps like the normal or regular razors and it shaves very well without missing a spot .Try it you will not regret your choice.</li>
    <li> I received one from Gillette to try and I am in love with it. It follows the contours of face great which means less irritation. I would recommend this to any guy. I don&#x27;t think they could have made it any better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally the kind of guy who will buy the generic razor at Meijer and not worry about the new technological advancements of razors after all we are not talking about a computer. However, after trying the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology I was surprised how use the Flexball Handle was, it allow the razor to easily conform to my face allowing me to shave in a shorter time that with my other razors. I used this razor with both the power portion turned on and off and didn&#x27;t notice any difference except for the razor vibrating and an orange light on the handle, not sure I need my razor to be battery operated.</li>
    <li> Got this razor from Gillette for free to try out. Over all a great razor. First razor I have ever owned that had the vibration feature on it. I have used the razor with it on and off and it definitely helps to have it on. A lot less pulling and yanking. The flex ball feature to me didn&#x27;t really change the way I shave all that much, I still contort my face to get around the corners of my mouth and such. Is it a habit? Possibly. I guess it will take some time before I can learn to shave without doing this. 20 years of shaving one way can&#x27;t be changed over a week or so of a new razor. I do however think the blades went dull a little quick. After 2 uses I found that they started to pull. But the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area 2-3 times to get it smooth is worth the extra coin for the refills. I have extremely coarse facial hair so that could be a contributing factor. Over all I like it better than my current brand and will most likely purchase refills for the blades as needed.</li>
    <li> I received a manufacturer&#x27;s coupon to try this razor free. Since I&#x27;d previously used the Proglide *without* the flexball, this was a good comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good shave. For a normal straight shaving motion, I didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement, though it certainly was as good as the model without the flexball. Where I noticed the difference was when turning the shave direction slightly in mid-stroke, following my facial contours. The flexball allowed finer maneuvering without lifting the blade from the skin, or rotating it uncomfortably. I was able to continue the stroke along a slight curve with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is, I&#x27;m happy to continue using this razor. I&#x27;m not sure that I would pay significantly more for the flexball technology, but all other things being equal, it was a moderate improvement.</li>
    <li> I HATE manual razors but the Fusion Proglide Power Razor is fantastic!  One pass and done.  No irritation. No bumps. Just smooth skin.  The only downfall is the price of replacement blades.</li>
    <li> so easy to use and comfortable</li>
    <li> I keep trying. Comparing side by side. I just prefer a razor without a bunch of movement. Gillette gave me this for free to try and I want to like it but don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re shaving around your mouth and at the corners of your nose this thing is a liability. It&#x27;s hard to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cartridges and the handle but the Flexball is dead to me. Like I said in another review though, it might be a good thing for shaving legs or your head.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this new razor in a free trial, and my first impression of the Gillette flexball razor was \\&quot;how am I supposed to use this?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;After the \\&quot;man in me\\&quot; read the instructions, I was ready to give it a whirl. The razor itself is excellent, it gave me really close shave on my face and also my head.(I shave my head every week)&lt;br /&gt;It took some getting use to control the pivoting head, but once I got the hang of it, it worked fairly well with no complaints.  My wife has now taken it from me and had stated it works wonderfully for all her shaving needs.</li>
    <li> So I received a free sample from Gillette and was a bit dubious about the improvement. I was using the Proglide manual previously and was very happy with it. Upon using the new Flexball version, I was pleasantly surprised that it did what Gillette advertised: it gave me as good a shave with fewer strokes. I have to admit that some of my facial hair grew in a direction that made it difficult to shave with the Proglide manual, and with the Flexball I didn&#x27;t have to navigate the razor as much. I&#x27;m very happy with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor caveat: the cartridge doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my previous Proglide. This worries me a bit...</li>
    <li> I gave this razor 5 stars because it deserves it!! The proglide fusion was already a great razor, gut with this awesome new handle....its now perfect!! If your on the fence with this one...jump over it already!! One blade on this razor will last at least a month!!! A month of perfect shaves!!!!!  I recieved this product to ty from gillette...and it was free.</li>
    <li> I Received this razor in the mail as a free customer trial campaign threw BzzAgent  , I didnt have very high hopes for the razor to tell the truth, most of these reusable handle razors the heads pop off every time you tap them on the sink , This one holds up ,&lt;br /&gt; The shave was nice and smooth , one pass clean , And the transition from chin to neck didnt leave me with that i just shaved rash i normally get .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only way your going to get a smoother shave, is to pull out your strap and straight razor and go old school . for $8-10 you cant go wrong with this razor..</li>
    <li> When I first got my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, this was my first time using a battery operated Hand Razor.  I was hesitant at first, but was easy to adapt to the feel of the vibration once on. Before this razor, I was using the Schick Quattro and have done so for many years. What I like most about the Gillette Razor is the FlexBall Handle Technology which moved perfectly around my chin much better than the Schick Razor. After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor for two weeks now, I have noticed from the start less nicks and cuts around the corners than my regular Razor.  I think that it comes more from the FlexBall Handle than anything and don&#x27;t know how much the power part plays into it.  I&#x27;m very curious to see how long the battery will last, because that will be another expense to plan for.  The comfort moisture strip is showing some wear in it&#x27;s second week, wear as the Schick Razor uses a gel or trap method from the shaving cream to keep a moisturizer ahead of the blades.  I found that my neck is less sensitive to the Schick stokes than the Gillette Razor.  I&#x27;ve read in another review that someone mentioned the blades popping off too easily.  I did not have this problem at all.  I think it&#x27;s all how you hold the Razor to eliminate that problem.  With less cuts and the moveable head of the blades, I really like the design of this razor.  I would only tweek a few areas that I like with the Schick Razor, then I think that would be the perfect Hand Razor to have.</li>
    <li> As far as shaving goes I a sloppy and lazy.  Usually waiting too long to shave and ending often with a fair share of cuts.  From the first time I picked this razor up, I was in love!  This razor provides and effortless shave that moves with your features to provide an easy, fast, and painless (especially nice for me) shave!  Also surprising to me is the strength and longevity of the blades!  They remain sharp after regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this point on, I shall only be using this razor.  By far the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out as a promotional item. At first, I was skeptical because a lot of the other &amp;#34;innovative&amp;#34; razor designs are cliche and lack-luster. But, I think we have a winner here with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt understand the concept of the flex-ball grip until I used it for the first time. Instead of having to make multiple passes at different angles, you can just slide in a different direction and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less passes, less irritation, happier guy! The Blade, as with ALL Gillette blades, cuts extremely close. The blade itself lasted about 3 weeks without having to be changed, The convenient part is that the handle is compatible with all of the other blades I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deffinately worth the money, and FAR from being cliche.</li>
    <li> I received this razor for free from Gilette to try and review it. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I have to say that it provides a smooth and close shave. It easily glides along the contours of my face, which provides for an enjoyable shaving experience. That being said, I&#x27;m comparing this to my standard razor (Mach3) which is about as basic as a razor gets, so one would expect better performance given the price point and features. The improvement seems mostly created by the flexball technology as the blade is not really any better than my standard blade. So while I enjoy using the fusion proglide, I most likely go back to my Mach3 once the battery runs out or the blade goes dull, whichever comes first. It&#x27;s not worth the additional investment in my opinion.</li>
    <li> First a little background on my typical shaving routine, so you know where I&#x27;m coming from. I have sensitive skin and my facial hair grows slowly. I can typically get away with shaving 1-2 days per week without getting overly scruffy. If it&#x27;s been a week, I typically run a trimmer over my face first just to make the actual shave less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide razor did an admirable job of clearing scruff off my face. A single pass was sufficient to remove almost all hair, with a few short touch-up strokes required to get those odd areas like right below the nose, and around the curves of my chin, which I expected. The glide is smooth. I&#x27;ve shaved about half a dozen times with this razor and the included blade is still working well. I expect that it will need to be replaced after a few more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor includes a &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; which allows the head of the razor to pivot side to side. It&#x27;s explained on the package that this is supposed to lead to a more comfortable shave as it allows the razor to respond to the contours of your face to &amp;#34;get virtually every hair&amp;#34;. While shaving I tried to pay special attention to watching the razor&#x27;s head in the mirror to see if it actually helped or not. From what I could tell, the Flexball appeared to have minimal advantage. The head of the razor did not appear to move very often at all, so I&#x27;m not sure it was really doing anything. In practice, my shave seemed to take just as long as usual. As I explained above I still needed to go back and touch up certain areas, which is something Gillette claims the Flexball should eliminate. As it stands, the Flexball seems do offer little advantage, and comes across as a marketing gimmick to entice consumers into &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; the handle of their razor from the standard-issue Gillette Fusion. It&#x27;s worth noting that all Gillette Fusion razors (regular, powered, Flexball, etc) all use the same razor cartridges. If you already have an existing Fusion razor, I don&#x27;t see any advantage in &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; to one with the Flexball. But if your current handle is old and busted, this would be a find replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the Fusion Proglide with Flexball razor, I had been using a Schick Hydro-5. At the end of the day, I did not notice any major difference in my shave between the Schick and Gillette razors. Both do a great job. However, I do prefer the hydration strip on the Schick razors over the Gillette ones, especially the Hydro-5 as it has the added ability to flip-back the hydration strip to get it out of the way, making it easier to shave those hard to reach spots. But even without those added benefits, I would continue to stick with the Schick as I don&#x27;t feel like the Gillette products warrant their markedly higher retail costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product directly from the brand.Fusion razor, I don&#x27;t see any advantage in &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; to one with the Flexball.

    <li> I never want to use another razor again after trying out my complimentary Proglide from Gillette! The pivoting ball helps to shave quicker and avoid awkward positions with your wrist and hand trying to get that last hair. When I am done shaving with the Proglide I have no stray hairs and can even skip a day of shaving every now and then because of how close the shave is. I use much less shaving cream with the Proglide and find my skin to be softer and healthy after a few weeks of using only the Gillette Proglide!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait and post my review until after I had a chance to fully test out this product.  I have been a consumer of Gillette products for a while now and am currently using the fusion pro glide (without flexball) as my daily razor.  I have tried other razors, to include electric razors, in the past but keep coming back to Gillette in the end.  The first time I used the flexball Gillette razor, I had not shaved in 2-3 days, which is often a problem for some of my previous razors.  I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth of a shave I got on the first day.  The razor felt solid in my hand, even a little heftier than its non-flexball cousin.  The blades conformed to the contours of my face, something that I never knew I was missing until that shave.  I was already accustomed to the vibration of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor, so that was not an issue for me.  I have now been using this razor steadily for 2 weeks , having periodically switched back a time or two to my old razor, and can honestly say that I like flexball razor better.  The one thing that I do not like about this razor is the holster that came with it as I prefer to store my razor vertically rather than horizontally.  One nice perk to this razor is that if you already use the fusion proglide power razor like I do, the replacement cartridges are compatible with both products.  Overall, this is a nice modification to an already solid razor design.  Was it something that I was actively looking for a few weeks ago? Not really, but now that I have tried it, I think I&#x27;ve found my new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/5/14: I forgot to disclose in the original review that I had received this product for free from Gillette to try. After reviewing the prices on amazon and elsewhere, I think $10 or so is a fair price for this razor. The real cost, as some of the other reviewers have noted is the cost of the replacement blades, which can be quite expensive. Overall, I would still recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try and then review FOR FREE. Let me tell you, this razor is the bees-knees of the shaving world. Smooth. Fast. Comfortable handle and amazing feel on my face. It just doesn&#x27;t get better then this razor. The flex-ball technology gives the razor every chance to just hug your face, around all the turns and bumps and crevices. It is even battery powered to get those pesky hairs to stand at attention for a &amp;#34;fight to the death match,&amp;#34; which they ALWAYS end up losing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really is nothing else to say about this razor other then &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I was given this product as part of a free campaign to use it and provide my opinion. After giving it a try, it&#x27;s pretty simple....I love it! The flexball handle technology provides a new dynamic to shaving and really allows for a closer shave.  Its easy to handle and the blade moves seamlessly around the areas that usually give me the most trouble or the most razor burn. It works great around the chin and the neck and I normally have to use a trimmer instead of a razor on those places.</li>
    <li> Incredibly close shave I tried it first as a DRY shave no irritation not nicks then with the proglide gel a couple days later and even better not only a smooth shave but a one pass shave no going over same area again and again! If you are looking for the quick smooth shave and smooth skin get this razor and the proglide gel you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Flexball definitely seems like a gimmick. Noticed no difference to non-flexball ones.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing I LOVED the ease of shaving with it. No ingrown hairs no nicks no bleeding and I&#x27;m prone to them. This razor is simply amazing. I love it. The pivot ball makes all the difference in the world. Helps get all those hard to get hairs in all the nooks and crannies of those hard to reach places on my face! In conclusion if you haven&#x27;t already BUY THIS RAZOR it&#x27;s well worth the price! I did get his as a promotional from the company to try but I would buy it over and over... It&#x27;s WELL worth it</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome I&#x27;m super amazed at both the razor and gel the gel is easy to glide the razor through and the razor is sharp enough to get through a thick beard will be buying refill and continue to use both products</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  It looks like 4 blades and they are so smooth against the skin.  I even used them on the boys and the boys were pleased and not at all irritated. I got this product free as a promotional item and will now buy the replacement blades when needed.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, its my first time to use this kind of razor and this one leave me a good image.</li>
    <li> Very good! I am satisfied!</li>
    <li> This shaver make shaving easier than before</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It gives a clean, close shave and leaves me so refreshed. I would recommend this to anybody who needs a good, reliable razor.</li>
    <li> Received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care as a promotion in the mail last week.  After using the gel, it was one of the best shave&#x27;s I can remember! The Gel is so smooth and just a little goes a long way which is great.  The gel forms into a thick lather quickly and you can really feel how the gel creates a near friction-less shave, which prevents the nicks and cuts. I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology products if you have never tried them.</li>
    <li> Using my wife&#x27;s account, but definitely enjoyed the smooth shave.  I got the Proglide razor and shave gel from BzzAgent to try and this razor definitely exceeded my expectations.  I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it for very long yet, waiting to see how long this blade actually lasts...</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve reviewed a razor before and I gave it glowing reviews because, I think, I felt like I owed it to them for sending it to me for free.  This time, I&#x27;m pulling no punches.  Gillette sent me their Fusion (meaning battery-powered vibration) ProGlide Razor with the Flexball (meaning the razor cartridge can angle left and right a little), so I could check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...it&#x27;s a good razor.  It cut my hair just fine (all of it, I shave my head, so I&#x27;m cutting quite a bit more surface area than your average man).  The first time I used it however, I did get a couple cuts and I usually don&#x27;t.  Perhaps this is from the Flexball making the 5 blades slide a little sideways?  I&#x27;m not sure.  The blades were, of course, sharp.  The vibrating doesn&#x27;t do much for me that I know of, I&#x27;m not sure of the point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a good razor but I don&#x27;t get all the extra stuff and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re paying for it...to me, there&#x27;s a limit to the useful features a razor can have, and this one goes beyond that limit.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion before I got the new flexball handle.  The flexball handle is awesome.  Easier shave, feels like you get every hair.  Easy on the chin area and around the ears, since I shave my head.  I am sold on this product as I was before on Gillette products.</li>
    <li> works better then any razor that I have ever tried</li>
    <li> I have a light beard, thus sensitive skin. The pivot on this razor really does come in handy. Now a razor that adjusts to your face in all directions. This will be my razor from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to impress a 17-year old boy.  So when ours got done shaving and emerged from the bathroom saying, &amp;#34;Holy Cow, that&#x27;s the closest shave in history,&amp;#34; we knew Gillette was on to something.  Your mileage may vary, but one teen is raving.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Gilette shaving products as I believe that they are the best on the market. I have however been doubtful of every new razors gimmicky marketing claims and product revolutions.  5 blades, 6 blades, 10 blades, and this and that. Was I surprised when I used the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology. It really provided a shaving experience like no other. It glides across your face, smooth and gentle without any sensation of scraping or pulling. I normally had to shave twice to get a really smooth shave, once with the hair growth and once against. I now get the same if not better results just shaving once with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall. I am extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely amazing. I have been using gillette for a couple years now and i would like to say nothing is better than this version! It gets a nice clean deep cut and afterwards your skin is so smooth. would highly recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I use to use gillette mach 3 but this is now my go to razor.  Best shave ever. Baby smooth.  I sometimes shave 2 days in a row just to see how smooth a shave i get.  I will buy more refill cartridges to try out for just shaving my body.</li>
    <li> At first the razor was awkward to handle but after using it a few times it was great. The ball on the razor made for a smooth shave with no nicks or cuts. Recommend the Gillette fusion proglide power razor to all my friends</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a program run by Gillette. After using this razor several times I noticed some pros and cons. The pros are it looks nice in the packaging, though this doesn&#x27;t really go toward the actual performance I felt it was worth noting. It is also extremely easy to use as it fits well in your hand and it is even easy to hang in the shower. It also is easy to clean which is a definite plus in my book. Finally it is small in size so that would make it easy to travel.&lt;br /&gt;However there were a cons. the battery appears to drain rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I think it is a good razor for the money and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> As someone who uses a razor very rarely I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the Fusion Proglide but let me tell you that it is AWESOME!  The Flexball Handle Technology allows the razor to almost perfectly glide across the weirdest bumps of your body.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for something that is REVOLUTIONARY!!!</li>
    <li> I love how this product works. It shaves cleanly and smoothly. It is a good price and works perfectly. I recommend to all. i got this product from bzzagent for testing purposes and soo glad i did.</li>
    <li> So I shaved for the first time with the new Fusion with Flexball Technology.  Let me tell you something guys, GO BUY IT NOW!  It is for sure the smoothest shave I have ever had and you know how great the Proglide was before.  Well the flexball really lets you get the closest, smoothest shave out there. I give it a 5 out of 5!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive face and I have to have a good razor. This is one of the best I have tried . The razor follows my facial contour and makes it easy to shave right next to my beard without leaving a nasty looking gap. Overall a really nice product</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor free from Gillette. This is a really good razor. It gives a nice close shave that follows the curve of your face. Could stand to have a little more vibration in the head of the razor. I would suggest it to my friends as well as buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> The razor is good, but there&#x27;s no reason for the vibe function. There&#x27;s no need to add a cut-me function that makes the blade unstable.</li>
    <li> I shave at least once a month  I just tried the pro glide that I received free from Gillette and found it to do what it&#x27;s meant to do. The flex ball turns and rotates to better follow your facial contours to give you a more close shaven look over all I enjoyed the razor and would recommend it to others to try out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high end razors before but none worked that great so I&#x27;ve been just using disposible razors for the last 6 years. Then I resently used the proglide power and wow its unbealivable I will not be using disposible razors ever again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used many different razors between my 10 years as a volunteer firefighter and 8 years in the Army with 1 tour to Iraq. The flexible head makes a world of difference. With most razors I have to perform the &amp;#34;down stroke&amp;#34; as well as an &amp;#34;up stroke&amp;#34; while shaving to get a close shave. Not with this razor. I do the downward stroke and i received an amazingly close shave. I even tried &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shaving like i was forced to do many early mornings running late for formation. Even that resulted in a close shave. 2 thumbs up to Gillette on this one. I will be purchasing this razor from now on. I love it!.</li>
    <li> I got the Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette free for a review (full disclosure). I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times. It&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t personally notice a difference with the little ball thingy, but it may be the shape of my face. The blade felt a little rough actually. I usually use women&#x27;s razors for my face (I guess I have sensitive skin). I hope they end up making different levels of blades for different levels of skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it either.</li>
    <li> I just received my free&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor...  and I decided to do a side by side comparison with my current razor the Schick Extreme 3.I first used the Schick razor on the right side of my face and shaved like I normally would.My razor only has 3 blades and pivots 30 degrees it also has what they call pro flex which is supposed to flex with the contours of your face.Then I shaved the left side of my face with Fusion proglide razor.I shaved as I normally would and when I finished I did my comparison and I was quite surprised.The right still had patches of unshaven hair on my face and when I felt the Proglide side it was smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom the power of the Proglide reached the toughest parts to shave on my face it was incredible! After I finished my comparison I went back and shaved the parts of my face with the proglide and it came out perfect.I also loved the blade for trimming your sideburns it is an incredibly efficient way to trim my current razor doesn&#x27;t even come close to it.The Proglide is the best razor I have ever used and possibly the most effective razor on the market to me it&#x27;s as good or better than getting shaved by a barber.You&#x27;ve got a great product here I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing..</li>
    <li> I got to try out this razor from Gillette. I must say this razor is going to replace my old one. It glided on my face so nicely. I have never felt a closer shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, gets into difficult spots. I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s anything extra special though. #gotitfree #bzzcampaign</li>
    <li> The razor stays on your face for a close shave the first time.  As with other razors you&#x27;d have to go over the spot over and over.  This makes for a quick, cleaner, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to make all those funny faces I used with those other razors I used in the past.  This one really does stick with the contours of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I #gotitfree from Bzzagent to try out and I&#x27;m really glad that I did!  It&#x27;s going to be by new go to razor.  I just hope by wife doesn&#x27;t steel it!</li>
    <li> Because it pivots, the shave is not as close as the previous version. Trying to get closer requires more strokes and more strokes mean likely burns and cuts. Biggest gimmick yet!</li>
    <li> the fusion progr at Allied Gillette make a great product. I have used the Gillette razors for over 20 some odd years. I find them to have a great product and they the newer ones even work better than the old ones.</li>
    <li> I go this razor from Gillette and was impressed with the rotating head but not impressed with the sharpness of the razor... the razor is the most important but the rotation of the razor was really nice!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I like it because I like Gillette stuff. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all that big of a leap forward in technology or anything like that. It&#x27;s simply a decent razor. The whole flexball handle thing seems like, &amp;#34;so what?&amp;#34; to me. It does a good job shaving so that is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> For the past 20 years, I have shaved just about every other day. I started on disposable single blade razors, and on at 18, got a Gillette Mach 3 in the mail. What a difference 3 blades made over a single blade. And now we move to 5 blades, a vibrating mode, and a pivoting head, kiss cuts and, in most cases, making 2 swipes with the razor, goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to no longer despise shaving, just accept it (maybe even enjoy it) as this has made it so much easier and faster to get in a good, clean shave. Because of this, I recommend the Fusion Proglide to anyone that asks, anyone I hear talking about shaving, or those that idly ask themselves if it works, as they see it displayed in a retailer endcap or the tv commercial.</li>
    <li> While I usually use a electric shaver, the Gillette fusion proglide w/ flexball handle technology worked really good.  I used it the 2nd day after i had recieved it in the mail.  It provided a good close shave, and the flexball handle allowed for good circular motions.  I would use this product if i did not enjoy my electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gillette fusion proglide since i received it from gillette since i am a bzzagent and i must say its one of the best razors i have used so far. Its really easy shaving around my neck and chin area now since it just moves right over giving a nice smooth finish, without any cuts.</li>
    <li> Loved this razor! Super smooth shave and no nicks can&#x27;t get much better than that! Love Gillette razors and I think I have found my new favorite in the Fusion Proglide. Gillette sent me this razor to try for free and they definitely made me one happy customer with their quality product</li>
    <li> The best razor Gillette has ever produced.  Built on a the solid design of the Fusion razors, this one hugs your face and slices through a tough beard with ease.</li>
    <li> Gilette has DONE IT AGAIN! What a razor! To anyone saying this is just as good as the old ProGlide.. man are you wrong!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Gillette to try out.  This razor is great for getting a nice close shave.  The 5 blades make it one of the best razors I have used.  I did not think that the flex-ball part of the razor worked as well as advertised.  I did not think that it took away from the razor at all though and was still able to get the good shave I needed even without it moving around with ease as it did in the commercials.  I think I will move away from my Mach 3 and have this as my go to razor now.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I love how soft it made my face feel, even the wife thought I was super smooth. I still have to get used to the vibration feel, as this is the first razor I have used like this. But I will say I love it!</li>
    <li> It shaves no  better than there regular Fusion blade, I actually ordered this buy mistake, I didn&#x27;t notice the battery that made it vibrate,,,,big deal, Its just another marketing ploy that so many people fall into. Yes I&#x27;ll grant it that the fusion line give a good close shave. But why wast the money on one that vibrates.</li>
    <li> I thought the way that this pivots was really interesting.  It helped along the area between my neck and chin.  I usually prefer electric razors but if I had to choose one that was not electric this would definitely be a good contender.</li>
    <li> I got this from Gillette to review.  I gave it to my husband and he absolutely loved it.  He said that it best razor that he has used to cut his bald head.  Also, he was able to use it with no problem. I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my friends.</li>
    <li> My dad simply loved this product! He doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account, so what he tells me i will post as a review for this razor. It is simply gentle and it isn&#x27;t so scratchy on the face. It moves quite smoothly and works perfectly with shaving foam giving you an excellent finish. It is a bit small to grip, but perfect for on the go or vacations that you can just drop into your bag!  Overall score 4/5</li>
    <li> The razors are extremely expensive, perform worse than I expected, and wear out too quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is standard on all proglides, as this is my first time trying this model out. The razors work fine, but I found the single blade in the back to be pretty weak, unlike the older models, sans vibrator.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the main issue. Mine has a power button that lights up, then the blade starts vibrating. If I recall correctly, the packaging said it was to minimize hair pulling, etc, for a smoother shave. however,I feel like this feature is all filler as I still end up with knicks and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;Tl, dr: A useless feature added to raise the prices. My girlfriend however enjoys the razor and uses it every day in the shower.</li>
    <li> Good if you need to shave daily and have thick facial hair. Slides smoothly and so far didn&#x27;t cut myself. Has a vibration button that requires one battery (If I remember correctly) I don&#x27;t know if it helps but it is there.</li>
    <li> If anyone is still wasting money on these overpriced super irritating unnecessary &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; multiple blade razor systems...your just plain stupid and I don&#x27;t feel sorry for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not trying to change anyone&#x27;s mind either, you do what you gotta do...I&#x27;m just going to state what seems so obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;All major shaving irritations are because of using these cheap yet overpriced multiple blade razors. Multiple blade razors cut below the skin level that leads to ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps and even acne. My skin was always red and would break out with multiple blade razors. The switch to DE saved my skin and even money...the learning curve isn&#x27;t that bad either within a few weeks I was getting perfect irritation and nick free shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refill model of multiple blade razors should be illegal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you really so stupid to think that those cheap refills that cost the company some pennies are worth the price the customer is supposed to pay? Come on please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are people falling for this BS marketing. First two blade was the best because the first blade shortened the hair and the second cut the remaining stubble. Then pivot was needed, then slimy strips that dissolve away in a couple of shaves, then three blades were needed, then vibrating razors were needed...VIBRATING razor LOL WHAT A JOKE!!! Then four and five blades and now FLEXBALL technology. FLEXBALL??? Really what&#x27;s next the SNL 15 blade laser face ripper? LOL!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously people just buy a quality double edge razor and get yourself a real shaving cream/soap with a brush and DE blade sampler pack. The initial investment is worth it for your skin and wallet. Don&#x27;t be fools and grow up. Since switching to DE I have resolved all my shaving related problems. No more ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps, redness, acne, nicks/cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if DE razor blades were expensive I&#x27;d still willingly pay the price for something that actually provides a great irritation free shave. With multiple blade vibrating balls even a penny paid is a penny wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people still continue to pay for this crap well good for you...maybe you just don&#x27;t enjoy the finer things in life.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise grow up and shave like a man.ice for something that actually provides a great irritation free shave. With multiple blade vibrating balls even a penny paid is a penny wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people still continue to pay for this crap well good for you...maybe you just don&#x27;t enjoy the finer things in life.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise grow up and shave like a man.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! I had been using a Schick and occasionally disposable razors and this one beats them all. I had received this product as part of a promotion; I was familiar with the Gillette brand but had only been using the shaving gel and had ignored the shavers. Using this shaver for the first time I was very surprised as how light it was compared to the Schick. Also, the quantity of the blades made a huge difference and the FlexBall made shaving much more time efficient as I&#x27;m usually running out the door in the morning.</li>
    <li> The only razor I will use</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of this product and the shave gel that goes with it as a promotion a few weeks ago. I&#x27;ve used many razors and gels, and everything out there has given me cuts/bumps/irritation after shaving.  This is literally the first product (along with the fusion proglide gel) that hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.  I seem to have sensitive facial skin, and I haven&#x27;t had a single day of irritation.  Very pleased.  I would recommend anyone who has irritable skin under the chin/neck area.</li>
    <li> Amazon has a great value price on this Gillette razor.  This new model had a orange power LED, while the previous &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; model had a cool blue LED.  The blades from all Fusion razors will fit and work, though Gillette markets different models for power and non-power models.  New feature is the angle-bending action so that the blade can now both tilt AND swivel, if you pull it in s straight line and apply a lot of force.  This begs the question: Why are you pulling your razor with so much straight line force?  I did not see that the swivel feature made a great deal of difference in comfort, and in some cases, it made it harder to reach beard hair in dimpled areas of the lower chin.  The swivel feature may help prevent the scaping of your skin if you inadvertently press too hard on part of your skin, maybe during a manscaping session.  The AAA battery lasts about 1 year and a couple months.  Included and Replacement blades have 5 tiny blades plus a backwards facing blade for precision edging.  However in my opinion the replacement blades seem to be incredibly expensive.  Build quality of Gillette products is yop notch.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor a lot. I rarely use straight razors as my skin gets far too irritated. Because of that, I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor, which never really gets a close shave. However, this razor seems to do a pretty great job at getting all of the hair on my neck with minimal razorburn. All in all, a great razor. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

    <li> I am really enjoying using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. It has a good hand grip and is comfortable to use. The razor leaves a clean, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different razors, and they all work but you can definitely tell the difference when the razor is quality. I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive the razor from Fusion ProGlide to try but this increases my awareness of the brand and I am more likely to want to buy other products from this company in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the price of replacement blades but pretty much all razor blade refills are way too expensive these days, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m old school. I personally I&#x27;ve always felt the best shave comes from a barber with a leather throng and a straight blade... at least, I did... up until a month ago when I was given a Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is is great. I love how ergonomic the handle is, and the way the blades rotate with the contours of my face. I have yet to cut myself and I&#x27;ve kept using the same blade for just under a month now, for testing purposes only, of course. Anyway, as a former Mach 3 user, who swore he would never give up old trustworthy, I&#x27;m a believer, this razor has changed my thinking and given a new meaning to the phrase &amp;#34;smooth as a babys butt&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette</li>
    <li> I recently received a free razor from Gillette to try &amp; I am here to say just how much I love the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor with FlexBall.  I already regularly used the regular Gillette Fusion Power razor &amp; couldn&#x27;t get over how the new razor actually got around the contours of my face and gave an even closer and smoother shave than the original.  As if that isn&#x27;t enough, I now regularly get through shaving nick free since I started using the FlexBall version.  Gillette literally took an excellent razor and took it to the next level....the best razor yet.</li>
    <li> This Product is one of the, if not most, comfortable razors I have used. The flex ball actually makes a bigger difference than you&#x27;d think when shaving the contours of your face. I found that when using this my face would not have only gotten an extremely close shave, but also no irritation what so ever. The Fusion Pro Glide Razor is a quick, comfortable and easy product to use and I recommend this to anyone whose in the market for a new razor.</li>
    <li> Received this free razor for trial from Gillette for testing several weeks ago. I gave it a 4 star rating after alternating from my usual razor to this razor every time I shaved during this test. Found I received a good shave when using either blade. Finally decided to shave half my face with one and the other half with the test razor. Found that the new razor was a little bit better. Had to get used to the way the flexball tech worked at first. It got easier the more I used it. Main drawback is cost. But that seems to be the same with most razors when buying them. Overall a decent razor.</li>
    <li> When Gillette sent me their new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall to try out I expected it to be just like their other razors. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I did like the other Gillette razors that I tried (Fusion Power and Fusion Manuel). This ProGlide razor with Flexball really does catch one&#x27;s eye however (good job with the bright orange Gillette)! When I took the razor out of the package and looked it over, it made me a little nervous to be honest with you. I mean, the bright orange FlexBall &amp;#34;flexes&amp;#34; so easily, so there&#x27;s a really good chance that it&#x27;s going to cut my face all over, right? Wrong. I enjoyed the shave just as much as the Gillette Fusion razors, but the real advantage that the FlexBall has is with those hard to reach areas such as right under your nose. I did not have to use a beard trimmer after shaving to get those missed spots because the ProGlide with FlexBall gets everything done the first time around which is really nice. The only real complaint that I have is that it didn&#x27;t come with a plastic razor holder. I find these really convenient to store my razors in and figured they would include a cheap plastic holder at least. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Having tried the Fusion line when it first released, I was anxious to try the new renditions after Gillette modified their blades (\\&quot;ProGlide\\&quot;) and attached them to the nifty handle that rocks side-to-side in addition to front and back (\\&quot;FlexBall handle technology\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After loving the Mach 3 then hating the original Fusion as I moved on to new shaving technology, I&#x27;ve wound up as a self-proclaimed Schick Quattro fanboy.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a razor that offers a shave even close in comfort, but as most men, I&#x27;m never satisfied.  As such, I gave the new \\&quot;Fusion ProFlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology\\&quot; every chance in the world to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the new Fusion with all its bells and whistles is no better than the original.  How, specifically?  It all has to do with the shave (obviously, I suppose).  It yields an extremely uncomfortable pulling sensation, even when shaving with the grain.  I didn&#x27;t try shaving against it, as it would&#x27;ve been extremely painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was left with was a shave that left noticeable stubble and an obvious case of razor burn; this is with a brand new set of blades!  It&#x27;s hard to tell what I&#x27;d have after a week&#x27;s use.  This is simply unacceptable for blades that are so spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about that fancy \\&quot;FlexBall\\&quot; handle?  A gimmick.  I suppose if your wrists and fingers can&#x27;t bend at all it might be something that you&#x27;d enjoy, but I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and a normal handle in actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does Gillette have wrong?  As best I can tell from comparing the design with my Schick, it&#x27;s very simple.  Schick runs tiny wires perpendicular to the blades.  Gillette does no such thing.  It seems to me that the wires in the Schick prevent the blades from flexing and separating, and so they cut as a more cohesive unit.  The Gillette blades flex very easily and as a result, pull apart and work much more like one of the old, single-bladed nightmares as opposed to a modern, advanced shaving instrument.  The other added advantage of the Schick design is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself.  Not so with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette: you&#x27;re better than this.  This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to providing the quality experience that the company purports to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received the \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology\\&quot; to try from Gillette as part of their promotion for the new product, free of charge.as opposed to a modern, advanced shaving instrument.

    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor directly from Gillette.  This is a great razor and if you are using any other razor this will be a step up.  With that said this is not a major improvement over the regular Fusion ProGlide Razor.  The Flexball, for me, did not make any noticeable difference. The Fusion ProGlide, hands down is a great razor.  The mirco-pulses feels like it makes the hair on your face stand up a bit more providing a closer shave.  I have a heavy beard, and after shaving in the morning my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is not there until 7pm!  Also the trim blade is a great feature.  Many of the other 3 to 5 blade razors don&#x27;t have it, and it makes it impossible to shave under your nose.  Overall I recommend the razor and if you have a lot of contours on your face the flexball will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Great Razor, Great Shave.  Leaving skin looking and feeling great!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion razors are my favorite brand of razor because I feel they give the closest shave. The Proglid was no different-close shave without irritating my skin. The blade lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t feel like the ball made a huge impact in the ability to navigate the curves of my face. I use shaving cream so the lubristrip doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.  Overall I would definitely purchase in the future, but that goes for any fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor as a promotion from Gillette to review but opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> The razor does what it was made to do. It is not, however, anything ground breaking or extraordinary. The ball acts in a similar fashion as the Dyson vacuum cleaner, but it is not a necessary feature. If this is priced the same as other razors then sure, give it a try, but do not pay extra just for the rotating ball.</li>
    <li> I got the fusion and the shaving cream free as part of a promotion to test the product. So far I enjoy not products. I am not sure that the little ball does anything for me. I have always like Gillette products and I still like it. Mostly, what I have seen is that the blades have been sharp and stayed sharp. The shaving cream is nice as well. It feels good on the face. So overall the whole system seems pretty good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a present for my father.I hope he likes it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST A MAN CAN GET!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product the blades last a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Mach 3 user for years and have never had an issue with it.  I received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology from Bzzagent  along with a can of Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care to try and review.  After seeing the fancy displays in every store, I had high hopes for the razor.  After using the new razor for a couple of weeks, I can say that the flex ball worked fine and rotated as it said it would; however, it didn&#x27;t really provide any closer shave than my Mach 3.  the Flexball provides a close shave, but I like the smaller head of the Mach 3.  However, Gillette has done some actually innovative things with their latest ProGlide shave gel. The gel itself is great at protecting against razor burn and bumps. In addition, it does not dry out my face like many other shaving products. The sent of the Ocean breeze is light and not overpowering.  This will be my go-to gel for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> One word for this razor. SMOOOTH!. I received this razor as a promotion and boy did it deliver. The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor glided smoothly along my face with no nicks or cuts. Also since it has 5 thin blades it made my face baby smooth. The way it works is amazing. So try it today.</li>
    <li> My usual problem when shaving is irritation in the neck area and this razor did not leave me with bumps or razor burn. First time in thirty years I was not left with a red neck. No snagging and the smooth blade glides easily over skin. Gillette has hit a home run with this razor.</li>
    <li> Seems a strange concept, but so comfortable.</li>
    <li> I had the original Proglide razor before and it was great. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with hair pulling when I went without shaving for 2-3 days. I was curious how this powered version would work. From my experience, if you have issues with pulling, get this razor. The vibrations do wonders. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought this from Costco, since they had a great deal for this and 6 blades, which is why it doesn&#x27;t say verified purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fusion Razors for years now, and I&#x27;m pretty confident that I&#x27;ve gone through all of their offerings. Not until now have I truly been satisfied with the my razor. The movement allowed by the Flexball Handle is nothing like any other razor I&#x27;ve used in the past. As someone who constantly battles cutting himself on the neck while shaving, this thing is exactly what I need. Since I received the razor from Gilette, my neck has been cut-free and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;m sold. As always the shave is extremely close on my face. This will be my go-to razor for a long time now.</li>
    <li> My name is Dan. I received this from BzzAgent to try this product and try. I have to say that it is amazing. It really tapers the curves when you shave lessening the risk of cutting yourself. It is definitely a product worth purchasing again and again. The price is worth it and has a comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I received a free sample of this product from this brand.  I thought this was a great razor for everyday use.  It&#x27;s also compact for traveling which is a big thing in my line of work, which also requires me to shave daily.  Since I do have to shave daily a razor that does the trick and keeps me smooth and bump free is important.  It needs to be easy on my skin and really get all the hair off.  This Gillette razor does that well and it&#x27;s affordable too.</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor from Gillette to review and comment on. I liked it at first, but after using it for about a month now I&#x27;m not so sure. Replacement cartridges are expensive and it tends to feel like it pulls on the hair. But overall not a bad razor, I guess disappointed because of the price. I would also like to see a better stand for this razor.</li>
    <li> PRETTY GREAT TECHNOLOGY WITH THE BALL, THE ART OF SHAVING IS SELLING THE SAME RAZOR FOR OVER $100 BUCKS, DON&#x27;T DRINK THE KOOL-AID.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide was good, the name brand is very well and i feel like it does help you shave better so you don&#x27;t have to twist and turn but i would probably not buy this</li>
    <li> The fusion proglide gives an outstanding smooth shave. no pulling or irritation. it gets every hair and is great for your upper lip and chin area.</li>
    <li> Now I have been shaving for over 20 years now and I haven&#x27;t seen a razor like this.I have used it for about a week now and I am very impressed with it,When I used it there was no irritation on my skin and it didn&#x27;t pull on my hairs.I found the ball to be helpful It made it smoother while shaving.The only thing I didn&#x27;t get  about this razor was the vibration it didn&#x27;t really make a difference while shaving.</li>
    <li> The Gillette razor Flexball handle is awesome and I do recommend this Fusion razor to anyone, this is all I use and 100% please.</li>
    <li> I received a demo product from Gilette to use and abuse. The Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle took a few shaves to get used to due the flexball.  However, after I got used to it, I can say I have never had a less irritating shave.  I normally get severe razor burn on my neck area.  With this razor, nothing. I noticed that my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is non-existent with this razor, and it just glides over my skin with no snags or tugs like some of my previous razors did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my Fiancee to use the spare blade when she was getting ready to shave her legs and underarms with it to see how it handled more difficult areas and she also loves the razor.  She actually told me that I wasn&#x27;t getting it back without a fight.  This will be my standard razor from now on (If I can get it back from my Fiancee!).</li>
    <li> For the last few years I have been using an electric shaver to handle my daily shaving needs. But, after my shave died due to battery issues I decided to buy the Gillette fusion power. Honestly, I could not remember the last time I had that close of a shave. I originally switched to an electric shaver because traditional razors would irritate my skin, especially around the neck. The Gillette fusion power gave me a close shave and no irritation. I thought the power feature was just a gimmick, but surprisingly it helped prevent irritation and gave a smooth shave. I will not be switching back to an electric shaver now that I can get a closer shave and have no irritating red marks on my neck.</li>
    <li> I usually use disposable razors for shaving.  I received this razor from Gillette and have been using it for a week now.  It does an excellent job!  No cuts and no irritation!  The blades are easy to clean and dry, so I would expect them to last much longer.</li>
    <li> Good shave, but doesn&#x27;t always stay close to the skin</li>
    <li> Good razor but really hardly no difference from previous models. Propaganda at its best.</li>
    <li> I spoke to members of my book club. I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy. In fact, I usually wait for two to four days between shaves just to get the hairs out long enough for the shaver to something to grab. Nonetheless, one aspect that does cause a fair amount of trouble is around my adam&#x27;s apple and on both sides of the neck, just below my jawline. In both cases, I have hairs that grow out in a number of different directions, making them very hard to grab without scraping a couple of times from every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I heard about the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology, I was hoping that the 3-D movement, instead of just a pivot, would help me get into those evasive spots. I was elated to get a free sample of the new shaver in the mail. After three or four shaves in a couple of weeks, I can truly say that I DO like the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology; although, it may not be for the promoted reason. I loved the smooth glide over my skin and the closeness of each shave; however, the adam&#x27;s apple and sub-jawline areas still took considerably extra strokes to eradicate all of the stubble. I&#x27;m presuming this is because the width of the shaving head still restricts the amount that the Flexball can &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the smoothness of the shave itself, I noticed the following bullet-points in some of the promotional material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reengineered Low Cutting Force Blades have thinner, finer edges and advanced low-resistance coating for effortless cutting with less tug and pull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade Stabilizer keeps blade spacing optimal, allowing the blades to respond to the contours of your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Streamlined Comfort Guard produces optimal blade contact by channeling excess shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhanced Lubrastrip® is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the razor to move smoothly over your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely say that that these components really do make a difference. I am certainly inclined to stick with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology simply for the smooth comfort of the shave alone.difference.

    <li> I like the fusion!  I seem to knick myself less now than I did before! It also seems to take less time to shave, which is a plus. Perhaps because it pivots, it makes transitions easier and quicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, BzzAgent sent me this awesome product along with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care at no cost!</li>
    <li> While not someone who usually is worried about his type of razor, I may be taking that back. The new Gilette Fusion Pro-Glide is an amazing razor and the shaving gel that goes with it is just great. I have never had a another shave, the ball technology helps the razor confirm to the contours of the face better then any razor I have ever used before. I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new. I received this as a promotional item from bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Says it  makes his face so smooth!</li>
    <li> Hey all I have been shaving since I was 12 years old, but truly I hate to shave and would rather grow a long bear but that is not professional and in my career professionalism is key.  One of the main reasons I hate to shave is the after affect of Razor Burn that most to all razors have done on my face.  When I received the Gillette ProGlide as a free product to review it for Buzz Feed, I was skeptical of the FlexBall technology, but holy cow it works, it gave me a butter smooth finish on my face and with no Razor Burn...non at all. I have truly found the razor of my dreams.</li>
    <li> Best shaving blades I&#x27;ve ever had. Insane. Forget that King of Shaves hype. This is the real deal!</li>
    <li> I am sure I have been using Gillette since the time I started shaving. I have seldom had any complains with any of their products so I was happy to try this Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care. Active sport gel had a nice fresh smell and like all Gillette gels it was easy to apply and lather. The razor was easy to use with a good grip and it shaves close and smooth. The only problem I faced is that it was really tough to clean the razor after use. The hair used to get stuck in the blades and it wasn&#x27;t easy to remove them. Other than that it was a wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave ever.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette and was extremely impressed with the results. I typically use disposable razors due to the price and I have never noticed a major difference in comfort when using a disposable vs a nice brand name with refills. However, with this model I can tell the difference. The comfort level is extremely high when using it. The blades were close to my skin but there was no pulling or burning. I let my stubble get a little long to test it out and it still performed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the cost of the replacement blades. That is why it is only 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> When I received this razor from Gillette,I was kind of nervous because of its movement. Butt after using it,I really liked it and recommend it because it shaves a whole lot closer and moves around contours of your face. A great product and a lot better then the original Gillette razor.</li>
    <li> They did it again. Great Gillette product.</li>
    <li> Love and my #1 and so so worth it !!!! And such a great and amazing racers, so on POINT !</li>
    <li> great product. great grip. great balance and great finish without actual irritation while shaving. Highly recommended for all.</li>
    <li> This razor works very similar to the pro glide razor I had already owned. I shave daily including my head as well. Did not notice any major differences from the original razor to this one. If you are going to change from a different razor to a proglide either one will suffice.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD KEEP BUYING FORM YOU.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Turbo Three</li>
    <li> Overpriced razors! Plenty of cheaper/better options.</li>
    <li> I have really coarse facial hair and most razor heads don&#x27;t last  that long for me, 1 week or so each. The Fusion ProGlide Power head works fine for me and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference between the Flex Ball and the non ball head. I give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s just like the Fusion ProGlide in that it cuts very nice and the straight blade on the opposite side is sharp and nice for precision but I didn&#x27;t give it the 5th star because even though it tilts, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
    <li> My husband says it provides the best shave he has ever gotten!</li>
    <li> Wanted to be wowed by this as much as I was by the original Power Fusion... but, honestly, didn&#x27;t notice much differences.  The little &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really a ball but just looks like it.  There&#x27;s a little gizmo that basically serves as a pivot point that allows the head to move in a ball-like motion as it glides across your face.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong....it&#x27;s as good as the original, just not significantly better.  So, if you need a new razor... sure, get it.  If you don&#x27;t, wait until you do.  All that said, the power fusion razors are still hands-down my favorite when it comes to getting nick-free, smooth, close shaves so you&#x27;ve got to hand it to Gillette on that count.</li>
    <li> Not enough words to describe this razor.  Can&#x27;t believe it shaves this close without any irritation whatsoever.  The customer reviews and that it can be used in the shower convinced me to try it..  Sure wish I&#x27;d had this razor when I was in boot camp in 1969.  Thank you Gillette and thanks to those who took the time to post their opinions.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a razor which pivots to get closer shaves without cutting yourself accidentally.</li>
    <li> Will need some getting used to</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of trying this item for free from Gilette.  I really enjoyed this razor.  It is heavier than others I have used, but that appealed to me.  It make me feel like it was stronger.  The technology of the ProGlide ball helped in moving around the contours of my face.  I got no cuts from the razor and got a GREAT shave.  I would highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> good and nice,i like it</li>
    <li> The blade lost it&#x27;s sharpness only after a couple of shaves. I understand this is how Gilette makes money, but losing the sharpness after only 2 times of use points to a bad design. The blade gave me a very bad shave long with bad cuts (and blood) during the third time I used it. I had to use a replacement blade. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a new buy if you already have a razor. Just buy new blades.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion pro glide is nothing like I have ever used. I got this and the alpine shaving cream for free along with coupons! The flex ball makes it very easy to get around curves. It leaves a nice clean cut without Knicks taken out of skin. I would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This shaver is waaay overrated and quite goofy.  I have TWO MAIN complaints.  1.  I hate how far the bottom blade is from the end of the razor ie that big blue thing on the bottom that serves no purpose - why is this an issue? For shaving under my nose - upwards - and even downwards there is a lot of space.  I wish the blade was closer to the end so I can shave effectively under my nose -and NO - I don&#x27;t wanna use that dumb trimming blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When you wanna get REAL close and stretch your skin and go over - I can&#x27;t catch the whiskers with these blades for some reason, on a certain part of my face - I was trying yesterday like between my cheek and chin and I kept going over and using my tongue to get the skin to go out and went over it like crazy and these blades wouldn&#x27;t catch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my last Fusion blade - and I&#x27;m glad - I&#x27;m gonna switch to a Schick product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is waaay overrated - I used Gillette Sensor 3 disposables once and cut my face all up.  They do these goofy flexballs and stuff and don&#x27;t even have a good safe simple razor that cuts close and easily after all these years - a couple weeks ago I gashed my chin with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better razors than this.  You can&#x27;t get close to your nostrils with this - I&#x27;m gonna try Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price-------it should last longer and work better - way too expensive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is just coasting on its name at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to Schick.</li>
    <li> I have to shave almost everyday I found that out of the box the razor was sharp and cut well.  It became dull quick, also i felt like it was pulling the hairs out instead of cutting them after a weekends worth of growth.  I have co workers who swear by the razor for me it will go back to my tried and true razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it&#x27;s power feature makes shaving a smoother experience and gets a closer shave. Battery has been running strong for me for 1 month now with nearly daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s water proof/resistant but I use it in the shower no issue at all. The blades last long and are not too costly for a 4 pack. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
