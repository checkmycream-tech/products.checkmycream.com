      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>Love, love the smell (Energizing Citrus).</li>

      <li>The price is right, not tested on animals, natural ingredients and smells awesome.</li>
      <li>:)  Seriously, fresh light clean scent, good value.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and makes you feel really fresh.</li>
      <li>All natural,St. Ives Energizing Citrus Body Wash has a wonderfully refreshing grapefruit fragrance and it&#x27;s free of parabens.  </li>
      <li>I got this item very quickly.</li>
      <li>It was refreshing, lots of lathe and does the job at keeping you clean.</li>
      <li>Have loved this product and now, since I use Subscribe &amp; Save, don&#x27;t have to scramble to the store to get a new one.</li>
      <li>Overall though, I really liked the smell and it makes my skin feel nice and clean!</li>
      <li>This is gentle and has a nice citrus smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>and if your husband uses whatever body wash is available in the shower, he will not head to work smelling like a flower garden....</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a good sudsing, and even though I have fairly sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t found this to be too drying.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean citrus smell but isn&#x27;t to overpowering.</li>
      <li>Clean, citrus fragrance--not sweet or phony.</li>
      <li>It is also a bit more watery and thinner than other body washes I have used like the Softsoap Pomegranate, which makes it not quite as good for shaving.  </li>
      <li>The citrus scent is bright and lively and really perks you up.  </li>
      <li>So fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
      <li>We felt so energized that we were able to make it to the television faster than we normally do!  </li>
      <li>That, combined with it&#x27;s very reasonable cost, makes it a very economical product.</li>
      <li>It really does invigorate- smells fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I paid for!</li>
      <li>Light and clean scent and leaves sky feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to most soaps and scents.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>If you like the smell of freshly cut grapefruit....</li>
      <li>The product is a little more watery than I would like, and I was hoping it would be better for dry skin in the winter, but it still smells great and cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>This is a really nice light and refreshing body wash, that has a great, not-too-sweet citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the packaging a little bit large and clumsy to pick up with wet hands when it&#x27;s full, and the large-ish hole means the liquid dispenses quickly.  </li>
      <li>It really wakes you up and gets your senses alert!</li>
      <li>I love a product that actually lives up to its name.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t handle most scents, citrus is clean and refreshing for me.&lt;br /&gt;It also keeps me from having dry skin that I often get with other products.</li>
      <li>Helps me get my days started on a positive note.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use it more in the summer when dry skin isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
      <li>The bottles are a large size and I like that</li>
      <li>St. Ives makes very high quality lotions and body washes.</li>

    <li> I did not purchase this product from amazon but i can tell you it&#x27;s a great buy. It smells and feels amazing, i finished my bottle in less than 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> Smells Good and good Lather.. Worth the price.  Leaves  moisture on skin. Always liked St.Ives products. They are really very good</li>
    <li> I love this. I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store and found it here. It&#x27;s light&lt;br /&gt;and smells good.</li>
    <li> what can i say about this body wash? it&#x27;s great, smells clean and citrus-y without knocking you out in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and the price? outstanding. amazon rules the web!</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for years. I love to use this body wash in the Winter, when it is cold and miserable here in the North East. This body wash smells like citrus heaven, like a vacation in a bottle. The complete opposite of the winters here in Jersey. The best thing about this product is that it is not tested on animals and contains no animal ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It smells amazing and makes you feel really fresh.</li>
    <li> I was so glad I was able to find this as the company has quit making it. It has such a vibrant, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this body wash for years.  I can&#x27;t handle most scents, citrus is clean and refreshing for me.&lt;br /&gt;It also keeps me from having dry skin that I often get with other products.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite body washes. It has a clean citrus smell but isn&#x27;t to overpowering. It&#x27;s unisex too. My boyfriend likes it also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the word awesome very often but I cannot find another word to describe this product.  I LOVE the smell, it lathers wonderfully and it rinses easily.  I have sensitive skin and have found that St Ives body washes are the only ones that work for me.  I loved the FresH2O one but they stopped making it.  BOO!  I hope they NEVER stop making this one!</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to most soaps and scents.  This is gentle and has a nice citrus smell.  I had ot buy it online because the stores where I usually shop stopped carrying this particular scent.</li>
    <li> wonderful body wash - great scent</li>
    <li> I use St. Ives body wash because it lathers very well without having to use a lot. That, combined with it&#x27;s very reasonable cost, makes it a very economical product. And all the St. Ives body washes have a very nice scent to them, which I enjoy. This one smells like a combination of oranges and grapefruit to me. It really wakes you up and gets your senses alert!</li>
    <li> This was the best smelling body wash EVER! Ok did I say EVEEEEEEEEEER? It was refreshing, lots of lathe and does the job at keeping you clean. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Value here, again, the St Ives brand works for my parents skin cleansing needs.  We also found the scent refreshing and a welcome change.  We felt so energized that we were able to make it to the television faster than we normally do!  :)  Seriously, fresh light clean scent, good value.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a bright but not in-your-face citrus scent.  I find it doesn&#x27;t smell as artificial as other body washes.  It isn&#x27;t too harsh on my dry skin, and rinses clean without residue.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a WONDERFUL fragrance; just the \\&quot;ahhhh\\&quot; factor of using it is ENERGIZING.  It has the invigorating smell of fresh grapefruit, and, at least for me, that&#x27;s a real \\&quot;wakeup\\&quot; smell.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a good sudsing, and even though I have fairly sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t found this to be too drying.  Highly recommended for the fragrance and for its kindness to my skin; a winner that&#x27;s staying on my shopping list!</li>
    <li> Great body wash ! Very energizing especially in the morning shower.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of grapefruit then you&#x27;ll like this! I love the smell, the suds and the way my skin feels when I use it.</li>
    <li> This body wash is my everyday staple. Plus I will use the St. Ives exfoliating formula too. I am addicted to the citrus aroma of this body wash. It makes my wash cloth soft, so I know my skin is getting there too. Living out in the desert of Vegas, this stuff will keep your skin from drying out. I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the citrusy scent of this body wash.  This scent is difficult to find in my area.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love, love the smell (Energizing Citrus). Great price.  It&#x27;s soap--it works like soap. I have no complaints about its soapiness.  The only reason I gave one star off is that I&#x27;m not sure about how natural this stuff is.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this frequently.  If you like the smell of freshly cut grapefruit....this is it!  It really does invigorate- smells fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and can use it over and over and over! Hence why I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  The price is right, not tested on animals, natural ingredients and smells awesome.What more canI ask for.  Its&#x27;s a friend for life.</li>
    <li> Love it. smells like citrus. Love the smell.  I recommend if you like citrus smell. I got this item very quickly.</li>
    <li> i love this product .i have searched  most drug store for this wash ..this wash energizes me and i feel great .i don&#x27;t think i can do with out it .so i will recommend this product 100/% to any one</li>
    <li> This body wash smells good! but it unfortnately is not moisturizing nor does it lather up at all! I will probably go back to dove! Cheap, moisturizing, great</li>
    <li> I use this to keep bugs off during summer months, just lather a little in my hands an rub it on, works like Avon skin-so-soft citrus wash.</li>
    <li> St. Ives makes very high quality lotions and body washes. I have used almost all of them and have liked them all. This one is particularly refreshing .</li>
    <li> I love a product that actually lives up to its name.  Energizing Citrus says it all.  I use it and feel a sense of joyousness every morning (which is why I had to review it even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon). The citrus scent is bright and lively and really perks you up.  You really get a sense of the tangerine in it.  The lather is nice and washes away cleanly....and if your husband uses whatever body wash is available in the shower, he will not head to work smelling like a flower garden....and he&#x27;ll probably thank you for it.  Great for every member of your family!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband and I discovered this soap at a B&amp;B recently and were instantly hooked. At our very next trip to Walmart, we picked some up to see if we would get the same experience at home. We then decided to stock up via Amazon. Great price for the 2-pack. Love the citrus-y scent in my morning showers. Helps me get my days started on a positive note.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this particular scent in my area. The bottles are a large size and I like that two come in an order. I will be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price at Amazon. Hard to find in my area, so glad that Amazon carries it!</li>
    <li> I think they are phasing out this variety of body wash, and that&#x27;s a shame. Our family loves the grapefruit scent! So fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
    <li> Always like citrus flavor in shower, body wash. Have a very sensitive skin and do not have allergy to it as well. Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> The product is a little more watery than I would like, and I was hoping it would be better for dry skin in the winter, but it still smells great and cleans very well.  I&#x27;ll use it more in the summer when dry skin isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is a brand/variety combination that appears fairly irregularly at our local grocery stores and I was very happy to find it avaialbe, at a reasonable price, through Amazon.com.  Your results will depend on your skin type, the environment your skin must put up with, and personal preferences.  But this one got check-marks in all the boxes.  The two most import factors for me are that does not feel oily, and the citrus IS refreshing without an overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice light and refreshing body wash, that has a great, not-too-sweet citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the packaging a little bit large and clumsy to pick up with wet hands when it&#x27;s full, and the large-ish hole means the liquid dispenses quickly.  It is also a bit more watery and thinner than other body washes I have used like the Softsoap Pomegranate, which makes it not quite as good for shaving.  Overall though, I really liked the smell and it makes my skin feel nice and clean!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I paid for!</li>
    <li> Great body wash. Light and clean scent and leaves sky feeling soft and clean. Good value when you are on subscribe and save plan.</li>
    <li> All natural,St. Ives Energizing Citrus Body Wash has a wonderfully refreshing grapefruit fragrance and it&#x27;s free of parabens.  It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed like so many of the other major-brand products.  I love the Citrus Body Wash--it&#x27;s essential to my daily shower ritutal.</li>
    <li> I love this product. They stopped selling it locally so I found it on Amazon! Clean, citrus fragrance--not sweet or phony. Well worth the slight extra effort of purchasing on line to have my favorite body wash!</li>
    <li> Great smell and my skin loves it.  I have switched from bar soap to St. Ives body wash,  This one is my favorite,  I do not like the smell of the sea salt one,  too perfumy, but the Citrus is real natural smelling and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> works well, lasts forever which is fantastic since I hate shopping.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It revives me</li>
    <li> Have loved this product and now, since I use Subscribe &amp; Save, don&#x27;t have to scramble to the store to get a new one.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say this is the best body wash I have used, but certainly it has the most refreshing smell. But, like dove, this leaves the moisturizer on you, which may be good, but i hate the soapy feel.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and I like the fact that St. Ives does not test on animals. Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, so I put this in my hand soap containers!</li>
