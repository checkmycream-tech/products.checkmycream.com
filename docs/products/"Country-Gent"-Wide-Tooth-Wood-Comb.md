      <li>I have long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
      <li>It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t look all gross like brushes do when you pull them out in a public restroom or anywhere really.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good quality comb but for some reason it has become warped (it now curves at the middle instead of being a straight flat comb), i&#x27;m assuming from the moisture in the shower</li>
      <li>but I bought this because I really baby my hair.</li>
      <li>Very substantially built.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle much at all, I can even get by sometimes just using my</li>

      <li>I have very long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing this comb</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have very little hair left in the comb and it makes my scalp feel SO good also.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast enough and enjoy the historical card explaining the history of wooden combs.</li>
      <li>This would be my first experience using a wooden comb (although I had heard about them several years ago)</li>
      <li>Much less breakage (I was using a pick - only brush my hair a couple times a year, as it tears up the curl), and comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>, it was shipped only a few hours after I ordered it and arrived safe in my mail box a short while later.</li>
      <li>No rough edges that would break or snag your hair.</li>

    <li> This comb is beautiful and truly great, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a lot healthier for the hair than plastic combs are.

Very happy with this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb when I read the information about it being better than the plastic combs that I have used all my life. This would be my first experience using a wooden comb (although I had heard about them several years ago) but I thought I would give it a try anyway. I found out that this is the Comb for me! I LOVE it! I have used it for about 6 months now and not only has my hair grown and gotten thicker, but when I use the comb, it literally glides through my hair. No snagging, pulling, breaking, etc. I have very little hair left in the comb and it makes my scalp feel SO good also. Thank you for a Wonderful product! I plan to buy one for my daughter-in-law. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb for use on my long(ish) hair (middle of my back) and it is just what I wanted and helps distribute the oils to the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend, she loves it. Says it&#x27;s the better than all her combs. I did good.</li>
    <li> Awesome wooden comb, feels amazing on your scalp! Smells wonderful, handles beautifully and there is no static cling to your hair since it is made of wood not plastic. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing this comb, it&#x27;s the best thing for your hair and I could not be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best comb I have ever had.  I LOVE this comb.  I have thick, long hair and have only used THIS comb for 2 years. My hair  doesn&#x27;t look frizzy as it did when I used plastic and boar bristles items.  I&#x27;m going to order another one.  I ordered another one and shipping was fast, it arrived in a couple of days.  I am very happy with the product and the merchant.</li>
    <li> Solid wooden comb. Got what you paid for. Shipped fast enough and enjoy the historical card explaining the history of wooden combs.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Very substantially built. A real great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Good overall comb. A few of the teeth weren&#x27;t sanded down smooth and had some sharp edges when I received it, but nothing a little sand paper couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I keep this comb in my backpack or purse at all times. It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t look all gross like brushes do when you pull them out in a public restroom or anywhere really. Also doesn&#x27;t make my hair static-y at all!</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair that tangles easily. I LOVE this comb!! No rough edges that would break or snag your hair. Will be buying another to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> When I first received this comb, I loved it. My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle much at all, I can even get by sometimes just using my fingers-- but I bought this because I really baby my hair. I have read a lot recently about the benefits of using wooden combs, and after a lot of searching I thought that I found one that would really work for me. I&#x27;ve had it for a week or two now, and it&#x27;s already broken in half! I wasn&#x27;t even combing through tangles, I was just combing it after a shower. I really wanted to like this comb, but maybe it&#x27;s just not very good for people with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair comb.  Much less breakage (I was using a pick - only brush my hair a couple times a year, as it tears up the curl), and comfortable to use.  I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very long, fine hair. Purchased a Japanese pear wood comb in 1977 that I used every day. I loved it. Unfortunately, so did my puppy. Now all that remains are splinters. I&#x27;ve purchased six or seven wooden combs in an attempt to replace it and they all disappointed: either too big, too small, teeth were too wide, too narrow, too blunt, too sharp, too rough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS comb... When I pick up this comb I no longer sigh with regret for my lost perfect comb, because this one is even better! It glides through tangles like magic. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just get it. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality comb but for some reason it has become warped (it now curves at the middle instead of being a straight flat comb), i&#x27;m assuming from the moisture in the shower but it&#x27;s only been a month or so otherwise seems like a good company</li>
    <li> I have been using this comb for a couple of weeks now and it is great! I don&#x27;t use conventional shampoo, so I needed something other than plastic for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like plastic Combs do. I like the wide teeth. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best comb I have ever owned. I have really long thick hair and it really takes the tangles out fast and easy.  I love this comb! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
