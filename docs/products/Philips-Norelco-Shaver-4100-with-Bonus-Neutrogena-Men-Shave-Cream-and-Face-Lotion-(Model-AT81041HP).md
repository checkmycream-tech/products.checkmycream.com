<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This thing is great!!! Close shave, and the battery (at least now) is lasting me over 14 shaves.  I&#x27;ve spent much more on a shaver and didn&#x27;t get as good a shave.  I have tender skin, but a tough beard.  This handles it very well.  Also the face cream sent with it is very nice (I ordered more), it only takes a tiny dab.  The shaver also came with shave cream for a wet shave.  Tried it both ways and the dry shave is quicker and just as close.</li>
    <li> A great razor! A pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my father. He really loves it.</li>
    <li> Quite nice and easy to use gadget. The additional Neutrogena it comes with is a great help</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly neighbor and he absolutely loves it.  He&#x27;s always used Norelco so I was happy that he loves it.  He said it hooves him a super close shave.</li>
    <li> The shave isnt as close as I thought I would be. I have to move the shaver back and forth to many times to get the hair off.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! he said it is the best electric razor he has ever had. Smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt like some others. The price was very reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for 30 years. Love it.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for. My husband loves it. The fact that he can use it with, or without, shaving cream and water is really convenient!</li>
    <li> My significant other loves this electric razor. It works very well on his sensitive skin and tough hairs.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s all even better with the sale price I got it for.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he used it once,his expirience wasn&#x27;t so good after using the machine,he said it was painful and had pimples all over his chin and cheeks.he is not using it anymore although it removed all the hair and was a clean shave but after a day he was swollen with pimples.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very cheap ,but very useful. it&#x27;s one of the seldom product I&#x27;m totally content with ! Philip ensure the product!</li>
    <li> This is my second  one and I use it in the shower every day.  Its great shave</li>
    <li> Very close shave. As good as any razor with blades. Shaving cream and after shave irritation cream a good bonus</li>
    <li> I have only had it a short time but so fare I love it.  Love the color, shape and performance it has shown me so far.  I would also have to say a nice buy and a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he is completely satisfied.  I got a very good deal and viewed many alternative products before choosing this one.  The reviews and ratings were all correct!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift, He says he loves it, clean shave, great mustache trimmer. likes the convenience as well</li>
    <li> The shave is very satisfactory. Not as close as with Gillette razor. The protective cap broke for some reason. I think the plastic is not as pliable and the marking on top is not that easily visible. I had a consultation with the customer service, she resolved the problem issue by sending another cap without charge. I have marked the cap&#x27;s inside with a permanent marker to remind me to slide it up and down. This could have been made with a better plastic material.</li>
    <li> Mediocre razor results and there was no bonus. I was replacing an old Norelco and should got the same brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband who is currently active duty in the US ARMY, he needs to be clean shaved at all times and has always had a hard time with regular razors due to his sensative skin, he loves this electric razor and said that it causes no irritation and a close shave</li>
    <li> great shave with the gel  when i use it as dry shaver i put a little talc powder on first</li>
    <li> I ordered this as  a Christmas gift for my Dad - he said this is better than any electric shaver he&#x27;s ever had.  Very close shave and very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it a fair rating.  It is slow and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, so far. I am still getting used to it.</li>
    <li> This works very good for me</li>
    <li> There is no shave in this package. It&#x27;s a lie! Don&#x27;t believe.&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is quite ... &#x27;under powered&#x27;. It takes time and effort to shave. In general there&#x27;s nothing that makes me feel satisfied, so 1 start. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the second one I bought!just as the details ,good quality and cheap price with the bonus listed worth of $12!</li>
    <li> very good shave,works and cleans up nice . just don,t push to hard or to long in one place you will get a raush ontill you learn the fell or the razor.a good purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband says this works well.  He especially likes that it catches the shavings so he is not chained to the front of door.</li>
    <li> My hubby says it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s gotten in years!  I usually buy him Braun shavers; but he says this is by far the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever owned and he&#x27;s owned many!  He now owns two, one he leaves at our camp.</li>
    <li> Item As Described works great...!</li>
    <li> Very quiet. I believe it is because of the steps needed to take in order for it to be waterproof. I was worried at first about people saying it might be under-powered, but if you open it up, turn it on and try to grab one of the drive posts you&#x27;ll find that the motor is definitely not weak. Takes a while to get use to. The circular motion method works well. The gel it comes with is a perfect fit. The shave is actually close... in the areas it gets. You will have to go over tge same areas more than once. Nothing can compete with a straight razor. That is the simple truth. Perfect if you want an electric razor without paying over $100. It works and everything, but its just a man toy.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband as an anniversary present and he loves it. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works, but sometimes takes multiple passes to get hair. Probably would not go this cheap again for my next razor</li>
    <li> Close shave, smooth action.</li>
    <li> LOOK GOOD AND GOT MY ORDER FAST&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> my husband was very pleased with the gift, it came fast in the mail, was a good price for what came with it and as he says no more razor burn from disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I replaced my existing Philips Norelco Triple Header because it was irritating my neck.  I was hoping that the New Philips Norelco would be non-irritating to my neck, but it isn&#x27;t.  Also, the Beard and Sideburns Trimmer should be sturdier so that it works well in both the up and down motions.  I like the triple header style electric shaver but find that this particular model could be improved upon.</li>
    <li> Shaves great easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> This shaver is incredible! i have used remington for years, but this razor ROCKS! I really enjoy the feeling and closeness of a wet shave!</li>
    <li> Very good razor! Very lightweight &amp; contours to all your curves and edges. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I had had one or two Norelco shavers in the past and was quite satisfied with them, so when I needed to replace the last one I ordered the closest model available. For the first few weeks it worked beautifully, but then, upon shaving, it began feeling as though individual hairs were being pulled out. A short time after that, I was repeatedly feeling this, particularly when shaving my throat. Upon looking in the mirror, I found four slightly bloody nicks. Rather painful. I have since gone back to my Braun with no further problems.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shaver that I ever had.  I&#x27;ve even tried braun 790cc!!  I&#x27;ve been using the creams and I feel like theres nothing on my  cheeks when you are done.  In fact my friends and family say that this makes me look a few years younger.  The cut is so small that it takes a while for when I need to shave again.  My face adjusted the first shave.  Also,  I accidentally dropped the shaver 2 feet from the table before I&#x27;ve got a to use it, and it still worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the creams seem very expensive and it takes away the price / value of the shaver when you get it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cream is very good.  But it might be better off if you get a higher end model without the creams, and get your own creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a few months.</li>
    <li> The purchase of this Norelco shaver was totally painless. Since this is a present we will have to await Christmas to see how well this grooming device will work.</li>
    <li> Compared to some of the more expensive brands, this is a good shaver. It holds its charge well and does a good job.</li>
    <li> THIS SEEMED TO SHAVE SMOOTHLY BUT LEFT A VERY PAINFUL RAZOR BURN AFTERWARDS. IT PULLS HAIRS OUT TOO! HATED THIS SHAVER. HOWEVER, I&#x27;M A WOMAN AND THOUGHT I&#x27;D TRY A HIGHLY RATED MENS SHAVER SINCE THERE ARE SO FEW SELECTIONS FOR WOMENS SHAVERS ANYMORE. THERE ARE 3 HEADED CIRCULAR WOMENS SHAVERS IN PRETTY COLORS TOO, SO I THOUGHT THERE MUST NOT BE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. THIS WAS MY 1ST TRIPPLE HEAD CIRCULAR BLADE AND MY LAST. JUST WAY TOO PAINFUL!!</li>
    <li> Works great.. I think... i bought it for my for wife to use on her legs. She very happy with it.Seen other reviews for women&#x27;s electic leg shavors. Women recommended getting a men&#x27;s electronic razor instead.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teen aged son. I did alot of research before deciding on this model. He is very happy with it. Says it works better dry without any shave cream.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Does not run while plugged in, as some customer reviews claim. It even has a pictorial sticker on the back explicitly indicating it doesn&#x27;t. That was the whole reason I bought this one--I wanted a shaver that could not run out of power during use. My fault for basing my purchase on customer reviews. But the product information didn&#x27;t specify whether it runs while plugged in.  I eventually figured out that that&#x27;s for safety reasons. This shaver is designed to be used in the shower and/or on a wet face, and of course if you try that corded, you&#x27;ll be electrocuted. I&#x27;m used to dry shaving and have no interest in shaving wet after taking a shower, so the selling point of this shaver is wasted on me. I chose the wrong model. But it shaves well enough dry, so I&#x27;m keeping it.  It&#x27;s better than my last shaver, the Norelco Sensotouch 1150X: a sensible design more similar to every other shaver I&#x27;ve had. But the shave? It isn&#x27;t clearly something I couldn&#x27;t have gotten just from replacing worn-out blades.</li>
    <li> The price on this item cannot be beat----the service is great----packaging was very adequate----Over  all I am very pleased with the item</li>
    <li> husband loves this item says it makes shaving much faster and easier!! easy to use and clean and soft on the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month now and look forward to a shave each day. I was a diehard blade user for over 20 years and never thought I would like an electric.&lt;br /&gt;If you go to electric, I highly recommend the wet shavers and a quality shave cream.  Takes a few days to train your face, but you&#x27;ll love it. I think this is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s as close as the blade was and the big plus is that I don&#x27;t have to buy those expensive blades anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for many years.  This shaver offers many benefits, i.e., the removable head, the cleaning feature with water, and the unique shaving heads for long and short hair cutting.</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything I expected and much more. I expected that it would give a good shave but not as fast or as close as it does. I did not want a shaver that cost over $70.00 and this hits the mark-very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The noise from motor is ok to use. I don&#x27;t have to care about the water when using it. The build is solid and fit, no water can go through it. Nice to have.</li>
    <li> Item was received on a timely bases.  Box was ripped and torn. Product look like it was tossed in the box with some paper cushioning all around. I have been in packaging for over 40 tears and I can tell you, no care was taken to protect an item of this size and weight. The Item had multiple dents and bends do to lack of protection and no information sheet as to how to assemble. If I had designed a package like this for shipment for Kodak or Xerox, I would have lost the account. Shame on you, I&#x27;m very disappointed as we wanted the popper for this weekend at our cottage. Now it&#x27;s on  the way back to you packed exactly like I received it.</li>
    <li> I had two Philips Cool Skin shavers before (with gels in small, inserted packages), and found the lotion-lubricated shave to be very smooth and comfortable. The Powertouch with Aquatec is even better. Although it requires applying the lotion beforehand, the ability to run the head under running, hot water, makes shaving especially comfortable -- even enjoyable. Lighter weight and new shape make this shaver the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Just OK. Not the best shave. You get a better shave with a blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, it does what it claims. Very decent unit and the extras that came with it made it a bargain</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth shave. It replaced a Remington shaver that was giving a painful shave. I have used Remington shavers for years but this one beat them all. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> best electric shave I have ever had</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father- in- law, he loves it . The best razor he&#x27;s had in years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my significant other&#x27;s son&#x27;s 18th birthday. He was a little worried about how comfortable of a shave it would be, but after his first use he was already raving about it. Four out of five stars because the trimmer on the shaver is mediocre.</li>
