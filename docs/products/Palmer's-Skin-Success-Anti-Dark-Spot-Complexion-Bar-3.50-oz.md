    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I due to my travelling job it is hard to find all the products I use at home so it was just so convenient to order a dozen of this. It helps with people who have oily skin. It is not bleach. It just gets rid of black heads and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
    <li> Great Soap. My wife loves it as well. Great product !&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend it to a household except infant.</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 years now. Never had a reason to complain. Be aware that it does not bleach your skin...It only makes you tone and even out your real color...so even if u are black, u can use this wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve started using Argan oil, not that it makes my face greasy or anything I just felt getting a good clean before helps. It does. This with argan oils helps to keep my skin in great condition.</li>

    <li> product as described. good quality- no complains. satisfied customer and will repeat order in the future. Would also refer to friends&lt;br /&gt;Have not experienced dryness or any discomfort. I enjoy the mild smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months now. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and makes my skin feel very clean without over drying it. I get best results when I use this with an exfoliating sponge. They stopped carrying it in the stores where I live, I love it so much I will buy it online. Haven&#x27;t found any other products that can replace it.</li>
    <li> Great Soap.. Smells Great. Love It</li>
    <li> Good and quick delivery.Item as described.Will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I will use. I have sensitive, oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out nor does it over dry or leave a residue. The scent is mild.</li>
    <li> Clean and clear face, acne get better&lt;br /&gt;as soon as the next day, always good products let you know fast when they are good, don&#x27;t wait to long for an expensive one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but the smell is awesome.  I washed my face with it, as well as my arms that get the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;, little red bumps and it seems the redness has lessened after just one use.  My face feels soft as well, although it burned my eyes, it seems to need more rinsing then my old face wash did.  I also used the Palmer&#x27;s face scrub with it, recommend that as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Palmer&#x27;s Complexion Soap for years and I loved it. For me it keeps my skin even. I have tried other complexion soaps before and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> I use this soap on my face , I have a very sensitive skin , and this soap makes my skin so soft , so I love the fact that I can buy it by the dozen , I will be buying it again</li>
    <li> Con: Drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Lightens the skin and pretty much stays that way for the most part...&lt;br /&gt;Does not bleach your hands.</li>
    <li> This the only soap I use. I have very sensitive skin. #perfect</li>
    <li> I have tried every brand imaginable, from drugstore, to department store to beauty store.  My daughter has acne, I have combination skin and this soap takes care of both. I usually don&#x27;t even bother with bar soap, but I took the reviews and recommendations and glad I did! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Came quickly thanks to PRIME 2day shipping. Works great. Hubby uses it too as its not soo LIGHTENing as it is a TONER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u are looking to LIGHTEN your skin, try another brand or use a lotion with this soap</li>
