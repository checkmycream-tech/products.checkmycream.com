      <li>Safe, chemical free, and effective.</li>
      <li>I love and use all of their products.  </li>
      <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion for about 2 years or more now</li>
      <li>My newest bottle came with a spray nozzle which works much better than pouring it out.</li>
      <li>It is more like an alchol spray that evaporates after rubbing in.</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion on the market that we have gotten results for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy residue on your hands.  </li>
      <li>This product is wonderful on my hands that tend to get dry and crack in the winter and gives me relief.</li>
      <li>I actually love the smell, it&#x27;s comforting and it disappears very quickly.</li>
      <li>This is the most comfortable winter I have ever had with my hands.  </li>
      <li>It has a very high glycerine content, so it is very effective as moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t leave ANY kind of residue at all on your skin - which is one of the reasons why I like it so much.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>One of the ingredients is camphor, and I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s what gives it the strong scent.  </li>
      <li>I have used Porter&#x27;s lotion for many years - it is great for dry skin and does to have an oilly feel.</li>
      <li>We had a product similar to this that worked great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, has no bells or whistles, is NOT oily or greasy and it works as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I happen to be a fan of the smell although I get that it isn&#x27;t something everyone will enjoy.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed it for several months and plan to continue for many more.</li>
      <li>Porter&#x27;s Original works great at relieving dry skin and cracks.  </li>
      <li>He loves it and says it works great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong smell but it goes away after it is absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural ingredients make it even better!</li>
      <li>It also works great when my skin is very dry and itchy.</li>
      <li>The thing you need to know is that it is a liquid, so if you&#x27;re trying to save your heels (and this will work, it absorbs quickly too)</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and stays on even after repeated hand washings.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the medicine smell, which goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>But this is an excellent product, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s got nothing weird in it.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my feet too, just love having soft skin again!</li>
      <li>Lotions heals it all right quick...</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s about as powerful of moisturizer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth</li>
      <li>I have been using it about 4 times a day without success.</li>
      <li>My wife is not crazy about its aroma.</li>
      <li>Porters lotion is simply the best at keeping your skin moisturised and free of dryness no matter how harsh the winter winds blow.</li>
      <li>(did I spell that right?)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply -- much easier than a traditional moisturizing cream -- and a squirt or two easily covers the whole body.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the product for the first time in December of 2010.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure,( maybe weather related in the midwest)</li>
      <li>I put it on at night, and wake up the next morning with healthy looking skin.</li>
      <li>I will continue to keep this on every sink in my house because it really does work very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The medicinal smell that goes away almost immediately is pretty much the downside...and--</li>
      <li>Love this product for supper dry skin.  </li>
      <li>and you can reach your back easily.</li>
      <li>This product is super for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I really  need to feel/see the difference, but this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
      <li>really isn&#x27;t a lotion, it&#x27;s a moisturizing spray.  </li>
      <li>It works really well on my cracked fingertips</li>
      <li>and I use this now instead of lotion on my whole body, including my face.  </li>
      <li>It is not really &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; but more like a spray.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have dry, itchy skin especially in the winter time as I do, this is not the product for you.  I am very disappointed with this product and due to my experience with this product, I&#x27;m wondering if the people who reviewed this product actually own it or work for the company.  I compared it with a much less expensive product that I already owned and it appeared to make my skin dryer than the other product.  This product is not only overpriced on the Amazon website but it does not do what it claims to do.  Will not purchase again and wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> A little antiseptic at first but the smell quickly dissipates and does not leave an oily residue.  Works great. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say?  It&#x27;s cheap, has no bells or whistles, is NOT oily or greasy and it works as advertised.  I have calluses (did I spell that right?) on big toes and heels with DEEP fissures.  Deep enough to become a health hazard.  Poured Porter&#x27;s (an alliteration for a skin product?) onto my toes and heel, put on socks and went on my way.  I&#x27;d repeat this at night and again cover with socks.    I saw improvement in two days and now, a month later, there&#x27;s NO improvement because there&#x27;s nothing TO improve.  The calluses are all gone.    I&#x27;d say \\&quot;Thank you Porter\\&quot; but he&#x27;s dead.    Oh, about the smell.  Everything I&#x27;ve read alluded to it without describing it.  Stop reading if you, too, wish to be surprised.      Still here?  One of the ingredients is \\&quot;something ammonium\\&quot;  There&#x27;s a hint of camphor and ammonia when first applied but the odder is slight and goes away almost immediately</li>
    <li> Porter&#x27;s Lotion is the best there is.  I have eczema.  My fingertips split open and bleed.  I have used many lotions over the years to no avail including expensive prescriptions.  Porter&#x27;s works where others have failed.  My skin is soft and feels wonderful.  It has a strong smell but it goes away after it is absorbed.  No sticky or greasy residue.  It absorbs quickly and stays on even after repeated hand washings.  I purchased the product for the first time in December of 2010.  This is the most comfortable winter I have ever had with my hands.  Porter&#x27;s is the miracle cure.  I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin and I used everything I could find. I have been using this lotion for about 2 years or more now and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I thought they sent me the wrong thing when I ordered it cause it is a liquid and I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it, but after a couple of times using it, I loved it!  I only have to apply it once a day and even my massage therapist noticed a huge difference and that my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and flaky anymore.   This product is worth the money, especially cause I buy it directly from porters.com and get the biggest bottle for around $40 and it lasts me about 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> This product is $12 in the manufacturer&#x27;s mail order catalog and $16 on this web site. How do you justify the Value Added by Amazon?</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I bouhg it while learning the art of magic at the Magic Castle in Hollywood. Magicians use this becuase it leaves your hands with a good about of traction (but not sticky). I use it all the time, not just for magic but as a hand lotion. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> It works extremely well for my 63 year-old hands, significantly better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and the scent is inoffensive to me and in any case not lasting.  A bottle goes a long way, since it requires only a few pumps per application, but I&#x27;m finally running low and just re-ordered.    With Amazon Prime and two-day free shipping, the delivered cost is still less than if ordered from Porter&#x27;s which adds more than half again the product cost for shipping.</li>
    <li> Best thing I HAVE EVER FOUND FOR SKIN WITH THOSE CRACKS THAT APPEAR IN YOUR HANDS IN THE WINTER THAT ARE SO PAINFUL.</li>
    <li> My mom turned me on to Porter&#x27;s over ten years ago and I have since never been without it. I&#x27;ve suggested it to many people since but none of them have ever seemed as enthusiastic. It must have something to do with skin type. I can only assume they don&#x27;t suffer dry skin as severely as I do which would make any relief they felt less spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I know for sure is I tried everything I could get my hands on before Porter&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t had to try another since.</li>
    <li> This Porter&#x27;s Lotion was recommended to me by a friend. Initially, I didn&#x27;t like it because of the smell. However, I kept trying it and I have a change of attitude about this lotion. It is effective. I put it on at night, and wake up the next morning with healthy looking skin. I recommend this product to anyone that like to look healthy and refresh.</li>
    <li> I must have tried everything there is for severe dry skin (and split fingers in the winter) until, at last, I found Porter&#x27;s Lotion. I also have allergic reactions to so many famous brands so I was quite sceptical to start with. I actually love the smell, it&#x27;s comforting and it disappears very quickly. I had dreadful split fingers every winter but within four days of using the lotion, they were on the mend. I have used Porter&#x27;s Lotion for 3 years and never had a split again. It&#x27;s also great on heels in the summer. Since then, I have loved using Sarah&#x27;s Leg Lotion from Porter&#x27;s - no more flaky, dry skin anywhere on my body! I can&#x27;t believe I had to wait 50 years to find this product. I use their face moisturiser and my husband uses their aftershave - he too suffered with dry skin on his face and in his eyebrows. You cannot imagine how grateful I feel.</li>
    <li> I have sufferedfor the last year of dry, peeling, cracked finger tips and hoping Porters Original Lotion would work.  I does not.  It smells like a pharmacy and does very little to add relieve.  I have been using it about 4 times a day without success.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The big thing for me was to find a lotion that didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with dry hands who dislike the oily, greasy feel of regular hand lotions.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this I was skeptical.  It&#x27;s the consistency of water and has a sharp, almost medicinal smell.  But having used it all winter I&#x27;m a convert.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply -- much easier than a traditional moisturizing cream -- and a squirt or two easily covers the whole body.  In a minute or so the smell is gone and so is any oily residue.   As someone who fights dry itchy skin all winter, it&#x27;s been a godsend.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the actual formula or the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to apply that I used it every day, but I haven&#x27;t scratched yet, through what was a rather long, cold dry winter here in NYC.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  P.S.  The scent doesn&#x27;t compete with cologne.</li>
    <li> This works really well on dry skin... even feet.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so medicinal.</li>
    <li> Really good.  Non-greasy.  Stopped my hands from cracking this winter.  Easy to apply.  My wife is not crazy about its aroma.</li>
    <li> The product is very good but the new style cap is very BAD!  Need to go back to the old style.</li>
    <li> This product is super for sensitive skin. Deliverable rash. Keeps skin moist but not greasy. Have used this product for several years. Always go back to Porters.</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  One of the best dry-skin lotions available.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion on the market that we have gotten results for extremely dry skin. This isn&#x27;t your typical lotion either. It&#x27;s a clear with a baby oil type appearance but the results are almost instant. Beats eczema almost within a day. Accutune users with very dry skin, this product is a must!  It&#x27;s natural ingredients make it even better!</li>
    <li> Porter&#x27;s lotion is the one if you want your skin to look moisturized all day!  It is unlike any lotion you have ever used...yet it works without any greasy feeling or sticky top coat.</li>
    <li> The product is very soothing and makes my skin feel revitalized. I have enjoyed it for several months and plan to continue for many more.</li>
    <li> It works really well on my cracked fingertips and if I use regularly I do not get cracked skin</li>
    <li> My husband is a fish biologist and this time of year his hands get so cracked and dry from working in the water and doing his other fish related duties.  We had a product similar to this that worked great but it ran out.  We searched everywhere and could not find a suitable replacement until this!  Porter&#x27;s Original works great at relieving dry skin and cracks.  Best of all its made in Montana!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but has a stringent which does sting a bit upon applying. I&#x27;ll need to see if they make a balm.</li>
    <li> It worked really good. I would recommend this for anyone that has dry skin. I would buy it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dry skin, especially on my legs.  I wanted to test it out to see if it really works.  I comes with a pump so you spray it on and rub it in.  The smell made my husband cringe, but I didn&#x27;t care if it worked.  So I used it on one leg twice a day for 3 days.  I&#x27;m not sure how much time I really  need to feel/see the difference, but this isn&#x27;t it.  Once it is on it feels a little smoother.  But after rubbing it on you have to wash your hands because they are sticky. (Kind of defeats the purpose I think.)</li>
    <li> ...and I have tried a LOT of lotions to alleviate my very dry and scaly skin: from the cheap Aveeno to the expensive Oil of Olay and Gloves in a Bottle.  Only Porter&#x27;s worked.  No greasy feeling.  The medicinal smell that goes away almost immediately is pretty much the downside...and--As one of the reviewers have mentioned--the dispenser is pretty awful.  Porter&#x27;s give you the spray cap or the shampoo-like dispenser caps because the consistency of the lotion is very thin, very watery...the problem is neither worked well; using the spray, well, sprays all over the place (my wife complains it makes the bathroom floor slippery); using the other cap makes a mess as well no matter how careful you are.     Barring those complaints, I believe Porter&#x27;s is the best lotion in the market today, that if they improve the dispenser/cap, it would be perfect.    BTW, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy through the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It smells like my dad, burns and fixes chapping. Every drop is a gift from the gods.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and it did not work for me</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin on my hands in Winter.  Porters is my new miracle.  My cracked, rough skin is starting to heal. This is the best cure I have found and I have tried many lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> Love this product for supper dry skin.  Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy residue on your hands.  Needless to say, it works so well that I&#x27;m not too bothered by the slightly medicinal smell or the fact that it&#x27;s a little messy.  The product is liquid and somewhat difficult to get where you want it without spilling a bit.  My newest bottle came with a spray nozzle which works much better than pouring it out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Not at all fancy and not even what you&#x27;d think of when you think of a lotion -- it more the consistency of a body spray -- but this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has cured the dry, rough skin on my elbows and heels. I can&#x27;t wait for short sleeves and summer sandals.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Porter&#x27;s Lotion \\&quot;spray\\&quot; (as I call it) for about 6 months.  I will continue to keep this on every sink in my house because it really does work very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really isn&#x27;t a lotion, it&#x27;s a moisturizing spray.  It has a very high glycerine content, so it is very effective as moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t leave ANY kind of residue at all on your skin - which is one of the reasons why I like it so much.  You will never stain your clothes from this.  But it is a liquid, not a true lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me is the scent.  One of the ingredients is camphor, and I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s what gives it the strong scent.  And it is strong!  But the scent will be gone within about a minute.  After that, it leaves no scent.  So it&#x27;s just temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this has worked so well sealing in the cracks in my hands during long winters.  When my skin is super dry, I will spray with Porter&#x27;s and add a lotion after it dries - that&#x27;s about as powerful of moisturizer as I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last benefit I&#x27;ve found - I&#x27;m currently pregnant, and one common symptom during pregnancy is the belly itching.  This spray works so well in stopping that itching.  Plus, it adds moisture, too, so it&#x27;s a two-fold benefit.  And it&#x27;s all-natural so there&#x27;s no concern for chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have used Porter&#x27;s lotion for many years - it is great for dry skin and does to have an oilly feel. I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have the same problem others have with cracks or fissures on my thumbs and fingers.  This lotion cured my hands of this problem.  I just love the lotion and the smell goes away after a bit.  I use it on my feet too, just love having soft skin again!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;While it smells medicinal, theres no denying its high quality. Porters lotion is simply the best at keeping your skin moisturised and free of dryness no matter how harsh the winter winds blow. Full of natural ingredients, it absorbs almost instantly into the skin. Try it - it obliterates the competition.</li>
    <li> Why bother with a cream that sits on your skin when this amazing lotion is available.  There is no stickiness and the lotion is especially good for freshly shaved legs.</li>
    <li> Porter&#x27;s Skin Lotion has been a staple of mine for many years. I have very dry skin and until I started using it, my hands and fingers would crack and be very painful. It just works!</li>
    <li> I love and use all of their products.  No chemicals and sweet smells that dry the skin.  Not oily but moisturizes!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> In the winter I sometimes develop dry, itchy skin on my torso.  This is usually following periods of extended outdoor physical activities.  When that happens I reach for this bottle of Porter&#x27;s.  It isn&#x27;t like any lotion I have ever used.  It is very thin and more the consistency of liquid aftershave.  It isn&#x27;t greasy in the least and it dries quickly.  Some reviews have referenced the medicinal smell and I think that&#x27;s a fair description.  I happen to be a fan of the smell although I get that it isn&#x27;t something everyone will enjoy.  Either way; it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised this works so well.  The first time I experienced this thin &amp;#34;liquid lotion&amp;#34; it was hard for me to imagine it could work as well as thicker brands.  For me it does and I prefer this to the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I am also a fan of the bottle design itself and don&#x27;t mind seeing it out on my bathroom counter year-round.</li>
    <li> Nothing like advertised.  Still have problems with my skin drying out and cracking.  Not worth the money in my book.</li>
    <li> If you think the word &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; means perfumed white cream, then this isn&#x27;t a lotion.  But I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;d call it. It&#x27;s a liquid, that smells sort of like your grandmother&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  And it is really beneficial for your skin.  Or at least it is for me.  I have very light skin, difficult and sensitive, both oily and dry, with acne my entire adult life.  I discovered this recently and I use this now instead of lotion on my whole body, including my face.  I think it helps my skin. I get less rashes and less acne when I use this.  I don&#x27;t mind the medicine smell, which goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Have been using this lotion for many years.Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use. Best lotion for my skin. It is not really &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; but more like a spray. It also works great when my skin is very dry and itchy. I buy 3 bottles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser my hands crack and bleed in the winter had used walgreens hand healer potion before but can&#x27;t get in store anymore. Did a search for ammonia based potion came upon Porters so glad I purchased. Yes it smells but not for long I use it three times a week before bed it removes the dry skin so my hands are not chapped use mosturizing hand balm the rest of the time no cracks also good for feet don&#x27;t use to often or can thin your skin</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the winter weather! It works on dry cracked feet as well! Love this product!</li>
    <li> My husband uses the Porter&#x27;s Lotion.  He loves it and says it works great for dry skin.  For the price, it must do a great job or he would not buy it!</li>
    <li> Product just as described, especially helps dry skin and cracked skin on fingers from cold weather. definitely recommend this lotion. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion as advertised. It is a spray clear liquid.  Very fowl odor would never use.  In other words,  it stinks</li>
    <li> Same results of no improvement-  I should give up on these products&lt;br /&gt;They do seem to help others, which is ok for them.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well, and as many reviewers said, the strong smell (which isn&#x27;t bad) disipates quickly.  The thing you need to know is that it is a liquid, so if you&#x27;re trying to save your heels (and this will work, it absorbs quickly too) you need to put a paper towel down when you apply it because it runs all over the place.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful on my hands that tend to get dry and crack in the winter and gives me relief.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe finger tip cracking in the cold weather.  I bought this as a last-ditch attempt to help my painful hands.  It works wonders--does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. It has a rather unpleasant odor for about the first 15 seconds after application but other than that, there&#x27;s no down side.</li>
    <li> This is not a hand &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;! It is a hand &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; that I love in the evening! It is more like an alchol spray that evaporates after rubbing in. Can&#x27;t say for sure,( maybe weather related in the midwest) but I did not have the cracked fingertips as often as I usually do in the winter!!!! My son in laws even grab &amp;#34;mother in law&amp;#34;s&amp;#34; Porter&#x27;s lotion when they are here!</li>
    <li> I have a very typical skin problem.  I&#x27;m middle aged and I get patches of dry and flaky skin - worse in the winter, but still there in the summer.  I&#x27;ve had some success with various products - Gold Bond has a dry skin cream that&#x27;s pretty darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys sent me one of their catalogs out of the blue, and I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s very effective - even better than the Gold Bond stuff.  Yes, it smells sort of turn of the last century medicinal, but that goes away pretty quickly (I like the smell, but I can see how people used to modern cosmetics and fragrance might find it odd).  It&#x27;s also not particularly greasy.  And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying that nothing works for everyone when it comes to skin care - kinda depends on what&#x27;s going on with your skin.  But this is an excellent product, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s got nothing weird in it.  It&#x27;s absolutely worth a try if you have a problem with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am a potter. My hands are rough. My thumbs crack in the winter and the backs of my hands chap painfully after a day of ceramic abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porter&#x27;s Lotions heals it all right quick... I mean, within the day if I apply it early enough. If you suffer from painful chapped, cracked hands (ever done too many dishes?), invest in this. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially in the summer when I don&#x27;t want to feel heavy thick lotion on my skin. Add a pump sprayer and you can reach your back easily. The smell may take some people by surprise, but it does dissipate and doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne fragrance. Safe, chemical free, and effective. Porter&#x27;s products are wonderful.</li>
