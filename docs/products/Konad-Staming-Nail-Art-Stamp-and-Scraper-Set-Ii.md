<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It actually works,  yay!</li>
    <li> Came fast and easy to use ! thank you</li>
    <li> Was very excited to try out my konad kit until I tried it and had no luck! This stamper doesn&#x27;t work! Returning this item. Starting to lose hope in this site...</li>
    <li> The scrapper is useless, it will just scratch your plates, it is really the stamper you want in this~</li>
    <li> Came when it said but I was under the impression it was two sided so I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very very good! Finally after all the research,  I got a good item. I will recommend it! It came pretty fast too!</li>
    <li> The stamp is wide and soft for easy application and I was worried that the metal scraper would scratch my plates, but no such problem! Cleanup is slightly harder than with the plastic scraper (lots of nooks and crannies for polish to get stuck in).</li>
    <li> Love it! Took me a bit to figure out why it wouldn&#x27;t work at first, but after I buffed it down it works awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching several videos on youtube about Konad stamping kit. I follow the instruction on how to use the stamp but it just would not pick up the nail color very well.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend mistakenly ordered this product for me and immediately emailed them letting them know he did not want to purchase the product and if they could please cancel the order. We did not hear back from them for several days and when we did they were a little rude in our opinion not professional at all. The money has still not been added back to our account. Reading the reviews I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with a design plate. It works absolutely great, however i will be buying a bigger one. this one seems to be a smaller stamp and scraper set, and i would like a bigger stamper.</li>
    <li> I like this stamp but not as much as the double side stamps. Overall, it&#x27;s just a one side stamp with an easy handle to hold onto.</li>
    <li> I like my stamper that I bought from the Konad store better. This one tends to not hold the polished decal like my other one does. (it peels even with buffering the stamper) This stamper has some sort of coating on the rubber. The scraper is good though.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my husband. Be sure to order Konad polish as well, while some other polishes work, most don&#x27;t do a great job. It is a little tricky to use and takes a few times to get everything on right, but if you are patient you will be wowed!</li>
    <li> the stamp work, the scraper should be in rubber not in metal so it would not leave scratched on the plate</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the stamper that was pictured, BUT it is VERY similar and it gets the job done! Works perfect, Five Stars!</li>
    <li> My favorite.... It actually works.</li>
    <li> Great price and works like a charm! I have had a blast stamping my nails. The scraper is not necessary though, as I have read that it&#x27;s better to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift. It is a good product for a great price.  I was very pleased that it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I DO LIKE IT. I LIKE THE QUALITY OF STAMPING THAT IS DOES VS MY OTHER STAMPERS. THE SALON EXPRESS STAMPER I HAVE CAN JUST BE THROWN IN THE TRASH IT COMPARES NOTHING TO THE KONAD.</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to get the hang of it but nail stamping ROCKS. you can find cheaper plates through Monster Bundle but don&#x27;t skimp on the stamp polish... buy Konad! Don&#x27;t give up... by the third round you&#x27;ll be a pro!</li>
    <li> Make sure you buff it a little bit so it has a better grip on the polish. After that it will work great.</li>
    <li> I love the Konad stamper I have a double ended one, but I ordered this because this is SUPPOSED TO BE set II and the Konad official website shows that item number with a white stamper and same with the image on here, but I got it from the seller Nail Beauty 4U and they sent me it in pink, I specifically ordered this expecting the white one, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I knew it would come in pink because I have the double stamper which is pink and its just about impossible to transfer full nail designs with pink colored polishes.</li>
    <li> I use mainly Kleancolor brand, which is a little on the thicker side.  This stamper and scraper work wonderfully.  I have used them for months with no issues.</li>
    <li> love it ease to transfer the stamping</li>
    <li> When I received it I was extremely misleading. I thought I would receive something a lot bigger than what I got</li>
    <li> Works great saves money</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, at first. The trick to being able to use is run the stamper 3 or 4 times over the course side of a nail buffer. Then clean it with acetone, then you can use the stamper as directed with any brand of polish. I was really upset when i first got it and it wouldn&#x27;t pick up the image. I&#x27;m happy with it now! :)</li>
    <li> I was expecting a white stamper and got another pink one.  Oh well, I can always use another stamper.  I would have liked a white one though. That was what I was after.  Now I have a couple of pink ones. I would have gave it 5 stars if it was white.</li>
    <li> This is a fun and easy, once you practice a few times, way to decorate your nails. I enjoyed this and it is holding up well to all my stamping.</li>
    <li> Best stamp for nail art in my opinion.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like it too.  prints the stamp too pale.  I don&#x27;t know if another brand would work better or not.</li>
    <li> This things is a piece of Sh...&lt;br /&gt;It is waste money. Never Never worked properly. I don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish just doesn&#x27;t adhere... !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is bad my gosh... Very bad... It is a real waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works well, it does what its made for. But I think it&#x27;s much more fun to hand paint on the nail but this is fun too. enough said</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the nail stamping so I was excited to find this so cheap as a first time user.  It worked flawlessly the first time I used it (I didn&#x27;t have to rub it with a file first like some reviews I read suggested to do).  It is easy to clean and works great!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a necessity if you want to use stamping plates. I love the stamper, gets the job done. They&#x27;re nothing remarkable, but you can&#x27;t use stamping plates without buying these. Definitely buy the Konad brand instead of something else though. Other brands have good stamping plates, but you can&#x27;t trust the other supplies they sell. When in doubt, go with the brand name.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered nail art stamping and after much reading of reviews and watching of YouTube, I chose to get the Konad stamper and scraper (even though I didn&#x27;t buy their plates - Shany!  Love!) because one reviewer on YouTube compared several stampers, and the Konad was obviously the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work really, really great. I have no issues or complaints at all.  Worked on the first try and every time - both the scraper and the stamper.  And for this price - win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned the color.  Mine wasn&#x27;t as pictured, either, but instead was dark pink.  Some color polishes were hard to see on it.  But I still don&#x27;t have a complaint about it - when I do my nails I wear reading glasses and use one of those freaky-bright Ott craft lamps, so I can still see even the more challenging colors well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, really thrilled with this set.</li>
    <li> At first I was really disappointed I couldn&#x27;t get the clear/white stamper, but after running into several scenarios where I wanted to stamp white onto my nails, I quickly understood why Konad had switched to the dark pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool set is so easy to use and easy to clean. Though I wouldn&#x27;t advise it, you could clean the stamper with your finger if you really wanted to. I&#x27;ve read reviews warning that the metal scraper was not effective, but I have had no problems with it. Maybe some people aren&#x27;t cleaning it often enough? I clean mine once per hand. It has not left scrape marks on my metal plates either, so that&#x27;s great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part of using the nail stamper is predicting where the pattern will start on your nail. I&#x27;ve done a few different patterns now, and I&#x27;m getting the hang of it. I think part of the trick is getting the pattern close to one of the stamper&#x27;s edges rather than aiming for perfect center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this set to a few friends now. People don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them I didn&#x27;t use those stick-on patterns from Sally Hansen! :D Would recommend this set to anyone who likes doing their nails.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other stamp!</li>
    <li> This item is such a needed tool. I actually never liked the scrapper and used an old gift card but the stamper was perfect!</li>
    <li> Super cute idea for nails!!!  Konad makes nail art nice and easy and for a great price and good quality product!</li>
    <li> I have loved Konad for years. I never used the smaller one on the old stamper. And, a tip---if you pull the rubber out of the stamp it works much better. For me anyway. I bought a generic kit, but the stamper wasn&#x27;t NEARLY as good at Konad. Always use Konad for stampers. I wish the scraper was easier to clean, but otherwise, love this!</li>
    <li> took the girls some time to get the hang of it.  worked ok once they figured it out although they don&#x27;t use it much anymore.</li>
    <li> Ok... so I purchased a different set before but not this brand (KONAD), didn&#x27;t work well at all and I thought I was doing something wrong. Once I got the KONAD brand, it&#x27;s been nothing but fun! It works great, perfect little stamping! Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent , first I bought another brand and it do not wok, I was very really disappointed, but I gave me another chance and I buy this and is excellent , now I do magnificent creations</li>
    <li> love it and it is worth the price and its not even that much just to let the customers that buy this you do not have to have the special polish for it I find sally Hansen and sinful colors work great as well and it isn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
    <li> This product was great!  Love It!  It works quite well.  Thank you for making such a quality product. It is really great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, delivery was quick</li>
    <li> The metal swipe scratched my metal disks.  Was very upset about that.  they need to improve that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;The item was not worth the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> Junk, cheap, never worked, my lady thought she wanted it until she tried it, waste of money, wouldn&#x27;t buy another</li>
    <li> i use this all the time!&lt;br /&gt;my mom bought me another set from ross, but that one isn&#x27;t as awesome as this one. it scrapes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my plate like the other one does. Highly recommend this product &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;+ Konad is amazing! anything by them is highly recommended</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use, simple and complies offered by the manufacturer. Leave a good finish on nails and allows a wide variety of figures on the nails.</li>
    <li> I have Konad stampers that are red, and it is difficult to see red or pink polish on them when stamping.  I thought this was going to have the white pad to erradicate this issue, but came in the usual red/pinkish color.  As far as the tool is concerned, it works great! I have used it several times (as well as the scraper), and it is comfortable to hold.  I would recommend as a stamping tool, but may not be white as pictured...</li>
    <li> Does not do what I thought it would but I do not use it very often.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it works good. I have small nail beds and this is even big for them although it looks small. I like it.</li>
    <li> I like it because it worked much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It scraped the excess polish away and left a complete image on the stamp which transferred well to the nail,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like using the Konad Stamping Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set...after practicing and practicing I was still unable to get my designs to look good to me. I&#x27;m pretty crafty/handy so it baffled me as to why I couldn&#x27;t achieve the look I saw in some of the videos. I gave it to my Grand-Daughter to play with. I would recommend it, maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck!</li>
    <li> It does not work as advertised. when you apply polish to the stencil it does not work as is should as per instructed</li>
    <li> As ordered. Don&#x27;t use the scraper. It will scratch the metal discs. Use a credit card instead. The stamper is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and works fine, BUT CHANGE THE PICTURE ALREADY, SELLER. There probably hasn&#x27;t been a single person that received the white bottom stamper. So change it. We like to get what we came here for.</li>
    <li> This stamper and scraper set works very well and is a good basic set, however the actual size of the stamper isn&#x27;t exactly obvious from the picture. It&#x27;s actually a very small set that leaves a lot to be desired. For basic stamping this set is still very useful.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This one got the job done more than \\&quot;Salon Express\\&quot; which is what I originally bought for my nails and first things first the things I love about this is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t Scratch the plates&lt;br /&gt;2. Picks up the polish&lt;br /&gt;3. The rubber parts it has don&#x27;t fall off like the Salon Express&lt;br /&gt;4. Cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;5. Scraper Actually works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely tossed out my old scraper.</li>
    <li> The stamp is really easy to use and I find the size to be perfect for me. I really didn&#x27;t like the scraper, it tends to scratch the plates. I use a old plastic gift card instead and get much better results. Even though I don&#x27;t like or use the scraper, I found the set to be worth the price for the stamper</li>
    <li> Coming from a house full of girls- loving these products!</li>
    <li> This the best stamper I have used! It small, but easy to handle. The scraper is hard to clean, but it works great if you don&#x27;t mind the fact that the black polish doesn&#x27;t come off completely. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the quality of the stamping.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, I got this for my niece and was so embarrassed when she opened it and tried using it with her friends IT DID NOT WORK! It does however work if you scrape it with a flat blade which is dangerous for an 11 yr old.</li>
    <li> you are better off buying the one at Walgreens, at least you can use your own nail polish and actually see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use and great to help stamp my nails. It is awesome, I loved it and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this set and a set of 25 decorative plates because I didn&#x27;t need the nail polish sold together in a different set.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Remember to file (with a nail file) the silicone stamp before using, so that the nail polish adheres to it, and it&#x27;ll work great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult because the nails have to be dry before applying.  When you do nails, you have to make sure the 2 coats of polish are cured or it dents in the nail</li>
    <li> I would have to say that the stamping set is ok...it doesn&#x27;t always pick up all colors idk why...and the scraper scratches the plates really bad...Ive been using an old credit card like everyone has recommended..</li>
    <li> Love this stamper and scraper.  The stamper picks up nice clean and crisp images.  However, I wish it was larger.  I have large nail beds so I have to use this stamper when I&#x27;m doing smaller images.  Love, love, love the scraper.  It&#x27;s the only one I use, and I own 6-8 scrapers.</li>
    <li> This little set is all you need to get started with nail stamping, except for the plate.  Only caution, and this isn&#x27;t a flaw: if you plan to stamp in white or silver, you may want to consider the double ended stamp.  The white surface of this stamp makes it tough to see the paint you&#x27;ve picked up from the plate.  It works great with darker colors, pink or red (which is hard to see on the double ended stamper due to its hot pink surface).</li>
    <li> I havent receive my item,i will like to know what happen</li>
    <li> When I first got the stamper I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. So I looked up some tips and found out that it helps of you take a coarse nail file across the stamper so it picks up the polish. Also, run the scraper over the stencil a few times but not to hard, then stamp it fast before it dries. Certain nail polishes don&#x27;t stick as well so I had to play with it some. Don&#x27;t give up!</li>
    <li> I must admit I had serious doubts about this product working, but I watched several youtube videos and thought I would give it a try, not really expecting much of anything!  It works beautifully!  I can not tell you how many people think that I have had my nails done at a salon.  I get complements on them where ever I go!  I love the set and have found that I can use the tools with a variety of different nail polishes!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I watched all kinds of youtube videos on this to see if it worked and I saw that it did, I really really wanted it. So I put it on my wishlist and someone bought it for me! It is really easy to use and I would def. recommend to anybody who loves girly things like this!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stamper. I feel like it works much better than the double stamper. It was not white but that is ok. I will purchase a white one later. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the most important part of the nail stamping technique. I am glad I didn&#x27;t skimp and buy a knock-off brand for the stamper and scraper. This one was cheap but great quality. I bought 2 so that my sister and I could each use one. They are great. buy a couple for a back-up, or in case you have a stamping party with girlfriends. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this with an order of nail plates. As this is need to use the nail plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this stamper and scraper set out of the others because of its shape. I honestly tough it was bigger then what I got, but the size is perfect for my hands. I was unsure if it was safe to use a metal scraper for fear i would scar the plates. It dose, however it doesn&#x27;t destroy the plates, it makes very light scrapes that make the plates look used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While messing around with the stamper and cleaning it,the rubber peace fell of. I but it back with my hand and it worked like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its a good set that has both the stamper and scraper.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic and rubber tip are easy to clean with a little nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scraper could be better.&lt;br /&gt;Scraper is hard to clean.</li>
    <li> I love this stamper! It works great every single time.</li>
    <li> Best stamper I have.  I&#x27;ve tried many, trust me.  And this one transfers the best.  Only two issues.  First, I wish they would make the scraper fully plastic.  I hate the metal edge as it scratches my plates all up!  NO idea why Konad insists on using that metal edge.  So that means that I have to buy a separate scraper.  Irritating.  Then, I wish that they would make the same stamper in white.  There are colors, such as pink and red, that are VERY hard to see on this stamper.  So when you are trying to place the image on your nail, if you are using red or pink...GOOD LUCK!  It is impossible to tell if you have it straight and it typically goes on crooked...and you have to start all over again.  If you take your time in order to discern the image placement, it is too long and the polish dries and doesn&#x27;t transfer.  Other than those two issues, it is a fabulous stamper that works the best on the market that I have found [in 3 years of stamping!]</li>
    <li> Stamper needed to be primed (learned from YouTube), Scraper scratches plate, but over all happy with product.</li>
    <li> Great love this stamper. I ordered two for backipscand they arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> This product I found very easy to use as was described. As for the talent part that takes time as with all artistic skills. I found it easy to clean when using it and used regular nail polish remover to clean it with. I also used an old tooth brush with the regular nail polish remover to get any residual nail polish left in the plate design out. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Stamper works great but the scraper the polish get stuck in, its better just to use an old credit card!</li>
    <li> The scraper is ok, but eventually it does scratch the plates. I think a lot of that is mostly the amount of pressure on applies to the scraper against the plates. However it does serve its purpose. I filed my stamper and cleaned it with acetone (as suggested in other reviews) and it works so well. Even with polishes that are not initially for stamping!!!! I am so in love!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I thought I was buying the double ended stamper like people have been posting in the review but I got a single ended mini  stamper about the size of my thumb. ... Well see how this goes but very disappointed that is not the double ended stamper.</li>
    <li> It still works the way it is supposed to.  But I would have much preferred the white pad on the stamper.  I got the usual red pad from Konad.  But I&#x27;m still happy with it and it works well.  I actually thought that this was a 2-way stamper when I ordered it, but it wasn&#x27;t.  Even so, it didn&#x27;t say that it was a 2-way stamper in the description, it was just a hope.</li>
    <li> This is a really good buy! I am so happy that I got this. Really easy to clean by the way. On the stamper just rub your bare finger over it, and the left over polish just peels right off, &amp; on the scraper just take a cotton ball covered with polish remover, and it comes right off. I also, bought the Konad Image Disc with the cheetah, zebra, lace, &amp; diamond print with 3 flowers. Read my review on it tooo.(:</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, muy buen vendedor!!! I loveeee productos  Mi hermana me compró algunos el verano pasado y los utilizo casi cada vez que hago mi jaja uñas</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 years ago and it still works as if it came in the mail today. I love all of the quick and cheap options it gives my manicures. There hasn&#x27;t been a time when I sported the stamps that other ladies weren&#x27;t blown away. Such a simple product and it makes me look like I do nails for a living.</li>
    <li> Stamp transfers design well. Scraper works well but scratches metal plates</li>
    <li> This does take a little practice (like a few hours of my frustration) before it starts looking really, really cool-Keep in mind, though, that I&#x27;m a perfectionist, so it may take you much less time to be satisfied. This tool is awesome!</li>
    <li> it is very easy to use i love it. I bought is as a gift also for a family member which she uses it allot because she is a nail technician and it make her work much easier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because product itself is good but it&#x27;s not as pictured. I needed one with a white stamp on it just like it&#x27;s pictured here. What I received is pink. I already have 2 double ended pink ones. I contacted the seller (Pink Nails) to see if they have any white. If they don&#x27;t this is going back. Amazon, please update this picture to reflect the correct color.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as pictured and described.  I am very happy with the product.  I received it a couple of days after ordering it.  I have not used it yet, so I may change my mind about it AFTER using it.</li>
    <li> i bought this stamper and it was not as pictured but it was still worth it.  hopefully you read the reviews before you purchase because you definitely have to take your course nail file to the rubber on the stamp to get the images to stick other wise you wind up with a smeared image!.  the scraper works great and so does the stamper after i filed it. :) happy stamping!</li>
    <li> stamper works great! A lot of people complain online about the scraper scratching their plates and it does put fine lines in them. I haven&#x27;t noticed an impact on the design however. I have tried to use a plastic gift card technique that a lot of people swear by without success. The metal scraper just works the best.</li>
    <li> I tried this four different times and it would not pick up the design or even the nail polish. Completely useless.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery but the stamp looked different it was pink instead of white. Cant wait to try it! Heard great review about it.</li>
    <li> It does the job well, even with regular nail polish.  However, the softer plastic part pops out of the handle.  I even tried using super glue, but it has popped out again.  Luckily it&#x27;s pretty easy to pop it back in.</li>
    <li> This set is great I did not get what was pictured but I got a great one anyways.  The scrapper has two sides which scrap slightly different so it works with each stamp. For the price it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Actually retains the shape very well and the application putting it on the nail was simple. I like the wide stamp, as you can easily cover longer nails and/or wider area of the thumb.</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I expected, but works well. The price is good and delivery time was fast. Just wish it was a bit bigger or double ended.</li>
    <li> You have to have just the right nail polish to have this stamp work right.  The polish needs to be a little thicker than most.  When you have the right nail polish this works great, otherwise you will not be as happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Not so good polish does not stick very well to this product I would not buy this again. NOT GOOD</li>
    <li> I got one of these in a little set from the dollar store but nothing there is made well there so I bought this one and it works so much better!!!</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve gave it a 5 but I didn&#x27;t get the stamper I wanted. I saw mixed reviews but it was the cheapest one so I thought I should risk it. It&#x27;s NOT NOT the same stammer as the display! The rubber piece is in PINK and NOT CLEAR!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  She loves stamping her nails. Every few days she has another design.  She said this is the best stamper she has used so far; and she has used many!  She likes their (Konad&#x27;s) nail polish for nail stamping because it is thick and doesn&#x27;t dry too fast.  They have great nail products. I recommend purchasing this stmper and scraper if you&#x27;re into nail stamping.</li>
    <li> I tried many different polishes including the special polishes made for stamping. I even took the advice and used a nail file to roughen up the surface of the stamper. Still nothing...</li>
    <li> I love this. it is really easy to use and looks like it is professionally done. You can also order different plates for different designs. it leaves you nails looking professional done!! and is is quick! :)</li>
    <li> I appreciate that the Stamper/Scraper worked very well.  However, I would appreciate it more if the bottom of the stamper was the translucent white that the picture of the product shows.  I got one with a dark, hot pink bottom.  If I were to use pink or a red-related stamping polish with this stamper, it would be hard for me to work with because it would be difficult to see.  Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you&#x27;re a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  Don&#x27;t let this discourage you from getting it, it&#x27;s still a well-working product.</li>
    <li> This is great, I can use it to decorate my nails I love it. Totally worth the money!! It makes nail decoration so easy.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time as promised. My daughter really enjoys it, however I find it difficult to use consistently.  You also need to order the disks to extract the image.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stamper and scraper even though it has some less than satisfied reviews. I thought the price was decent for the product and I wanted to give it a try. I&#x27;m new to stamping so I don&#x27;t have any product biases, I just wanted something that was going to work. I used the stamper as soon as it arrived with the plates that I orderded. It picked up the polish (which was just some cheap grocery store polish) and applied it to my nails without any issues. I had read some reviews that suggested lightly filing the stamper to better pick up nail polish; however, I haven&#x27;t needed to file the stamper, but I believe it&#x27;s a good tip and if I have any issues in the future I will be sure to give it a try. The scraper is exactly that, a scraper. Just apply some pressure and slide it over the design to scrape away the nail polish, works fine for me. Overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product, it does what it is intended to do and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this konad stamper with the hopes it would be as the picture shows having a white stamper on the end. Today i got my stamper and its not white at all its pink and only one sided. Works well i already own a pink sided stamper . Pretty sad it was not a white one but over all works like it should. Three stars because it was not exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Bought this a month ago and i think i like it better than the MASH stamper.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that stamper was the same color as it shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;But PINK color was fine &amp; cute:) All in all I LOVE using it &amp; i recommend it. Planning to get the other KONAD stamper too, just to add in my nail collection.</li>
    <li> Very good  stamping grabs all my stamps when stamping is lil but its good for me cuz I got small hands but very good quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and found this to be very easy to use.  It would be nice if somehow it could be clear so you could more easily line up the design but I&#x27;m sure with practice It will get easier.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I just need to practice more.  Other&#x27;s tips very helpful</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s name brand and functions pretty simple. It really can&#x27;t do any wrong can it? It&#x27;s cute and pink and it works just fine. I got the double ended one too so i can aim better when doing smaller stamps because this one if biggish for tiny decals. Over the years, the silicone pad can go in a little far when pressing down but nothing that makes it function terribly. No complaints here really.</li>
    <li> This works extremely well!! Ive had a bad past with these! They NEVER work! BUT! This one works perfectly! The way its suppose to!</li>
    <li> A must have if you are going to stamp your nails with the Konad stamping plates, or any other stamping plates you have.  It&#x27;s a great tool for your nail art collection, as well.</li>
    <li> Love the stamp and scraper, works great.</li>
    <li> Love! I use this all the time!</li>
    <li> Stamper is very easy to use &amp; just clean it up with some nail polish remover &amp; it&#x27;s ready to use again. Love how small it is &amp; now my nails look awesome without having to go to an expensive nail salon.</li>
    <li> Great stamper!  The rubber is soft and pliable, leaving a nice smooth image.  The scraper is really unnecessary, as you get the same effect (or better) from a hotel room card or a used gift card.  Plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning the scraper.  After a few uses, I just throw away the gift card!</li>
    <li> Both are in very good condition and made well. My daughter and I had no problems using these or cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and now she can&#x27;t live without it. Now everyday she has a new design on her fingers.</li>
    <li> At first I had a problem with not being able to get the whole image to transfer to the stamp but I was given a good tip, which was to gently file the stamp with a fine grit file and clean it with acetone, and now I no longer have that problem. It works great! The scraper is good but sometimes I feel its a little too abrasive and I worry that it may scratch the plate up so I just use an old credit card.  It may just be the metal on metal sound, but I don&#x27;t want to take any chances.</li>
    <li> LOVE the squishiness of this awesome stamper. I get a super clear stamped image on the full nail with this stamper. It is my must have product for nail stamping now. Super easy to clean up as well. Highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Came quick and easy to clean.. and easy to use... I love the grip you get on this stamper... it is effortless to use</li>
    <li> I ordered this twice from two different sellers and both times received the pink not white stamp.  I&#x27;m going to order directly from Konad&#x27;s website for the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works great. If you apply top coat before stamping you can easily erase a mistake without having to redo your manicure. Don&#x27;t be shy about getting polish on your skin for full nail designs. You can&#x27;t align properly without going outside the nail. I tried with regular and stamping nail polish and it does make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> The product itself is GREAT! I only gave it 3 stars because the picture on the site was different than what I received in the mail. I ordered this stamper because the stamp portion was WHITE in the picture so I could see the images on the stamper when I used red and or pink polishes. UNFORTUNATELY, the stamp portion on the one I received is RED.... So it makes it difficult to see the images :( Otherwise, it is a GREAT product! If it was clear like the image presented I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> the stamper works great and i use a old credit card or gift card to scrap. i dont care for the scrapper. but all in all it was worth the money for the stamper. :)</li>
    <li> Love the konad for all my stamping needs. It&#x27;s just perfect for stamping. Recommend anyone to buy this product you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this stamper.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but since it is a Konad product, I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine.  However, I specifically ordered this because I wanted a stamper with a white rubber end so it would be easier to stamp with red or pink polishes.  What I got was one with a deep pink rubber end.  Not thrilled about that.  I like to get what I ordered - not what someone else thinks I should have ordered.</li>
    <li> Okay, this is honestly amazing. I love how when transferring the design from the plate, to the stamp to the nail, it makes absolutely no mess at all! And there is nothing left on the actual stamper after the design is transferred onto the nail. It is so neat and wonderful. Plus, the scraper works perfectly and leaves exactly what fills the design. Brilliant job!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t stamp very well, I&#x27;m disappointed. The design comes out messy and I tried using different kinds of nail polish too....still stinks. It&#x27;s sitting on my table collecting dust...</li>
    <li> This stamper works a lot better than the Salon Express Stamper. It works great actually. Picks up the images without any hassle. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not white/clear as pictured. It&#x27;s pink. I read Konad has discontinued the white one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scraper, I was concerned it would damage the nail plates but it doesn&#x27;t at all. The Salon Express scraper actually scraped my nail plates pretty badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother starting out with any other Stamper and Scraper set. Save your time and money and get a Konad. It really is the best.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but I just think its to small...I can&#x27;t get grip on it while I&#x27;m stamping...:(.. But other than thT it works great and if the stamper was a little bigger....it would be PERFECT !!!!:)</li>
    <li> I used this for my first time stamping and this was great. I used it with Cheeky plates and it transferred perfectly. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> These work great. I mean I didnt have to buy the Konad brand but I do like it and use it a lot</li>
    <li> This stamper works great!!!! I didn&#x27;t even have to prime it. I just opened the package and used it and it picked up the image perfectly. One thing to keep in mind about this stamper is that the stamper head is soft, so if you press it hard on the stamping plate it wont pick up the complete image. Lightly press the stamper on the stamping plate and it would pick up the image perfectly. The stamper head is not XL but since my nails are not that long, it works for me fine. It also stamps the image on the nail pretty well, but you have to be quick, otherwise the polish dries on the stamper and image is not transferred on the nail completely. I use a plastic card to scrape off excess polish on the stamping plate , so I havent used the scraper, but the stamper is great. Five stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars simply because the metal blade will scratch the image plates if you press too hard.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use! I use it on myself and my girls and its makes our nails look like we just came from the salon! Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much more difficult to use than I expected. But that is user error I&#x27;m sure. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. It&#x27;s bright pink so I haven&#x27;t lost it yet, which is a bonus? I think it&#x27;s mocking me though.</li>
    <li> some of the stamps work great, and some don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works very well when you stamp. The only problem I have is that the picture shows the rubber part in white (that&#x27;s why I bought this one) but they sent it in pink. I think white would have been nicer to use.-- It does work great &amp; I have the extra large plates that I use this with.</li>
    <li> So, I have tried the fing&#x27;rs stamper, the salon express one and this konad stamper. Konad is by far the more superior choice. Had I known that, I would have just started with this set. I was able to stamp all my nails in a matter of minutes. Both of the other stampers I have I had to file. This one worked without any prep work. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s really not that much more expensive then any other stamper/scraper set. It pretty much pays for it self after once use. Yes like other reviews have said it is the stamper with the pink stamping end. It makes it hard to see if you are stamping with pink but not impossible. From now on when it comes to stamping I&#x27;m sticking with konad products!</li>
    <li> Transfers fast and easy, good images transfer great and strong. Very easy to clean. I don&#x27;t personally use the scraper I use an old giftcard</li>
    <li> The Konad stamper was not what I imagined it to be, it was extremely too small. I thought from looking at the image it was bigger in size, but to my surprise when it arrived it was tiny, not to be mean but if I was one of those consumers who always return items I would&#x27;ve sent this back immediately</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the konad nail art set. I always have my nails painted and this gives it that extra piece to make them look like they were done in a salon.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I like that its not too big so it could be handled very easily. I also love the plates. The designs are amazing. Love the variety</li>
    <li> Works great and item is exactly as described</li>
    <li> The price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok  ok ok</li>
    <li> The main reason I ordered this is because I wanted a stamper that wasn&#x27;t pink. When I&#x27;m stamping in pink or red, the design is really hard to see. Unfortunately what I got was pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I like this design better than the double ended stamper or the stamper/scraper combo, so I guess as far as Konad stampers go, this is as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> ive seen these before and i heard konad is the best. ive been trying to get into nail art since going to a salon is so expensive now a days. if i have the talent, why not try it myself? well, talent or not, i cant seem to figure out why i cant transfer the images off of my discs onto this stamp. ive googled it and followed youtube videos but its just not working for me. i know time is of the essance with this and if you dont act quick, the nail polish dries leaving you having to start from square one again. ive cleaned it with nail polish remover before application, tried filing the stamp with a file, and tried different types of polish. no dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought all the right tools and stuff i just cant figure it out. i may just need more pacients i suppose.&lt;br /&gt;i gave this 3 stars only on my experience because maybe im too much of a n00b to figure it out. but hey, if it works then it works. im sure it does 0.o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> It not white like the one I saw on line its pink all over there wasn&#x27;t a white stamping part at all which is hard to get the image transfer over the nail although I did used my special polish from Konad brand too.  It not like I never know how to used this stamping kit before I did too I been a manicurist for while I know how the product support to worked okay so trust me if you want cheap that is the cheap result I saw and I&#x27;m not intend to waist my time and wast my money from know on and go to real beauty supply store that we all known and trust even the price will be higher but @ least I am happy with the product I &#x27;ll purchase hope this help.</li>
    <li> I love this stamper and scrapper gets the job done delivered quick easy to use other then the scrapper scratching your plates but thats ok cuz it doesnt mess up your image anyway would deffinetly recommend</li>
    <li> I find that i need to use a nail filler to rub the top of the stamp so the image can stick better. Its not that easy. I have to push down pretty hard. Sometimes the image wont come off the stamp. I just gotta get the hang of it. Not giving up tho.</li>
    <li> I got this to try my hand at nail stamping. This product is easy to use and simple to clean.</li>
    <li> The Konad scrapper is great. The scraper that I got from my Express Salon scraper is not a good at all. So I purchased a Konad one and love it.</li>
    <li> I love the stamper part of this set on the fence on the scraper. They work really well though I just have a different scraper that is my favorite. However this Konad stamper is my first grab when stamping.</li>
    <li> I know konad is the stamping original but their stamper is by far the least impressive one I own. I will not even comment on the scraper except to say .. if you want scratched up plates .. go for it. The stamper does work .. I have just found several that work far better.</li>
    <li> I did not get the product that was pictured, I got something like it but the stamp bottom was not white like the picture. The stamp bottom was dark pink. It did not bother me much but when I get something, I expect it to be like the one pictured, otherwise this product would have got a higher rating because it performed okay. I had trouble getting the stamp to show up clearly but other than that, it worked okay.</li>
    <li> After doing nail art for over a year and buying many different types of stampers, this is the one I keep coming back to.  Small and easy to use--it&#x27;s perfect for the beginning stamper. Definitely my favorite. The only problem is when you use red or pink stamping polish for an image.  It doesn&#x27;t show up too well. :)</li>
    <li> Not my favorite stamping tools!</li>
    <li> I had one of these before, but I misplaced it so I got another.  I like konad products, they are fun to work with.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! was very pleased with this item...had never done anything love this with my nails and someone told me how and told me rhetorically brand to get....i nailed it the first try ever using it...love it! And inexpensive also!</li>
    <li> Its a good product, it came in fast.  I gave it 4 stars because is not the easiest thing to use for people like me without experience. I used a nail file to take the shinny away, and it still wasn&#x27;t working.  It turns out I had to do the whole process super fast and you cant press as hard.  I wish it came with more instructions.  Also the scraper scratches the plates, so I used an old plastic card. But after many trials, it finally worked.  Looking forward to more stamp designs!!</li>
    <li> I thought it was double sided but it&#x27;s not. However it still works great even after a few stampings. And it is pink - some reviewers thought it was a white one.</li>
    <li> This set was new...came in the package. The quality of Konad, of course, is good (: These are definitely very useful tools.</li>
    <li> Konad is the best brand of nail stamp kits. Just rough up the rubbery end with a nail file and you&#x27;re all set to stamp!</li>
    <li> You have to get this stamper if your going to stamp nails!!! I have 2 other knock offs and they are horrible. I was about to give up on stamping until I used the real Konad stamper!</li>
    <li> Does just what you need it to do.  I would recommend cleaning off the stamper after each nail though or else it doesn&#x27;t come out as clean.</li>
    <li> this is an easy way to have great nails, works phenomenal, just as they said. i highly recommended. very easy to use</li>
