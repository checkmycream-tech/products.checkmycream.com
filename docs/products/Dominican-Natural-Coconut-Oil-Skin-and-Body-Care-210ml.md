      <li>Love this product and super fast service!!!</li>
      <li>I now use Dominican Coconut Oil on my entire body and my skin is well moisturized and very healthy!  </li>
      <li>This is a cheap oil.</li>
      <li>Nice soft smell of coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>but i say it is true stuff.</li>
      <li>I am a true believer that nature has a cure for everything.  </li>
      <li>My 2 boys love it so much that I had order another one just for them.</li>
      <li>May smell good, but its far from pure.  </li>
      <li>if you use to much it does have a strong coconut smell.</li>
      <li>I was using a different kind b4</li>
      <li>Is not greasy at all, lasting moisture (especially when applying right after shower time), smells really good too!</li>
      <li>Came right on time.</li>
      <li>Very soothing, and the antimicrobial benefits of organic coconut oil make this a safe and natural choice.</li>
      <li>and I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I use it on my entire body and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When used under moisturizer, my face feels soft and looks smooth &amp; dewy.</li>
      <li>first, I thought that I didn&#x27;t like the smell but in time, whatever smell there is, goes away.  </li>
      <li>It is light and keeps my skin soft all throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>first used this product in the Dominican.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I love it and as long as it is made I will buy it.</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong scent, which is another plus, but just enough to make you think of the beach.  </li>
      <li>the stuff is pure</li>
      <li>I decided to take matters into my own hands, studied natural cures for dry skin and discovered coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>it really helps alot....</li>
      <li>i just donc&#x27;t like all the oil uou have on your hands when you put some on its very runnie .</li>
      <li>haha  </li>
      <li>My wife says she really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like this oil.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes you whole body very well.</li>
      <li>Still goes on the skin very well and absorbs into the skin without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>and it keeps my skin soft all throughout the day, even in hot weather.</li>
      <li>body oils at the dollar store have mineral oil as main ingredient too (for example).  </li>
      <li>Within 3 weeks my hands were completely healed.  </li>
      <li>Soft coconut scent.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>naturally has vitamin e</li>
      <li>so be careful you wash your hands right after you use it an Donc&#x27;t rub your eyes.</li>
      <li>As someone who has been to the Dominican several times every time I use this im reminded of the island, the smells and the soft skin from using there oils.</li>
      <li>However, as it warmed up once home, it was a somewhat thick liquid but very easy to apply to body - a little goes along way.  </li>

    <li> the stuff is pure alright. gets cold and it turns into this white thick stuff just as real stuff should. only issue i have is with the fact its oil, the lid wont stay tight down, had a bit all over the bottle and bag it came in. but the lid was on tight and a little goes a long way with this oil. can use it on your skin or on your nails to give it a healthy shine and makes them grow better i noticed. naturally has vitamin e so whatever coconut oil is good for. if you use to much it does have a strong coconut smell. but i say it is true stuff.</li>
    <li> Real natural 100% very good product</li>
    <li> It arrived as promised.  When I opened it, it was solid.  However, as it warmed up once home, it was a somewhat thick liquid but very easy to apply to body - a little goes along way.  You must be careful as to not squeeze out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought that I didn&#x27;t like the smell but in time, whatever smell there is, goes away.  It leaves your skin very smooth, with a nice glow.  I use it on my entire body and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a personal lubricant, and it is a lifesaver. Very soothing, and the antimicrobial benefits of organic coconut oil make this a safe and natural choice. Soft coconut scent.</li>
    <li> I love it even my husband has noticed that my skin looks so much better and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooth, I am going to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this is a lotion and it is amazing. I love how it smells and I notice the difference when I apply it on my skin. Will be using this instead of lotion from now on.</li>
    <li> My wife says she really like it. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love this product and super fast service!!! Will definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> love it! Smooth, nice scent. Moisturizes you whole body very well. I will definitely recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> My 2 boys love it so much that I had order another one just for them. I love how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling so soft and smells so good!!!</li>
    <li> Came right on time. love the coconut oil</li>

    <li> Excellent coconut oil for the body. I bought a bottle in the Dominican Republic, and after searching the web for more with no luck I wished that I had bought 20 bottles, but Amazon came to my rescue! I pray this item stays in stock!</li>
    <li> gave it as a gift, I think she likes it</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product! It feels so good on my skin and smells heavenly. I apply it to my skin after my shower while I&#x27;m still wet and it keeps my skin soft all throughout the day, even in hot weather. When used under moisturizer, my face feels soft and looks smooth &amp; dewy. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Found this product after 8 months of severe cracked/bleeding hands that my dermatologist could not cure.  I decided to take matters into my own hands, studied natural cures for dry skin and discovered coconut oil.  Within 3 weeks my hands were completely healed.  I came to the conclusion that the cause of my skin problem was chemicals used in soap and lotions.  I now use Dominican Coconut Oil on my entire body and my skin is well moisturized and very healthy!  I am a true believer that nature has a cure for everything.  You just have to look!</li>
    <li> For my granddaughter&#x27;s eczema. Is very effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this</li>
    <li> Nice soft smell of coconut oil.  Mine was shipped in the winter time and was semi solid inside the bottle with the color of white.  Over time and in room temp it became a &amp;#34;runny shampoo like&amp;#34; consistency.  Still goes on the skin very well and absorbs into the skin without a greasy feel. I love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this body oil.  I use it all the time and have ordered several times.  It is light and keeps my skin soft all throughout the day.  It does not have a strong scent, which is another plus, but just enough to make you think of the beach.  I love it and as long as it is made I will buy it.</li>
    <li> works great, loved it!</li>
    <li> first used this product in the Dominican. loved it wish I had brought more home from the islands. great for after the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap oil. Note: body oils at the dollar store have mineral oil as main ingredient too (for example).  1st ingredient is Mineral oil means it has the most of that ingredient in it.  May smell good, but its far from pure.  Skin clogging mineral oil ewww!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a cross btw baby oil, and coconut massage oil...it goes solid in temps cooler then 70 degrees...so just leave it in the shower and it will warm up.  I use it for massage and as a skin moisturizer...coconut is also anti-fungal and great for so many things...dandruff, skin irritations..etc etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good, and goes on very nicely...I&#x27;m on my 4 btl after finding it in the airport in the DR.</li>
    <li> I love covering my body with this after I shower. It makes my skin so incredibly soft &amp; it smells amazing! I add a little to my shampoo to make my hair extra soft! I also use it as a tanning oil, before &amp; after. Love the smell! :)</li>
    <li> the coconut oil the odor smell burn ,is very strong ,don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was using a different kind b4 but im so glad I found this one. As someone who has been to the Dominican several times every time I use this im reminded of the island, the smells and the soft skin from using there oils. Buy it, u wont be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Is very moisturizing and smells great. I use it on my skin daily. Feel moisturized all over. Great selection for me.</li>
    <li> i rated this a 4 due to it was just like a brick when it arrived . i had to letvit set for 5 days before i could use it. i like it i just donc&#x27;t like all the oil uou have on your hands when you put some on its very runnie . so be careful you wash your hands right after you use it an Donc&#x27;t rub your eyes.</li>
    <li> Yes it did and I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Took a leap of faith with this purchase but I love it!!! Is not greasy at all, lasting moisture (especially when applying right after shower time), smells really good too!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the bottle because the plastic is too hard to squeeze when the weather is cool/cold and the coconut oil has solidified. When the weather is warm, the oil is liquid and there&#x27;s no problem with getting it out of the bottle. Otherwise, the coconut oil is just fine.</li>
    <li> love it.... it is so amazing to use for the hair and skin...  it really helps alot.... I will buy it again soon!!</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked into the outer package (bubble package) and we lost some of the contents. It turned out that the lid was loose. No return documentation inside the package. We are away for a couple of months so not hear to receive a replacement bottle, in any event.</li>
