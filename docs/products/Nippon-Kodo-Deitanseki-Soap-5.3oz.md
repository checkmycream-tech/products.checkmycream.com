<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Leaves skin awsome!</li>
    <li> Best facial soap ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 yr old female who is in college and I have tried almost every single face wash out there! I finally stumbled upon this and decided to try it. Thank goodness I did! I have extremely dry skin that is prone to breakouts and I had large, very noticeable pores on my nose. Since I started using this three months ago I&#x27;ve had great skin!!! My routine is to wash my face at night by using a small chunk of the soap, rubbing it into a lather on a washcloth and moving in a circular motion for about thirty seconds. I then moisturize with my favorite face cream of all time- Jergens All-Purpose Face Cream!!!! [[ASIN:B00005304L Jergens All-Purpose Face Cream - 15 oz]] The soap removes all the dead skin and impurities while the face cream (because it has mineral oil and beeswax and some other stuff) heavily moisturizes. I shower in the morning and just run warm water over my face and pat dry with no washing or exfoliating involved. This is extremely effective combo of products and extremely economical. I love it! Note: use a sharp knife when cutting the bar into about three or four pieces and you may lose some small bits but its perfectly okay I&#x27;m still on my first little piece after three months! Also my boyfriend who has a little bit of rosacea on his cheeks just lathers this up in the shower and washes and this works very well for him too!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne anything from whiteheads, blackheads, cystic acne, uneven skin tone, you name it....  I have spent hundreds of dollars on acne products with no result sometime even made things worse.  Then I used this product and the first time I used it I cleaned my face then rinsed it off, then I applied it again lathered it in REALLY good then let it sit until it dried rinsed it off, followed with bio-oil and Egyptian magic and the next day no acne bumps and an even skin tone.....  I am a true believer.  Now after a few days of using the clay and charcoal bar my skin is smooth.  I would definitely buy this again when it runs out but it seems to last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one week. I am not sure whether it will work in the future, but so far I don&#x27;t see any good results. It leaves the skin very dry and it is hard to rinse away. It does not unclog pores or stuff, then I am not sure what it is really for.</li>
    <li> To use this soap properly, you have to slather some soap on your hand not too much, just slightly; you get lots of lather. then you spread around your face and leave it for a min. or so. then  you wait. after that you wash it off, and wipe with a towel. I leaves you this clean fresh feeling. and I love the smell too. It&#x27;s a great natural soap with no harsh chemicals of any kind. and it lasts long! i say that one bar last you couple of months. Normally i cut it in half since the chunk is too big for normal use.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for this soap and being so frustrated with my skin, I decided to go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m glad I did! Although I&#x27;ve only had it since yesterday, I&#x27;ve used it three times and have already noticed a difference. This soap REALLY cleans my skin. It&#x27;s so soft and smooth! A big plus is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like other facial cleansers. Typically when I would wash my face in the morning, it would begin to feel oily and dirty by the early afternoon. This product doesn&#x27;t do that. In fact, I washed my face around 11 this morning and it still feels great now at 5 PM! It is definately well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked, I&#x27;ve been through many different cleansers over the years and none work as well as this...buying another after this.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews on this soap, I thought I would give it a try, I&#x27;m a fan of the La Roche Posay LHA cleansing gel, and am looking for a less \\&quot;active\\&quot; and less expensive cleanser.  This was a disappointment for me on multiple fronts, I am dry/sensitive and tend to be combo/sensitive on the more oily side during the summer, so I was looking for something to dry up my oily t-zone and not irritate my skin for the summer months.  My first disappointment was that this soap does not rinse clean, there is a sensation of stickiness after rinsing, similar to what you would experience if you used noxema cleansing cream.  Second, after a week I began breaking out in small red pimples, I know that some products will draw impurities out from deeper levels on occasion when you begin using them, so I continued use, however, this issue continued for a month and a half, therefore I can only conclude that this soap actually caused the break outs.  It did not dry my oily zones, and appeared to make my pores larger in the long run.  Overall, would rather spend the 40 dollars on the LHA Cleanser from La Roche Posay, than save some money and be covered in little red pimples.  I wanted desperately to like this product, but I just could not.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when the store I worked in started selling bars of Japanese clay and coal for $11. However, I went out on a limb and bought it three weeks ago. It seems to be doing something right, since I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts (and my pores tend to get clogged easily). I also like the fact that this $11 bar is actually pretty large. I cut 1/4 of the bar off, and I&#x27;m still working on that one piece. My skin is neither too oily nor dry after using it (I have combination skin).  The price looks daunting, but it&#x27;s actually more economical than the liquid soaps sold in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it has some toxic chemicals in there so I would not recommend using it. It does work well in cleaning my skin, but it has chemicals that has been classified as toxic to the eye in Europe and as toxic to the reproductive system in Canada according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database at [...].</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser out there. I have oily skin and this leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling stripped or dry. I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much of an acne problem but I live in a cold climate and get very dry skin.  This product didn&#x27;t dry my skin out and left me with a glowing complexion. I&#x27;ve used more facial cleansers than I can count and this is the best yet. The price may seem a bit steep for a bar of soap but it lasts a really long time, even if left in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is the soap for those of us with oily skin and tend to break out a lot. I wish I had this when I was younger and in the prime of break outs. I still have a few every now and then but that is unavoidable. My skin has become smoother and my pores have shrank. I have used this product for quite awhile now and don&#x27;t use any other facial cleaner with it. It has an abundance of lather and rinses off nice. There is no aroma and I used it for body wash when hunting. I believe that is is a definite recommend for others.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like using this soap on my face. It lathers well, is unscented, and leaves my face clean without overdrying.     I am a 30 y.o. female who in the past 2 years has been struggling with moderate acne flare ups (as are a lot of other people, I&#x27;m finding!). I have, like all the others, been trying EVERYTHING to get rid of this crap and make my skin beautiful again, but I still get pretty nasty acne - mainly on my chin and around my lips. I finally decided I would try to go the natural route and stop using all these chemicals.     Anyway, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s either helped or hurt my acne thus far. Perhaps if given another week or so, I will see a change. Time will tell.      I have never had an issue with large pores, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not it minimizes them. One thing I can comment on is that my t-zone was getting pretty oily for awhile, and I do think that something in my &#x27;regimen&#x27; has helped with that.     Currently, my &#x27;regimen&#x27; is (listing this so you can see what else I&#x27;m doing in addition to this soap):    A.M. - Wash w/ this soap, use Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil pads (think they help w/ acne prevention a little), spot-treat zits w/ tea tree oil, spritz on Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater &amp; Glycerin toner, apply Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, and my makeup (trying to go as oil-free as possible w/ that).     P.M. - Wash w/ this soap, apply Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar topically, spot treat w/ tea tree oil, spritz on the rosewater (see above), and moisturize. ALSO... every other day I am using Aztec Secrets Indian Healing Clay, which draws all the nasty gunk out of your pores &amp; makes your skin feel radiant.    I have just begun the straight up vinegar topically, but I did the clay mask &amp; vinegar last night, and I think I see some minor improvement today.     Moral of the story, I WOULD reccommend this soap &amp; really like it; I&#x27;m just not so sure about the acne healing properties just yet. But good luck to ya!</li>
    <li> I tried this, along with many other types of coal/tar/deep sea type of cleansers and it doesn&#x27;t help me with my skin. It&#x27;s a little drying, but does a good job of cleaning. I still have plenty of break outs though.</li>
    <li> When I bought this soap I was looking for a less costly brand of charcoal face cleanser -- achieved! One 150g bar can be cut into two normal sized pieces, or shaved into smaller bits. Your hands will gain enough lather for your face in seconds, which makes this an incredibly long lasting soap, and much, much easier on the wallet than other popular brands.    As an unexpected plus, I recently found out that this soap is less chemically toxic than any of my previous cleansers, including the popular brand of similar soap I had sampled. In my personal opinion, it also works better for my specific skin type.    What some consumers might not take into account is this product&#x27;s combination of charcoal AND clay rather than just charcoal. It not going to be perfect for everyone. I recommend this for combination skin that is prone to imbalance, probably not for those with chronic, true acne, or skin that breaks out due to over-dryness ... but that&#x27;s just a guess on my part and it&#x27;s really up to each individual to see what works for them. For true combination skin, I can vouch that it&#x27;s great.     My perfectly clear (though combination) skin suddenly got unmanageable as an adult, for what reason I&#x27;ve never been able to fathom. Nothing I did worked. I was constantly washing my face, moisturizing, trying a combination of new products in new ways ... I even had a doctor once ask me if I washed, since it was apparent I didn&#x27;t have true chronic acne. I ran across this product by chance and it&#x27;s worked for me. I only wash my face with product once outside of a shower instead of a few times a day. I use a skin appropriate moisturizer afterward. I do not use this over my entire body, since my body itself tends towards dryness and does not have a breakout problem. For that I use something with a bit more moisturizing product and less clay (imagine the feeling you get directly after a clay mask and you can imagine using this soap).     DO NOT get it in your eyes. It hurts like nobody&#x27;sbusiness. It&#x27;s easy not to, just be aware. Wash it off well. If you don&#x27;t, you get a tight, itchy feeling like you&#x27;ve improperly washed off a mask.     Enjoy!</li>
    <li> No special skin problems, but this soap (in concert with softened water) feels really soft and gentle and seems to offer a really thorough cleansing.  No aroma, and while it is a bit pricey, it seems to last.  Use it all over, but I&#x27;d say that it would be quite nice as a facial bar only.  A small luxury that gives the day a nice start.</li>
    <li> Yep, this is a fantastic soap.  Has a pleasant slightly gritty texture that cleans those pores right out.  Kind of pricey for a bar of soap, but it is hard as a rock and slow to wear down, especially if you are only using it for your face. In fact I may cut it in half, since it is weirdly long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for more years than I can count.  I can say with all honesty that I am 63 years old and have no wrinkles at all on my face.  And I don&#x27;t have stock in their company nor do I work for them.  It just works.  Natural is normally better anyhow. Women are so convinced to put a bunch of chemicals on their faces and they have no idea what they are.  I use it all over my body as does my husband.  As your skin is your largest organ in your body, why would you use just anything on it????</li>
    <li> I have recently started using clay soaps on the recommendation of a naturalist. Clay soaps are great for restoring your skin&#x27;s balance, which many of the products that are touted as being good for acne-prone skin actually drain your skin of its natural moisture and balance.  This soap, in particular, works well, washes off clean, and leaves no scent or residue behind - both bad news for break-out prone people.</li>
    <li> I used this soap and really liked the smooth texture it gave to my skin. I used it every morning before applying my moisturizer and I noticed my skin did not breakout as it usually did. I prefer using clay soaps and will look for another one that may be a bit less expensive, but if I don&#x27;t find one I will buy this one again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only my second day using this product but my skin has already improved tremendously!  I read all the good reviews about this product, and they were all true!  After the first use, my insanely large pores and blackheads were already decreased in size and fewer in number.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I have extremely dry skin on my cheeks and a semi-oily t-zone, but it didn&#x27;t matter because this soap balanced my skin out very well.  My skin also felt tighter as well.  I also think this bar is priced very reasonably considering all the money anyone has spent over time for creams, anti-aging products, and acne treatments to help their face.  By far the best wash for my combination Asian skin :)  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Something to take into consideration: I have seen some reviews saying there are toxic chemicals in this facial bar, but honestly, anything that isn&#x27;t of natural substance or organic that is applied to our skin or ingested is considered \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; to our bodies.  Things such as deodorant, shampoo, facial creams, lotion, make-up, even acne treatments can be considered toxic because of the unnatural ingredients contained in all these products.  Like with anything, everything in moderation!</li>
    <li> This is a good solid cleanser</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and still get pimples because I have large pores that get clogged easily.  The soap I was using (Acne Aid) got discontinued.  The apothecary recommended this product and it works amazingly.    I wish I could have tried it sooner.  My pores have reduced in size and my skin is so soft and clear.  I use it twice daily followed with Noxzema Triple Clean pads.  My skin has not looked better thanks to this routine.    Please try this soap if you have large pores or a lot of blackheads.</li>
    <li> This soap does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little difficult to remove it all - you really have to rinse a LOT more than with most other soaps I&#x27;m used too.  Otherwise, it gets in your eyes and it does NOT feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it leaves my skin feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an acne problem for years and using this soap hasn&#x27;t helped it much.  It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not as good as some reviewers say it is.  It does give you a squeaky clean feeling when you&#x27;re rinsing the soap off but it won&#x27;t cure acne for everyone. I&#x27;ve had better luck with the stuff sold at department stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap strictly for its claims to help w/ acne. This soap did NOTHING for my ance. However, it does leave your skin feeling clean and soft. So overall, its good soap but I would not reccomend it for any type of acne purposes. Burt&#x27;s Bees garden tomato soap bar is now the only soap I will put near my face and would recommend it to everyone that is suffering from acne!</li>
    <li> Horrible! I bought this based on reviews and it&#x27;s horrible. Made my skin so much worse. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This soap is probably one of the best finds ever. Before I found this soap I was using every facial scrub and anti-blackhead cream cleanser I could find. Some worked better than others but every time my face would get red because of the acids in the cleansers. Deitenseki soap solved that for me. It lasts forever and does a great job at keeping my face blackhead free. It cleans deeper than any of the other stuff I&#x27;ve used and dries with a nice matte finish without over drying my skin. The only downside is with such clear pores my pores are free to expel their oils freely. Overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I am a bar soap lover--I hate liquid cleansers.  Not sure why, but I do.  This one is great for pulling the goop out of pores and bringing it to the surface for removal. It makes your skin feel soooo clean-no residue. I have combo skin, more toward the dry side, and have developed adult onset acne on my cheeks and temple area.  My chin and nose have always had problems with blackheads. This soap dramatically reduced the development of whiteheads on my cheeks, and really cleaned out my pores.  I haven&#x27;t had any new blackheads on my nose for months! Note: I also stopped using a moisturizer (maybe that helped too).  IT IS KEY to really take the time to lather this soap up on your face in circular motions.  Note:  This soap can be drying, but I have been okay using it without a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> This cleansing bar is one of the best kept secrets.  Thorough but not drying to the skin.  Very, very long-lasting. Bar is over-sized and does not fit in most soap dishes.</li>
    <li> I used this while I was in karate (practice 3 hours a day, 6 days a week) and it totally cleared up my acne. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this. I&#x27;ve used charcoal soaps before and they were wonderful, so I thought it would be the same thing, but it really wasn&#x27;t. It caused breakouts, did nothing for my pores, and I found it to be drying instead of moisturizing, as advertised. I ended up letting it sit there for a while before finally dumping it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap 13 months ago and it&#x27;s lasted so long I had to write a review.  I use it only to wash my face roughly twice a day.  I was hesitant to spend $10 for a bar of soap but gave it a try based on the great reviews.  13 months later the bar is only 1/2 gone.  I&#x27;m buying more to try to use as my regular soap.  Highly recommend trying this soap.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lasts reallllyyyyy long. Didn&#x27;t overly dry my skin, but it did dry up small pimples &#x3D;)  I tried to cut it up, but it didn&#x27;t slice too nicely because the soap is very dense - so it broke at irregular parts. I get a small piece and work it into a lather between my palms.  It lathers surprisingly well.  The smell as a little off-putting for me, but my friend thinks it smells good.  I would buy it again, but that probably won&#x27;t happen until next year seeing as I only use it 3-4 times weekly and the piece I broke off hasn&#x27;t gotten much smaller.</li>
    <li> This is a good solid cleanser. It removes makeup pretty well including mascara. My skin has improved since using it but it has not been a miracle product. It provides a nice lather and will probably last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good facial cleaner, better than the average. Gives a slippery clean, cleans a lot better than soap. Bit too long to use as a facial bar, had to cut it to smaller chunks. Quick and easy to lather up. Has a distinct small kind of like pine. Blackish gray bar will turn a purple gray when wet and used. Bit expensive, doesn&#x27;t work wonders, but gives you a different kind of clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This soap is really different. Some friends told me about the soap from Japan, but I didn&#x27;t think that I can actually get it.</li>
    <li> Spent $12 bucks and got a sample.. A 1 inch cube of a bar.. I initially thought, it was just a sample, great right! Nope, this is the shipment.. The sample packaging even says, \\&quot;Sample not for Sale.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my goal is a clean experience with no chemical additives.  This soap fits the bill - lathers up nicely and I feel clean afterwards with no guilt, and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> DON&#x60;T BUY IT, IF YOU WANT IT TO REMOVE YOUR BLACK HEADS... That&#x60;s what I did, and I regret it. However, it seems to help people with their acne. So I&#x60;m not going to give it a bad review.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because of the great reviews that it has...but unfortunately I was very disappointed. I have combination acne prone skin this soap made my face breakout, I used for one week... I&#x27;m now going to try dudu osun black soap it has many natural ingredients...Hopefully it works better for me.</li>
    <li> I dunno--I don&#x27;t think I had any great result from this. It didn&#x27;t cure my mild to moderate pimples, and I don&#x27;t think it improved my skin tone/pore size. I found it to be a little more drying than the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar I usually use, so I alternated the two. I&#x27;m going to try the Basis All Clear Bar now -- has antibiotics, which I hate to use (contributing to resistant bacteria), but I also hate still having zits, as I am 28 year male. At least I&#x27;ll only use All Clear on my face, and regular soap for rest of me. Hope it works.    This Pelican soap is fine as a soap, but I saw no miracles. Also, I kept it in the shower and it makes the tiles/caddy next to it look dirty, because it is black. No permanent stains, but a little messy--I&#x27;ll stick with a white/clear soap, as this offered no significant benefit for me, and is expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I have t-zone skin and blackheads and this is the first thing that really helped. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker (I don&#x27;t believe that one exists) but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin but removed the oil for the t-zone, cleans well and shrinks my pores.   After a few days I tried it for my hair and it works great as a shampoo, too. I feel like there is less residue left in my hair. So now I actually only have this one soap in the shower, no other soaps, no shampoos, no facial cleaner, just this and it feels great!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I have battled blackheads and whiteheads for as long as I can remember. I have combination skin &#x3D; very dry and very infested with blackheads and whiteheads. I&#x27;ve learned that certain types of clay can draw out the gunk that clogs your pores so when I saw this and all the good reviews, I had to have it.     The first day I used it, my skin looked like the skin you see in magazines. The whiteheads near my ears had reduced dramatically and the blackheads above my eyebrows had the same result. This was a miracle I thought. It must be very drying because I moisturize with emu oil (non-comedogenic) and I would have a few (very small) patches of dry skin at the end of the day.     Within the next few days of using this product, the results became less and less noticeable. My whiteheads were slowly creeping back. It is sad really. But I guess you get what you pay for. It might work for some of you guys so I don&#x27;t discourage you from trying it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This soap feels good on my skin...  it lasts so long...  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it all.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, truly removes all impurities, I would not recommend using more than a few days a week or your skill will dry out.</li>
    <li> This soap didn&#x27;t work for me. Got this soap to help with oily skin and blackheads. Used this soap for 3 weeks and no improvement in either. In fact, blackheads got worse. So switching back to my old Neutrogena Acne soap, and skin has improved in just 3 days.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take better care of my face. Creates a nice lather, and washes off easily. my skin definitely feel better when i use it. And being sourced from natural ingredients is great. Definitely recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I used to have a clay facial mask, and it worked very well for my face, so I gave this charcoal soap a try for my body. Sometimes I have a couple breakouts under my chin and some on my back during those times of the month, but after using this, all of them went away! Now I use this every night instead of my typical liquid soaps because this is so much more clean and so easy to use. It can leave your skin a bit dry after using (at least on my face it was kinda tight), but after applying some moisturizer, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I just received this soap in the mail and it did not look like the photo online.  My soap was very chalky-- I had to brush the chalk residue off of the outside before even trying to use it.  I am hoping that this does not prevent it from working as wonderfully as everyone has said it does.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I live in Japan, so I can buy it for as little as 400 to 500 Yen a bar.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my skin wonderfully, even removes makeup. It reduces the size of my pores, and makes my skin look brighter and healthier. It is a bit drying though, but I really don&#x27;t mind, since I always use moisturizer in the morning and evening after washing my face.  It also help with improving my acne. However, the only thing I dislike is, that it doesn&#x27;t really help with reducing the amount of blackheads, as I was hoping. So this is the reason, why I give this product only 4, instead of 5 stars. I haven&#x27;t come across anything better than this, also concerning cost-performance, so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This soap does exactly what it claims.  It get&#x27;s my skin squeaky clean, without drying it out and it&#x27;s smoother after one use!  I have dry skin and most soaps leave it flaky.</li>
    <li> At 57, my skin is past constant breakouts but I do get the occasional pimple and oil in the T Zone.  This soap has been my favorite now for over a year.  It keeps my skin squeaky clean but does NOT dry it out or make it red or flaky.  Perfect balance for my older skin!  I will keep buying on a regular basis.  The bar is large and if used only for the face and not left sitting in water, last several months.  I break it in half once it is small enough to do so.  It lasts even longer.</li>
    <li> ive been using this product everyday since i have recieved it and my acne has been clearing up. the only thing i dont like about this product is that after i wash my face its not as dry as i would like it to be. my face is very oily and i like a very dry face after a wash. but overall it is a good product i do recommend it.- XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I have a mixed complexion, which makes finding a cleanser difficult. Everytime I use this bar, a new layer of life is exposed. I highly recommend this product, and only a small application is necessary to lather the skin. This is a great investment, and gift.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skins and am prone to breakouts so I tried this bar after reading the good reviews, but it just seemed like any other bar of soap to me. It left a filmy kind of feeling on my skin and just seemed a little to harsh to be using on my skin. I have since moved on to African Black Soap by Nubian Heritage and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69.  Cleared up the occasional acne on my forehead.  Worked as well as the pine tar soaps that I tried before, but doesn&#x27;t have a burnt smell.  Also last a lot longer than the pine tar soaps.  Will definitely buy again.  Also use Selsun Blue medicated shampoo on my forehead.  Between the two they get the job done.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this face soap it smells so good and i will never go back to another one. i have no blemishes and my skin has been perfectly clear using this soap...i found about it on cleopatrachoice.com.....</li>
    <li> smells a little funky if you are use to irish spring. but does a good job doing a deep clean.</li>
    <li> So I have used everything under the sun and under the moon and any where else they sell acne cures, but seriously I have bought everything on the market. The best thing I found was the African black dudu soap it worked well but I would still have break outs every so often. I figured hey this stuff is the best I could get. Then I decided to try this because I know charcoal is a natural detox. In fact, it is in every hospital and they use it for people who are poisoned. I tried it and WOW IT WORKED OVER NIGHT!!!! my skin cleared up and after continue use BAM ACNE FREE!!! this is it! this is the cure for me. I know people have different skin types so I cant say it will work for you. I have really oily skin and have been breaking out ever since 9th grade. I would say its worth a try because it is my acne cure and works better then anything I have tried and like I said I have tried everything!! I even read a couple books and tried their methods and all the natural remedies as well. The only other things I would recommend is Queen Helens mint face mask that is cheap and works great whether your using it for acne or just for minimizing pores/getting great skin. So keep it healthy and try it out! It made me acne free and happy as can be. I saw some reviews saying the bar lasted a long time. It only lasted about a month for me. That&#x27;s not too long but I am re buying it ASAP because I have been a couple weeks without it and i&#x27;m starting to break out again. Thank you amazon for prime cause Im getting this bad boy in two days and will continue to buy and be a happy customer for life! if you have any questions or comments be sure to let me know cause I would love to share the good news of this life saving soap! Thanks</li>
    <li> I have a very oily skin and at first I was skeptical about this product.  However, I am now about to order my second bar as this is just a wonderful soap! It leaves my face dry but not too dry, clean and acne free.    Pros:   - Very good face soap   - No more blackheads  - Significant improvement in acne    Cons:  - Too big - I had to cut mine into half so it can fit in my travel bag. Absolutely not a reason to not buy this soap    Suggestion: Best to wash the face before you go to sleep and also, even more important: wash your face with soap when you wake up in the morning - it will make a big difference!</li>
    <li> The first week of using the Deitanseki soap yielded fantastic results.  However, after using this product for 4 weeks, it became obvious that my acne condition was only worsening.  After the clear spell, it just got worse and worse.  I am 26 years old and have been battling an oily acne prone complexion for 10 years.  My condition has only worsened as I have gotten older. I was looking for a natural alternative to acne treatment.  I had previously been using Proactiv, but after almost three years it had stopped working.  I have mild to moderate acne, and this product caused my acne to reach the higher moderate levels, possibly severe if I continue use.  I gave this product three stars considering it did give my skin a pleasant clean feeling without drying out my skin.  It just didn&#x27;t help with my acne.  The bar would certainly last over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this soap at a local Asian Grocery and thought \\&quot;what the heck, it looks interesting....\\&quot;  I can not believe how beautiful my skin is since using this soap.  I have combination skin and occasionally get a pimple from my cell phone pressed against my face - but this soap makes my skin supple, soft and clean without feeling tight dry and stripped.  I follow up with my day and evening mositurizer(s) and I have to say that my skin has NEVER looked better.  It positively glows and I don&#x27;t have itchy areas or dry patches - I swear it has even helped plump up minor lines in the forehead area.  BUY THIS.  The bar lasts about 6 to 8 months with daily use ont he face only.</li>
    <li> Returned: The item appears much larger from the image provided and price, however it is about the size of a regular soap bar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 with relatively good skin. My pores have gotten larger as I&#x27;ve aged and I don&#x27;t like going with out a BB or foundation. Because of them,makeup (blush, powders etc) tends to settle into them.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a greasy t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this soap for 4 nights, 3 days (wash 2x day) but already my pores are almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I mean this is a HUGE difference. I&#x27;ve read reviews that it only works initially, but doesn&#x27;t sustain so I&#x27;m not getting my hopes up. If I notice that it&#x27;s not doing as great of a job after some time, I will go down to using 2-3x a week as a supplement to my other routines...like a face mask.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, so far my skin feels really clean - no tight feeling after washing and it definitely has given my skin that \\&quot;fresh faced\\&quot; look. So far I love it! No change to my T-zone, but sometimes greasy takes a while to help..and it&#x27;s been really hot this week so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a bit odd at first - it&#x27;s carbon so it has a charcoal like smell but I got over it quick and now it just smells good. It&#x27;s a big block, so I think I could easily cut it into 1/4&#x27;s and make it easier to handle, last longer, and less to travel with!&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a whirl! I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> This soap has made my pores a lot smaller and clearer as others have claimed.&lt;br /&gt;I also like it because it doesnt have a heavy scent. Feels good after I was my face with it.</li>
    <li> It really dried up my oily skin.  It didnt touch my scars but it did remove the oil that causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> This clears up my acne so well and makes my skin super smooth. It also removes a lot of the dead skin from my face so I appear to be a shade lighter when I finish washing my face haha :) The smell of the soap irritates my nose a bit, but I don&#x27;t mind. You don&#x27;t smell it while washing your face anyway. It even helps fade my acne scars a little bit. I love this soap.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap! Leaves my skin feeling clean and not greasy! I have oily skin, and just discovered charcoal soap. It leaves my skin feeling so much cleaner than regular soaps. I just wish this soap lasted longer. I am the only one using it and it&#x27;s on its last limb and it&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks. Kind of expensive to have to replace every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I discovered Nippon Kodo Deitanseiki soap in my determined search for a soap that would perform seriously deep cleansing, yet would not be harsh on my face. I am happy with this beauty/hygiene product and it has become a staple in my product cabinet. I always make sure to take it with me when I travel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I purchase this soap, I split it into 3 pieces since the bar is kind of long, and each single bar I purchase lasts me 2.5 to 3 months (each piece lasts about 1 month). Worth the money.</li>
    <li> It may have been my skin type, but I broke out while using this product on my face. The rest of my skin was fine. In fact my dry skin seemed to soften after using it so I wasn&#x27;t so desperate for lotion after a shower. Know your skin type.</li>
    <li> I like the soap&#x27;s scent and it doens&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but is a large bar that lasts a while if you keep it dry between uses.</li>
    <li> My skin have been soft and moisturized! Dried skin have been improved! I will continue using this products!! and reasonable price</li>
    <li> Package came here in time and it&#x27;s a very good product to use for your face as it does cleanse off dirt and whatever else. Just make sure you use a moisturizer after using this as it will dry your face out!! Other then that it&#x27;s a great product !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  For greasy faces it cleans up and helps prevent breakouts.  But it&#x27;s no better or worse than any other coal product, like Coal Face at Lush.  If you find a different product cheaper, get that, there&#x27;s no reason to pay more for this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but I was just expecting more from this product. Nice soap. Lightly cleans, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it oily either. It has a strange smell. Like your clothes might smell the next day after going to a bonfire. My wife was dissapointed with my smell after washing with my new soap. I was expecting a smell like art class clay and an aquarium filter but it&#x27;s more like a day old wet campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit larger than a normal soap bar. Add about an inch to a regular bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I discovered this soap&#x27;s true potential. It makes an EXCELLENT shave soap. It lathers great and the hinoki oil in it makes for a smooth razor glide. Because of the way it rinses, it&#x27;s superb for shaving, it leaves the skin feeling normal, not oily, not dry, not stretched, not squeaky, just....normal. I cut off a chunk and put it in my soap dish, it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever for extremely sensitive skin-especially in the winter-doesn&#x27;t dry out or cause breakouts-also use this instead of shaving cream-no razor bumps</li>
    <li> Great lather.  Soft on skin.  I have sensitive skin.  Didn&#x27;t clear anything, remove scars or close my open pores but cleaned it.  My skin wasn&#x27;t irritated or dry after.  Used twice a day.  High quality and long lasting.  Would I buy again?  Sure.  But in the meantime, looking for something that will improve my facial skin, close my pores, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because of all of the reviews that said it was so great for pores, etc. I have used it for 3 months and it did nothing for my oily skin nor my large pores or anything.  I had to go back to my acne soap and the chemical peels. Do not count on this soap if you have troubled skin.</li>
    <li> I buy a couple of bars of this a year and use it primarily as my summertime facial cleanser. It is extremely thorough, removes impurities, and I believe it visibly reduces the size of pores. I used to have an area of blackheads on my cheeks near my nose, and after using this soap it is no longer a problem. I&#x27;ve traveled to Japan and tried about five different brands of charcoal soap, but the Pelican is the strongest. I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a day (I use a gentler cream cleanser in the mornings), but it&#x27;s great for getting rid of daily buildup. Just make sure you moisturize afterwards, and keep it away from your eyes because this STINGS. This sells for about $7 in Japan, so $10 isn&#x27;t bad as an imported product. I like the fact that it&#x27;s a bar, which means less trash and containers to deal with.</li>
    <li> Tried this for about two weeks, and all it did was dry out my skin. It stinks, and watch out if you get it in your eyes because it seems to sting worse than just normal soap. My skin just didn&#x27;t react well to it, and it did not reduce the oil so my skin was oily/flaky!</li>
    <li> According to Amazon I bought this soap in April of last year. It is mid-February and, with still another month or so to go on the old one, I am only now buying my second bar; so yes, this thing lasts about a year (and I wash my face twice a day). It is unbelievable. I have sensitive skin that breaks out in cystic horror -- or at least it used to -- at the slightest provocation; but to tell you the truth I cannot remember the last time it did that, thanks to this soap. Nothing seems to piss off my skin any more. If you have senstive, angry skin I cannot recommend this soap highly enough (plus Cetaphil cream, especially in this hideous weather, plus Olay Complete&#x27;s day moisturizer for Sensitive skin for the non-irritating SPF). Seriously, buy it yesterday. Best ten bucks you&#x27;ll ever spend.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to keep your skin looking and feeling as young and as firm as possible, Deitanseki seems to help slow down the aging process. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> If you want clear, non oily skin then this is the soap you should buy. I love charcoal soap and have always used them since 2012 but unfortunately I live down south where the nearest Lush Cosmetics is in Virginia. Although the coal face soap has more scrub than this soap, this soap still has the same qualities for a reasonable price and size. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a week now and it&#x27;s made my complexion glow. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, i do not use any type of chemical based facial cleanser in conjunction with this, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your face nice and clean. I will admit this soap has a tightening sensation on my face as it dries but that&#x27;s just mainly my pores shrinking down for the day. Try this soap, purify your pores and keep harsh chemical cleansers off your face and out of our water source.</li>
    <li> I used this exact same brand for years when I lived in Japan. I continued to buy as much as I could carry every time I returned to visit. Now I can get it online! This is a great facial soap with a great clean smell and feel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with acne. NO NEW ZITS SINCE I STARTED USING IT!!!    Pros: It has done a very good job of cleansing and drying out the acne without drying out my skin. I have had no irritation at all from using this product.     Cons: It may slightly stain your light colored washcloths.</li>
    <li> I got this product today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because a lot of people were raving about this charcoal soap. Let me tell you, it dramatically shrunk my pores. My pores have always noticeable and big; so when I washed my face with Nippon Kodo Deitanseki, I immediately saw my pores shrink. Wow, it was such a dramatic difference! My face feels so clean and I feel like all the dirt were taken out. This is definitely worth your money-- and hey, the way I see it, you should use only the best products for your skin.</li>
    <li> I had been using Wonderbar, but it was leaving my skin very dry after a year of using it. I found this slab in a little boutique and was told it was the same and far cheaper.  I thought I would give it a try. well at 51 my skin is now moist and younger looking.  I love this product. initially a few impurities were drawn out, but the wonder bar had already done that.  the big difference is in how soothing it feels.  elasticity is back.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin then, you need this soap.  Just a word for the conservationists: slice off a sliver for the shower and save the rest for the future. It&#x27;ll last longer. Yeah.. I know... Duh.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for your skin.  Too pricey to continue using it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive - ten bucks or more a bar - but it&#x27;s so worth it. My face is just better now. This soap has fixed the problems within its power. I&#x27;m going to the local international grocery tomorrow to see if they carry it, but even if they don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll still order it from Amazon, cost and all.</li>
    <li> I have been facing problem with Acne for the last 10+ years and have severe seborrheic dermatitis which causes pimples to form around the lips, on the nose line, temple, chin etc.. I have tried a lot of products earlier such as Tar shampoo, face washes with Tar in them. Apple cider vinegar(Which helped a bit too). I have extremely oily skin and a huge pores due to the acne. Ever since I started this soap(Its been 2 weeks now) I use this soap everyday almost 3~4 times to wash my face and I could see visible difference on my face in 1 week. The pimples just would start to dry out and fall of from your skin, the impurities are washed away and you would feel them. Your skin starts to look healthy, clean, and you feel like a protective layer has been formed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot write for other skin types as mine is extremely oily, if your skin is extremely oily and you face a problem with acne then I would definitely recommend this soap for great results.</li>
    <li> Great soap! Skin feels clean, and helps with the breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several weeks now. I bought it for two reasons. First, I&#x27;d like to stop putting chemicals and toxins on my face. Second, it would be nice to finally get rid of the blackheads on my nose. My blackheads are not gone. I think they will be with me forever. I find the soap to really dry out my face and I&#x27;ve never, ever had that experience with any soap at any time ever. This is strong stuff. Within a few minutes of washing, my face is begging for moisturizer. Begging as in my skin is flaking off. I would recommend this soap for someone with oily skin thinking that they could achieve normal skin after using.</li>
    <li> It sucks up the oil--mission accomplished. I have used this soap on and off for years and its the only face bar soap I&#x27;d probably ever use again. I typically use Aveeno cleansing pads for oily skin, but I learned that my skin isn&#x27;t actually oily. It just over produces from using those pads day and night. Well I transitioned to using Deitanseki once a day and the Aveeno cleansing pad once a day. For now---I have found balance. Note: I don&#x27;t have problem, nor mature skin.</li>
    <li> I found this soap entirely by accident in an booth selling Japanese incense at a gift trade show! The sales rep gave me a sample and swore it would clear my hormonally-challenged skin without drying it out. After years of spending ridiculous amounts of money on Lancome and Clinique skincare products, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been 6 months now and my skin has cleared completely! I do use it with the Clairsonic cleansing brush religiously! It&#x27;s incredible. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help combat my adult acne based on reviews.  It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me - clear up or prevent.  But it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  The bar is HUGE.  I cut it in half and that worked fine.  It cleaned my skin, didn&#x27;t dry it out but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> Will minimize pore and take out old skin. Great soap! And not much smell to it. My skin has been lighter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t try out my face.  Looking fwd to see what it does long term.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over 2 months and I have not had 1 single breakout..which is a first for me..I usually have to change products very regular but not this soap..</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that actually minimizes my pores! I am cautiously concluding that after using this daily for over a week. I use it in the shower, and when I come out, the larger pores in my cheeks appear to be a LOT smaller. It also reduces the ruddiness in my cheeks and makes my combination skin feel balanced and smooth all over. Over the day, my t-zone returns to it&#x27;s normal oily self with large pores, but I&#x27;m hoping that over time the pore-minimizing will be longer-lasting. Also, I live in a humid tropical climate that makes my skin so oily that no product can overcome that. I&#x27;d like to see how this performs in a cooler climate. I think it would work even better for me there. There is an interesting smell to it. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. A little like tangy perfumed charcoal. It&#x27;s not offensive to me. You need so little to clean your face that I can see this soap lasting a long time, at least a few months, maybe more. I&#x27;m really liking this product so far!</li>
    <li> Use this on my face.  Not harsh but you feel clean</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works great on my oily skin. Now the only soap I use on my face. A bar lasts a year.</li>
    <li> There is a solid debate in the reviews for the validity of this product and I purchased it in hopes of it falling on the positive side.  I have to say this soap is wonderful.  It makes me want to wash my face.  It feels clean with no residue after you wash and the smell is a faint and light clean.  I pair this with Dr. Badushka&#x27;s healing cream twice a day and have seen a significant change (albeit a slow change i.e. 6+ weeks) in my skin which was oily, pore-ridden and with a fair share of cystic acne.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I first found this soap on Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice and ordered it. Works great on dry winter skin. Makes your skin feel soft and relieves the itch of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Read the other detailed reviews regarding skin clearing up, feeling, freshness and that the bar lasts forever. I endorse those reviews after 30 days of use today</li>
    <li> I love it- I have oily acne prone skin with lots of acne scarring of pits, hyper pigmentation and discoloration. This soap is literally taking away all of that and NOT drying out my skin or leaving it moist. My skin is NEUTRAL now, which has never happened with any other soap I&#x27;ve ever tried. and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of soaps, face washes and skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this soap on my entire body and because I&#x27;m persian/middle eastern, and I&#x27;m hairy, I tend to have bumps on my skin from shaving and just being middle eastern. This soap is taking away all of that and making my skin literally smooth and soft and supple! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only like using liquid soap from a bottle cuz bar soaps are messy and ugly looking, but this soap is SO good that I don&#x27;t care about the inconvenience of a bar or that it looks ugly sitting on my bathroom counter- I&#x27;m only using this soap here on out. Its that good!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this soap very much. I use it every few days on my face and upper body when showering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for your skin. Feels smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time as well and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this soap because of all the good reviews I read.  I did finally use for about 2 weeks and never saw a difference in my skin, it did keep it less oily, which I liked but no significant difference at all.</li>
    <li> The review was great, that was the reason i bought this soap even though i thought it was too expensive for a bar of soap. I will not buy this soap again. It dries up my skin and it doesn&#x27;t do anything about your acne problems. By the way, the soap doesn&#x27;t come in a box it comes in wrapped in plastic.</li>
    <li> Great for my husbands sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. A little drying so good for acne. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over two years now, usually ordering direct from Nippon Kodo but since it was on Amazon I took advantage of one stop shopping! This cleanser never leaves a film on my skin, cleans all but the toughest mascara off the first time without scrubbing. Does not dry my skin (almost 60 years old) and never leads to any type of break out. I cut each bar into three sections as it makes it last an extraordinarily long time without wasting any to melt, even though it is not a big melt away bar. Store it dry in a rack and each section lasts months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to clear pimples or not, but if it is it didn&#x27;t for me. All it did was keep my face clean which I enjoyed and it also doesn&#x27;t dry out your face. This thing is pretty huge for a face soap and will probably last me over 1 year I&#x27;ve only had this for about 4 months now and it has not shrunken in size one bit.</li>
    <li> this is a great soap with lots of bubbles but i am not how effective it is compared to other regular soaps; it is a little drying so i have not been using it everyday; i probably would not repurchase after i finish up this bar....will most likely last me at least a year</li>
    <li> i love the soap once i received it and actually used it. It makes my skin feel smoother and cleaner than normal soap</li>
    <li> After seeing this product listed in an article in Vogue and having had some skin issues, I decided to give it a try. Use of a mineral makeup had left me with some pretty serious cystic acne and rough skin, and I tried so many other soaps, from Philosophy, ProActiv, Murad, etc; however, this has truly been my miracle solution. After taking my makeup off with Bliss remover, I lather my face with this soap and rinse, then follow with Say Yes to Tomatoes! Skin Wipes, then a nice moisturizer or cream, and my breakout have completely cleared up! My complexion is so smooth now thanks to this soap and my regime. It can be a bit drying, but honestly the best time to apply moisturizer is right after cleansing, so if you do this there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. For $10 it is really worth a try!</li>
    <li> I got this soap as a gift from someone who went to Japan. I loved the soap and found it being sold on Amazon but was disappointed that the soap seem to be \\&quot;old\\&quot;. It was whitesh (normally gray) and brittle so I don&#x27;t plan on buying again. Note: this was a old purchase, only doing review now.</li>
    <li> I got this soap about two weeks ago &amp; am liking it so far.  I was worried it would leave a black mess all over the place, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I have noticed a decrease in breakouts &amp; blackheads.  I use this together with a rice flour face scrub, and I am loving it!  The soap foams up really well &amp; my face feels very clean.  The bar is pretty big &amp; should last a long time.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so different, love it</li>
    <li> Difficult to make suds with this soap.</li>
