<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this works great to remove eye makeup and clean your lids good.  Cheaper than what my eye dr. was charging too.</li>
    <li> Purchased in hopes of getting rid of milia near the eyes. No cigar. It is a good soft cleanser for the eyes, though it is too gentle to remove makeup (non waterproof) even after use of oil-based makeup remover. Overall efficacy mediocre but still many eye doctors recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lid scrub for a very long time.  It helps keep my eyelids clean around my eyelashes so I don&#x27;t get eye infections.  It works very well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Been using the individual packets and this is much more convenient (except for travel) just put a little on a cotton pad and scrub your eyes. Comes out as a foam, no waste.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my eyes and it helps keep my allergies at bay. I also think it does a better job at removing my eye makeup than makeup removers do.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by our Optician to help keep tour lids clean from build-up that often accompanies aging and dryness of the lids. We have used it for a number of years and find it wonderfully effective; if used as directed.</li>
    <li> Helps my eyes feel refreshed, healthy, and clean. I love this stuff, ever since an opthalmologist suggested I start using it when I had an allergic reaction to my contacts. It helps with redness, irritation, and is an EXCELLENT MAKEUP REMOVER! Great for all eye makeup! Love love love.  Use it with dellon cotton rounds.</li>
    <li> Gentle, effective and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This product is a great value...the 7.25 oz (215 ml) size is a GIANT bottle in comparison to the (1.68 oz) 50 ml size...over 4 times the amount at just a few dollars more. I was paying $14 at the drugstore for the 50 ml size and even here on Amazon that size runs $10-11 dollars. Even with shipping I was able to get two of these big bottles (430 ml) for 34.85. The equivalent amount at the drugstore in the 50 ml size (the only size any drugstore in my area carries) would have taken 9 bottles and $126!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is wonderful..soothing, non-irritating and perfect for those that need to keep their lids clean due to blepharitis, ocular rosacea or any other issues. Much easier to use than the scrub pads, and much less irritating as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this product and want to save, buy this larger size!</li>
    <li> I have constantly dry eyelids due to clogged pores in my eyelids.  I didn&#x27;t know this condition exists, but it does.  This product is soothing and clears them out and never stings or burns.  You can also go with baby shampoo instead and it will do the same job, but I like the foaming action of this product.  Not sure why it needs to cost so much, but it&#x27;s the only product of it&#x27;s kind, so I guess that&#x27;s your answer.</li>
    <li> The product works very well for me.  After more than 30 years as s a contact lens wearer (first hard contact lenses, now gas permeable) I recently developed blepharitis and it would often cause my lenses to appear foggy, cause a glare or make it seem as if my lenses needed cleaning again.  This was creating a serious problem for me.  I went through several contact lens products trying to find a solution to this problem.  My optometrist told me to try this product.  This product has really made a very big difference in my vision. My lenses remain clear of any fog, glare or any other visual disturbance.  I love this product.  I now have crystal clear vision again.</li>
    <li> After my recent Lasik eye surgery, I developed Blephartis.  My eye Dr. recommended eye scrubs thus I&#x27;ve tried many pre-packaged towelette type scrubs which all left my eyelids irritated.  This product is super gentle and I did not suffer any irritation.</li>
    <li> so i wus planing on bringing to partis so i cen easily wip of the pen line from my eye the eyelinr but it did not work????? i don no what this is suposd to do this is not eyelid clenr nd i calld compani nd dhey wil not giv me refund???  horible nevr buy from amazon agen</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis and this is the first product I found that actually removes makeup and cleanses the lid without causing any burning at all.  When I rated my transaction for some reason I could not give it 5 stars, so I will do it here.</li>
    <li> I previously used the Ocusoft single use cleansing pads, and now use this foaming cleanser.  It was recommended during a consult with a new eye doctor.  It is excellent, much better than attempting to use baby shampoo, which breaks up the tear film and is irritating.  This is so gentle, does a great job of eliminating the daily buildup on my lashes from blepharitis and even removes my eye makeup well.  No burning, rinses clean.  I think I could wash my face with it!  I still use the pads for travelling.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  My eyes were always irritated using diluted baby shampoo.  With mild blepharitis, I prefer to scrub with a cotton swab.  The foam is wonderful.  In fact, I gave up my expensive department store soap and use the foam to wash my face also.  A small puff is all I need.  It lasts more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Used the pads before and this is easier and just as effective! Nothing to open and discard, just squeeze a small amount of foam out and use! &lt;br /&gt;Pads are good for travelling.  I like to keep this in the shower.</li>
    <li> I forgot to bring it on vacation, and had to spend $19 for sterilid at CVS for a tiny, tiny qty.    I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m scrubbing with gold when I use this product, and it works great!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  I use it twice a day prior to putting lubricating eye drops in my eyes because I have blepharitis (dry eyes).  It does not irritate my eyes.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price and the product works perfectly for my blephritis and kerititis.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It helps clean the grit out of my eyes from the lubricant I put in at night for dry eye and really makes them feel better</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, whose ophthalmologist &amp;#34;prescribed&#x27;. My husband preferred the liquid, but that type is apparently no longer made. The foam is OK.</li>
    <li> If you have any sort of eye problem, I believe buying this eyelid cleanser will help! I have read online that even if you wash your eyelids with face wash, you have not truly washed them. This can lead to or worsen eye problems. This eyelid cleanser works very well, and following the advice of another reviewer I keep the bottle in the shower and apply it to my eyelids after I have washed my face. Plus- if you wear eye makeup, this actually doubles as an eye makeup remover! It removes eye makeup so well that you will almost not believe it. I actually apply it to both the top and bottom lid in order to clean up any eyeliner. Plus, it can&#x27;t hurt to clean both lids. I think that you will find this product to be very helpful, so try it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Amazon because it was cheaper than the stores.  My eye doctor said I needed this.  It&#x27;s easy to use, rub the foam on your eyes with a washcloth and rinse.  It is not irritating.  But I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you whether or not the product works.  I don&#x27;t feel a difference now and before I used it.  I guess I have to wait to my next eye doctor appointment to be sure.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get through allergy season without this product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to prevent eye styes and just to clean your eyes PERIOD! I love the fact that it removes makeup too! I&#x27;ve got eczema around my eyes and this NEVER affects it. So this is great for sensitive eyes too! highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Several years ago my ophthalmologist recommended I cleans my eyelids every morning (and when my eyes feel tired) to preclude those nasty and painful sties.  Ocusoft is what she recommended and I have used it every day since.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foaming Cleanser along with several other less costly products.  You get what you pay for....this product is far superior to the other products he suggested.  It leaves no residue or film and it&#x27;s gentle on the lashes and lids.  Half a pump does the trick.  This is my second purchase of Ocusoft Foaming Eyelid Cleanser so I can tell you that the 7.25 oz bottle lasts a long time, the previous bottle lasted 12 months and I used it daily.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 5 years.  Really helps with eyelid problems.  Glad to find it at a good price.  Saves me a trip to the eye doctor.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 1 month (for Blephoritis) and am not sure if it is helping. I was following my Ophthalmologists instructions of baby shampoo for about 8 months but it left my eyes dry and itchy. Then I tried a bottle of SteriLid foaming cleanser until it ran out (1 month). The SteriLid seemed to make my eyes feel better but it was very expensive so I decided to try Ocusoft. Ocusoft is a similar foaming cleanser but comes in a larger bottle that would last 6-8 months or more.  However, at this time, I don&#x27;t think it may be effective for Blephoritis. Today, I used Ocusoft Plus lid scrub pads and my eyes seem to feel better. Unfortunately, the Ocusoft Plus pads are very expensive.</li>
    <li> I suffer from frequent styes - I had horrible acne when I was in my teens, so I imagine now that they&#x27;re gone, they still manifest themselves into little annoying styes! (Oily lids) So far so good - I&#x27;ll update my review if I get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for styes, but it actually cured another issue I had. With my bad allergies, I often had blurry/dizzy vision and always felt my eyes were &amp;#34;not awake&amp;#34; yet during the day. No more! I use this as I wake up and for the first time since I was a child I feel wide awake and bright eyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also removes eye makeup wonderfully. No stinging, very gentle, not over drying. A crucial part if my daily routine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I bought 12 ply gauzes, cut them into squares, and with this pump and some warm water I&#x27;ve created my own eye wipes.</li>
    <li> My mom has horrible dry eyes (we were driving 12 hours one way to a specialist to treat it for a while) and her eye doctor suggested she try using this eye scrub.  Since then, she has had me try it (I also have a milder case of dry eyes, and get frequent clogged tear-ducts) and wow I love it.  In addition to helping a little with the dry eye stuff, it doesn&#x27;t sting and takes off eye makeup great.</li>
    <li> Occusoft lid scrub is the best!  My husband has been using this product for years and years on a daily basis.  Thanks for getting this product to us in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, have to keep the eyelids clean due to dry eyes and this works perfectly and lasts a long time.  Amazon delivers this which is also great.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product for scrubing eyelids.  This size should last you a long time too, at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Get yourself a method hand soap bottle, about $3 - empty it out and rinse it thoroughly with water including the pump FREE.  Now you have foaming dispenser.  Get some eyewash solution, which is basically purified water.  $5 est, get a bottle of no tears baby shampoo or shampoo and body wash $5.  Mix 1/2 and 1/2 plus or minus in the bottle or adjust it to your liking.  Ok you&#x27;re up to about 13 but you have about 10 times more soap.  You can also refill this bottle for travel which is actually really nice.  So I purchased this bottle and when it&#x27;s empty I will refill it with my own much less expensive, yet equally effective solution.  Now I have a nice bottle at my sink and one for travel.  What could be better?  It does work well for makeup as well.  If you up the ratio of soap just a bit it works even better.  I like the flexibility of adjusting my own ratio.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because I switched from glasses to contacts.  My doctor said I have dry eye, and \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; the eyes will ensure contact comfort. Of course it works miracles for that!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add, though, that even when I wore glasses and my dry eye was undiagnosed, I had eye trouble.  I was told it was from allergies but Claritin did nothing for my eyes of course.  I&#x27;d wake up with red, puffy, tearing eyes BECAUSE that&#x27;s what happens when dry eyes stress out.&lt;br /&gt;This product is comfortable enough for me to use daily, and good enough to make the difference to eye comfort with or without contacts.  I&#x27;m a return customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I use this product to prevent eye infections as recommended by my eye doctor. This is very convenient to use in the shower. No pads, no nothing. The size for the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent for sufferers of Blepheritis.  I use the product at least once per day to help clean oil and debris from my eyelids.  As gentle as baby shampoo and the foam is easy to apply and massage into the eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This product is easier to use than the normal swabs in packages.  Much better value to buy on-line than in the docs office.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me.  I wish I could buy it at drugstores. The pads don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and a very good price.</li>
    <li> Good service, prompt delivery. Very pleased with the product. It provides a combination of effective cleaning, ease of application and lack of discomfort. Will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> Man this stuff is like liquid gold! Expensive for the size but works! Initially recommended to me by my eye doc for my mild blephartis I have found this works as a general all around cleaner for face breakouts as well as cleaning my eyelids. Has a neutral to mildly-chemical scent (not perfumed) but not too annoying and it works. Amazon seems to always have the best price on this no matter who is selling it compared to either your eye doc or the mass merchandisers (if you can even find it there.) This stuff works so well I almost want to schedule auto delivery on it. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended washing my eyelids to prevent sties but the methods suggested were cumbersome. This product makes it much easier and faster. Puts out a nice gentle foam onto a finger tip.</li>
    <li> A grand way to clean my eyelids.  Was  using  Ocusoft wipes, but I like the foam much better.  Wipes are good for travel, though.  All in all a great product and I am glad it&#x27;s available.  My eyelids  need to be washed every morning because of the eye drops I have to use during the evening hours.  This does it cleanly and comfortably.  I use a sterile 3 x 3 gauze pad, wet it first with tap water, squeeze it out a bit,  open it one fold, then use the foam on one eyelid, wipe it clean with the unused side, turn the pad and do the same with the other eyelid.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> A previous order was linked to this page so assumed it was the 7.25oz (415ml) size since no size was stated. Received the 50ml tiny bottle instead for almost the same price as the 8x bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It removes all of my eye makeup and helps my eyes feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Great product and this is a great size.  Works really well in the shower for allergy eyes and for blepharitis.</li>
    <li> The Ocusoft lid scrub was recommended by my eye doctor and after using it daily for the past couple weeks, I would recommend it to others.  I also ordered it for my parents, who are getting up there in the years.  Anyone out there using baby shampoo for their eyes should give this a try.</li>
    <li> my eye dr recommended I use this every morning. I usually just rinse my eyes for about a min w warm water then apply this foam and scrub for another minute. I eyes feels so much better since I started this.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with sty&#x27;s for years. My eye doctor recommended Ocusoft lid scrub foam and it has made them disappear! Also helps remove eye makeup without irritation. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Gentle on eyes. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back to my old eyelid cleanser.  It was really expensive, and this stuff does the trick for about half the cost.  I use it daily to battle chalazions / blepharitis and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now. works well to temporarily relieve that &amp;#34;allergy itchy eye&amp;#34; syndrome. very safe, effective foam cleaner for daily eye care.</li>
    <li> This lid scrub is great and I like that it does not iritate your eyes at all.  It has a clean smell and for the eye area you want something real gentle. This is my second time to order it and I will be ording it again.</li>
    <li> Very gentle, effective eyelid cleanser.  It is easier to use than the individual pads because you can apply it in the shower and then thoroughly rinse.  It completely alleviates the itchy and teary eyes i get from allergies.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use every morning in the shower.  My eyes do not feel as irritated as they normally do.</li>
    <li> an optometrist recommended that I get this because I was starting to have difficulties wearing my contacts (after 40 years!)   these types of products were not to be found anywhere, except online.  this particular product has much more in it than the other one - great value -- its good to be able to really clean my eyelids and lashes, i know that there is a lot living there! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely maner. Product is as expected.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to clean my eyelids. I started using it at the advice of my ophthalmologist. The big bottle is much better deal. Even though it says the formula doesn&#x27;t sting, I&#x27;ve found that it does. You really have to rinse it off quickly after use.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes.  I&#x27;ve spent the past 2+ yrs with eyes that look puffy, hung over red, watered all day long and very irritated.  All because of the products I was using.  My new eye doctor recommended the scrub pads, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about scrubbing my eyelids?  I randomly stumbled upon OcuSoft Foam and it has CHANGED my life!  Sooo gentle and it completely removes all your eye make up.  I even stopped using it to see what happened and all my symptoms reappeared... then I went back to using OcuSoft Foam and my eyes cleared right up!!  I highly recommend this product to anyone...even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> We have used this product for some years now and find it satisfactory. We also use the pre-moistened pads, for example when traveling.  There is NO WAY to find the size being offered in Amazon&#x27;s description. A terrible oversight.  Peter McCorison</li>
    <li> Worked fairly well, eyes a lot better now</li>
    <li> Works well.  This was recommended by our eye doctor.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to remove make up and to control some eye issues.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its the only cleanser I use on my eyes. I have damaged corneas and I cannot make tears anymore due to a bad reaction from a prescription medication.I use Ocusoft every morning and evening and have never had a problem with it. The bottle last such a long time(months) so for the price, it is definitely worth it.If anyone has a special need when it pertains to cleaning their eyelids, should seriously consider this product. Thanks again,your customer,Angela</li>
    <li> excellent size and applicability</li>
    <li> Works great and good price.</li>
    <li> Finally a product to help with the eyelid problem!!!  After trying and loving this product my eye doctor asked me how I liked it, I recommended it highly.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my ophthalmologist because I have severe dry eye syndrome.  It has been extremely helpful. Can&#x27;t recommended it highly enough for anyone with symptomatic dry eye syndrome.</li>
    <li> I keep this in the shower and use it everyday to avoid eye issues. Does a very good job of thoroughly cleaning your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the OcuSoft Lid Scrub Foaming Eyelid Cleanser for over a year now.  I have &#x27;dry eye&#x27; because the moisture secreting glands on my eyelids get plugged up, then the eye gets irritated and red which meant I had to the eye surgeon to get prescription antibiotic eye drops.  I&#x27;m on the computer daily, so also don&#x27;t blink enough to keep the surface of the eye moist.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser night and day, plus Refresh eye drops, I haven&#x27;t had the dry eye problems.  This cleanser comes out foamy so I apply with my fingers, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin around the eye area.  When I&#x27;ve traveled and forgotten to take the cleanser, I soon pay the price, so I know it works.  But use a cosmetic cleanser to take off eye make-up first; OcuSoft is gentle and so doesn&#x27;t have the heavy cleanser to remove make-up.  If you use the OcuSoft with mascara and eyeliner still on, some of the make-up will dissolve and creep into the eyes - and that burns.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that worked very well for me in controlling my blepharitis. Before using this product I had chronic dry, red, irritated eyes. After using this product daily, my problems vanished. Convenience is key for me. The doctor telling me to use the corner of a washcloth or Qtip with baby shampoo resulted in me not doing anything. And I couldn&#x27;t stomach the price and waste of the single use lid scrub pads. With the foaming hand pump of this product, I simply applied it in the shower and gently scrubbed with my fingertips for 15 seconds, once daily. That&#x27;s it, problem solved. The price of this product is very reasonable. The large bottle lasts about 9 months for me. Compare to the cost of the single use pads or the Sterilid product, and you will see how reasonable this product is priced.</li>
    <li> My previous optometrist had said that I have dry eyes so I thought that this lid scrub would help after reading all the reviews.  I stumbled upon this by accident -- had never heard of a lid scrubber.  I don&#x27;t know if it really helped my so-called dry eyes, but I noticed that I get minimal mid-day eye discharge (you know that gunk that accumulates in the corners of your eyes).  I only use it in the morning solely for that reason.  It&#x27;s important to me because it&#x27;s embarrassing when you have stuff in your eyes.  And unless you&#x27;re very careful in removing it, your eye makeup may be disturbed.      I also tried it at night and it reduces discharge overnight too.  But since I don&#x27;t have a medical issue, I thought it might be too harsh on my eyes to use it 2x a day.  I tested its abilty to remove eye liner but it failed miserably.  But that might be because my eye liner was heavy duty (Tarte Amazonian clay liner).  Even Bare Minerals Active Soil Purifying Cleanser which claims to remove eye makeup could not remove it.  Used my DHL deep cleansing oil--easy.      I was going to clean my 14-year old dog&#x27;s eyes with the lid scrubber because he has certifible dry eyes (takes meds).  But after I read the directions that it has to be rinsed out, I only used a small dab for both of his eyes and wiped off with wet cotton rounds.  It didn&#x27;t seem to bother him but I don&#x27;t want to risk harming him with a human product.     Great discovery and good buy.</li>
    <li> I used the original Ocusoft pads and got the Lid Scrub foam right when it came out. I still have the bottle after almost six months and I use it daily. It&#x27;s a lot easier for me because I just put the bottle right in the shower and scrub my lids each morning. This product is so effective; my eyes don&#x27;t itch, look red, or feel dry since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gentle yet effective in removing eye makeup or irritants.</li>
    <li> Yes! Very satisfied with the product, price, and delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this for plugged tear ducts causing me great pain.  I got a small container from the doctor but when I wanted to replace, I went to Amazon and got twice the quantity for the same price.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> I kept getting eye infections and this was recommended to me by my eye doctor.  I love the product, it&#x27;s gentle and can be kept in the shower for easy use.</li>
    <li> I was awakened a few times in the middle of the night with incredibly painful burning in my one of my eyes.  Come to find out, my eyes had become so dried out while I slept that they literally cracked, like dry skin.  Ocusoft lid scrub was recommended by my eye doctor.  It removes oils that accumulate on your eyelids and can dry out your eyes.  I use this ocusoft every day, morning and night and it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you get any in your eyes while cleaning your eyelids because it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  It is easy to use and the bottle lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product and literally a life-changer.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but I don&#x27;t understand the justification for charging 14 dollars for a small bottle (Theratear&#x27;s-Sterilid charges exhorbitantly high for this too) for something that contains ingredients found elswehere in much cheaper products (compare the ingredients list to a bottle of baby shampoo, they&#x27;re very similar).  Fortunately, Dial has come up a new product that has an aerator spray head for their new foaming handwash.  Once you finish using the foaming hand wash, clean out all the old soap that is in there (using water), including the soap in the nozzle.  Then fill the bottle with 50% baby shampoo and 50% Collyrium water (or distilled water), or whatever combination works best for you.  Shake the bottle up and you have a low cost replacement for Ocusoft lid scrub or Theratears Sterilid.</li>
    <li> Optometrist Recommended</li>
    <li> Been using the lid scrub for years. love it.</li>
    <li> Cleans lids without irritation</li>
    <li> No scent, no irritation. This has really helped my blepharitis.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day for my blepharitis along with the thera pearl eye mask. Really relieves my dry eyes.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using Ocusoft for dry eyes for several years now. It clears the gunk that accumulates on her eye rims and provides relief from the aching and itching symptomatic of her condition. Its is also very easy for her to use.</li>
    <li> i have moderate to severe dry eye syndrome.  using this twice a day definitely improves my symptoms.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and could not find it easily.  The product I used was only the liquid and not the foaming stuff.  Found from the manufacturer the formula is the same and you can take off the top to just use the liquid if desired.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been sold a similar product by our opthalmologist.  It cost the same as this did except it was just 1.5 oz.  Took a chance on this and checked the ingredients and they are the same.  What a deal!  We will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> Works great as long as you keep up on it daily</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me by my ophthalmologist after my cataract surgery.  It cleans the eyelids of any guck that may have formed after a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than other eye cleansers for me.  Lasts a long time too.  Not only removes makeup and truly cleans the eye area, but you can use as a total face cleanser in a pinch.  Removes oils and debris without drying the skin.  I give this five stars.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great ship time.  Love the scrub more than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Using it now for dry eye issues,  but wish I new about it years ago.</li>
    <li> I get little fluid filled bumps on my eyelid sometimes and bought this at the recommendation of my eye doctor. This cleanser really seems to help clean and prevent the bumps from appearing. It&#x27;s also great at removing eye makeup, even the waterproof mascara. I always was my eyes with this and then run my whole face, works great as a bedtime face wash.</li>
    <li> For those people with Blepharitis this is absolutely the only thing you want to use to scrub your eye lids with.  It cleans your eyes without destroying your skin.</li>
    <li> Reduced the number of styes I was getting from 8 to 10 a year down to none.  The OCuSOFT Lid Scrub Plus is a little better if you leave it on over night, but the original is good, especially in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product has pretty much changed my life. I went through a bout of chalazions in 2010 and thought there was no hope. I had two surgeries and it was absolutely miserable. My optometrist suggested eye lid scrubs using this product, and I have had absolutely no problems in 3 years. I do morning and night scrubs since I am so prone to chalazions, and it&#x27;s become such a part of my routine that I don&#x27;t even think about it. The product itself works great and leaves your eyes feeling clean and refreshed. If you are suffering from blepharitis or any other oil gland/eye issue, start using this stuff and be amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> Lasts much longer than the already moist towels, which are ridiculously overpriced. Not necessarily the best product if you have allergies as it tends to make the eyes a little red in some people. Lasts for quite a long time, if you are using moist towels, ditch them for this instead.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a more economical way to clean your eyelids than using the individual prepackaged pads that they make. I use the foam by applying it with a cotton ball or with my index finger. It brings instant relief to my eyelids after use.</li>
    <li> Doctor recomended - worked</li>
    <li> Ocusoft has a great product here. Much easier on the eyes than Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo or wash. If you suffer from itchy eyes this will certainly ease that some if you use it regularly to wash your eyelids.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dr. and works well.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Meibomian gland dysfunction and would get incredibly painful infected glands in my eyes. One of my eye doctors recommended this to me and since I&#x27;ve started using it I have not had a single stye. Because I use it twice a day it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it does for some people and I think it is a little pricey, but it is worth it to not have painful cysts in my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis and was told by my eye doc to start using this pre-cataract surgery. Easy to use. Non-stinging. Looks like it will last forever as I need to use very very little each time.</li>
    <li> Has eliminated eye problems.</li>
    <li> I like it BUT the company&#x27;s customer service STINKS.  About 3/4 of the way into the bottle the pump no longer worked.  I called Customer service.  They said to soak it.  I told them that I already tried that.  They said they would get back to me.  All I wanted was a new pump, not a new bottle. Never heard back.  Dr. wants me to continue using this brand so I bought a new bottle.  I will save the remaining liquid in the old one and, providing this one doesn&#x27;t freeze up as well, I&#x27;ll add it to the new one eventually.</li>
    <li> I like this product in that it cleanses my eyelids to keep blepharitis from coming back.</li>
    <li> Great eye scrub. Much better than the wipes.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use as a foaming cleanser. Better value than the individual wipes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for people who have dry eyes or other eye issues with flaking skin or dust in their eyes. The foam cleaner is easy on the eyes and is effective when trying to remove small dust or skin particles around the eye lids and eye lashes. This is also a great product for children. I call it a &amp;#34;Magic Foam&amp;#34; for their eyes and I let them wash their eyes with the foam. It can be effective in preventing styes on the eyelids since children rub their eyes usually with dirty hands and fingers. This is a great product..</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and that gets into my eyelashes, eyelids and eventually my eyes and it burns really bad and it really irritating and my eye doctor recommended this stuff and I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it is magical how well it works, my eyes are no longer irritated and burning like they would be if I wasn&#x27;t using this.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working for my eyelid issues.  I like the foaminess of the product. Easy to use with just a quick push.</li>
    <li> I use Ocusoft to wash my eyelids when my blepharitis is under control.  If my eyelids are itchy, I need something medicated.  Cliridex, bought from my opthalmologist, is the only product that actually works; however, it burns terribly.  It contains tea tree oil.  After I used it a few times though,  I was able to go back to the Ocusoft to maintain eyelid health.  p.s.  You can wash your whole face with it if you choose.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Opthalmoligist, it comes in pump (shower use) and in foil-sealed packets (on-the-go).&lt;br /&gt;The product refreshes your eyes and eliminates the &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; feeling. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelid wash &amp; use it every day.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating and cleans thoroughly.  I tried using just diluted baby shampoo with a q-tip and it stung and my eyelashes started to fall out.  Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foam just cleans my eyelids without any side effects.</li>
    <li> I had used the sterilid wet wipes in the past when my eye doctor told me i had blepharitis but i felt those were a bit too harsh on my eyelids. My eyes would become red and burn if i did not rinse for a good 5 minutes after wiping with the wipes. Then, I tried this ocusoft foam and with my first use i knew i would be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and sometimes at night. It has not irritated my eyes. Very easy to rinse off and I would say the big bottles last a good 4-6 months with daily use! The price is pretty high but I have no doubts about buying this product again and again. Using this foam scrub and my daily omega-3s has really helped keep my blepharitis under control.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended this scrub to help with my dry eye condition and it&#x27;s really great.  It is also helpful for removing eye makeup.  The 7.25 ounce container lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the advice of my ophthalmologist and just love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and non irritating to my eyes. I&#x27;ve had cataract surgery and do my best not to rub my eyes too much and this just makes it easy to clean than and remove any makeup at the same time.</li>
    <li> This cleanser if very gentle and mild.  I had minor eye irritation due to wearing contacts, and cleansing with the Ocusoft Lid Scrub really helped to get rid of the redness. I just started using it, but believe it will be a permanent part of my routine.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Application is easy, it does the job nicely without any irritation to the eyelid,  and it is a great value disposed in this manner. You can use just the amount you want, thereby saving you money.</li>
    <li> This product I have found to give my eyes a lot of relief.  Regular use has cleared up my tear ducts,which my optomotrist said were clogged.  It feels good to use, and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great value for one who uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis so I use this to get rid of the flakes that appear on my eye lashes. I use this in the morning and before bed so I can go out in public and not feel self-conscious. This hasn&#x27;t cured anything but it treats the symptoms. Before this I was using the Ocusoft wipes (both the light blue and dark blue one) and those don&#x27;t last very long. One box of those wipes lasted me a little more than a month. On the other hand, this tube lasted me 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now this is the cheapest and best way to keep my blepharitis under control. If anyone has any other product recommendations or tips I welcome them.</li>
    <li> Have been buying this for 4 years. Delivery is always quick. Product has been great with the excpetion of one two-bottle order that would not foam correctly. But highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Satisfactory.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try and stimulate more moisture for my dry eyes, but it&#x27;s irritating to my eyes, so I can&#x27;t use it. Oddly the stronger leave-on version is less irritating so I use that as needed instead.</li>
    <li> Love this product for cleaning my eyes everyday. This is so gentle and makes my eyes feel so clean. It has helped me a lot with my eye condition.</li>
    <li> Have used the individual Ocusoft packets over the years and find this easy to use in the shower.  Seems to be doing the job just fine.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have used this foam for several years. It was first given to me after my lasix procedure by the doctor. It works better than (and is cheaper than) the Clinique I had used for years. My eyes never itch anymore!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use- I just put one pump worth of foam on my fingers and massage onto  my lids. Have been using this about a month.Gentle and non irritating. Also have the disposable pads which I now use for travel. .</li>
    <li> This is great product I used twice daily to get over hump of bruferiis (spelling) in my eye now down to ounce a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have really dry eyes. So dry that I don&#x27;t even like using diluted Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo to gently scrub my lash line. This product is so gentle that I barely think about dryness when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> very soothing to your eyes, especially if you have allergies</li>
    <li> not bad, my doctor recommended this to me, i like it</li>
    <li> Why you need special scrub for your eyes is beyond me, but my mother swears by this stuff. It is MADE IN THE USA so no concern but putting chinese chemicals in your eyes :)</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Price was the reason I purchased on Line.&lt;br /&gt;Received as promised by ad</li>
    <li> This is by far and away the best value for cleaning eyelids. I have had problems with blepharitis and find the cost of the pre-treated scrub pads to be outrageous. I use this product with generic facial cleaning pads at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> As we age, we&#x27;re more prone to sties, dry eyes, and eye irritations from dandruff-like particles that descend from the eyelid into the eye.  I believe the latter is called blepharitis. In any case, my well-regard optometrist recommended I use OcuSoft daily in the shower. I&#x27;ve seen real benefits and it&#x27;s very easy to use. And unlike drugs, it has no side effects. For me, it was well worth trying. I&#x27;m now on my third bottle. And the bottle lasts a long time. I use it daily yet a bottle lasts a year. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years since it was recommended by an ophthamologist; really helps eliminate the problems associated with blepharitis (condition that causes little flakes on the eyelashes) and irritated lids.</li>
    <li> I Use This All The Time, Actually Every Day! It Does The Job For Me!</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly,  and meant my needs very well.</li>
    <li> I got it cheaper and quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> I have granulated eyelids and this helps to clean them</li>
    <li> Cleaning my eyelids morning and night has made a huge difference in my dry eye problems.  Ocusoft is just as good as the Sterilid purchased at my local pharmacy, but much more economical.  This stuff is great!  I buy two at a time to save shipping costs.</li>
    <li> Great product, really does a good job cleaning the crap off my eyelashes that I have every morning</li>
    <li> Good product. Much cheaper than the individual packets and the product helps clean the eyelids and is quite soothing as well.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended this and it is so much better than the product I bought at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Cleans thoroughly, and with less irritation than the previous product I was using to wash my eyelids: baby shampoo. Recommended by my optometrist.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  I have very sensitive skin and eyes, with a tendency towards Blepharitis.  Daily use of this eyelid cleanser keeps that in check with no burning, stinging or eye irritation.  It&#x27;s so much cheaper to use this large bottle of the foaming cleanser with a clean washcloth, than to buy those individual pads.  I do use the individual pads for trips but this is the way to go for home use.  I have tried other eyelid cleanser products that I did not like nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;Quite pleased with the product and will continue to use it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for years. I like it because it does not burn my eyes and like the foamy feeling and most of all it cleans very well.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this product very gentle eye wash no tears burning or redness superb</li>
    <li> Excellent foaming eyelid cleanser.. After use of 1 week,  I do not have sticky or itchy eyes anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ocusoft lid scrub 2 times a day, for a number of years using the pads.  Then I bought the foaming cleanser.  It works just as well (be sure to wash hands first) and a 7.25 oz container will last for about 1 year -- this is a very substantial saving over the pads.  So this is a FINE Product at a GREAT Price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My blepharitis used to prevent me from wearing contacts for more than an hour at a time.  Now, I can wear them all day without any trouble.  It&#x27;s amazing, and at this size and price, much cheaper than the local pharmacy</li>
    <li> My eyelids felt gritty but after using Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foaming Eyelid cleanser my eyelids felt clean and I like it.</li>
    <li> For those of us who are older and suffer from Blepharitis, this really helps, and it&#x27;s far less expensive that the individually packaged pads.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! No need to use the foil packets when I&#x27;m not traveling.</li>
    <li> Give it a try, it might work for you. It doesn&#x27;t work for me, but a competing product works great. This one seems like it&#x27;s baby shampoo or something similar. The other one I use feels and smells more like medicine, not soap or shampoo, and seems to clear up my eye discharge and irritation better. However, the competing product costs about the same for 1.62 oz, while this contains 7.25 oz. So if this one works for you, it&#x27;s definitely a better deal.</li>
    <li> Container label creates a navy ink when it is wet. It is meant to be used in the shower but when the paper on the container gets wet it leaves a navy ring on my tub. I have used this product before without this happening, so I&#x27;m wondering if this product from Interspective LLC could be a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;.  Or may be occusoft changed the container.  Amazon refunded my money minus a $3.59 re-stocking fee. I would like to use the product again, but don&#x27;t want to be disappointed again by the container.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now for blepharitis (chronic inflammation of the eye lids)  it is the best thing I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of products.</li>
    <li> I have used Ocusoft foaming eyelid cleanser for several years, but found it expensive.  I was delighted to find Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years, as recommended by my eye Dr.  It is difficult to find in stores and I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I never thought to look before!  I&#x27;m not really sure how I feel about it&#x27;s effectiveness.  It seems to only work after applying a warm washcloth  to my eyes for 5 minutes prior to using it, but I continue to use it due to my dry eye condition.</li>
    <li> I was fooled into thinking this was the larger container of Occusoft Foam (7.5 oz) that I had purchased before.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the other (regular Lid Scrub) but it costs the same amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years,  however this is the first time purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This foam keeps my eyes clean and comfortable.  I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery of this product was fast, the next two-day deliver happened.  I was happy about that.  The package was perfect when received.</li>
    <li> Great product . Soothes the eyes and refreshes. Be sure fingers are clean before applying. Get the large size it lasts for almost a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> As effective as you soft plus.</li>
    <li> this works just fine and is so much less expensive than the alternative wipes plus there is much less in my waste basket. This one bottle is going to last for several months as compared to 30 days for the box of wipes and costs less than double.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use, gentle on my eyelids, and convenient.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser, promoted by the optommetrist has nothing to recommend its value against cost</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. I have a high prescription and my contact lenses are thicker than regular contacts. I tend to blink a lot while wearing them, and I&#x27;ve also gotten a couple of styes in the past from eye irritation and dryness. This cleanser makes my eyes feel less fatigued and dry, even several hours into wearing my contacts. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough. They&#x27;re also great to use after taking your contacts off or at the end of the day, as they &amp;#34;awaken&amp;#34; your eyes and don&#x27;t make them feel so heavy and tired.</li>
    <li> Super large bottle perfect for refilling the travel size ones.</li>
    <li> Buying the product this way is a great deal more practical from a cost viewpoint than the single wet compresss packages for day-to-day use. It&#x27;s nice to have some of the ready packages for travel purposes, but nearly all of the time I&#x27;m very satisfied with a squirt of foam from the bulk container which really isn&#x27;t very bulky and the soft detergent has never irritated my eyes. You can easily apply with clean fingers, or a washcloth if you prefer.</li>
    <li> It is good. Really big i think it will be enou to use for over 6 months easily.  However it dries my eyelid a little bit.</li>
    <li> This is the best lid foam product I&#x27;ve found for my daughter&#x27;s blepharitis. The diluted baby shampoo (recommended by Doc) irritated her eyes and another ophthalmologic foam contained tea tree oil which also irritated her eyes. I tried the wipes too but the fabric was not soft so she didn&#x27;t like it. This product is great, has a nice thick lather and is gentle while keeping my kid&#x27;s eyes clean. I sometimes use it to remove make up and it works great.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear my contacts more that 2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opthamologist told me about ocusoft and I&#x27;ve been wearing my contacts everyday since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All people with contact issues should know about this product.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye, and in addition to hot compresses, the optometrist recommended opti-soft eye scrubs. A package of 30 only lasts 15 days, at a cost of 66 cents a day. Also, I kept having to run to Walmart for more because they are the only place I&#x27;ve found them.     The Foaming Eyelid cleaner lasts much longer, and I use it on my wite&#x27;s makeup remover pads, at a cost of maybe 6 cents a day. I can&#x27;t tell any deterioration in cleaning, and the pads are easier on my eyes.    I ordered two bottles and will reorder more when they run out.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It was recommended by my eye doctor for my dry eyes. Works very well and I’m glad I found this product. It  has made wearing contacts much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Best Lid scrub my wife has ever used in the business and at the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ocusoft,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Vance</li>
    <li> Like most people using this product, I have blepharitis. I&#x27;ve tried several different products from foaming cleansers to eye scrub pads.  Occusoft eyelid cleanser works very well and is economical in the 215 mL size.  Sterilid eyelid cleanser works excellent because of the melaleuca (tea tree) oil it contains but is very expensive.  The melaleuca oil is a natural antiseptic and solvent.  It is also the distinctive odor of the SteriLid product.      I find I can have the best of both worlds by blending the two products.  I mix 9 parts of OCuSOFT foaming eyelid cleanser with 1 part SteriLid eyelid cleanser in a used bottle of one of the products.  (Note: the lids of each type of bottle unscrew.) This works great!</li>
    <li> Having used the product for less than a month, I&#x27;m still getting familiar with using FOAM cleanser for my eyes.  IGENE Daily Eyelid Cleanser, which I have used for a number of years, is a viscous fluid which I sincerely feel did a better job of cleaning off mascara.  However, since I can no longer find it, I shall learn to be happy with OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM.  It works just fine, but it takes a second scrubbing to really do the job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is impossible to find in stores. I&#x27;m so happy that it was available here at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> An excellant eyelid cleanser at an excellant price.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my eyelids feeling soft and clean. I&#x27;ve had no problem with flaking skin since using this product.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye specialist.  Perfect for removing small pieces of mascara that tend to stick in your lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with Blepharitis&lt;br /&gt;For years. I finally found a eye Dr who suggested Ocusoft foaming cleanser &amp; it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked! It&#x27;s worth every penny! A bottle usually last atleast 6 months. I keep it in the shower &amp; wash my eyes with it for a few seconds in the shower each day. It&#x27;s also good for removing make up.</li>
    <li> The lid scrub foam does a great job cleaning the &amp;#34;cruft&amp;#34; from my eye lids.  I use it with ordinary gauze pads.  This is a much better value than buying the individually wrapped eye lid pads.</li>
    <li> My first bottle lasted 9 month&#x27;s It is a very good product.  It removes all the oily residue from your eye lids. Freshen your eyes every day using it in the morning or before you go to sleep. My eye doctor sell it for $20.00. This a good price &amp; not having to go get it.</li>
    <li> The order was shipped promptly and arrived when expected. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it works great!</li>
    <li> Wash your face with it to keep eye area clean and almost allergy-free. My eye doctor first suggested it.&lt;br /&gt;Pump container is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower every morning and when my eyes feel tired and itchy.  Immediate and long lasting relief.  If you are always rubbing and messing with your eyes, try this.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended that I use this to remove my eye make-up each night before washing my face to help with my eye allergies and irritation.  I love that I can order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This brand costs a fraction of the one recommended by my ophthalmologist. Occusoft lid scrub foam does the work very nicely, and it lasts 3 times longer! I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Very good eye wash. Does the job well, keeping my mother&#x27;s eyes very clear without creating any irritation or discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product has helped a lot with my ocular rosacea.  I like the foam, it seems like there is no waste.</li>
    <li> Much better than the little pad things that seem last about a week for a whole carton. This foaming stuff works just as well but with your finger or a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> I use the ocusoft lid scrub foam as makeup remover and a lid-scrub. It works better than most other makeup remover products and doesnt sting. The foam makes it a little easier to use because you don&#x27;t need water at first!</li>
    <li> Gentle but cleansing.  Absolutely no stinging.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Suggested to me by my Eye Dr....seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Removes every bit of eye makeup without rubbing. The pump releases a puffy cloud of product in your hand--then you just apply it to the eye area, wipe ever-so-gently with your fingers, (absolutely no rubbing required) and rinse. It&#x27;s a must-have product. Light years beyond any eye makeup remover out there, even the ones marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of my ophthamologist, I have been using this product for several years.  Works well and buying via Amazon is more economical than purchasing at the ophthamologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Who knew that your eyelids need to be washed?  It really works and helps with dry or irritated eyes.  Use it every day along with a Thermalon Dry Eye Compress.  You should feel a difference within 2 weeks of everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally love this product!  It is easy to use, no perfumery smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting. (some wipes by other companies that I tried were way too strong)  The Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foaming Eyelid Cleanser is fabulous! A little bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review helpful in your product search.</li>
    <li> Recommended by doctor; great price!</li>
    <li> Long story short I got my item a month after my order because they shipped me someone else&#x27;s order. After emailing with the company rep, he didn&#x27;t keep me in the loop as to when I would get the item I ordered. Very frustrating experience. You&#x27;d expect more from a medical supply company. The item I ordered was for my health and the  company rep had no urgency for the mix up. I&#x27;ll never order from here again. My order should have been free.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and have it in my medicine cabinet and shower for use every day.  I&#x27;m very happy to say that the small size travels very well (I&#x27;ve never had a leak) and lets my eye lids feel clean and clear while I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing product for preventing styes.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with both blepharitis and dry eye. Docs recommended using the eye wipes which I did for a while (both Ocusoft and other brands). Then I discovered this on Amazon. I find it a lot easier and quicker to use than the wipes, not to mention more economical. I just squeeze a small amount of foam out and divide between both hands (fingers) and gently massage both eyes at the same time. (No slight stinging like I have experienced from some pads.) Then gently rinse with warm water. To me, most wipes seemed a little rough on the gentle eye area. No more dealing with the packet....locating, opening and disposing. (Wipes would be better for travel, of course.) This 7.25 oz bottle surely delivers more foam for the buck than the wipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/15/13: I had a follow-up appt this week with my ophthamologist, and he said my dry eye has improved a lot and looks much better. Dry eye can be caused by blepharitis, in part. I believe using this lid scrub, as well as hot compresses and drops, are how I got a better report from the doc. Very happy about that! It is something you just have to keep on top of.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have been very pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is the best and cheapest. The large bottle last for months. I wet a soft paper towel (Viva) and use that to apply the cleanser and scrub the eyelid. Very effective. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product was fine as was the dely and service</li>
    <li> Better value than other lid scrubs. Does a great job removing dirt and makeup. Very gentle formula.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis, and based on the many positive reviews, bought this eyelid cleanser with high hopes.  But I have very sensitive, fair skin.  I used this wash per directions two days in a row and it made the skin under my eyes burn.  Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could send it back.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, is not irritating to my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have been using for years now to clean my eyes. Takes make up off as well.</li>
    <li> Used it before - it&#x27;s a good product that does the Jo</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend and she swears it is very good!</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I had never had a stye until I reached retirement age. This Ocusoft foam does a very good job of cleaning the eye lids without irritating them.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to use for blephartis and it is easy to use with a clean washcloth or just your fingers.</li>
    <li> Ocusoft is much less expensive than SteriLid, and may be a good product for ordinary use, but I did not find it effective in warding off blepharitis.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice daily to keep my eyelids clean. Helps keep my blepharitis under control. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It removes my eye makeup and cleans the eye area. I can use a wash cloth or my hands to work it. Much better then the cloths, at least for me.</li>
    <li> After my optometrist treated my eye infection he recommended that I use Ocusoft lid scrub foam daily.  Since then I haven&#x27;t had another infection.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, and as an added bonus is a gentle eye makeup remover.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and online the small size is more common.  It&#x27;s a much better deal in the 7.25 oz. size!</li>
    <li> I use this product in the shower. It&#x27;s easy to use that way and incorporate into your daily routine. I love it and it&#x27;s way more economical than the pads.</li>
    <li> It does what it is intended for, it is easy to use and soothing for the eyes. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product for the prevention of infection (especially for those with ultra-sensitive eyes).  The travel size comes in handy as well.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes. This seems to calm my eyelids and my eyes feel fresh after using this product.</li>
    <li> Suffer from dry eyes and my eye Dr. sold me this product through her office.  I found it to be really helpful, and use it every day.  My eye issues have improved significantly.  When I ran out, I found it here for a better price and it was exactly the same size and kind the Dr. sold me, so I saved some $ and it was more convenient to get it delivered in the mail.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended this product for cleaning for eyelids.  It is difficult to find in the local pharmacy, in fact they have to special order it.  With Amazon the price is good and the delivery is fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended that I use OcuSoft Lid Scrub Foaming Eyelid cleanser.</li>
    <li> As good as the Ocusoft pads and much more economical.  I just use my finger tips and foam to wash my eyelash lines.  So much better than than the baby shampoo my doctor has recommended which is harsh harsh harsh.  Oh those poor babies.  What are we thinking?</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference using Ocusoft makes.  The feeling tells you that the excess oils have been removed.  And it&#x27;s formula is not irritating to the eye.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Even the mildest facial cleanser or regular soap irritates my eyelids, making them itchy all day. This stuff is mild and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
    <li> My Othamologist&#x27;s most recommended product to help combat severe dry related issues.</li>
    <li> My optometrist recommended that I buy lid scrub to prevent styes. It has an awful moldy/musty smell that lingers even after rinsing off when applying in the shower. I&#x27;m not sure if others can smell when I use it, but I can for hours afterward. So I&#x27;ve stopped using it and will not buy this particular brand again.</li>
    <li> Comes out of the pump as foam already.  Allows me to quickly wash my eyelids and feels refreshing for my eyes.  I bought this because I feel my eyes are always tired looking - I stare at a computer all day, so this seems to help them feel refreshed.  I&#x27;m a fan, and it seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I had an overnight eye condition that I first thought was allergies. Just by chance I had my glasses adjusted and my eye doctor had a look and determined I had blipheritis and suggested I use this product. It worked and I continue to use it each night and can tell if I skip a night. Also comes in travel packets and a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have Ocular Rosacea and since it&#x27;s not observable to others they don&#x27;t see how much irritation and fatigue you face every day.  It affects vision, ability to be outdoors in sunlight, and reading.  I get occasional Styes, which is very painful and takes 5-7 days to heal.  Occusoft foam cleanse to my eye lids every morning and before bed provide soothing calm to the irritated eye lids.  I will never stop using it, it makes my condition bearable every day.  The larger 214ml size is reasonable, and lasts a couple of months, so I always have it on hand.  I bought the 50ml for travel, which fits in my travel bag easily.</li>
    <li> Chronic eye infection ~ Opthamologist strongly recommended O/S Lid Scrub to be used daily.  Your prices were the best and being a senior citizen ~ all pricing assistance is appreciated.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old gets styes in her right eye all the time. When we use this foam cleanser at bedtime she doesn&#x27;t get them any more. When we forget to use it she gets them right back again. It is nice and sensitive. Does not burn the eyes and is nice and foamy. Wish is was a wee bit less expensive but it works great for us.</li>
    <li> Told my eyer doctor how much better this was than his recommendation of baby shampoo which never really got the crust off the lids to my satisfaction. Said that it was OK to use the product, but limit it to once a day because it has a tendency to dry out the lids. Wish he told me about it years ago because it has really improved my vision.</li>
    <li> This bottle that creates a foamy cleanser for eyelids has been helpful with my chronic blepharitis.  It is much less expensive than another product I used for a while, and one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like or dislike this product.  I have Blephenitis in my eyelids, which is why I bought Ocusoft.  However, like so many products on the market, it hasn&#x27;t eleminated the problem.  Hopefully someone some day will find a solution to the problem.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep on searching.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on schedule, in good packaging, works great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lid scrub.  I put a little on a q tip and scrub my eyelids after I remove my makeup every night.  It really keeps your lash line free of bacteria and helps keep blepharitis in check:)</li>
    <li> It does irritate my eyes, but I missed the dead line to return it.</li>
    <li> Use with a light pressure.  Product is very gentle.  No scent.  No sting.  Soothes</li>
    <li> Use daily as eyelid scrub. On days I miss using it, I can tell, and usually scrub  eyes. Its the area where eye lid joins skin that collects dirt, and can get infected.</li>
    <li> MUCH less expensive than the pre&#x3D;medicated, individual pads suggested by the ophthalmologist. After using this product, I was congratulated on the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; eyelids at the follow up visit.</li>
    <li> This is a must for anyone suffering from blepharitis. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and swear by it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that we have used before. It is very expensive but it seems to be worth it.</li>
    <li> Approximately 8 years ago Blephritis developed in both eyes.  My opthalmologist sugested thisproduct.  It is true that you can open your eyes with the product on them.  My eyes feel so squeaky clean after washing and finsing with this product.  My eyes need to be scrubbed ~ 3 times daily.  The price is great.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to sooth irritated eyelids related to high-count pollen days and dryness. It is very soothing, non-greasy, non-alcoholic. It works and feels good.</li>
    <li> I originally had some of the Ocusoft Lid Pads from my eye doctor.  Those work really well.  This isn&#x27;t nearly as good.  Spend the extra money for the pads.  In the end I got more of them from my eye doctor.  He told me that everyone likes the pads better.</li>
    <li> The eye scrub is wonderful. Thank you for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This eyelid cleanser feels so wonderful to use and is so easy to use as well.  I am very pleased with it and would definitely recommend this one to others who are looking for this type of product.  Your eyelids feel so refreshed afterwards!</li>
    <li> Good product. I had tried the wipes, which I will still use for travel, but the foam in the bottle is more practical for everyday use at home. It does help with eyelid irritation.</li>
    <li> Despite searching, I could not find an ingredients list for this product before purchase. When it arrived, I saw that it contains sodium lauryl sulfate. Since I have a sensitivity to SLS, I was unable to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years, it the best for my eyes lid problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and relieves blepharitis! I use it nearly every day. It refreshes my eyes and stops the itching from &amp;#34;who know&#x27;s what?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> works great &#x3D; so much more economical than the wipes I get at stores</li>
    <li> I would rather use this foam over the Ocusoft towelettes, It&#x27;s easy to use, so comfortable to use...no burning. Recommend to anyone implementing a dry eye cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> The Ocusoft was the same product I got from my doctor,  but at a much better price.</li>
    <li> Good for removing oil and dirt from the rims of eye lids. I have dry eyes and this foam wash is a must regimen every morning.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for her eyes as she&#x27;s been suffering from some kind of eye lid stye (I forgot the scientific name for it).  This stuff was way less expensive than the stuff they sell at Walgreen&#x27;s.  The eyelid cleanser at Walgreens is a different brand and it&#x27;s quite expensive.  She hasn&#x27;t said anything bad about this stuff.  She seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I must be missing something:  This Ocusoft 7.25 oz. costs $17.89;  the Thera Tears foaming lid scrub 1.62 oz costs $l6.19.  This is a HUGE difference in price.  I found that the Ocusolft does not burn when I get it in my eyes, but the Thera Tears burns like the very devil if I get it in my eyes.  Does this mean it is working better?  I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ve pretty much given up the Thera Tears for the Ocusoft.  I didn&#x27;t really believe that lid scrub would help dry eyes; but you know what?  It does seem to help.  I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor prescribed this to clean my eyelids. I was pleased to find it at a much better price than his office charged. Now I have one for the shower and one for the sink. I use it twice a day, and a little goes a long way. The bottle should last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> received on time and quality product in less than a week and a at a cheaper price than I had paid before</li>
    <li> Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foaming Eyelid Cleanser is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It will not burn or sting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing (feels a little bit oily - in a good way) but it rinses clear and it softens deposits along one&#x27;s eyelid margins;&lt;br /&gt;But, absolutely no stinging .. I can use this on my toddler&#x27;s eyelids when she gets a little stye.</li>
    <li> My eye docs have been telling me for years to wash my eyelids w/ baby shampoo. I followed their directions but found the baby shampoo to be extremely irritating. I&#x27;m glad I found this eyelid cleanser - it&#x27;s very gentle and my eyes seem to be better with the regular cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find this brand (Ocusoft) in any stores (the stores only carry the individual wipes). This is great and a great price!</li>
    <li> it works well of cleaning your eyelids</li>
    <li> I first used it before going to bed last night. This morning it was several hours after I woke up that I realized my eyes continued to feel good even though I had not done my morning ritual of hot washcloth on closed eyelids (as sufferers of blepharitis are supposed to do). My blepharitis is mild. Please note the product says it is for mild and moderate eye problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When scrubbing, I keep my eyes shut lightly not tightly. This spreads out the eyelid margins and allows more follicles to be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do my eyebrows too! I like knowing they are cleansed and it softens the eyebrow skin too.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It certainly has helped a problem I have with tearing in my eye. Scrub with this morning and at bedtime and where prescription products were useless, this worked.</li>
    <li> If you decide to try this product, be careful which size you buy.  Some vendors have been selling the much smaller 50 ml size (&#x3D; 1.69 oz) for more than $11. The more expensive 7.25 oz bottle is a much better deal. Don&#x27;t be fooled!  I clean my eyelids **twice** each time (so four times per day total) and the large bottle lasts a long time (note: I found I do not need to use much for it to be effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience:  I have chronic dry eye syndrome and struggle with blepharitis.  Over the years I have used many eyelid scrubs as well as [[ASIN:B000W68NDI Thera Tears Sterilid EyeLid Cleanser, 1.62-Ounce]]. I found cheaper eyelid scrubs too rough for my skin and softer ones rather expensive. Sterilid seemed to do a good job of cleaning my eyelids but it would sting my eyes if I was not careful.  About a year ago, I decided to give Ocusoft Lid Scrub a try and found it was very gentle, did a good job cleaning my eyelids and economical. Since using it regularly (in the morning and evening), I have had no problems with irritated skin and no problems with blepharitis. I really appreciate this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if your experience would be as positive as mine but this solved a major problem for me.  I must mention that I also started using the [[ASIN:B004385RPS Thermalon Dry Eye Compress]] at the same time and think this has also contributed to keeping blepharitis at bay. However I doubt all the improvement can be attributed to using the Thermalon compress (twice per day) and in any event not suffering any longer from irritated skin next to the eyes is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product that I have used 1 or 2 times a week for several years.  I mainly use it to ward off eye infection issues.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this.  She really likes it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a year now, similar price as my optician and easier to order on line.</li>
    <li> Clean my eyelid very well. Not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> It works as promised.</li>
    <li> If you have dry eye this is a blessing!  It lasts forever, cleans the eyelid and eyelash area without feeling like you&#x27;re putting chlorine into your eyes.  It also has no fragrance that I can detect.  This product is also good if you get styes from infected lashes.  The other cleaners that I have used either smell like chlorine, feel like chlorine on the eyes and the pump starts getting stuck about 1/4 way through using the bottle which is incredibly frustrating as this sort of product is not cheap.  I highly recommend Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foam.</li>
    <li> This is a good general eyelid and face cleaner that cleans but is not harsh on the more sensitive skin on the face.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended for my eyelids. None better.</li>
    <li> This was easy to apply and rinse when done.  I was glad I read instructions first, though.  When I purchased, I don&#x27;t remember seeing that you had to remove contact lenses first, but the bottle instructions says you have to.  That&#x27;s the reason for no 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This was recommended for my eyes and it does help them.</li>
    <li> I had formerly been using baby shampoo for eyelid washing until I learned that it can remove the tear film from your eye and cause other issues because even though it is mild it is still not mild enough for eye usage. This product was recommended by my eye doctor and is very mild and I use it in combination with TheraTears.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove puffiness, but leaves your eyes tired as if using a light soap. Not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Order this for my mom, for itchy eyes and she loved it.</li>
    <li> My optometrist recommended ocusoft to relieve symptoms of allergies. The scrub foam is far more economical than the disposable paper towels commonly available in stores.</li>
    <li> This eyelid cleanser is an absolute must for making sure I don&#x27;t get a infection in my eyes.  I use it every morning and it works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Good price through Amazon.  This scrub works very well and it incredibly gentle.</li>
    <li> Great product...Great price...</li>
    <li> Gentle, easy to use, especially in shower.  Bought two, still using first one; seems to last.</li>
    <li> Economical way to use this product which is excellent for cleaning your eyelids</li>
    <li> My husband’s eye doctor recommended this for his irritated eyes. I started using it in the shower to remove my mascara and found it works better than my regular soap! No more double washing my eyes to get all the makeup off! Yeah!</li>
    <li> I hated paying so much for another brand of eye scrub at the local drug store.  This does the exact same job and the product lasts for many more applications.</li>
    <li> I love it! One of my holy grails, shipping and handling was great. Everything as expected. A definite item I would purchase again, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works..I bought it because I have very dry eyes and I&#x27;ve been told by dr that my ducts on my eyelids are clogged. This cleans the outside of your eyelids. I suppose it removes dirt/pollen/grit so it doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes.  So far I don&#x27;t see any difference but I&#x27;m not sure if I should.  In other words, I&#x27;m not sure why I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I switched from another product that I didn&#x27;t realize was too harsh and irritating my lids more than cleaning them.  This OcuSoft scrub is milder but completely effective.  I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product delivers as promised.  Cleanses my eyes quickly and thoroughly.  I could not asked for more, and it is a large bottle that will most likely last a year!</li>
    <li> Works wonders for dry eye problems with eye lids.</li>
