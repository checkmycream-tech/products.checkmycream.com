    <li> This body cream is thick and gloppy and, while the fragrance is delightful initially, it does not have much staying power.  Also, it did not really keep my skin noticeably soft throughout the day.  And I expected it to as the majority of other reviews were quite complementary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but I feel there&#x27;s better ones out there cost wise.  I&#x27;m a hair stylist so buy lots of hair and body products</li>
